For the integration of renewable energy sources, power grid operators need realistic information
about the effects of energy production and consumption to assess grid stability. Recently, research
in scenario planning benefits from utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) as generative
models for operational scenario planning. In these scenarios, operators examine temporal as well
as spatial influences of different energy sources on the grid. The analysis of how renewable energy
resources affect the grid enables the operators to evaluate the stability and to identify potential
weak points such as a limiting transformer. However, due to their novelty, there are limited studies
on how well GANs model the underlying power distribution. This analysis is essential because, e.g.,
especially extreme situations with low or high power generation are required to evaluate grid stability.
We conduct a comparative study of the Wasserstein distance, binary-cross-entropy loss, and a Gaussian
copula as the baseline applied on two wind and two solar datasets with limited data compared to previous
studies. Both GANs achieve good results considering the limited amount of data, but the Wasserstein
GAN is superior in modeling temporal and spatial relations, and the power distribution. Besides
evaluating the generated power distribution over all farms, it is essential to assess terrain specific
distributions for wind scenarios. These terrain specific power distributions affect the grid
by their differences in their generating power magnitude. Therefore, in a second study, we show
that even when simultaneously learning distributions from wind parks with terrain specific patterns,
GANs are capable of modeling these individualities also when faced with limited data.
