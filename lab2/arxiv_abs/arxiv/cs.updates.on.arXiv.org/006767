Improving predictive understanding of Earth system variability and change requires data-model
integration. Efficient data-model integration for complex models requires surrogate modeling
to reduce model evaluation time. However, building a surrogate of a large-scale Earth system model
(ESM) with many output variables is computationally intensive because it involves a large number
of expensive ESM simulations. In this effort, we propose an efficient surrogate method capable
of using a few ESM runs to build an accurate and fast-to-evaluate surrogate system of model outputs
over large spatial and temporal domains. We first use singular value decomposition to reduce the
output dimensions, and then use Bayesian optimization techniques to generate an accurate neural
network surrogate model based on limited ESM simulation samples. Our machine learning based surrogate
methods can build and evaluate a large surrogate system of many variables quickly. Thus, whenever
the quantities of interest change such as a different objective function, a new site, and a longer
simulation time, we can simply extract the information of interest from the surrogate system without
rebuilding new surrogates, which significantly saves computational efforts. We apply the proposed
method to a regional ecosystem model to approximate the relationship between 8 model parameters
and 42660 carbon flux outputs. Results indicate that using only 20 model simulations, we can build
an accurate surrogate system of the 42660 variables, where the consistency between the surrogate
prediction and actual model simulation is 0.93 and the mean squared error is 0.02. This highly-accurate
and fast-to-evaluate surrogate system will greatly enhance the computational efficiency in data-model
integration to improve predictions and advance our understanding of the Earth system.
