Massive MIMO has been the subject of intense interest in both academia and industry for the past few
years. 3GPP standardization for cellular systems have adopted the principles of massive MIMO and
categorized the use of large rectangular planar arrays at the base station as full-dimension MIMO
(FD-MIMO) to operate in both TDD and FDD. Operating a large antenna array base station requires the
system to overcome several implementation challenges caused by hardware impairments making practical
solutions non-ideal and expensive to deploy at scale. It is important to learn from existing challenges
and solutions in order to prepare for larger scale deployment for example with cell free massive
MIMO. Hence in this paper, we specifically study the phase and amplitude instability due to RF impairments
using measurements carried out in the lab and in the field in a commercial LTE network. We investigate
the effect of phase and magnitude errors on the performance of FD-MIMO systems. We discuss and characterize
various sources creating these errors including time varying phase drift from low cost local oscillator
(LO) and internal temperature variations affecting frequency response of RF chains. The minimum
requirements and tradeoffs of different LO architectures and calibration mechanisms for practical
cellular deployment are discussed. We then provide details of a novel coherent LO distribution
mechanism and related novel array calibration mechanism that can be applied to both TDD and FDD systems.
Measurement results are provided to validate the performance of these methods used in a 2D full-connected
hybrid beamforming array architecture called High Definition Active Antenna System (HDAAS).
These results showcase the efficacy of the proposed methods which can easily be extended to other
array architectures including sub-array hybrid beamforming and element-level digitization.
