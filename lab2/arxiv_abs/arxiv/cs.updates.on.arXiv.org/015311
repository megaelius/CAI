Graph convolution network (GCN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of node
prediction in the graph structure. However, with the gradual various of graph attack methods, there
are lack of research on the robustness of GCN. At this paper, we will design a robust GCN method for
node prediction tasks. Considering the graph structure contains two types of information: node
information and connection information, and attackers usually modify the connection information
to complete the interference with the prediction results of the node, we first proposed a method
to hide the connection information in the generator, named Anonymized GCN (AN-GCN). By hiding the
connection information in the graph structure in the generator through adversarial training,
the accurate node prediction can be completed only by the node number rather than its specific position
in the graph. Specifically, we first demonstrated the key to determine the embedding of a specific
node: the row corresponding to the node of the eigenmatrix of the Laplace matrix, by target it as the
output of the generator, we designed a method to hide the node number in the noise. Take the corresponding
noise as input, we will obtain the connection structure of the node instead of directly obtaining.
Then the encoder and decoder are spliced both in discriminator, so that after adversarial training,
the generator and discriminator can cooperate to complete the encoding and decoding of the graph,
then complete the node prediction. Finally, All node positions can generated by noise at the same
time, that is to say, the generator will hides all the connection information of the graph structure.
The evaluation shows that we only need to obtain the initial features and node numbers of the nodes
to complete the node prediction, and the accuracy did not decrease, but increased by 0.0293.
