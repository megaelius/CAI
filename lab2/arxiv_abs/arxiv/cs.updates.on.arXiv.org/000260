In this series of papers, we present a motion planning framework for planning comfortable and customizable
motion of nonholonomic mobile robots such as intelligent wheelchairs and autonomous cars. In this
first one we present the mathematical foundation of our framework. The motion of a mobile robot that
transports a human should be comfortable and customizable. We identify several properties that
a trajectory must have for comfort. We model motion discomfort as a weighted cost functional and
define comfortable motion planning as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem of computing
trajectories that minimize this discomfort given the appropriate boundary conditions and constraints.
The optimization problem is infinite-dimensional and we discretize it using conforming finite
elements. We also outline a method by which different users may customize the motion to achieve personal
comfort. There exists significant past work in kinodynamic motion planning, to the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first comprehensive formulation of kinodynamic motion planning for a nonholonomic
mobile robot as a nonlinear optimization problem that includes all of the following - a careful analysis
of boundary conditions, continuity requirements on trajectory, dynamic constraints, obstacle
avoidance constraints, and a robust numerical implementation. In this paper, we present the mathematical
foundation of the motion planning framework and formulate the full nonlinear constrained optimization
problem. We describe, in brief, the discretization method using finite elements and the process
of computing initial guesses for the optimization problem. Details of the above two are presented
in Part II of the series.
