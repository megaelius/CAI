It is well known that normality can be described as incompressibility via finite automata. Still
the statement and the proof of this result as given by Becher and Heiber (2013) in terms of "lossless
finite-state compressors" do not follow the standard scheme of Kolmogorov complexity definition
(an automaton is used for compression, not decompression). We modify this approach to make it more
similar to the traditional Kolmogorov complexity theory (and simpler) by explicitly defining
the notion of automatic Kolmogorov complexity and using its simple properties. Using this characterization
and a sufficient condition for normality in terms of Kolmogorov complexity derived from it, we provide
easy proofs for classical results about normal sequences (Champernown, Wall, Piatetski-Shapiro,
Besicovitch, Copeland, Erdos et al.) Then we extend this approach to finite state dimension. We
show that the block entropy definition of the finite state dimension remains the same if non-aligned
blocks are used. Then we provide equivalent definitions in terms of automatic complexity, superadditive
bounds for Kolmogorov complexity, calibrated superadditive functions and finite state a priori
probability and use them to give simple proofs for known results about finite state dimension, and
for Agafonov's result saying that normality is preserved by automatic selection rules as well as
the results of Schnorr and Stimm that relate normality to finite state martingales. Some results
of this paper were presented at the Fundamentals in Computing Theory conferences in 2017 and 2019.
Preliminary version of this paper (that does not mention the finite state dimension) was published
in arxiv in~2017 (see the previous version of this submission).
