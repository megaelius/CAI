Mobile device location data (MDLD) contains abundant travel behavior information to support travel
demand analysis. Compared to traditional travel surveys, MDLD has larger spatiotemporal coverage
of population and its mobility. However, ground truth information such as trip origins and destinations,
travel modes, and trip purposes are not included by default. Such important attributes must be imputed
to maximize the usefulness of the data. This paper tends to study the capability of MDLD on estimating
travel mode share at aggregated levels. A data-driven framework is proposed to extract travel behavior
information from the MDLD. The proposed framework first identifies trip ends with a modified Spatiotemporal
Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. Then three
types of features are extracted for each trip to impute travel modes using machine learning models.
A labeled MDLD dataset with ground truth information is used to train the proposed models, resulting
in 95% accuracy in identifying trip ends and 93% accuracy in imputing five travel modes (drive, rail,
bus, bike and walk) with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed framework is then applied
to two large-scale MDLD datasets, covering the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and the
United States, respectively. The estimated trip distance, trip time, trip rate distribution,
and travel mode share are compared against travel surveys at different geographies. The results
suggest that the proposed framework can be readily applied in different states and metropolitan
regions with low cost in order to study multimodal travel demand, understand mobility trends, and
support decision making.
