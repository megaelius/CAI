Analyzing probabilistic programs and randomized algorithms are classical problems in computer
science.The first basic problem in the analysis of stochastic processes is to consider the expectation
or mean, and another basic problem is to consider concentration bounds, i.e. showing that large
deviations from the mean have small probability. Similarly, in the context of probabilistic programs
and randomized algorithms, the analysis of expected termination time/running time and their concentration
bounds are fundamental problems. In this work, we focus on concentration bounds for probabilistic
programs and probabilistic recurrences of randomized algorithms. For probabilistic programs,
the basic technique to achieve concentration bounds is to consider martingales and apply the classical
Azuma's inequality. For probabilistic recurrences of randomized algorithms, Karp's classical
"cookbook" method, which is similar to the master theorem for recurrences, is the standard approach
to obtain concentration bounds. In this work, we propose a novel approach for deriving concentration
bounds for probabilistic programs and probabilistic recurrence relations through the synthesis
of exponential supermartingales. For probabilistic programs, we present algorithms for synthesis
of such supermartingales in several cases. We also show that our approach can derive better concentration
bounds than simply applying the classical Azuma's inequality over various probabilistic programs
considered in the literature. For probabilistic recurrences, our approach can derive tighter
bounds than the well-established methods of and for classical algorithms such as quick sort, quick
select, and randomized diameter computation. We also present a prototype implementation that
can automatically infer these bounds.
