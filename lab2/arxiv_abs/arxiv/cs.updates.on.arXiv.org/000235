Spreading processes represent a very efficient tool to investigate the structural properties
of networks and the relative importance of their constituents, and have been widely used to this
aim in static networks. Here we consider simple disease spreading processes on empirical time-varying
networks of contacts between individuals, and compare the effect of several immunization strategies
on these processes. An immunization strategy is defined as the choice of a set of nodes (individuals)
who cannot catch nor transmit the disease. This choice is performed according to a certain ranking
of the nodes of the contact network. We consider various ranking strategies, focusing in particular
on the role of the training window during which the nodes' properties are measured in the time-varying
network: longer training windows correspond to a larger amount of information collected and could
be expected to result in better performances of the immunization strategies. We find instead an
unexpected saturation in the efficiency of strategies based on nodes' characteristics when the
length of the training window is increased, showing that a limited amount of information on the contact
patterns is sufficient to design efficient immunization strategies. This finding is balanced
by the large variations of the contact patterns, which strongly alter the importance of nodes from
one period to the next and therefore significantly limit the efficiency of any strategy based on
an importance ranking of nodes. We also observe that the efficiency of strategies that include an
element of randomness and are based on temporally local information do not perform as well but are
largely independent on the amount of information available.
