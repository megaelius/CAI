Scientific investigation procedures have been evolving to follow an ever-changing cultural landscape,
the sophistication of the technology available and an ever-growing knowledge base. This continuous
evolution brought investigation practices through distinct historical phases, mostly marked
by different types of participants and organization, from individual natural philosophers to
science driven by large institutions. There is clear evidence that we are now getting to an age of
drastic disruptive change. Increased complexity and mandatory multidisciplinary thinking have
moved research from an initial phase of disjoint polymaths into a current phase of widespread uncontrolled
use of computational tools and data generation, the "informatics crisis". The use of advanced computational
technology for communication and generation of data in large scale without proper controls is compromising
our ability to conduct an adequate reproducible investigation, causing a dangerous drift from
the scientific method. To counteract this deviation, we advocate the use of a next-generation investigative
approach leveraging forces of human diversity, micro-specialized crowds and proper computer-assisted
control methods associated with a "pipeline of proof". This paper outlines the impact of advanced
computational technology, not only as an accelerator of the rate in which humanity acquires objective
knowledge but also as a dangerous side effect as a generator of massive amounts of uncontrolled,
unverified and untraceable data and results that cannot be reproduced. We propose an alternative
for methods of investigation based on collaboration in large-scale through standard procedures
of proof and crowds in building a "collective brain in which neurons are human collaborators".
