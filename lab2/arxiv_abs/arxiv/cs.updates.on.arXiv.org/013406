We study the maximal independent set (MIS) and maximum independent set (MAX-IS) problems on dynamic
sets of $O(n)$ axis-parallel rectangles, which can be modeled as dynamic rectangle intersection
graphs. We consider the fully dynamic vertex update (insertion/deletion) model for two types of
rectangles: (i) uniform height and width and (ii) uniform height and arbitrary width. These types
of dynamic vertex update problems arise, e.g., in interactive map labeling. We present the first
deterministic algorithm for maintaining a MIS (and thus a 4-approximate MAX-IS) of a dynamic set
of uniform rectangles with amortized sub-logarithmic update time. This breaks the natural barrier
of $O(\Delta)$ update time (where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph) for vertex updates
presented by Assadi et al. (STOC 2018). We continue by investigating MAX-IS and provide a series
of deterministic dynamic approximation schemes. For uniform rectangles, we first give an algorithm
that maintains a $4$-approximate MAX-IS with $O(1)$ update time. In a subsequent algorithm, we
establish the trade-off between approximation quality $2(1+\frac{1}{k})$ and update time $O(k^2\log
n)$ for $k\in \mathbb{N}$. We conclude with an algorithm that maintains a $2$-approximate MAX-IS
for dynamic sets of uniform height and arbitrary width rectangles with $O(\omega \log n)$ update
time, where $\omega$ is the largest number of maximal cliques stabbed by any axis-parallel line.
We have implemented our algorithms and report the results of an experimental comparison exploring
the trade-off between solution size and update time for synthetic and real-world map labeling data
sets.
