Facial Expressions Recognition(FER) on low-resolution images is necessary for applications
like group expression recognition in crowd scenarios(station, classroom etc.). Classifying
a small size facial image into the right expression category is still a challenging task. The main
cause of this problem is the loss of discriminative feature due to reduced resolution. Super-resolution
method is often used to enhance low-resolution images, but the performance on FER task is limited
when on images of very low resolution. In this work, inspired by feature super-resolution methods
for object detection, we proposed a novel generative adversary network-based feature level super-resolution
method for robust facial expression recognition(FSR-FER). In particular, a pre-trained FER model
was employed as feature extractor, and a generator network G and a discriminator network D are trained
with features extracted from images of low resolution and original high resolution. Generator
network G tries to transform features of low-resolution images to more discriminative ones by making
them closer to the ones of corresponding high-resolution images. For better classification performance,
we also proposed an effective classification-aware loss re-weighting strategy based on the classification
probability calculated by a fixed FER model to make our model focus more on samples that are easily
misclassified. Experiment results on Real-World Affective Faces (RAF) Database demonstrate
that our method achieves satisfying results on various down-sample factors with a single model
and has better performance on low-resolution images compared with methods using image super-resolution
and expression recognition separately.
