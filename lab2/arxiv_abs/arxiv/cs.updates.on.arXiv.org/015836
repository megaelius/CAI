In this work we present a robust interface coupling algorithm called Compact Interface quasi-Newton
(CIQN). It is designed for computationally intensive applications using an MPI multi-code partitioned
scheme. The algorithm allows to reuse information from previous time steps, feature that has been
previously proposed to accelerate convergence. Through algebraic manipulation, an efficient
usage of the computational resources is achieved by: avoiding construction of dense matrices and
reduce every multiplication to a matrix-vector product and reusing the computationally expensive
loops. This leads to a compact version of the original quasi-Newton algorithm. Altogether with
an efficient communication, in this paper we show an efficient scalability up to 4800 cores. Three
examples with qualitatively different dynamics are shown to prove that the algorithm can efficiently
deal with added mass instability and two-field coupled problems. We also show how reusing histories
and filtering does not necessarily makes a more robust scheme and, finally, we prove the necessity
of this HPC version of the algorithm. The novelty of this article lies in the HPC focused implementation
of the algorithm, detailing how to fuse and combine the composing blocks to obtain an scalable MPI
implementation. Such an implementation is mandatory in large scale cases, for which the contact
surface cannot be stored in a single computational node, or the number of contact nodes is not negligible
compared with the size of the domain. \c{opyright} <2020> Elsevier. This manuscript version is
