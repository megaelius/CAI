Most recent studies on establishing intersection safety focus on the situation where all vehicles
are fully autonomous. However, currently most vehicles are human-driven and so we will need to transition
through regimes featuring a varying proportion of human-driven vehicles ranging from 100\% to
0\% before realizing such a fully autonomous future -- if ever. We will, therefore, need to address
the safety of hybrid systems featuring an arbitrary mixture of human-driven and autonomous vehicles.
In fact, recent incidents involving autonomous vehicles have already highlighted the need to study
the safety of autonomous vehicles co-existing with human-driven vehicles. Motivated by this we
address the design of provably safe intersection management for mixed traffic consisting of a mix
of human-driven vehicles (HVs) as well as autonomous vehicles (AVs). To analyze such mixed traffic,
we model HVs as nearsighted and with relatively loose constraints, permitting worst-case behavior
while AVs are considered as capable of following much tighter constraints. HVs are allowed freedom
to change their speed at any time while AVs are only allowed to change their speed beginning of a time
slot through a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). AVs are assumed to possess a shorter response
time and stronger braking capability than HVs in collision avoidance. Moreover, AVs obtain the
permissions of passing through the intersection through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication,
while HVs achieve the same objective by following traffic lights. Taking the above differences
into consideration, we propose a provably safe intersection management for mixed traffic comprised
of an MPC-based protocol for AVs along with a coordination protocol for traffic lights...
