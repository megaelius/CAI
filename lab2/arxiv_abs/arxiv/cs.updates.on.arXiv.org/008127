Lucid dreaming (LD) is a phenomenon during which the person is aware that he/she dreaming and is able
to control the dream content. Studies have shown that only 20% of people can experience lucid dreams
on a regular basis. However, LD frequency can be increased through induction techniques. External
stimulation technique relies on the ability to integrate external information into the dream content.
The aim is to remind the sleeper that she/he is dreaming. If this type of protocol is not fully efficient,
it demonstrates how sensorial stimuli can be easily incorporated into people's dreams. The objective
of our project was to replicate this induction technique using material less expensive and more
portable. This material could simplify experimental procedures. Participants could bring the
material home, then have a more ecological setting. First, we used the OpenBCI Cyton, a low-cost
EEG signal acquisition board in order to record and manually live-score sleep. Then, we designed
a mask containing two LEDs, connected to a microcontroller to flash visual stimulation during sleep.
We asked two volunteers to sleep for 2 hours in a dedicated room. One of the participants declared
having a dream during which the blue lights diffused by the mask were embedded into the dream environment.
The other participant woke up during the visual stimulation. These results are congruent with previous
studies. This work marked the first step of a larger project. Our ongoing research includes the use
of an online sleep stage scoring tool and the possibility to automatically send stimuli according
to the sleep stage. We will also investigate other types of stimulus induction in the future such
as vibro-tactile stimulation that showed great potentials.
