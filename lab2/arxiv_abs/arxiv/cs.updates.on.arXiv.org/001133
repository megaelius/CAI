We present many new results related to reliable (interactive) communication over insertion-deletion
channels. Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, strictly generalize the
usual symbol corruption errors and are much harder to protect against. We show how to hide the complications
of synchronization errors in many applications by introducing very general channel simulations
which efficiently transform an insertion-deletion channel into a regular symbol corruption channel
with an error rate larger by a constant factor and a slightly smaller alphabet. We generalize synchronization
string based methods which were recently introduced as a tool to design essentially optimal error
correcting codes for insertion-deletion channels. Our channel simulations depend on the fact
that, at the cost of increasing the error rate by a constant factor, synchronization strings can
be decoded in a streaming manner that preserves linearity of time. We also provide a lower bound showing
that this constant factor cannot be improved to $1+\epsilon$, in contrast to what is achievable
for error correcting codes. Our channel simulations drastically generalize the applicability
of synchronization strings. We provide new interactive coding schemes which simulate any interactive
two-party protocol over an insertion-deletion channel. Our results improve over the interactive
coding scheme of Braverman et al. which achieves a small constant rate and requires exponential
time computations. We provide the first computationally efficient interactive coding schemes
for synchronization errors, the first coding scheme with a rate approaching one for small noise
rates, and also improve over the maximal tolerable error rate. We also show tight connections between
synchronization strings and edit-distance tree codes which allow us to transfer results from tree
codes directly to edit-distance tree codes.
