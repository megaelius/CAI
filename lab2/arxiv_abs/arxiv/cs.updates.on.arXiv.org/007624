We introduce in the paper a novel observability problem for a continuum ensemble of nonholonomic
control systems with unknown population density. We address the problem by focussing on a prototype
of such ensemble system, namely, the ensemble of Bloch equations. The dynamics of the equations
are structurally identical, but show variations in Larmor dispersion and radio frequency (rf)
inhomogeneity. We assume that the initial state of every individual system is unknown and, moreover,
the population density of these individual systems is also unknown. Furthermore, we assume that
at any time, there is only one scalar measurement output at our disposal. The measurement output
integrates a certain observation function, common to all individual systems, over the continuum
ensemble. The observability problem we pose in the paper is thus the following: Whether one is able
to use the common control input (i.e., the rf field) and the single measurement output to estimate
the initial states of the individual systems and, moreover, to identify the population density?
Amongst other things, we establish a sufficient condition for the ensemble system to be observable:
We show that if the common observation function is any harmonic homogeneous polynomial of positive
degree, then the ensemble system is observable. The main focus of the paper is to demonstrate how
to leverage tools from representation theory of Lie algebras to address the observability problem.
Although the results we establish in the paper are for the specific ensemble of Bloch equations,
the approach we develop along the analysis can be generalized to investigate observability of other
general ensembles of nonholonomic control systems with a single, integrated measurement output.
