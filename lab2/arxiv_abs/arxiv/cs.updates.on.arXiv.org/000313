The paper is a part of an ongoing program which aims to show that the existential theory in free groups
(hyperbolic groups or even toral relatively hyperbolic) is NP-complete. For that we study compression
of solutions with straight-line programs (SLPs) as suggested originally by Plandowski and Rytter
in the context of a single word equation. We review some basic results on SLPs and give full proofs
in order to keep this fundamental part of the program self-contained. Next we study systems of equations
with constraints in free groups and more generally in free products of abelian groups. We show how
to compress minimal solutions with extended Parikh-constraints. This type of constraints allows
to express semi linear conditions as e.g. alphabetic information. The result relies on some combinatorial
analysis and has not been shown elsewhere. We show similar compression results for Boolean formula
of equations over a torsion-free $\delta$-hyperbolic group. The situation is much more delicate
than in free groups. As byproduct we improve the estimation of the "capacity" constant used by Rips
and Sela in their paper "Canonical representatives and equations in hyperbolic groups" from a double-exponential
bound in $\delta$ to some single-exponential bound. The final section shows compression results
for toral relatively hyperbolic group using the work of Dahmani: We show that given a system of equations
over a fixed toral relatively hyperbolic group, for every solution of length $N$ there is an SLP for
another solution such that the size of the SLP is bounded by some polynomial $p(s+ \log N)$ where $s$
is the size of the system.
