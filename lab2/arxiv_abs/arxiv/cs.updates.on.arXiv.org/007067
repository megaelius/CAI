This article considers the design and analysis of multiple moving target defenses for recognizing
and isolating attacks on cyber-physical systems. We consider attackers who perform integrity
attacks on a set of sensors and actuators in a control system. In such cases, a model aware adversary
can carefully design attack vectors to bypass bad data detection and identification filters while
causing damage to the control system. To counter such an attacker, we propose the moving target defense
which introduces stochastic, time-varying parameters in the control system. The underlying random
dynamics of the system limits an attacker's model knowledge and inhibits his/her ability to construct
stealthy attack sequences. Moreover, the time-varying nature of the dynamics thwarts adaptive
adversaries. We explore three main designs. First, we consider a hybrid system where parameters
within the existing plant are switched among multiple modes. We demonstrate how such an approach
can enable both the detection and identification of malicious nodes. Next, we investigate the addition
of an extended system with dynamics that are coupled to the original plant but do not affect system
performance. An attack on the original system will affect the authenticating subsystem and in turn
be revealed by a set of sensors measuring the extended plant. Lastly, we propose the use of sensor
nonlinearities to enhance the effectiveness of the moving target defense. The nonlinear dynamics
act to conceal normal operational behavior from an attacker who has tampered with the system state,
further hindering an attacker's ability to glean information about the time-varying dynamics.
In all cases mechanisms for analysis and design are proposed. Finally, we analyze attack detectability
for each moving target defense by investigating expected lower bounds on the detection statistic.
Our contributions are tested via simulation.
