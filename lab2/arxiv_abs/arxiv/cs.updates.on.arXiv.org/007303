Environmental air quality affects people's life, obtaining real-time and accurate environmental
air quality has a profound guiding significance for the development of social activities. At present,
environmental air quality measurement mainly adopts the method that setting air quality detector
at specific monitoring points in cities and timing sampling analysis, which is easy to be restricted
by time and space factors. Some air quality measurement algorithms related to deep learning mostly
adopt a single convolutional neural network to train the whole image, which will ignore the difference
of different parts of the image. In this paper, we propose a method for air quality measurement based
on double-channel convolutional neural network ensemble learning to solve the problem of feature
extraction for different parts of environmental images. Our method mainly includes two aspects:
ensemble learning of double-channel convolutional neural network and self-learning weighted
feature fusion. We constructed a double-channel convolutional neural network, used each channel
to train different parts of the environment images for feature extraction. We propose a feature
weight self-learning method, which weights and concatenates the extracted feature vectors, and
uses the fused feature vectors to measure air quality. Our method can be applied to the two tasks of
air quality grade measurement and air quality index (AQI) measurement. Moreover, we build an environmental
image dataset of random time and location condition. The experiments show that our method can achieve
nearly 82% accuracy and a small mean absolute error (MAE) on our test dataset. At the same time, through
comparative experiment, we proved that our proposed method gained considerable improvement in
performance compared with single channel convolutional neural network air quality measurements.
