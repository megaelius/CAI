We present a method to detect anomalies in a time series of flow interaction patterns. There are many
existing methods for anomaly detection in network traffic, such as number of packets. However,
there is non established method detecting anomalies in a time series of flow interaction patterns
that can be represented as complex network. Firstly, based on proposed multivariate flow similarity
method on temporal locality, a complex network model (MFS-TL) is constructed to describe the interactive
behaviors of traffic flows. Having analyzed the relationships between MFS-TL characteristics,
temporal locality window and multivariate flow similarity critical threshold, an approach for
parameter determination is established. Having observed the evolution of MFS-TL characteristics,
three non-deterministic correlations are defined for network states (i.e. normal or abnormal).
Furthermore, intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is introduced to quantify three non-deterministic
correlations, and then a anomaly detection method is put forward for single characteristic sequence.
To build an objective IFS, we design a Gaussian distribution-based membership function with a variable
hesitation degree. To determine the mapping of IFS's clustering intervals to network states, a
distinction index is developed. Then, an IFS ensemble method (IFSE-AD) is proposed to eliminate
the impacts of the inconsistent about MFS-TL characteristic to network state and improve detection
performance. Finally, we carried out extensive experiments on several network traffic datasets
for anomaly detection, and the results demonstrate the superiority of IFSE-AD to state-of-the-art
approaches, validating the effectiveness of our method.
