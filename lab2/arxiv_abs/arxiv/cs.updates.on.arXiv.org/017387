Issues regarding air quality and related health concerns have prompted this study, which develops
an accurate and computationally fast, efficient hybrid modeling system that combines numerical
modeling and machine learning for forecasting concentrations of surface ozone. Currently available
numerical modeling systems for air quality predictions (e.g., CMAQ, NCEP EMP) can forecast 24 to
48 hours in advance. In this study, we develop a modeling system based on a convolutional neural network
(CNN) model that is not only fast but covers a temporal period of two weeks with a resolution as small
as a single hour for 255 stations. The CNN model uses forecasted meteorology from the Weather Research
and Forecasting model (processed by the Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor), forecasted
air quality from the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ), and previous 24-hour concentrations
of various measurable air quality parameters as inputs and predicts the following 14-day hourly
surface ozone concentrations. The model achieves an average accuracy of 0.91 in terms of the index
of agreement for the first day and 0.78 for the fourteenth day while the average index of agreement
for one day ahead prediction from the CMAQ is 0.77. Through this study, we intend to amalgamate the
best features of numerical modeling (i.e., fine spatial resolution) and a deep neural network (i.e.,
computation speed and accuracy) to achieve more accurate spatio-temporal predictions of hourly
ozone concentrations. Although the primary purpose of this study is the prediction of hourly ozone
concentrations, the system can be extended to various other pollutants.
