Among the machine learning applications to business, recommender systems would take one of the
top places when it comes to success and adoption. They help the user in accelerating the process of
search while helping businesses maximize sales. Post phenomenal success in computer vision and
speech recognition, deep learning methods are beginning to get applied to recommender systems.
Current survey papers on deep learning in recommender systems provide a historical overview and
taxonomy of recommender systems based on type. Our paper addresses the gaps of providing a taxonomy
of deep learning approaches to address recommender systems problems in the areas of cold start and
candidate generation in recommender systems. We outline different challenges in recommender
systems into those related to the recommendations themselves (include relevance, speed, accuracy
and scalability), those related to the nature of the data (cold start problem, imbalance and sparsity)
and candidate generation. We then provide a taxonomy of deep learning techniques to address these
challenges. Deep learning techniques are mapped to the different challenges in recommender systems
providing an overview of how deep learning techniques can be used to address them. We contribute
a taxonomy of deep learning techniques to address the cold start and candidate generation problems
in recommender systems. Cold Start is addressed through additional features (for audio, images,
text) and by learning hidden user and item representations. Candidate generation has been addressed
by separate networks, RNNs, autoencoders and hybrid methods. We also summarize the advantages
and limitations of these techniques while outlining areas for future research.
