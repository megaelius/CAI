Angle closure glaucoma (ACG) is a more aggressive disease than open-angle glaucoma, where the abnormal
anatomical structures of the anterior chamber angle (ACA) may cause an elevated intraocular pressure
and gradually leads to glaucomatous optic neuropathy and eventually to visual impairment and blindness.
Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) imaging provides a fast and contactless
way to discriminate angle closure from open angle. Although many medical image analysis algorithms
have been developed for glaucoma diagnosis, only a few studies have focused on AS-OCT imaging. In
particular, there is no public AS-OCT dataset available for evaluating the existing methods in
a uniform way, which limits the progress in the development of automated techniques for angle closure
detection and assessment. To address this, we organized the Angle closure Glaucoma Evaluation
challenge (AGE), held in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. The AGE challenge consisted of two tasks:
scleral spur localization and angle closure classification. For this challenge, we released a
large data of 4800 annotated AS-OCT images from 199 patients, and also proposed an evaluation framework
to benchmark and compare different models. During the AGE challenge, over 200 teams registered
online, and more than 1100 results were submitted for online evaluation. Finally, eight teams participated
in the onsite challenge. In this paper, we summarize these eight onsite challenge methods and analyze
their corresponding results in the two tasks. We further discuss limitations and future directions.
In the AGE challenge, the top-performing approach had an average Euclidean Distance of 10 pixel
in scleral spur localization, while in the task of angle closure classification, all the algorithms
achieved the satisfactory performances, especially, 100% accuracy rate for top-two performances.
