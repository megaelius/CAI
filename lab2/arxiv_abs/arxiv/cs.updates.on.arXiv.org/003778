Uncovering modular structure in networks is fundamental for advancing the understanding of complex
systems in biology, physics, engineering, and technology. Community detection provides a way
to computationally identify candidate modules as hypotheses, which then need to be experimentally
validated. However, validation of detected communities requires expensive and time consuming
experimental methods, such as mutagenesis in a wet biological laboratory. As a consequence only
a limited number of communities can be experimentally validated, and it is thus important to determine
which communities to select for downstream validation and experimentation. Here we develop CRank,
an automatic method for prioritizing network communities and identifying the most promising ones
for further experimentation. CRank efficiently evaluates robustness and magnitude of structural
features of each community and then combines these features to obtain the community prioritization.
CRank can be used with any community detection method and scales to large networks. It needs only
information provided by the network structure and does not require any additional metadata or labels.
However, when available, CRank can incorporate domain-specific information to further boost
performance. Experiments on many diverse and important biological networks demonstrate that
the proposed approach effectively prioritizes communities, yielding a nearly 50-fold improvement
in community prioritization over a baseline ordering of detected communities. Taken together,
CRank represents a network-based approach to identify high-quality communities, even for domains
at the frontier of science where supervised meta information is not available.
