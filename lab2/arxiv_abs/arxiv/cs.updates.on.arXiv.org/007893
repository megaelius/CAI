In the 1970's, Lov\'asz built a bridge between graphs and alternating matrix spaces, in the context
of perfect matchings (FCT 1979). A similar connection between bipartite graphs and matrix spaces
plays a key role in the recent resolutions of the non-commutative rank problem (Garg-Gurvits-Oliveira-Wigderson,
FOCS 2016; Ivanyos-Qiao-Subrahmanyam, ITCS 2017). In this paper, we lay the foundation for another
bridge between graphs and alternating matrix spaces, in the context of independent sets and vertex
colorings. The corresponding structures in alternating matrix spaces are isotropic spaces and
isotropic decompositions, both useful structures in group theory and manifold theory. We first
show that the maximum independent set problem and the vertex c-coloring problem reduce to the maximum
isotropic space problem and the isotropic c-decomposition problem, respectively. Next, we show
that several topics and results about independent sets and vertex colorings have natural correspondences
for isotropic spaces and decompositions. These include algorithmic problems, such as the maximum
independent set problem for bipartite graphs, and exact exponential-time algorithms for the chromatic
number, as well as mathematical questions, such as the number of maximal independent sets, and the
relation between the maximum degree and the chromatic number. These connections lead to new interactions
between graph theory and algebra. Some results have concrete applications to group theory and manifold
theory, and we initiate a variant of these structures in the context of quantum information theory.
Finally, we propose several open questions for further exploration. This paper is dedicated to
the memory of Ker-I Ko.
