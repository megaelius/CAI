Wave energy technologies have the potential to play a significant role in the supply of renewable
energy on a world scale. One of the most promising designs for wave energy converters (WECs) are fully
submerged buoys. In this work, we explore the optimisation of WEC arrays consisting of a three-tether
buoy model called CETO. Such arrays can be optimised for total energy output by adjusting both the
relative positions of buoys in farms and also the power-take-off (PTO) parameters for each buoy.
The search space for these parameters is complex and multi-modal. Moreover, the evaluation of each
parameter setting is computationally expensive -- limiting the number of full model evaluations
that can be made. To handle this problem, we propose a new hybrid cooperative co-evolution algorithm
(HCCA). HCCA consists of a symmetric local search plus Nelder-Mead and a cooperative co-evolution
algorithm (CC) with a backtracking strategy for optimising the positions and PTO settings of WECs,
respectively. Moreover, a new adaptive scenario is proposed for tuning grey wolf optimiser (AGWO)
hyper-parameter. AGWO participates notably with other applied optimisers in HCCA. For assessing
the effectiveness of the proposed approach five popular Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), four alternating
optimisation methods and two modern hybrid ideas (LS-NM and SLS-NM-B) are carefully compared in
four real wave situations (Adelaide, Tasmania, Sydney and Perth) with two wave farm sizes (4 and
16). According to the experimental outcomes, the hybrid cooperative framework exhibits better
performance in terms of both runtime and quality of obtained solutions.
