Many Artificial Intelligence systems depend on the agent's updating its beliefs about the world
on the basis of experience. Experiments constitute one type of experience, so scientific methodology
offers a natural environment for examining the issues attendant to using this class of evidence.
This paper presents a framework which structures the process of using scientific data from research
reports for the purpose of making decisions, using decision analysis as the basis for the structure
and using medical research as the general scientific domain. The structure extends the basic influence
diagram for updating belief in an object domain parameter of interest by expanding the parameter
into four parts: those of the patient, the population, the study sample, and the effective study
sample. The structure uses biases to perform the transformation of one parameter into another,
so that, for instance, selection biases, in concert with the population parameter, yield the study
sample parameter. The influence diagram structure provides decision theoretic justification
for practices of good clinical research such as randomized assignment and blindfolding of care
providers. The model covers most research designs used in medicine: case-control studies, cohort
studies, and controlled clinical trials, and provides an architecture to separate clearly between
statistical knowledge and domain knowledge. The proposed general model can be the basis for clinical
epidemiological advisory systems, when coupled with heuristic pruning of irrelevant biases;
of statistical workstations, when the computational machinery for calculation of posterior distributions
is added; and of meta-analytic reviews, when multiple studies may impact on a single population
parameter.
