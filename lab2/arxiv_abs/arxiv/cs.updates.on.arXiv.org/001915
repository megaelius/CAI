The structure of complex networks has been of interest in many scientific and engineering disciplines
over the decades. A number of studies in the field have been focused on finding the common properties
among different kinds of networks such as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and
modular structure and they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complex
networks. However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure across a diverse set of
domains in order to explain the structural diversity we observe in the real-world networks. In this
paper, we study 986 real-world networks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to
online social networks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models. Our
study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random forest and confusion matrix
in order to show the relationships among network domains in terms of network structure. Our results
indicate that there are some partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish
based purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of network categories tend
to have similar underlying functions, constraints and/or generative mechanisms of networks even
though networks in the same partition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results
of engineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network, whether it's biological,
technological or social, may not necessarily be a decisive factor of the formation of similar network
structure. Our findings shed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hidden
principles for the structural diversity of complex networks.
