Adversarial attacks of deep neural networks have been intensively studied on image, audio, natural
language, patch, and pixel classification tasks. Nevertheless, as a typical, while important
real-world application, the adversarial attacks of online video object tracking that traces an
object's moving trajectory instead of its category are rarely explored. In this paper, we identify
a new task for the adversarial attack to visual tracking: online generating imperceptible perturbations
that mislead trackers along an incorrect (Untargeted Attack, UA) or specified trajectory (Targeted
Attack, TA). To this end, we first propose a \textit{spatial-aware} basic attack by adapting existing
attack methods, i.e., FGSM, BIM, and C&W, and comprehensively analyze the attacking performance.
We identify that online object tracking poses two new challenges: 1) it is difficult to generate
imperceptible perturbations that can transfer across frames, and 2) real-time trackers require
the attack to satisfy a certain level of efficiency. To address these challenges, we further propose
the spatial-aware online incremental attack (a.k.a. SPARK) that performs spatial-temporal sparse
incremental perturbations online and makes the adversarial attack less perceptible. In addition,
as an optimization-based method, SPARK quickly converges to very small losses within several iterations
by considering historical incremental perturbations, making it much more efficient than basic
attacks. The in-depth evaluation on state-of-the-art trackers (i.e., SiamRPN++ with AlexNet,
MobileNetv2, and ResNet-50, and SiamDW) on OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT demonstrates the
effectiveness and transferability of SPARK in misleading the trackers under both UA and TA with
minor perturbations.
