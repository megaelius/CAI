Several Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications provide location-based services, wherein it
is critical to obtain accurate position estimates by aggregating information from individual
sensors. In the recently proposed narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) standard, which trades off bandwidth
to gain wide coverage, the location estimation is compounded by the low sampling rate receivers
and limited-capacity links. We address both of these NB-IoT drawbacks in the framework of passive
sensing devices that receive signals from the target-of-interest. We consider the limiting case
where each node receiver employs one-bit analog-to-digital-converters and propose a novel low-complexity
nodal delay estimation method using constrained-weighted least squares minimization. To support
the low-capacity links to the fusion center (FC), the range estimates obtained at individual sensors
are then converted to one-bit data. At the FC, we propose target localization with the aggregated
one-bit range vector using both optimal and sub-optimal techniques. The computationally expensive
former approach is based on Lasserre's method for multivariate polynomial optimization while
the latter employs our less complex iterative joint range-target location estimation (ANTARES)
algorithm. Our overall one-bit framework not only complements the low NB-IoT bandwidth but also
supports the design goal of inexpensive NB-IoT location sensing. Numerical experiments demonstrate
feasibility of the proposed one-bit approach with a $0.6$% increase in the normalized localization
error for the small set of $20$-$60$ nodes over the full-precision case. When the number of nodes
is sufficiently large ($>80$), the one-bit methods yield the same performance as the full precision.
