In this paper, we study the server-side rate adaptation problem for streaming tile-based adaptive
360-degree videos to multiple users who are competing for transmission resources at the network
bottleneck. Specifically, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based viewpoint prediction
model to capture the nonlinear relationship between the future and historical viewpoints. A Laplace
distribution model is utilized to characterize the probability distribution of the prediction
error. Given the predicted viewpoint, we then map the viewport in the spherical space into its corresponding
planar projection in the 2-D plane, and further derive the visibility probability of each tile based
on the planar projection and the prediction error probability. According to the visibility probability,
tiles are classified as viewport, marginal and invisible tiles. The server-side tile rate allocation
problem for multiple users is then formulated as a non-linear discrete optimization problem to
minimize the overall received video distortion of all users and the quality difference between
the viewport and marginal tiles of each user, subject to the transmission capacity constraints
and users' specific viewport requirements. We develop a steepest descent algorithm to solve this
non-linear discrete optimization problem, by initializing the feasible starting point in accordance
with the optimal solution of its continuous relaxation. Extensive experimental results show that
the proposed algorithm can achieve a near-optimal solution, and outperforms the existing rate
adaptation schemes for tile-based adaptive 360-video streaming.
