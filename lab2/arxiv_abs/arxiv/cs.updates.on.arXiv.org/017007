This article presents a novel scheduling approach to minimise the energy consumption of a machine
during its idle periods. In the scheduling domain, it is common to model the behaviour of the machine
by defining a small set of machine modes, e.g. "on", "off" and "stand-by". Then the transitions between
the modes are represented by a static transition graph. In this paper, we argue that this type of model
might be too restrictive for some types of machines (e.g. the furnaces). For such machines, we propose
to employ the complete time-domain dynamics and integrate it into an idle energy function. This
way, the scheduling algorithm can exploit the full knowledge about the machine dynamics with minimised
energy consumption encapsulated in this function. In this paper, we study a scheduling problem,
where the tasks characterised by release times and deadlines are scheduled in the given order such
that the idle energy consumption of the machine is minimised. We show that this problem can be solved
in polynomial time whenever the idle energy function is concave. To highlight the practical applicability,
we analyse a heat-intensive system employing a steel-hardening furnace. We derive an energy optimal
control law, and the corresponding idle energy function, for the bilinear system model approximating
the dynamics of the furnace (and possibly other heat-intensive systems). Further, we prove that
the idle energy function is, indeed, concave in this case. Therefore, the proposed scheduling algorithm
can be used. Numerical experiments show that by using our approach, combining both the optimal control
and optimal scheduling, higher energy savings can be achieved, compared to the state-of-the-art
scheduling approaches.
