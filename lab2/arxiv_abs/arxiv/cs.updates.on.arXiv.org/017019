A confluence of advances in the computer and mathematical sciences has unleashed unprecedented
capabilities for enabling true evidence-based decision making. These capabilities are making
possible the large-scale capture of data and the transformation of that data into insights and recommendations
in support of decisions about challenging problems in science, society, and government. Key advances
include jumps in the availability of rich streams of data, precipitous drops in the cost of storing
and retrieving massive amounts of data, exponential increases in computing power and memory, and
jumps in the prowess of methods for performing machine learning and reasoning. These advances have
come together to create an inflection point in our ability to harness large amounts of data for generating
insights and guiding decision making. The shift of commerce, science, education, art, and entertainment
to the web makes available unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured databases
about human activities - much of it available to anyone who wishes to mine it for insights. In the sciences,
new evidential paradigms and sensing technologies are making available great quantities of data,
via use of fundamentally new kinds of low-cost sensors (e.g., genomic microarrays) or through viewers
that provide unprecedented scope and resolution. The data pose a huge opportunity for data-centric
analyses. To date, we have only scratched the surface of the potential for learning from these large-scale
data sets. Opportunities abound for tapping our new capabilities more broadly to provide insights
to decision makers and to enhance the quality of their actions and policies.
