Although the traditional physical password, fingerprint unlocking and facial features have improved
the security to a certain extent, they have the characteristics of passive authentication and easiness
to be stolen. The existing behavioral data collected based on mobile phone sensors is mainly used
for human activity recognition and fall detection and health management. Prophet is a procedure
for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with
yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that
have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing
data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. Based on the time series behavior
data of mobile terminal users, this paper uses Prophet algorithm to decompose the time series of
six kinds of daily behavior and strip off the singular value, to get the inherent cycle and trend of
each behavior, and to verify the legitimacy of the behavior user at the next moment. The experimental
results on the UniMiB SHAR public dataset show that the user only needs to do 2 cycles of specified
actions to realize the prediction of the next time series. The main contribution of this paper is
that we propose a new idea for smartphone user authentication. It is based on real-time data of smartphone
user behavior, through Phophet algorithm for feature decomposition and time series prediction,
and to find the inherent cycle and other characteristics, so as to perform user behavior recognition.
This data-driven auxiliary authentication method can effectively solve the problem of easy forgery
of static feature recognition such as password, fingerprint and face recognition.
