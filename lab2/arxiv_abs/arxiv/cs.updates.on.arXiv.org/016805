The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging disease responsible for infecting millions of people
since the first notification until nowadays. Developing efficient short-term forecasting models
allow knowing the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning
in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA), cubist (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression
(SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with
one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states
with a high daily incidence. In the stacking learning approach, the cubist, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models
are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models' effectiveness
is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage
error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking ensemble learning reach a better performance
regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate
accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87% - 3.51%, 1.02% - 5.63%, and 0.95% - 6.90%
in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models in all scenarios is SVR,
stacking ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is
recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models
can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.
