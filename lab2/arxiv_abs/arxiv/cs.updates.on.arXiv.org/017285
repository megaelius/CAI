Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) is a natural and general representation of data in recommender
systems. Combining HIN and recommender systems can not only help model user behaviors but also make
the recommendation results explainable by aligning the users/items with various types of entities
in the network. Over the past few years, path-based reasoning models have shown great capacity in
HIN-based recommendation. The basic idea of these models is to explore HIN with predefined path
schemes. Despite their effectiveness, these models are often confronted with the following limitations:
(1) Most prior path-based reasoning models only consider the influence of the predecessors on the
subsequent nodes when modeling the sequences, and ignore the reciprocity between the nodes in a
path; (2) The weights of nodes in the same path instance are usually assumed to be constant, whereas
varied weights of nodes can bring more flexibility and lead to expressive modeling; (3) User-item
interactions are noisy, but they are often indiscriminately exploited. To overcome the aforementioned
issues, in this paper, we propose a novel path-based reasoning approach for recommendation over
HIN. Concretely, we use a bidirectional LSTM to enable the two-way modeling of paths and capture
the reciprocity between nodes. Then an attention mechanism is employed to learn the dynamical influence
of nodes in different contexts. Finally, the adversarial regularization terms are imposed on the
loss function of the model to mitigate the effects of noise and enhance HIN-based recommendation.
Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines. The case study further demonstrates the feasibility of our model on the explainable
recommendation task.
