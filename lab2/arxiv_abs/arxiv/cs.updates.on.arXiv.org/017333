Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) evaluation of chest-pain patients in an Emergency
Department (ED) is considered appropriate. While a negative CCTA interpretation supports direct
patient discharge from an ED, labor-intensive analyses are required, with accuracy in jeopardy
from distractions. We describe the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm and
workflow for assisting interpreting physicians in CCTA screening for the absence of coronary atherosclerosis.
The two-phase approach consisted of (1) Phase 1 - focused on the development and preliminary testing
of an algorithm for vessel-centerline extraction classification in a balanced study population
(n = 500 with 50% disease prevalence) derived by retrospective random case selection; and (2) Phase
2 - concerned with simulated-clinical Trialing of the developed algorithm on a per-case basis in
a more real-world study population (n = 100 with 28% disease prevalence) from an ED chest-pain series.
This allowed pre-deployment evaluation of the AI-based CCTA screening application which provides
a vessel-by-vessel graphic display of algorithm inference results integrated into a clinically
capable viewer. Algorithm performance evaluation used Area Under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic
Curve (AUC-ROC); confusion matrices reflected ground-truth vs AI determinations. The vessel-based
algorithm demonstrated strong performance with AUC-ROC = 0.96. In both Phase 1 and Phase 2, independent
of disease prevalence differences, negative predictive values at the case level were very high
at 95%. The rate of completion of the algorithm workflow process (96% with inference results in 55-80
seconds) in Phase 2 depended on adequate image quality. There is potential for this AI application
to assist in CCTA interpretation to help extricate atherosclerosis from chest-pain presentations.
