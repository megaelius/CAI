The COVID-19 outbreak forced governments worldwide to impose lockdowns and quarantines over their
population to prevent virus transmission. As a consequence, there are disruptions in human and
economic activities all over the globe. The recovery process is also expected to be rough. Economic
activities impact social behaviors, which leave signatures in satellite images that can be automatically
detected and classified. Satellite imagery can support the decision-making of analysts and policymakers
by providing a different kind of visibility into the unfolding economic changes. Such information
can be useful both during the crisis and also as we recover from it. In this work, we use a deep learning
approach that combines strategic location sampling and an ensemble of lightweight convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to recognize specific elements in satellite images and compute economic
indicators based on it, automatically. This CNN ensemble framework ranked third place in the US
Department of Defense xView challenge, the most advanced benchmark for object detection in satellite
images. We show the potential of our framework for temporal analysis using the US IARPA Function
Map of the World (fMoW) dataset. We also show results on real examples of different sites before and
after the COVID-19 outbreak to demonstrate possibilities. Among the future work is the possibility
that with a satellite image dataset that samples a region at a weekly (or biweekly) frequency, we
can generate more informative temporal signatures that can predict future economic states. Our
