Sequence set is a widely-used type of data source in a large variety of fields. A typical example is
protein structure prediction, which takes an multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input and aims
to infer structural information from it. Almost all of the existing approaches exploit MSAs in an
indirect fashion, i.e., they transform MSAs into position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) that
represent the distribution of amino acid types at each column. PSSM could capture column-wise characteristics
of MSA, however, the column-wise characteristics embedded in each individual component sequence
were nearly totally neglected. The drawback of PSSM is rooted in the fact that an MSA is essentially
an unordered sequence set rather than a matrix. Specifically, the interchange of any two sequences
will not affect the whole MSA. In contrast, the pixels in an image essentially form a matrix since
any two rows of pixels cannot be interchanged. Therefore, the traditional deep neural networks
designed for image processing cannot be directly applied on sequence sets. Here, we proposed a novel
deep neural network framework (called Seq-SetNet) for sequence set processing. By employing a
{\it symmetric function} module to integrate features calculated from preceding layers, Seq-SetNet
are immune to the order of sequences in the input MSA. This advantage enables us to directly and fully
exploit MSAs by considering each component protein individually. We evaluated Seq-SetNet by using
it to extract structural information from MSA for protein secondary structure prediction. Experimental
results on popular benchmark sets suggests that Seq-SetNet outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches by 3.6% in precision. These results clearly suggest the advantages of Seq-SetNet in
sequence set processing and it can be readily used in a wide range of fields, say natural language
processing.
