Multi-objective recommender systems address the difficult task of recommending items that are
relevant to multiple, possibly conflicting, criteria. However these systems are most often designed
to address the objective of one single stakeholder, typically, in online commerce, the consumers
whose input and purchasing decisions ultimately determine the success of the recommendation systems.
In this work, we address the multi-objective, multi-stakeholder, recommendation problem involving
one or more objective(s) per stakeholder. In addition to the consumer stakeholder, we also consider
two other stakeholders; the suppliers who provide the goods and services for sale and the intermediary
who is responsible for helping connect consumers to suppliers via its recommendation algorithms.
We analyze the multi-objective, multi-stakeholder, problem from the point of view of the online
marketplace intermediary whose objective is to maximize its commission through its recommender
system. We define a multi-objective problem relating all our three stakeholders which we solve
with a novel learning-to-re-rank approach that makes use of a novel regularization function based
on the Kendall tau correlation metric and its kernel version; given an initial ranking of item recommendations
built for the consumer, we aim to re-rank it such that the new ranking is also optimized for the secondary
objectives while staying close to the initial ranking. We evaluate our approach on a real-world
dataset of hotel recommendations provided by Expedia where we show the effectiveness of our approach
against a business-rules oriented baseline model.
