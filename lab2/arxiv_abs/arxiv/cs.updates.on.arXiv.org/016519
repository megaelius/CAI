When selling information, sometimes the seller can increase the revenue by giving away some partial
information to change the buyers' belief about the information product, so the buyers may be more
willing to purchase. This work studies the general problem of advertising information products
by revealing some partial information. We consider buyers who need to make a decision, the outcome
of which depends on the state of the world that is unknown to the buyers. There is an information seller
who has access to the state of the world. The seller can advertise the information by revealing some
partial information. We assume that the seller chooses a long-term advertising strategy and then
commits to it. The buyers decide whether to purchase the full information product after seeing the
partial information. The seller's goal is to maximize the expected revenue. We study the problem
in two settings. 1. The seller targets the buyers of a certain type. In this case, we prove that finding
the optimal advertising strategy is equivalent to finding the concave closure of a function, which
is NP-hard in general. Based on this observation, we prove some properties of the optimal mechanism,
which allow us to solve for the optimal mechanism by a convex program (of exponential size in general,
polynomial size for special cases). We also prove some interesting characterizations of the optimal
mechanisms based on these properties. 2. For the general problem when the seller faces buyers of
different types and only knows the distribution of their types, it is NP-hard to find a constant factor
approximation. We thus look at special cases and provide an approximation algorithm that finds
an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal mechanism when it is not too hard to predict the possible type of buyers
who will make the purchase.
