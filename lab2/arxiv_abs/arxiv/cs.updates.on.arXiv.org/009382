The efficiency of numerous proposed flow-oriented networking mechanisms strongly depends on
traffic characteristics and should thus be assessed using accurate models. For example, in the
case of algorithms, which are based on the distinction between elephant and mice flows, it is extremely
important to ensure realistic flows' length (in packets) and size (in bytes) distributions. Credible
models or data are not available in literature. Numerous works contain only plots roughly presenting
empirical probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions of selected flow
parameters, however, none of these papers provide distribution mixture models or reusable data.
This paper presents a complete tutorial on constructing network flow models from traffic traces.
The proposed methodology is universal and can be applied to traffic traces gathered in any network.
Apart from the methodology, we also provide an open source software framework which make it possible
to analyse flow traces and fit general mixture models to them. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that provides such a universal methodology together with fully a usable software
framework. Additionally, we utilise the proposed methodology and software to extract accurate
models of flow length and size from real traffic traces. Traces were collected at the Internet-facing
interface of the university campus network and comprise four billion flow (275 TB of transmitted
data). Thus, this work also provides a realistic model of traffic, which can be used to assess a variety
of flow-oriented solutions under the assumption of realistic conditions.
