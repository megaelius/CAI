Network virtualization provides a promising solution to overcome the ossification of current
networks, allowing multiple Virtual Network Requests (VNRs) embedded on a common infrastructure.
The major challenge in network virtualization is the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem,
which is to embed VNRs onto a shared substrate network and known to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard. The topological
heterogeneity of VNRs is one important factor hampering the performance of the VNE. However, in
many specialized applications and infrastructures, VNRs are of some common structural features
$\textit{e.g.}$, paths and cycles. To achieve better outcomes, it is thus critical to design dedicated
algorithms for these applications and infrastructures by taking into accounting topological
characteristics. Besides, paths and cycles are two of the most fundamental topologies that all
network structures consist of. Exploiting the characteristics of path and cycle embeddings is
vital to tackle the general VNE problem. In this paper, we investigated the path and cycle embedding
problems. For path embedding, we proved its $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness and inapproximability.
Then, by utilizing Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) and Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP),
we proposed an efficient and effective MKP-MDKP-based algorithm. For cycle embedding, we proposed
a Weighted Directed Auxiliary Graph (WDAG) to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to determine
the least-resource-consuming embedding. Numerical results showed our customized algorithms
can boost the acceptance ratio and revenue compared to generic embedding algorithms in the literature.
