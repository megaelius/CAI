The goal of this paper is to establish the general framework of consensus equilibria for Mining-Pool
Games in Blockchain Ecosystems, and with the explanation for the stability of in terms of the existence
of consensus equilibria related to mining gap game's behaviors by using one new concept called consensus
games in Blockchain Ecosystems, here, the Blockchain ecosystem mainly means the economic activities
by taking into the account of three types of different factors which are expenses, reward mechanism
and mining power for the work on blockschain by applying the key consensus called Proof of Work due
to Nakamoto in 2008. In order to do so, we first give an outline how the general existence of consensus
equilibria for Mining Pool Games is formulated, and then used to explain the stable for Gap Games
for Bitcoin in the sense by the existence of consensus equilibria under the framework of Blockchain
consensus, we then establish a general existence result for consensus equilibria of general mining
gap games by using the profit functions for miners as the payoffs in game theory. As applications,
the general existence results for consensus equilibria of Gap games are established, which not
only help us to claim the existence for the general stability for Gap games under the general framework
of Blockchain ecosystems, but also allow us to illustrate a number of different phenomenon on the
study of mining-pool games with possible impacts due to miners's gap behaviors with scenarios embedded
n Bitcoin economics. Our study on the explanation for the stability of mining gap game for Blockchain
ecosystems shows that the concept of consensus equilibria may play a important role for the development
of fundamental theory for consensus economics.
