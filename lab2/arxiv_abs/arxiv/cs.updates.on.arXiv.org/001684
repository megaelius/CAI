The security of the Bitcoin system is based on having a large amount of computational power in the
hands of honest miners. Such miners are incentivized to join the system and validate transactions
by the payments issued by the protocol to anyone who creates blocks. As new bitcoins creation rate
decreases (halving every 4 years), the revenue derived from transaction fees start to have an increasingly
important role. We argue that Bitcoin's current fee market does not extract revenue well when blocks
are not congested. This effect has implications for the scalability debate: revenue from transaction
fees may decrease if block size is increased. The current mechanism is a "pay your bid" auction in
which included transactions pay the amount they suggested. We propose two alternative auction
mechanisms: The Monopolistic Price Mechanism, and the Random Sampling Optimal Price Mechanism
(due to Goldberg et al.). In the monopolistic price mechanism, the miner chooses the number of accepted
transactions in the block, and all transactions pay exactly the smallest bid included in the block.
The mechanism thus sets the block size dynamically (up to a bound required for fast block propagation
and other security concerns). We show, using analysis and simulations, that this mechanism extracts
revenue better from users, and that it is nearly incentive compatible: the profit due to strategic
bidding relative to honest biding decreases as the number of bidders grows. Users can then simply
set their bids truthfully to exactly the amount they are willing to pay to transact, and do not need
to utilize fee estimate mechanisms, do not resort to bid shading and do not need to adjust transaction
fees (via replace-by-fee mechanisms) if the mempool grows. We discuss these and other properties
of our mechanisms, and explore various desired properties of fee market mechanisms for crypto-currencies.
