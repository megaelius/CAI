Elderly fall prevention and detection is extremely crucial especially with the fast aging society.
In this paper, we propose mmFall, a novel system for fall detection. In terms of sensing modality,
we adopt the emerging millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor to collect the point cloud of a moving
human body along with its estimated centroid. In terms of detection methodology, we propose a variational
recurrent autoencoder (VRAE) model to monitor the motion anomaly level, and claim a fall detection
when two conditions meet simultaneously, viz. (i) a anomaly level spike and (ii) a sudden drop of
body's centroid height. The mmWave radar sensor provides advantages, such as privacy-compliance
and high sensitivity to motion, over the traditional sensing modalities. To overcome the difficulties
in machine learning using radar due to the data randomness, the VRAE uses variational inference,
a probabilistic approach rather than deterministic approach, to infer the posterior probability
of latent motion state at every frame, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the temporal
features of the motion over multiple frames. Moreover, to circumvent the difficulties in fall data
collection and labeling in the traditional fall detection research, the VRAE is built upon an autoencoder
architecture, a semisupervised approach, and trained with only normal activities of daily living
(ADL) such that in the inference stage the VRAE will generate a spike in the anomaly level once an abnormal
motion, such as fall, occurs. During the experiment, we implemented the VRAE along with two other
baselines, and tested on the dataset collected in an apartment. The receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve indicates that our proposed model outperforms the other two baselines, and achieves
98% detection out of 50 falls at expense of just 2 false alarms.
