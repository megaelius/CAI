What are the functions of curiosity? What are the mechanisms of curiosity-driven learning? We approach
these questions about the living using concepts and tools from machine learning and developmental
robotics. We argue that curiosity-driven learning enables organisms to make discoveries to solve
complex problems with rare or deceptive rewards. By fostering exploration and discovery of a diversity
of behavioural skills, and ignoring these rewards, curiosity can be efficient to bootstrap learning
when there is no information, or deceptive information, about local improvement towards these
problems. We also explain the key role of curiosity for efficient learning of world models. We review
both normative and heuristic computational frameworks used to understand the mechanisms of curiosity
in humans, conceptualizing the child as a sense-making organism. These frameworks enable us to
discuss the bi-directional causal links between curiosity and learning, and to provide new hypotheses
about the fundamental role of curiosity in self-organizing developmental structures through
curriculum learning. We present various developmental robotics experiments that study these
mechanisms in action, both supporting these hypotheses to understand better curiosity in humans
and opening new research avenues in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Finally, we
discuss challenges for the design of experimental paradigms for studying curiosity in psychology
and cognitive neuroscience. Keywords: Curiosity, intrinsic motivation, lifelong learning,
