We propose a novel method for massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) in Frequency
Division Duplexing (FDD) systems. Due to the large frequency separation between Uplink (UL) and
Downlink (DL), in FDD systems channel reciprocity does not hold. Hence, in order to provide DL channel
state information to the Base Station (BS), closed-loop DL channel probing and feedback is needed.
In massive MIMO this incurs typically a large training overhead. For example, in a typical configuration
with $M \simeq 200$ BS antennas and fading coherence block of $T \simeq 200$ symbols, the resulting
rate penalty factor due to the DL training overhead, given by $\max\{0, 1 - M/T\}$, is close to 0. To
reduce this overhead, we build upon the observation that the Angular Scattering Function (ASF)
of the user channels is invariant over the frequency domain. We develop a robust and stable method
to estimate the users' DL channel covariance matrices from pilots sent by the users in the UL. The
resulting DL covariance information is used to optimize a sparsifying precoder, in order to limit
the effective channel dimension of each user channel to be not larger than some desired DL pilot dimension
$T_{\rm dl}$. In this way, we can maximize the rank of the effective sparsified channel matrix subject
to a desired training overhead penalty factor $\max\{0, 1 - T_{\rm dl} / T\}$. We pose this problem
as a Mixed Integer Linear Program, that can be efficiently solved. Furthermore, each user can simply
feed back its $T_{\rm dl}$ pilot measurements. Thus, the proposed approach yields also a small feedback
overhead and delay. We provide simulation results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed
approach with respect to state-of-the-art "compressed DL pilot" schemes based on compressed sensing.
