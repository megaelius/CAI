To design a method to solve the issues of handling 'dirty' and highly complex geometries, the topology-free
method combined with the immersed boundary method is presented for viscous and incompressible
flows at a high Reynolds number. The method simultaneously employs a ghost-cell technique and distributed
forcing technique to impose the boundary conditions. An axis-projected interpolation scheme
is used to avoid searching failures during fluid and solid identification. This method yields a
topology-free immersed boundary, which particularly suits flow simulations of highly complex
geometries. Difficulties generally arise when generating the calculation grid for these scenarios.
This method allows dirty data to be handled without any preparatory treatment work to simplify or
clean-up the geometry. This method is also applicable to the coherent structural turbulence model
employed in this study. The verification cases, used in conjunction with the second-order central-difference
scheme, resulted in first-order accuracy at finer resolution, although the coarser resolution
retained second-order accuracy. This method is fully parallelized for distributed memory platforms.
In this study, the accuracy and fidelity of this method were examined by simulating the flow around
the bluff body, past a flat plate, and past dirty spheres. These simulations were compared with experimental
data and other established results. Finally, results from the simulation of practical applications
demonstrate the ability of the method to model highly complex, non-canonical three-dimensional
flows. The countermeasure based on the accurate classification of geometric features has provided
a robust and reasonable solution.
