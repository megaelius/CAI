In swarm robotics, any of the robots in a swarm may be affected by different faults, resulting in significant
performance declines. To allow fault recovery from randomly injected faults to different robots
in a swarm, a model-free approach may be preferable due to the accumulation of faults in models and
the difficulty to predict the behaviour of neighbouring robots. One model-free approach to fault
recovery involves two phases: during simulation, a quality-diversity algorithm evolves a behaviourally
diverse archive of controllers; during the target application, a search for the best controller
is initiated after fault injection. In quality-diversity algorithms, the choice of the behavioural
descriptor is a key design choice that determines the quality of the evolved archives, and therefore
the fault recovery performance. Although the environment is an important determinant of behaviour,
the impact of environmental diversity is often ignored in the choice of a suitable behavioural descriptor.
This study compares different behavioural descriptors, including two generic descriptors that
work on a wide range of tasks, one hand-coded descriptor which fits the domain of interest, and one
novel type of descriptor based on environmental diversity, which we call Quality-Environment-Diversity
(QED). Results demonstrate that the above-mentioned model-free approach to fault recovery is
feasible in the context of swarm robotics, reducing the fault impact by a factor 2-3. Further, the
environmental diversity obtained with QED yields a unique behavioural diversity profile that
allows it to recover from high-impact faults.
