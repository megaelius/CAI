Subjective Logic (SL) is one of well-known belief models that can explicitly deal with uncertain
opinions and infer unknown opinions based on a rich set of operators of fusing multiple opinions.
Due to high simplicity and applicability, SL has been substantially applied in a variety of decision
making in the area of cybersecurity, opinion models, trust models, and/or social network analysis.
However, SL and its variants have exposed limitations in predicting uncertain opinions in real-world
dynamic network data mainly in three-fold: (1) a lack of scalability to deal with a large-scale network;
(2) limited capability to handle heterogeneous topological and temporal dependencies among node-level
opinions; and (3) a high sensitivity with conflicting evidence that may generate counterintuitive
opinions derived from the evidence. In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based dynamic
opinion inference model while node-level opinions are still formalized based on SL meaning that
an opinion has a dimension of uncertainty in addition to belief and disbelief in a binomial opinion
(i.e., agree or disagree). The proposed DL-based dynamic opinion inference model overcomes the
above three limitations by integrating the following techniques: (1) state-of-the-art DL techniques,
such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for modeling the
topological and temporal heterogeneous dependency information of a given dynamic network; (2)
modeling conflicting opinions based on robust statistics; and (3) a highly scalable inference
algorithm to predict dynamic, uncertain opinions in a linear computation time. We validated the
outperformance of our proposed DL-based algorithm (i.e., GCN-GRU-opinion model) via extensive
comparative performance analysis based on four real-world datasets.
