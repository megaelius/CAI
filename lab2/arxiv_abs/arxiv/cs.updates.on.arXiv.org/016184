In this paper, we propose a novel method for irregularity detection. Previous researches solve
this problem as a One-Class Classification (OCC) task where they train a reference model on all of
the available samples. Then, they consider a test sample as an anomaly if it has a diversion from the
reference model. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved the most promising results
for OCC while implementing and training such networks, especially for the OCC task, is a cumbersome
and computationally expensive procedure. To cope with the mentioned challenges, we present a simple
but effective method to solve the irregularity detection as a binary classification task in order
to make the implementation easier along with improving the detection performance. We learn two
deep neural networks (generator and discriminator) in a GAN-style setting on merely the normal
samples. During training, the generator gradually becomes an expert to generate samples which
are similar to the normal ones. In the training phase, when the generator fails to produce normal
data (in the early stages of learning and also prior to the complete convergence), it can be considered
as an irregularity generator. In this way, we simultaneously generate the irregular samples. Afterward,
we train a binary classifier on the generated anomalous samples along with the normal instances
in order to be capable of detecting irregularities. The proposed framework applies to different
related applications of outlier and anomaly detection in images and videos, respectively. The
results confirm that our proposed method is superior to the baseline and state-of-the-art solutions.
