Software-Defined Networking (SDN) introduces a centralized network control and management by
separating the data plane from the control plane which facilitates traffic flow monitoring, security
analysis and policy formulation. However, it is challenging to choose a proper degree of traffic
flow handling granularity while proactively protecting forwarding devices from getting overloaded.
In this paper, we propose a novel traffic flow matching control framework called Q-DATA that applies
reinforcement learning in order to enhance the traffic flow monitoring performance in SDN based
networks and prevent traffic forwarding performance degradation. We first describe and analyse
an SDN-based traffic flow matching control system that applies a reinforcement learning approach
based on Q-learning algorithm in order to maximize the traffic flow granularity. It also considers
the forwarding performance status of the SDN switches derived from a Support Vector Machine based
algorithm. Next, we outline the Q-DATA framework that incorporates the optimal traffic flow matching
policy derived from the traffic flow matching control system to efficiently provide the most detailed
traffic flow information that other mechanisms require. Our novel approach is realized as a REST
SDN application and evaluated in an SDN environment. Through comprehensive experiments, the results
show that---compared to the default behavior of common SDN controllers and to our previous DATA
mechanism---the new Q-DATA framework yields a remarkable improvement in terms of traffic forwarding
performance degradation protection of SDN switches while still providing the most detailed traffic
flow information on demand.
