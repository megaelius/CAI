In-browser cryptojacking involves hijacking the CPU power of a website's visitor to perform CPU-intensive
cryptocurrency mining, and has been on the rise, with 8500% growth during 2017. While some websites
advocate cryptojacking as a replacement for online advertisement, web attackers exploit it to
generate revenue by embedding malicious cryptojacking code in highly ranked websites. Motivated
by the rise of cryptojacking and the lack of any prior systematic work, we set out to analyze malicious
cryptojacking statically and dynamically, and examine the economical basis of cryptojacking
as an alternative to advertisement. For our static analysis, we perform content-, currency-, and
code-based analyses. Through the content-based analysis, we unveil that cryptojacking is a wide-spread
threat targeting a variety of website types. Through a currency-based analysis we highlight affinities
between mining platforms and currencies: the majority of cryptojacking websites use Coinhive
to mine Monero. Through code-based analysis, we highlight unique code complexity features of cryptojacking
scripts, and use them to detect cryptojacking code among benign and other malicious JavaScript
code, with an accuracy of 96.4%. Through dynamic analysis, we highlight the impact of cryptojacking
on system resources, such as CPU and battery consumption (in battery-powered devices); we use the
latter to build an analytical model that examines the feasibility of cryptojacking as an alternative
to online advertisement, and show a huge negative profit/loss gap, suggesting that the model is
impractical. By surveying existing countermeasures and their limitations, we conclude with long-term
countermeasures using insights from our analysis.
