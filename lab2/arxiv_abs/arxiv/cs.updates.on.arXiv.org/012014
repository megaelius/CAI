One of the major challenges in multivariate analysis is the estimation of population covariance
matrix from sample covariance matrix (SCM). Most recent covariance matrix estimators use either
shrinkage transformations or asymptotic results from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Shrinkage techniques
help in pulling extreme correlation values towards certain target values whereas tools from RMT
help in removing noisy eigenvalues of SCM. Both of these techniques use different approaches to
achieve a similar goal which is to remove noisy correlations and add structure to SCM to overcome
the bias-variance trade-off. In this paper, we first critically evaluate the pros and cons of these
two techniques and then propose an improved estimator which exploits the advantages of both by taking
an optimally weighted convex combination of covariance matrices estimated by an improved shrinkage
transformation and a RMT based filter. It is a generalized estimator which can adapt to changing
sampling noise conditions in various datasets by performing hyperparameter optimization. We
show the effectiveness of this estimator on the problem of designing a financial portfolio with
minimum risk. We have chosen this problem because the complex properties of stock market data provide
extreme conditions to test the robustness of a covariance estimator. Using data from four of the
world's largest stock exchanges, we show that our proposed estimator outperforms existing estimators
in minimizing the out-of-sample risk of the portfolio and hence predicts population statistics
more precisely. Since covariance analysis is a crucial statistical tool, this estimator can be
used in a wide range of machine learning, signal processing and high dimensional pattern recognition
applications.
