Operating modern power grids with stability guarantees is admittedly imperative. Classic stability
methods are not well-suited for these dynamic systems as they involve centralized gathering of
information and computation of the system's eigenvalues, processes which are oftentimes not privacy-preserving
and computationally burdensome. System operators (SOs) would nowadays have to be able to quickly
and efficiently assess small-signal stability as the power grid operating conditions change more
dynamically while also respect the privacy of the distributed energy resources (DERs). Motivated
by all these, in this paper we introduce a framework that comprises a computationally efficient,
privacy-preserving, distributed and compositional stability assessment method. Our proposed
method first calls for representative agents at various buses to exchange information with their
neighbors and design their local controls in order to meet some local stability conditions. Following
that, the agents are required to notify the SO whether their local conditions are satisfied or not.
In case the agents cannot verify their local conditions they can augment their local controls using
a global control input. The SO can then warrant stability of the interconnected power grid by assembling
the local stability guarantees, established by the agents, in a compositional manner. We analytically
derive the local stability conditions and prove that when they are collectively satisfied stability
of the interconnected system ensues. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSA method
via a numerical example centered around a three-bus power grid.
