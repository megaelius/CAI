We introduce Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel technique for transferring biomarker information
between related neurodegenerative diseases. DKT infers robust multimodal biomarker trajectories
in rare neurodegenerative diseases even when only limited, unimodal data is available, by transferring
information from larger multimodal datasets from common neurodegenerative diseases. DKT is a
joint-disease generative model of biomarker progressions, which exploits biomarker relationships
that are shared across diseases. Our proposed method allows, for the first time, the estimation
of plausible, multimodal biomarker trajectories in Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a rare neurodegenerative
disease where only unimodal MRI data is available. For this we train DKT on a combined dataset containing
subjects with two distinct diseases and sizes of data available: 1) a larger, multimodal typical
AD (tAD) dataset from the TADPOLE Challenge, and 2) a smaller unimodal Posterior Cortical Atrophy
(PCA) dataset from the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), for which only a limited number of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are available. Although validation is challenging due to lack of
data in PCA, we validate DKT on synthetic data and two patient datasets (TADPOLE and PCA cohorts),
showing it can estimate the ground truth parameters in the simulation and predict unseen biomarkers
on the two patient datasets. While we demonstrated DKT on Alzheimer's variants, we note DKT is generalisable
to other forms of related neurodegenerative diseases. Source code for DKT is available online:
