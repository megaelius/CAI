Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) are particle imaging detectors recording 2D or
3D images of numerous complex trajectories of charged particles. Identifying points of interest
in these images, such as the starting and ending points of particles trajectories, is a crucial step
of identifying and analyzing these particles and impacts inference of physics signals such as neutrino
interaction. The Point Proposal Network is designed to discover specific points of interest, namely
the starting and ending points of track-like particle trajectories such as muons and protons, and
the starting points of electromagnetic shower-like particle trajectories such as electrons and
gamma rays. The algorithm predicts with a sub-voxel precision their spatial location, and also
determines the category of the identified points of interest. Using the PILArNet public LArTPC
data sample as a benchmark, our algorithm successfully predicted 96.8%, 97.8%, and 98.1% of 3D points
within the voxel distance of 3, 10, and 20 from the provided true point locations respectively. For
the predicted 3D points within 3 voxels of the closest true point locations, the median distance
is found to be 0.25 voxels, achieving the sub-voxel level precision. We report that the majority
of predicted points that are more than 10 voxels away from the closest true point locations are legitimate
mistakes, and our algorithm achieved high enough accuracy to identify issues associated with a
small fraction of true point locations provided in the dataset. Further, using those predicted
points, we demonstrate a set of simple algorithms to cluster 3D voxels into individual track-like
particle trajectories at the clustering efficiency, purity, and Adjusted Rand Index of 83.2%,
96.7%, and 94.7% respectively.
