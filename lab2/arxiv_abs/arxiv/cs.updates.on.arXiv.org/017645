This paper presents a cognitive behavioral-based driver mood repairment platform in intelligent
transportation cyber-physical systems (IT-CPS) for road safety. In particular, we propose a driving
safety platform for distracted drivers, namely \emph{drive safe}, in IT-CPS. The proposed platform
recognizes the distracting activities of the drivers as well as their emotions for mood repair.
Further, we develop a prototype of the proposed drive safe platform to establish proof-of-concept
(PoC) for the road safety in IT-CPS. In the developed driving safety platform, we employ five AI and
statistical-based models to infer a vehicle driver's cognitive-behavioral mining to ensure safe
driving during the drive. Especially, capsule network (CN), maximum likelihood (ML), convolutional
neural network (CNN), Apriori algorithm, and Bayesian network (BN) are deployed for driver activity
recognition, environmental feature extraction, mood recognition, sequential pattern mining,
and content recommendation for affective mood repairment of the driver, respectively. Besides,
we develop a communication module to interact with the systems in IT-CPS asynchronously. Thus,
the developed drive safe PoC can guide the vehicle drivers when they are distracted from driving
due to the cognitive-behavioral factors. Finally, we have performed a qualitative evaluation
to measure the usability and effectiveness of the developed drive safe platform. We observe that
the P-value is 0.0041 (i.e., < 0.05) in the ANOVA test. Moreover, the confidence interval analysis
also shows significant gains in prevalence value which is around 0.93 for a 95% confidence level.
The aforementioned statistical results indicate high reliability in terms of driver's safety
and mental state.
