Over the past decade, Airbnb has emerged as the most popular platform for renting out single rooms
or whole apartments. The impact of Airbnb listings on local neighborhoods has been controversially
discussed in many cities around the world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in
urban life, and in particular urban tourism. We argue that urban tourism space can no longer be understood
as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist approach and argue that urban tourism
space is (re-)produced digitally and collaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate
our work to a CSCW research direction that is concerned with the role of digital technologies in the
production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of representations as a theoretical
lens for our empirical study. In that study, we qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods
Kreuzk\"olln and City West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing descriptions.
Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned places differ between Airbnb
hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination management organization (DMO). In our qualitative
analysis, we found that hosts primarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their
apartment. In the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many places also
mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzk\"olln, in contrast, hosts reframed everyday
places such as parks or an immigrant food market as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb
hosts contribute to the discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them
as tourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb, power relations
in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs towards local residents who are now producing
tourism space collaboratively.
