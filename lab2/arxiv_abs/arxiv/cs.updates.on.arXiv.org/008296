In this paper, we propose a novel control architecture, inspired from neuroscience, for adaptive
control of continuous-time systems. The proposed architecture, in the setting of standard neural
network (NN) based adaptive control, augments an external working memory to the NN. The external
working memory, through a write operation, stores certain recently observed feature vectors from
the hidden layer of the NN. It retrieves relevant vectors from the working memory to modify the final
control signal generated by the controller. The use of external working memory is aimed at improving
the context thereby inducing the learning system to search in a particular direction. This directed
learning allows the learning system to find a good approximation of the unknown function even after
abrupt changes quickly. A key objective explored in this paper is to design control architectures
and algorithms that can learn and adapt quickly to changes that are even abrupt. We consider two classes
of controllers for concrete development of our ideas (i) a model reference NN adaptive controller
for linear systems with matched uncertainty (ii) robot arm controller. We prove that the resulting
controllers lead to Uniformly Ulitmately Bounded (UUB) stable closed loop systems. We provide
a detailed illustration of the working of this learning mechanism through a simple example. Through
extensive simulations and specific metrics we also show that memory augmentation improves learning
significantly even when the system undergoes sudden changes. Importantly, we also provide evidence
for the proposed mechanism by which this specific memory augmentation improves learning.
