We sought to develop a quantitative tool to quickly determine relative differences in MRI volumes
both within and between large MR imaging cohorts (such as available in The Cancer Imaging Archive
(TCIA)), in order to help determine the generalizability of radiomics and machine learning schemes
to unseen datasets. The tool is intended to help quantify presence of (a) site- or scanner-specific
variations in image resolution, field-of-view, or image contrast, or (b) imaging artifacts such
as noise, motion, inhomogeneity, ringing, or aliasing; which can adversely affect relative image
quality between data cohorts. We present MRQy, a new open-source quality control tool to (a) interrogate
MRI cohorts for site- or equipment-based differences, and (b) quantify the impact of MRI artifacts
on relative image quality; to help determine how to correct for these variations prior to model development.
MRQy extracts a series of quality measures (e.g. noise ratios, variation metrics, entropy and energy
criteria) and MR image metadata (e.g. voxel resolution, image dimensions) for subsequent interrogation
via a specialized HTML5 based front-end designed for real-time filtering and trend visualization.
MRQy was used to evaluate (a) n=133 brain MRIs from TCIA (7 sites), and (b) n=104 rectal MRIs (3 local
sites). MRQy measures revealed significant site-specific variations in both cohorts, indicating
potential batch effects. Marked differences in specific MRQy measures were also able to identify
outlier MRI datasets that needed to be corrected for common MR imaging artifacts. MRQy is designed
to be a standalone, unsupervised tool that can be efficiently run on a standard desktop computer.
