Anomaly detection problems (also called change-point detection problems) have been studied in
data mining, statistics and computer science over the last several decades (mostly in non-network
context) in applications such as medical condition monitoring, weather change detection and speech
recognition. In recent days, however, anomaly detection problems have become increasing more
relevant in the context of network science since useful insights for many complex systems in biology,
finance and social science are often obtained by representing them via networks. Notions of local
and non-local curvatures of higher-dimensional geometric shapes and topological spaces play
a fundamental role in physics and mathematics in characterizing anomalous behaviours of these
higher dimensional entities. However, using curvature measures to detect anomalies in networks
is not yet very common. To this end, a main goal in this paper to formulate and analyze curvature analysis
methods to provide the foundations of systematic approaches to find critical components and detect
anomalies in networks. For this purpose, we use two measures of network curvatures which depend
on non-trivial global properties, such as distributions of geodesics and higher-order correlations
among nodes, of the given network. Based on these measures, we precisely formulate several computational
problems related to anomaly detection in static or dynamic networks, and provide non-trivial computational
complexity results for these problems. This paper must not be viewed as delivering the final word
on appropriateness and suitability of specific curvature measures. Instead, it is our hope that
this paper will stimulate and motivate further theoretical or empirical research concerning the
exciting interplay between notions of curvatures from network and non-network domains, a much
desired goal in our opinion.
