Virtual reality 360-degree videos will become the first prosperous online VR application. VR 360
videos are data-hungry and latency-sensitive that pose unique challenges to the networking infrastructure.
In this paper, we focus on the ultimate VR 360 that satisfies human eye fidelity. The ultimate VR 360
requires downlink 1.5 Gbps for viewing and uplink 6.6 Gbps for live broadcasting, with round-trip
time of less than 8.3 ms. On the other hand, wireless access to VR 360 services is preferred over wire-line
transmission because of the better user experience and the safety concern (e.g., tripping hazard).
We explore in this paper whether the most advanced wireless technologies from both cellular communications
and WiFi communications support the ultimate VR 360. Specifically, we consider 5G in cellular communications,
IEEE 802.11ac (operating in 5GHz) and IEEE 802.11ad (operating in 60GHz) in WiFi communications.
According to their performance specified in their standards and/or empirical measurements, we
have the following findings: (1) Only 5G has the potential to support both the the ultimate VR 360
viewing and live broadcasting. However, it is difficult for 5G to support multiple users of the ultimate
VR live broadcasting at home; (2) IEEE 802.11ac supports the ultimate VR 360 viewing but fails to
support the ultimate VR 360 live broadcasting because it does not meet the data rate requirement
of the ultimate VR 360 live broadcasting; (3) IEEE 802.11ad fails to support the ultimate VR 360,
because its current implementation incurs very high latency. Our preliminary results indicate
that more advanced wireless technologies are needed to fully support multiple ultimate VR 360 users
at home.
