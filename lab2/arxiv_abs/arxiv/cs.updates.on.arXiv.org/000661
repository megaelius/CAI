Powering a radio access network using renewables such as wind and solar power promises dramatic
reduction of the network operation cost and of the networks' carbon footprints. However, the spatial
variation of the energy field can lead to fluctuation in power supplied to the network and thereby
affects its coverage. This warrants research on quantifying this negative effect and techniques
for countermeasure, motivating the current work. The paper considers a cellular downlink network
with hexagonal cells and powered by harvesting energy. The network coverage of mobiles is specified
by an outage constraint. A novel model of the energy field is developed using stochastic geometry.
In the model, fixed maximum energy intensity occurs at Poisson distributed locations, called energy
centers; the intensities fall off from the centers following an exponential-decay function of
squared distance; the energy intensity at an arbitrary location is given by the decayed intensity
from the nearest energy center. The effect of the energy field on the network performance depends
on the harvester deployment. First, consider single harvesters deployed on the same sites as base
stations (BSs). The mobile outage probability is shown to decrease exponentially with the product
of the two parameters of the energy-field model, namely the energy-center density and exponential
rate of the energy-decay function. Next, consider distributed harvesters whose generated energy
is aggregated and then re-distributed to BSs. As the number of harvesters per aggregator increases,
the power supplied to each BS is shown to converge to a constant proportional to the number of harvesters
per BS, which counteracts the randomness of the energy field. Nevertheless, this requires regulating
the energy loss in the aggregation process.
