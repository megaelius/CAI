We study the task of Byzantine gathering in a network modeled as a graph. Despite the presence of Byzantine
agents, all the other (good) agents, starting from possibly different nodes and applying the same
deterministic algorithm, have to meet at the same node in finite time and stop moving. An adversary
chooses the initial nodes of the agents and assigns a different label to each of them. The agents move
in synchronous rounds and communicate with each other only when located at the same node. Within
the team, f of the agents are Byzantine. A Byzantine agent acts in an unpredictable way: in particular
it may forge the label of another agent or create a completely new one. Besides its label, which corresponds
to a local knowledge, an agent is assigned some global knowledge GK that is common to all agents. In
literature, the Byzantine gathering problem has been analyzed in arbitrary n-node graphs by considering
the scenario when GK=(n,f) and the scenario when GK=f. In the first (resp. second) scenario, it has
been shown that the minimum number of good agents guaranteeing deterministic gathering of all of
them is f+1 (resp. f+2). For both these scenarios, all the existing deterministic algorithms, whether
or not they are optimal in terms of required number of good agents, have a time complexity that is exponential
in n and L, where L is the largest label belonging to a good agent. In this paper, we seek to design a deterministic
solution for Byzantine gathering that makes a concession on the proportion of Byzantine agents
within the team, but that offers a significantly lower complexity. We also seek to use a global knowledge
whose the length of the binary representation is small. Assuming that the agents are in a strong team
i.e., a team in which the number of good agents is at least some prescribed value that is quadratic
in f, we give positive and negative results.
