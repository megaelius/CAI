Understanding the evolutionary patterns of real-world evolving complex systems such as human
interactions, transport networks, biological interactions, and computer networks has important
implications in our daily lives. Predicting future links among the nodes in such networks reveals
an important aspect of the evolution of temporal networks. To analyse networks, they are mapped
to adjacency matrices, however, a single adjacency matrix cannot represent complex relationships
(e.g. temporal pattern), and therefore, some approaches consider a simplified representation
of temporal networks but in high-dimensional and generally sparse matrices. As a result, adjacency
matrices cannot be directly used by machine learning models for making network or node level predictions.
To overcome this problem, automated frameworks are proposed for learning low-dimensional vectors
for nodes or edges, as state-of-the-art techniques in predicting temporal patterns in networks
such as link prediction. However, these models fail to consider temporal dimensions of the networks.
This gap motivated us to propose in this research a new node embedding technique which exploits the
evolving nature of the networks considering a simple three-layer graph neural network at each time
step, and extracting node orientation by Given's angle method. To prove our proposed algorithm's
efficiency, we evaluated the efficiency of our proposed algorithm against six state-of-the-art
benchmark network embedding models, on four real temporal networks data, and the results show our
model outperforms other methods in predicting future links in temporal networks.
