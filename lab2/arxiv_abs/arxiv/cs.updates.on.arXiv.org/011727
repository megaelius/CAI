The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the development of a knowledge-based infrastructure
to support MSP decision-making processes. The paper emerged from a study to define specifications
for a knowledge-based infrastructure to provide decision support for community-level MSPs in
the Canadian province of Quebec. As part of the study, a process assessment was conducted to understand
the needs of communities as they collect, organize, and analyze data to make decisions about their
priorities. The result of this process is a portrait, which is an epidemiological profile of health
and nutrition in their community. Portraits inform strategic planning and development of interventions
and are used to assess the impact of interventions. Our key findings indicate ambiguities and disagreement
among MSP decision-makers regarding causal relationships between actions and outcomes, and the
relevant data needed for making decisions. MSP decision-makers expressed a desire for easy-to-use
tools that facilitate the collection, organization, synthesis, and analysis of data, to enable
decision-making in a timely manner. Findings inform conceptual modeling and ontological analysis
to capture the domain knowledge and specify relationships between actions and outcomes. This modeling
and analysis provide the foundation for an ontology, encoded using OWL 2 Web Ontology Language.
The ontology is developed to provide semantic support for the MSP process, defining objectives,
strategies, actions, indicators, and data sources. In the future, software interacting with the
ontology can facilitate interactive browsing by decision-makers in the MSP in the form of concepts,
instances, relationships, and axioms. Our ontology also facilitates the integration and interpretation
of community data and can help in managing semantic interoperability between different knowledge
sources.
