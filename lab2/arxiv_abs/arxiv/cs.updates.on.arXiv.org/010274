The numerous expanding online social networks offer fast channels for misinformation spreading,
which could have a serious impact on socioeconomic systems. Researchers across multiple areas
have paid attention to this issue with a view of addressing it. However, no systematical theoretical
study has been performed to date on observing misinformation spreading on correlated multiplex
networks. In this study, we propose a multiplex network-based misinformation spreading model,
considering the fact that each individual can obtain misinformation from multiple platforms.
Subsequently, we develop a heterogeneous edge-base compartmental theory to comprehend the spreading
dynamics of our proposed model. In addition, we establish an analytical method based on stability
analysis to obtain the misinformation outbreak threshold. On the basis of these theories, we finally
analyze the influence of different dynamical and structural parameters on the misinformation
spreading dynamics. Results show that the misinformation outbreak size $R(\infty)$ grows continuously
with the effective transmission probability $\beta$ once $\beta$ exceeds a certain value, that
is, the outbreak threshold $\beta_c$. A large average degrees, strong degree heterogeneity, or
positive inter-layer correlation will reduce $\beta_c$, accelerating the outbreak of misinformation.
Besides, increasing the degree heterogeneity or a more positive inter-layer correlation will
both enlarge (reduce) $R(\infty)$ for small (large) values of $\beta$. Our systematic theoretical
analysis results agree well with the numerical simulation results. Our proposed model and accurate
theoretical analysis will serve as a useful framework to understand and predict the spreading dynamics
of misinformation on multiplex networks, and thereby pave the way to address this serious issue.
