Stone-type dualities provide a powerful mathematical framework for studying properties of logical
systems. They have recently been fruitfully explored in understanding minimisation of various
types of automata. In Bezhanishvili et al. (2012), a dual equivalence between a category of coalgebras
and a category of algebras was used to explain minimisation. The algebraic semantics is dual to a
coalgebraic semantics in which logical equivalence coincides with trace equivalence. It follows
that maximal quotients of coalgebras correspond to minimal subobjects of algebras. Examples include
partially observable deterministic finite automata, linear weighted automata viewed as coalgebras
over finite-dimensional vector spaces, and belief automata, which are coalgebras on compact Hausdorff
spaces. In Bonchi et al. (2014), Brzozowski's double-reversal minimisation algorithm for deterministic
finite automata was described categorically and its correctness explained via the duality between
reachability and observability. This work includes generalisations of Brzozowski's algorithm
to Moore and weighted automata over commutative semirings. In this paper we propose a general categorical
framework within which such minimisation algorithms can be understood. The goal is to provide a
unifying perspective based on duality. Our framework consists of a stack of three interconnected
adjunctions: a base dual adjunction that can be lifted to a dual adjunction between coalgebras and
algebras and also to a dual adjunction between automata. The approach provides an abstract understanding
of reachability and observability. We illustrate the general framework on range of concrete examples,
including deterministic Kripke frames, weighted automata, topological automata (belief automata),
and alternating automata.
