Cyber-physical systems increasingly rely on distributed computing platforms where sensing,
computing, actuation, and communication resources are shared by a multitude of applications.
Such `cyber-physical cloud computing platforms' present novel challenges because the system
is built from mobile embedded devices, is inherently distributed, and typically suffers from highly
fluctuating connectivity among the modules. Architecting software for these systems raises many
challenges not present in traditional cloud computing. Effective management of constrained resources
and application isolation without adversely affecting performance are necessary. Autonomous
fault management and real-time performance requirements must be met in a verifiable manner. It
is also both critical and challenging to support multiple end-users whose diverse software applications
have changing demands for computational and communication resources, while operating on different
levels and in separate domains of security. The solution presented in this paper is based on a layered
architecture consisting of a novel operating system, a middleware layer, and component-structured
applications. The component model facilitates the construction of software applications from
modular and reusable components that are deployed in the distributed system and interact only through
well-defined mechanisms. The complexity of creating applications and performing system integration
is mitigated through the use of a domain-specific model-driven development process that relies
on a domain-specific modeling language and its accompanying graphical modeling tools, software
generators for synthesizing infrastructure code, and the extensive use of model-based analysis
for verification and validation.
