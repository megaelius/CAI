In the natural sciences, differential equations are widely used to describe dynamical systems.
The discovery and verification of such models from data has become a fundamental challenge of science
today. From a statistical point of view, we distinguish two problems: parameter estimation and
structure search. In parameter estimation, we start from a given differential equation and estimate
the parameters from noisy data that are observed at discrete time points. The estimate depends nonlinearly
on the parameters. This poses both statistical and computational challenges and makes the task
of structure search even more ambitious. Existing methods use either standard model selection
techniques or various types of sparsity enforcing regularization, hence focusing on predictive
performance. In this work, we develop novel methodology for structure search in ordinary differential
equation models. Exploiting ideas from causal inference, we propose to rank models not only by their
predictive performance, but also by taking into account stability, i.e., their ability to predict
well in different experimental settings. Based on this model ranking we also construct a ranking
of individual variables reflecting causal importance. It provides researchers with a list of promising
candidate variables that may be investigated further in interventional experiments. Our ranking
methodology (both for models and variables) comes with theoretical asymptotic guarantees and
is shown to outperform current state-of-the art methods based on extensive experimental evaluation
on simulated data. Practical applicability of the procedure is illustrated on a not yet published
biological data set. Our methodology is fully implemented. Code will be provided online and will
also be made available as an R package.
