The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus,
causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists
are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific
institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and
the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at
solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method,
combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to
provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and
research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions'
COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information
including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g.
mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory
of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need
to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology
will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation
interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous
issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
