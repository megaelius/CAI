Security provisioning has become the most important design consideration for large-scale Internet
of Things (IoT) systems due to their critical roles to support diverse vertical applications by
connecting heterogenous devices, machines and industry processes. Conventional authentication
and authorization schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due
to their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity for improving
security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for different layers and link segments
while ignoring the overall protection lead to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication
latency and overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled security
provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast authentication and progressive
authorization. To be more specific, a lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed
by exploring machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or frequencies of
resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic authentication and authorization approach,
where online machine learning and trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic
environment and achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish
the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security progressively, so that communication
latency can be reduced and security risks are well-controlled in large-scale IoT. Finally, we outline
several areas for AI-enabled security provisioning for future researches.
