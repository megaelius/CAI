Hyperspectral imaging holds enormous potential to improve the state-of-the-art in aerial vehicle
tracking with low spatial and temporal resolutions. Recently, adaptive multi-modal hyperspectral
sensors, controlled by Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) methodology, have attracted
growing interest due to their ability to record extended data quickly from the aerial platforms.
In this study, we apply popular concepts from traditional object tracking - (1) Kernelized Correlation
Filters (KCF) and (2) Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features - to the hyperspectral aerial
tracking domain. Specifically, we propose the Deep Hyperspectral Kernelized Correlation Filter
based tracker (DeepHKCF) to efficiently track aerial vehicles using an adaptive multi-modal hyperspectral
sensor. We address low temporal resolution by designing a single KCF-in-multiple Regions-of-Interest
(ROIs) approach to cover a reasonable large area. To increase the speed of deep convolutional features
extraction from multiple ROIs, we design an effective ROI mapping strategy. The proposed tracker
also provides flexibility to couple it to the more advanced correlation filter trackers. The DeepHKCF
tracker performs exceptionally with deep features set up in a synthetic hyperspectral video generated
by the Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation (DIRSIG) software. Additionally, we
generate a large, synthetic, single-channel dataset using DIRSIG to perform vehicle classification
in the Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) platform . This way, the high-fidelity of the DIRSIG software
is proved and a large scale aerial vehicle classification dataset is released to support studies
on vehicle detection and tracking in the WAMI platform.
