This paper settles the computational complexity of model checking of several extensions of the
monadic second order (MSO) logic on two classes of graphs: graphs of bounded treewidth and graphs
of bounded neighborhood diversity. A classical theorem of Courcelle states that any graph property
definable in MSO is decidable in linear time on graphs of bounded treewidth. Algorithmic metatheorems
like Courcelle's serve to generalize known positive results on various graph classes. We explore
and extend three previously studied MSO extensions: global and local cardinality constraints
(CardMSO and MSO-LCC) and optimizing the fair objective function (fairMSO). First, we show how
these extensions of MSO relate to each other in their expressive power. Furthermore, we highlight
a certain "linearity" of some of the newly introduced extensions which turns out to play an important
role. Second, we provide parameterized algorithm for the aforementioned structural parameters.
On the side of neighborhood diversity, we show that combining the linear variants of local and global
cardinality constraints is possible while keeping the linear (FPT) runtime but removing linearity
of either makes this impossible. Moreover, we provide a polynomial time (XP) algorithm for the most
powerful of studied extensions, i.e. the combination of global and local constraints. Furthermore,
we show a polynomial time (XP) algorithm on graphs of bounded treewidth for the same extension. In
addition, we propose a general procedure of deriving XP algorithms on graphs on bounded treewidth
via formulation as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). This shows an alternate approach as
compared to standard dynamic programming formulations.
