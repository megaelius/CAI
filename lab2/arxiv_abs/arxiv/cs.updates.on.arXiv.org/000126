The weighted $k$-server problem is a generalization of the $k$-server problem in which the cost
of moving a server of weight $\beta_i$ through a distance $d$ is $\beta_i\cdot d$. The weighted server
problem on uniform spaces models caching where caches have different write costs. We prove tight
bounds on the performance of randomized memoryless algorithms for this problem on uniform metric
spaces. We prove that there is an $\alpha_k$ competitive memoryless algorithm for this problem,
where where $\alpha_k=\alpha_{k-1}^2+3\alpha_{k-1}+1$; $\alpha_1=1$. On the other hand, we
also prove a lower bound result, which is a strong evidence to our conjecture, that no randomized
memoryless algorithm can have competitive ratio better than $\alpha_k$. To prove the upper bound
of $\alpha_k$, we develop a framework to bound from above the competitive ratio of any randomized
memoryless algorithm for this problem. The key technical contribution is a method for working with
potential functions defined implicitly as the solution of a linear system. The result is robust
in the sense that a small change in the probabilities used by the algorithm results in a small change
in the upper bound on the competitive ratio. The above result has two important implications. Firstly
this yields an $\alpha_k$-competitive memoryless algorithm for the weighted $k$-server problem
on uniform spaces. This is the first competitive algorithm for $k>2$ which is memoryless. For
$k=2$, our algorithm agrees with the one given by Chrobak and Sgall. Secondly, this helps us prove
that the Harmonic algorithm, which chooses probabilities in inverse proportion to weights, has
a competitive ratio of $k\alpha_k$.
