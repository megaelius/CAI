COVID-19's rapid global spread has driven innovative tools for Big Data Analytics. These have guided
organizations in all fields of the health industry to track and minimized the effects of virus. Researchers
are required to detect coronaviruses through artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
natural language processing, and to gain a complete understanding of the disease. COVID-19 takes
place in different countries in the world, with which only big data application and the work of NOSQL
databases are suitable. There is a great number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases
model like: Spark, H2O and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous
amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers, especially those that
work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models through different APIs and query. In this
context, this paper proposes a storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF)
for COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus spreading worldwide
by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database, COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and
Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and
query Processing layer. The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides
data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the Connector of the
spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving and retrieving. While the Processing
layer executes the request query and sends results. The proposed framework used three datasets
increased for time for COVID-19 data (COVID-19-Merging, COVID-19-inside-Hubei and COVID-19-ex-Hubei)
to test experiments of this study. The results obtained insure the superiority of the COVID-QF framework.
