The average predictability (aka informativity) of a word in context has been shown to condition
word duration (Seyfarth, 2014). All else being equal, words that tend to occur in more predictable
environments are shorter than words that tend to occur in less predictable environments. One account
of the informativity effect on duration is that the acoustic details of word reduction are stored
as part of a word's representation. Other research has argued that predictability effects are tied
to prosodic structure in integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for
informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two directions; it
investigated informativity effects in another large language, Mandarin Chinese, and broadened
the study beyond word duration to additional acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to
index prosodic prominence. The acoustic information of content words was extracted from a large
telephone conversation speech corpus with over 400,000 tokens and 6,000 word types spoken by 1,655
individuals and analyzed for the effect of informativity using frequency statistics estimated
from a 431 million word subtitle corpus. Results indicated that words with low informativity have
shorter durations, replicating the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant
effects on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic prominence.
Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that informativity is closely linked to
prosodic prominence, and that lexical representation of a word includes phonetic details associated
with its prosodic prominence. In other words, the lexicon absorbs prosodic influences on speech
production.
