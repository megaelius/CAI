This paper analyzes consumer choices over lunchtime restaurants using data from a sample of several
thousand anonymous mobile phone users in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data is used to identify
users' approximate typical morning location, as well as their choices of lunchtime restaurants.
We build a model where restaurants have latent characteristics (whose distribution may depend
on restaurant observables, such as star ratings, food category, and price range), each user has
preferences for these latent characteristics, and these preferences are heterogeneous across
users. Similarly, each item has latent characteristics that describe users' willingness to travel
to the restaurant, and each user has individual-specific preferences for those latent characteristics.
Thus, both users' willingness to travel and their base utility for each restaurant vary across user-restaurant
pairs. We use a Bayesian approach to estimation. To make the estimation computationally feasible,
we rely on variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution, as well as stochastic
gradient descent as a computational approach. Our model performs better than more standard competing
models such as multinomial logit and nested logit models, in part due to the personalization of the
estimates. We analyze how consumers re-allocate their demand after a restaurant closes to nearby
restaurants versus more distant restaurants with similar characteristics, and we compare our
predictions to actual outcomes. Finally, we show how the model can be used to analyze counterfactual
questions such as what type of restaurant would attract the most consumers in a given location.
