The problem of private information retrieval with graph-based replicated storage was recently
introduced by Raviv, Tamo and Yaakobi. Its capacity remains open in almost all cases. In this work
the asymptotic (large number of messages) capacity of this problem is studied along with its generalizations
to include arbitrary $T$-privacy and $X$-security constraints, where the privacy of the user must
be protected against any set of up to $T$ colluding servers and the security of the stored data must
be protected against any set of up to $X$ colluding servers. A general achievable scheme for arbitrary
storage patterns is presented that achieves the rate $(\rho_{\min}-X-T)/N$, where $N$ is the total
number of servers, and each message is replicated at least $\rho_{\min}$ times. Notably, the scheme
makes use of a special structure inspired by dual Generalized Reed Solomon (GRS) codes. A general
converse is also presented. The two bounds are shown to match for many settings, including symmetric
storage patterns. Finally, the asymptotic capacity is fully characterized for the case without
security constraints $(X=0)$ for arbitrary storage patterns provided that each message is replicated
no more than $T+2$ times. As an example of this result, consider PIR with arbitrary graph based storage
($T=1, X=0$) where every message is replicated at exactly $3$ servers. For this $3$-replicated
storage setting, the asymptotic capacity is equal to $2/\nu_2(G)$ where $\nu_2(G)$ is the maximum
size of a $2$-matching in a storage graph $G[V,E]$. In this undirected graph, the vertices $V$ correspond
to the set of servers, and there is an edge $uv\in E$ between vertices $u,v$ only if a subset of messages
is replicated at both servers $u$ and $v$.
