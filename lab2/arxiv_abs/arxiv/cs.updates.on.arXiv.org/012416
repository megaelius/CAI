The recent increase in the availability of system condition monitoring data has lead to increases
in the use of data-driven approaches for fault diagnostics. The accuracy of the fault detection
and classification using these approaches is generally good when abundant labelled data on healthy
and faulty system conditions exists and the diagnosis problem is formulated as a supervised learning
task, i.e. supervised fault diagnosis. It is, however, relatively common in real situations that
only a small fraction of the system condition monitoring data are labeled as healthy and the rest
is unlabeled due to the uncertainty of the number and type of faults that may occur. In this case, supervised
fault diagnosis performs poorly. Fault diagnosis with an unknown number and nature of faults is
an open set learning problem where the knowledge of the faulty system is incomplete during training
and the number and extent of the faults, of different types, can evolve during testing. In this paper,
we propose to formulate the open set diagnostics problem as a semi-supervised learning problem
and we demonstrate how it can be solved using a knowledge-induced learning approach with adaptive
sampling variational autoencoders (KIL-AdaVAE) in combination with a one-class classifier.
The fault detection and segmentation capability of the proposed method is demonstrated on a simulated
case study using the Advanced Geared Turbofan 30000 (AGTF30) dynamical model under real flight
conditions and induced faults of 17 fault types. The performance of the method is compared to the
different learning strategies (supervised learning, supervised learning with embedding and
semi-supervised learning) and deep learning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed
method is able to significantly outperform all other tested methods in terms of fault detection
and fault segmentation.
