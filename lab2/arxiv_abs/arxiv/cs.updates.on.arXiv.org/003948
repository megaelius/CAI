The spinal cord is frequently affected by atrophy and/or lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions from MRI data provides measures of atrophy and lesion
burden, which are key criteria for the diagnosis, prognosis and longitudinal monitoring in MS.
Achieving robust and reliable segmentation across multi-center spinal cord data is challenging
because of the large variability related to acquisition parameters and image artifacts. In particular,
a precise delineation of lesions is hindered by a broad heterogeneity of lesion contrast, size,
location, and shape. The goal of this study was to develop a fully-automatic framework, robust to
variability in both image parameters and clinical condition, for segmentation of the spinal cord
and intramedullary MS lesions from conventional MRI data. 1042 adult subjects (459 healthy controls,
471 MS patients, and 112 with other spinal pathologies) were included in this multi-center study
(n=30 centers). Data spanned 3 contrasts (T1-, T2- and T2*-weighted) for a total of 1943 volumes
and featured large heterogeneity in terms of resolution, orientation, coverage and clinical conditions.
The proposed cord and lesion automatic segmentation approach is based on a cascade of two Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN): a first CNN with 2D dilated convolutions detects the spinal cord centerline
followed by a second 3D CNN that segments the spinal cord and lesions. When compared to a state-of-the-art
spinal cord segmentation method (PropSeg), our CNN-based approach showed a median Dice of 95% vs.
88% for PropSeg. Regarding lesion segmentation, our framework, when compared with manual segmentation
of MS patients, provided a lesion-wise detection sensitivity of 83%, a precision of 77%, a relative
volume difference of 15%, and a Dice of 60%. The proposed framework is open-source and available
in the Spinal Cord Toolbox.
