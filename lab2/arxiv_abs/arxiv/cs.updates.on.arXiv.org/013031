OBJECTIVE: To better understand clinician needs and preferences for the display of pharmacogenomic
(PGx) information in clinical decision support (CDS) tools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed
a semi-structured interview to collect feedback and preferences in six key areas of PGx CDS design,
from clinicians who had prior experience with live PGx CDS tools. Eight clinicians from Northwestern
Medicine's (NM) General Internal Medicine clinic participated in the study. RESULTS: Clinicians
expressed preference for interruptive pop-up alerts during order entry, brief descriptions of
relevant drug-gene interactions, and a clear and specific recommended alternative course of action
when a medication is contraindicated. They did not wish to see detailed genetic data, preferring
phenotypic information predicted from the genotype. Nor did they wish to be interrupted when genetic
test results do not indicate a change in treatment plan. Clinicians reported little familiarity
with Clinical Pharmacogenetic Implementation Consortium prescribing recommendations but reported
trusting recommendations of their professional societies and resources like UpToDate. Analysis
of unstructured comments concurred with structured results, indicating a general uncertainty
among participants around how to interpret and apply PGx information in practice. DISCUSSION:
Results point to several underlying principles that can inform future PGx CDS alert designs: Be
Specific and Actionable; Be Brief; Display Phenotypes not Genotypes; Rely on Sources Clinicians
Already Trust; and, Be Adaptable to Learning Effects. CONCLUSION: This study is part of a broader
socio-technical design approach to PGx CDS design underway at NM and provides a baseline for future
PGx CDS development. Designs based on these results have the potential to improve clinician education
and adherence levels, and to improve patient outcomes.
