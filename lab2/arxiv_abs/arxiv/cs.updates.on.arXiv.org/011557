Most cryptocurrencies rely on Proof-of-Work (PoW) "mining" for resistance to Sybil and double-spending
attacks, as well as a mechanism for currency issuance. Hashcash PoW has successfully secured the
Bitcoin network since its inception, however, as the network has expanded to take on additional
value storage and transaction volume, Bitcoin PoW's heavy reliance on electricity has created
scalability issues, environmental concerns, and systemic risks. Mining efforts have concentrated
in areas with low electricity costs, creating single points of failure. Although PoW security properties
rely on imposing a trivially verifiable economic cost on miners, there is no fundamental reason
for it to consist primarily of electricity cost. The authors propose a novel PoW algorithm, Optical
Proof of Work (oPoW), to eliminate energy as the primary cost of mining. Proposed algorithm imposes
economic difficulty on the miners, however, the cost is concentrated in hardware (capital expense-CAPEX)
rather than electricity (operating expenses-OPEX). The oPoW scheme involves minimal modifications
to Hashcash-like PoW schemes, inheriting safety/security properties from such schemes. Rapid
growth and improvement in silicon photonics over the last two decades has led to the commercialization
of silicon photonic co-processors (integrated circuits that use photons instead of electrons
to perform specialized computing tasks) for low-energy deep learning. oPoW is optimized for this
technology such that miners are incentivized to use specialized, energy-efficient photonics
for computation. Beyond providing energy savings, oPoW has the potential to improve network scalability,
enable decentralized mining outside of low electricity cost areas, and democratize issuance.
Due to the CAPEX dominance of mining costs, oPoW hashrate will be significantly less sensitive to
underlying coin price declines.
