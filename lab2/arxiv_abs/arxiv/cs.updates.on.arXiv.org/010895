Solving optimization problems with parallel algorithms has a long tradition in OR. Its future relevance
for solving hard optimization problems in many fields, including finance, logistics, production
and design, is leveraged through the increasing availability of powerful computing capabilities.
Acknowledging the existence of several literature reviews on parallel optimization, we did not
find reviews that cover the most recent literature on the parallelization of both exact and (meta)heuristic
methods. However, in the past decade substantial advancements in parallel computing capabilities
have been achieved and used by OR scholars so that an overview of modern parallel optimization in
OR that accounts for these advancements is beneficial. Another issue from previous reviews results
from their adoption of different foci so that concepts used to describe and structure prior literature
differ. This heterogeneity is accompanied by a lack of unifying frameworks for parallel optimization
across methodologies, application fields and problems, and it has finally led to an overall fragmented
picture of what has been achieved and still needs to be done in parallel optimization in OR. This review
addresses the aforementioned issues with three contributions: First, we suggest a new integrative
framework of parallel computational optimization across optimization problems, algorithms
and application domains. The framework integrates the perspectives of algorithmic design and
computational implementation of parallel optimization. Second, we apply the framework to synthesize
prior research on parallel optimization in OR, focusing on computational studies published in
the period 2008-2017. Finally, we suggest research directions for parallel optimization in OR.
