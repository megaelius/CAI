Dependency graph, as a heterogeneous graph representing the intrinsic relationships between
different pairs of system entities, is essential to many data analysis applications, such as root
cause diagnosis, intrusion detection, etc. Given a well-trained dependency graph from a source
domain and an immature dependency graph from a target domain, how can we extract the entity and dependency
knowledge from the source to enhance the target? One way is to directly apply a mature dependency
graph learned from a source domain to the target domain. But due to the domain variety problem, directly
using the source dependency graph often can not achieve good performance. Traditional transfer
learning methods mainly focus on numerical data and are not applicable. In this paper, we propose
ACRET, a knowledge transfer based model for accelerating dependency graph learning from heterogeneous
categorical event streams. In particular, we first propose an entity estimation model to filter
out irrelevant entities from the source domain based on entity embedding and manifold learning.
Only the entities with statistically high correlations are transferred to the target domain. On
the surviving entities, we propose a dependency construction model for constructing the unbiased
dependency relationships by solving a two-constraint optimization problem. The experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
ACRET. We also apply ACRET to a real enterprise security system for intrusion detection. Our method
is able to achieve superior detection performance at least 20 days lead lag time in advance with more
than 70% accuracy.
