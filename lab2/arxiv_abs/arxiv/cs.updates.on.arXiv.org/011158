Placement delivery arrays for distributed computing~(Comp-PDAs) have recently been proposed
as a framework to construct computing schemes for MapReduce-like systems. In this work, we extend
this concept to systems with straggling nodes, i.e., to systems where a subset of the nodes cannot
accomplish the assigned map-computations in due time. Unlike most previous works that focused
on computing linear functions, our results apply for arbitrary map and reduce functions. Our contributions
are as follows. Firstly, we show how to construct a distributed computing scheme for MapReduce-like
systems with straggling nodes from any given Comp-PDA satisfying some property. We also caracterize
the storage and communication loads of the resulting scheme in terms of the Comp-PDA parameters.
Then, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the achievable storage-communication (SC) tradeoff,
and show that it matches the performance attained by the Comp-PDAs that correspond to Maddah-Ali
and Niesen's coded caching scheme (the so called MAN-PDAs). Interestingly, the same Comp-PDAs
(the MAN PDAs) are optimal for any number of straggling nodes, which implies that the map-phase of
optimal computing schemes does not need to be adapted to the number of stragglers in the system. We
finally prove that while the points that lie exactly on the optimal SC tradeoff cannot be achieved
with Comp-PDAs that require smaller number of files than the MAN-PDAs, this is possible for some
of the points that lie close to the SC tradeoff. For these latter points, the decrease in the requested
number of files can be exponential in the number of nodes of the system.
