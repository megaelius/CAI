Objective: This paper considers challenges in developing algorithms for accurate segmentation
and classification of heart sound (HS) signals. Methods: We propose an approach based on Markov
switching autoregressive model (MSAR) to segmenting the HS into four fundamental components each
with distinct second-order structure. The identified boundaries are then utilized for automated
classification of pathological HS using the continuous density hidden Markov model (CD-HMM).
The MSAR formulated in a state-space form is able to capture simultaneously both the continuous
hidden dynamics in HS, and the regime switching in the dynamics using a discrete Markov chain. This
overcomes the limitation of HMM which uses a single-layer of discrete states. We introduce three
schemes for model estimation: (1.) switching Kalman filter (SKF); (2.) refined SKF; (3.) fusion
of SKF and the duration-dependent Viterbi algorithm (SKF-Viterbi). Results: The proposed methods
are evaluated on Physionet/CinC Challenge 2016 database. The SKF-Viterbi significantly outperforms
SKF by improvement of segmentation accuracy from 71% to 84.2%. The use of CD-HMM as a classifier and
Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as features can characterize not only the normal
and abnormal morphologies of HS signals but also morphologies considered as unclassifiable (denoted
as X-Factor). It gives classification rates with best gross F1 score of 90.19 (without X-Factor)
and 82.7 (with X-Factor) for abnormal beats. Conclusion: The proposed MSAR approach for automatic
localization and detection of pathological HS shows a noticeable performance on large HS dataset.
Significance: It has potential applications in heart monitoring systems to assist cardiologists
for pre-screening of heart pathologies.
