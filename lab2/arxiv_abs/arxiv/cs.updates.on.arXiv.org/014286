ARINC 429 is the most common data bus in use today in civil avionics. However, the protocol lacks any
form of source authentication. A technician with physical access to the bus is able to replace a transmitter
by a rogue device, and the receivers will accept its malicious data as they have no method of verifying
the authenticity of messages. Updating the protocol would close off security loopholes in new aircraft
but would require thousands of airplanes to be modified. For the interim, until the protocol is replaced,
we propose the first intrusion detection system that utilizes a hardware fingerprinting approach
for sender identification for the ARINC 429 data bus. Our approach relies on the observation that
changes in hardware, such as replacing a transmitter or a receiver with a rogue one, modify the electric
signal of the transmission. Because we rely on the analog properties, and not on the digital content
of the transmissions, we are able to detect a hardware switch as soon as it occurs, even if the data
that is being transmitted is completely normal. Thus, we are able to preempt the attack before any
damage is caused. In this paper we describe the design of our intrusion detection system and evaluate
its performance against different adversary models. Our analysis includes both a theoretical
Markov-chain model and an extensive empirical evaluation. For this purpose, we collected a data
corpus of ARINC 429 data traces, which may be of independent interest since, to the best of our knowledge,
no public corpus is available. We find that our intrusion detection system is quite realistic: e.g.,
it achieves near-zero false alarms per second, while detecting a rogue transmitter in under 50ms,
and detecting a rogue receiver in under 3 seconds. In other words, technician attacks can be reliably
detected during the pre-flight checks, well before the aircraft takes off.
