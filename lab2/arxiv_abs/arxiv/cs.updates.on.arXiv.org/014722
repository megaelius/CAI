Currently, reliable and accurate ship detection in optical remote sensing images is still challenging.
Even the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods cannot obtain very
satisfactory results. To more accurately locate the ships in diverse orientations, some recent
methods conduct the detection via the rotated bounding box. However, it further increases the difficulty
of detection, because an additional variable of ship orientation must be accurately predicted
in the algorithm. In this paper, a novel CNN-based ship detection method is proposed, by overcoming
some common deficiencies of current CNN-based methods in ship detection. Specifically, to generate
rotated region proposals, current methods have to predefine multi-oriented anchors, and predict
all unknown variables together in one regression process, limiting the quality of overall prediction.
By contrast, we are able to predict the orientation and other variables independently, and yet more
effectively, with a novel dual-branch regression network, based on the observation that the ship
targets are nearly rotation-invariant in remote sensing images. Next, a shape-adaptive pooling
method is proposed, to overcome the limitation of typical regular ROI-pooling in extracting the
features of the ships with various aspect ratios. Furthermore, we propose to incorporate multilevel
features via the spatially-variant adaptive pooling. This novel approach, called multilevel
adaptive pooling, leads to a compact feature representation more qualified for the simultaneous
ship classification and localization. Finally, detailed ablation study performed on the proposed
approaches is provided, along with some useful insights. Experimental results demonstrate the
great superiority of the proposed method in ship detection.
