Most recently, with the proliferation of IoT devices, computational nodes in manufacturing systems
IIoT(Industrial-Internet-of-things) and the lunch of 5G networks, there will be millions of connected
devices generating a massive amount of data. In such an environment, the controlling systems need
to be intelligent enough to deal with a vast amount of data to detect defects in a real-time process.
Driven by such a need, artificial intelligence models such as deep learning have to be deployed into
IIoT systems. However, learning and using deep learning models are computationally expensive,
so an IoT device with limited computational power could not run such models. To tackle this issue,
edge intelligence had emerged as a new paradigm towards running Artificial Intelligence models
on edge devices. Although a considerable amount of studies have been proposed in this area, the research
is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose a novel edge-based multi-phase pruning pipelines
to ensemble learning on IIoT devices. In the first phase, we generate a diverse ensemble of pruned
models, then we apply integer quantisation, next we prune the generated ensemble using a clustering-based
technique. Finally, we choose the best representative from each generated cluster to be deployed
to a distributed IoT environment. On CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10, our proposed approach was able to outperform
the predictability levels of a baseline model (up to 7%), more importantly, the generated learners
have small sizes (up to 90% reduction in the model size) that minimise the required computational
capabilities to make an inference on the resource-constraint devices.
