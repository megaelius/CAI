Segmentation of cardiac images, particularly late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(LGE-MRI) widely used for visualizing diseased cardiac structures, is a crucial first step for
clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, direct segmentation of LGE-MRIs is challenging due
to its attenuated contrast. Since most clinical studies have relied on manual and labor-intensive
approaches, automatic methods are of high interest, particularly optimized machine learning
approaches. To address this, we organized the "2018 Left Atrium Segmentation Challenge" using
154 3D LGE-MRIs, currently the world's largest cardiac LGE-MRI dataset, and associated labels
of the left atrium segmented by three medical experts, ultimately attracting the participation
of 27 international teams. In this paper, extensive analysis of the submitted algorithms using
technical and biological metrics was performed by undergoing subgroup analysis and conducting
hyper-parameter analysis, offering an overall picture of the major design choices of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and practical considerations for achieving state-of-the-art left atrium
segmentation. Results show the top method achieved a dice score of 93.2% and a mean surface to a surface
distance of 0.7 mm, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art. Particularly, our analysis
demonstrated that double, sequentially used CNNs, in which a first CNN is used for automatic region-of-interest
localization and a subsequent CNN is used for refined regional segmentation, achieved far superior
results than traditional methods and pipelines containing single CNNs. This large-scale benchmarking
study makes a significant step towards much-improved segmentation methods for cardiac LGE-MRIs,
and will serve as an important benchmark for evaluating and comparing the future works in the field.
