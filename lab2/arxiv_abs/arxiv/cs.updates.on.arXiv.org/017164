A preference profile is single-peaked on a tree if the candidate set can be equipped with a tree structure
so that the preferences of each voter are decreasing from their top candidate along all paths in the
tree. This notion was introduced by Demange (1982), and subsequently Trick (1989) described an
efficient algorithm for deciding if a given profile is single-peaked on a tree. We study the complexity
of multiwinner elections under several variants of the Chamberlin-Courant rule for preferences
single-peaked on trees. We show that the egalitarian version of this problem admits a polynomial-time
algorithm. For the utilitarian version, we prove that winner determination remains NP-hard, even
for the Borda scoring function; however, a winning committee can be found in polynomial time if either
the number of leaves or the number of internal vertices of the underlying tree is bounded by a constant.
To benefit from these positive results, we need a procedure that can determine whether a given profile
is single-peaked on a tree that has additional desirable properties (such as, e.g., a small number
of leaves). To address this challenge, we develop a structural approach that enables us to compactly
represent all trees with respect to which a given profile is single-peaked. We show how to use this
representation to efficiently find the best tree for a given profile for use with our winner determination
algorithms: Given a profile, we can efficiently find a tree with the minimum number of leaves, or
a tree with the minimum number of internal vertices among trees on which the profile is single-peaked.
We also consider several other optimization criteria for trees: for some we obtain polynomial-time
algorithms, while for others we show NP-hardness results.
