In this paper, we present a tube-based framework for robust adaptive model predictive control (RAMPC)
for nonlinear systems subject to parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances. Set-membership
estimation is used to provide accurate bounds on the parametric uncertainty, which are employed
for the construction of the tube in a robust MPC scheme. The resulting RAMPC framework ensures robust
recursive feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction, while allowing for less conservative
operation compared to robust MPC schemes without model/parameter adaptation. Furthermore, by
using an additional mean-squared point estimate in the objective function the framework ensures
finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_2$ stability w.r.t. additive disturbances. As a first contribution
we derive suitable monotonicity and non-increasing properties on general parameter estimation
algorithms and tube/set based RAMPC schemes that ensure robust recursive feasibility and robust
constraint satisfaction under recursive model updates. Then, as the main contribution of this
paper, we provide similar conditions for a tube based formulation that is parametrized using an
incremental Lyapunov function, a scalar contraction rate and a function bounding the uncertainty.
With this result, we can provide simple constructive designs for different RAMPC schemes with varying
computational complexity and conservatism. As a corollary, we can demonstrate that state of the
art formulations for nonlinear RAMPC are a special case of the proposed framework. We provide a numerical
example that demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed framework and showcase improvements
compared to state of the art approaches.
