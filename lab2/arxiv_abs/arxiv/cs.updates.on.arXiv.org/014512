We revisit Min-Mean-Cycle, the classical problem of finding a cycle in a weighted directed graph
with minimum mean weight. Despite an extensive algorithmic literature, previous work falls short
of a near-linear runtime in the number of edges $m$--in fact, there is a natural barrier which precludes
such a runtime for solving Min-Mean-Cycle exactly. Here, we give a much faster approximation algorithm
that, for graphs with polylogarithmic diameter, has near-linear runtime. In particular, this
is the first algorithm whose runtime for the complete graph scales in the number of vertices $n$ as
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$. Moreover--unconditionally on the diameter--the algorithm uses only $O(n)$
memory beyond reading the input, making it "memory-optimal". The algorithm is also simple to implement
and has remarkable practical performance. Our approach is based on solving a linear programming
(LP) relaxation using entropic regularization, which effectively reduces the LP to a Matrix Balancing
problem--a la the popular reduction of Optimal Transport to Matrix Scaling. We then round the fractional
LP solution using a variant of the classical Cycle-Cancelling algorithm that is sped up to near-linear
runtime at the expense of being approximate, and implemented in a memory-optimal manner. We also
provide an alternative algorithm with slightly faster theoretical runtime, albeit worse memory
usage and practicality. This algorithm uses the same rounding procedure, but solves the LP relaxation
by leveraging recent developments in area-convexity regularization. Its runtime scales inversely
in the approximation accuracy, which we show is optimal--barring a major breakthrough in algorithmic
graph theory, namely faster Shortest Paths algorithms.
