Many network services and tools (e.g. network monitors, malware-detection systems, routing and
billing policy enforcement modules in ISPs) depend on identifying the type of traffic that passes
through the network. With the widespread use of mobile devices, the vast diversity of mobile apps,
and the massive adoption of encryption protocols (such as TLS), large-scale traffic classification
becomes inevitable and more difficult. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for mobile
app identification. The proposed model only needs the payload of the first few packets for classification,
and, hence, it is suitable even for applications that rely on early prediction, such as routing and
QoS provisioning. The deep model achieves between 84% to 98% accuracy for the identification of
80 popular apps. We also perform occlusion analysis for the first time to bring insight into what
data is leaked from SSL/TLS protocol that allows accurate app identification. Moreover, our traffic
analysis shows that many apps generate not only app-specific traffic, but also numerous ambiguous
flows. Ambiguous flows are flows generated by common functionality modules, such as advertisement
and traffic analytics. Because such flows are common among many different apps, identifying the
source app that generates ambiguous flows is challenging. To address this challenge, we propose
a CNN+LSTM model that takes adjacent flows to learn the order and pattern of multiple flows, to better
identify the app that generates them. We show that such flow association considerably improves
the accuracy, particularly for ambiguous flows. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust
to mixed traffic scenarios where some unrelated flows may appear in adjacent flows. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that identifies the source app for ambiguous flows.
