Multi-scale spectrum sensing is proposed to overcome the huge cost of full network state information
on the spectrum occupancy of primary users (PUs) in multi-cell dense cognitive networks. Secondary
users (SUs) estimate the local spectrum occupancies and aggregate them hierarchically to estimate
spectrum occupancy at multiple spatial scales. Thus, SUs obtain fine-grained estimates of spectrum
occupancies of nearby cells, more relevant to resource allocation tasks, and coarse-grained estimates
of those of distant cells. This architecture accounts for local estimation errors and delays in
the exchange of state information. An agglomerative clustering algorithm is proposed to design
a cost-effective aggregation tree matched to the irregular structure of interference. Given these
multi-scale estimates, the SU traffic is adapted in a decentralized fashion in each cell, to optimize
the trade-off between SU cell throughput and interference caused to PUs, keeping into account the
mutual SU interference. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves
a small degradation in SU cell throughput (up to 15% under a reference interference-to-noise ratio
of 0dB experienced at PUs) compared to a scheme with full network state information, with one-third
of the cost incurred in the exchange of spectrum estimates. The proposed interference-matched
tree design is shown to significantly outperform a random tree design, by providing more relevant
information for network control, and a state-of-the-art consensus-based algorithm, which does
not leverage the spatio-temporal variations of interference in the network.
