The MaxClique problem, finding the largest complete subgraph in an Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi $G(N,p)$
random graph in the large $N$ limit, is a well-known example of a simple problem for which finding
any approximate solution within a factor of $2$ of the known, probabilistically determined limit,
appears to require P$=$NP. This type of search has practical importance in very large graphs. Algorithmic
approaches run into phase boundaries long before they reach the size of the largest likely solutions.
And, most intriguing, there is an extensive literature of \textit{challenges} posed for concrete
methods of finding maximum naturally occurring as well as artificially hidden cliques, with computational
costs that are at most polynomial in the size of the problem. We use the probabilistic approach in
a novel way to provide a more insightful test of constructive algorithms for this problem. We show
that extensions of existing methods of greedy local search will be able to meet the \textit{challenges}
for practical problems with $N$ as large as $10^{10}$ and perhaps more. Experiments with spectral
methods that treat a single large clique of size $\alpha N^{1/2}$ \textit{planted} in the graph
as an impurity level in a tight binding energy band show that such a clique can be detected when $\alpha
\geq \approx1.0$. Belief propagation using a recent \textit{approximate message passing} (\textbf{AMP})
scheme of inference pushes this limit down to $\alpha \sim \sqrt{1/e}$. Exhaustive local search
(with early stopping when the planted clique is found) does even better on problems of practical
size, and proves to be the fastest solution method for this problem.
