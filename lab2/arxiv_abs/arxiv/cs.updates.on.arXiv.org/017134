Magnetic resonance (MR)-$T_2^*$ mapping is widely used to study hemorrhage, calcification and
iron deposition in various clinical applications, it provides a direct and precise mapping of desired
contrast in the tissue. However, the long acquisition time required by conventional 3D high-resolution
$T_2^*$ mapping method causes discomfort to patients and introduces motion artifacts to reconstructed
images, which limits its wider applicability. In this paper we address this issue by performing
$T_2^*$ mapping from undersampled data using compressive sensing (CS). We formulate the reconstruction
as a nonconvex problem that can be decomposed into two subproblems. They can be solved either separately
via the standard approach or jointly via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Compared to previous CS-based approaches that only apply sparse regularization on the spin density
$\boldsymbol X_0$ and the relaxation rate $\boldsymbol R_2^*$, our formulation enforces additional
sparse priors on the $T_2^*$-weighted images at multiple echoes to improve the reconstruction
performance. We performed convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, evaluated its performance
on in vivo data, and studied the effects of different sampling schemes. Experimental results showed
that the proposed joint-recovery approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art method,
especially in the low-sampling rate regime, making it a preferred choice to perform fast 3D $T_2^*$
mapping in practice. The framework adopted in this work can be easily extended to other problems
arising from MR or other imaging modalities with non-linearly coupled variables.
