Deep learning based medical image classifiers have shown remarkable prowess in various application
areas like ophthalmology, dermatology, pathology, and radiology. However, the acceptance of
these Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems in real clinical setups is severely limited primarily
because their decision-making process remains largely obscure. This work aims at elucidating
a deep learning based medical image classifier by verifying that the model learns and utilizes similar
disease-related concepts as described and employed by dermatologists. We used a well-trained
and high performing neural network developed by REasoning for COmplex Data (RECOD) Lab for classification
of three skin tumours, i.e. Melanocytic Naevi, Melanoma and Seborrheic Keratosis and performed
a detailed analysis on its latent space. Two well established and publicly available skin disease
datasets, PH2 and derm7pt, are used for experimentation. Human understandable concepts are mapped
to RECOD image classification model with the help of Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), introducing
a novel training and significance testing paradigm for CAVs. Our results on an independent evaluation
set clearly shows that the classifier learns and encodes human understandable concepts in its latent
representation. Additionally, TCAV scores (Testing with CAVs) suggest that the neural network
indeed makes use of disease-related concepts in the correct way when making predictions. We anticipate
that this work can not only increase confidence of medical practitioners on CAD but also serve as
a stepping stone for further development of CAV-based neural network interpretation methods.
