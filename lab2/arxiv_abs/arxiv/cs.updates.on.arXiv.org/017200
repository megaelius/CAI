Multimodal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is used routinely in the
assessment of cancer. PET-CT combines the high sensitivity for tumor detection with PET and anatomical
information from CT. Tumor segmentation is a critical element of PET-CT but at present, there is
not an accurate automated segmentation method. Segmentation tends to be done manually by different
imaging experts and it is labor-intensive and prone to errors and inconsistency. Previous automated
segmentation methods largely focused on fusing information that is extracted separately from
the PET and CT modalities, with the underlying assumption that each modality contains complementary
information. However, these methods do not fully exploit the high PET tumor sensitivity that can
guide the segmentation. We introduce a multimodal spatial attention module (MSAM) that automatically
learns to emphasize regions (spatial areas) related to tumors and suppress normal regions with
physiologic high-uptake. The resulting spatial attention maps are subsequently employed to target
a convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation of areas with higher tumor likelihood. Our
MSAM can be applied to common backbone architectures and trained end-to-end. Our experimental
results on two clinical PET-CT datasets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and soft tissue sarcoma
(STS) validate the effectiveness of the MSAM in these different cancer types. We show that our MSAM,
with a conventional U-Net backbone, surpasses the state-of-the-art lung tumor segmentation approach
by a margin of 7.6% in Dice similarity coefficient (DSC).
