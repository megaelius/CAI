In recent years, the electrocardiogram (ECG) has seen a large diffusion in both medical and commercial
applications, fueled by the rise of single-lead versions. Single-lead ECG can be embedded in medical
devices and wearable products such as the injectable Medtronic Linq monitor, the iRhythm Ziopatch
wearable monitor, and the Apple Watch Series 4. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to
automatically analyze ECG tracings, outperforming even physicians specialized in cardiac electrophysiology
in detecting certain rhythm irregularities. However, deep learning classifiers have been shown
to be brittle to adversarial examples, which are examples created to look incontrovertibly belonging
to a certain class to a human eye but contain subtle features that fool the classifier into misclassifying
them into the wrong class. Very recently, adversarial examples have also been created for medical-related
tasks. Yet, traditional attack methods to create adversarial examples, such as projected gradient
descent (PGD) do not extend directly to ECG signals, as they generate examples that introduce square
wave artifacts that are not physiologically plausible. Here, we developed a method to construct
smoothed adversarial examples for single-lead ECG. First, we implemented a neural network model
achieving state-of-the-art performance on the data from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing-in-Cardiology
Challenge for arrhythmia detection from single lead ECG classification. For this model, we utilized
a new technique to generate smoothed examples to produce signals that are 1) indistinguishable
to cardiologists from the original examples and 2) incorrectly classified by the neural network.
Finally, we show that adversarial examples are not unique and provide a general technique to collate
and perturb known adversarial examples to create new ones.
