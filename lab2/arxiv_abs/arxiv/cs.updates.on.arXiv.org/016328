Recognizing surfaces based on their vibration signatures is useful as it can enable tagging of different
locations without requiring any additional hardware such as Near Field Communication (NFC) tags.
However, previous vibration based surface recognition schemes either use custom hardware for
creating and sensing vibration, which makes them difficult to adopt, or use inertial (IMU) sensors
in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphones to sense movements produced due to vibrations,
which makes them coarse-grained because of the low sampling rates of IMU sensors. The mainstream
COTS smartphones based schemes are also susceptible to inherent hardware based irregularities
in vibration mechanism of the smartphones. Moreover, the existing schemes that use microphones
to sense vibration are prone to short-term and constant background noises (e.g. intermittent talking,
exhaust fan, etc.) because microphones not only capture the sounds created by vibration but also
other interfering sounds present in the environment. In this paper, we propose VibroTag, a robust
and practical vibration based sensing scheme that works with smartphones with different hardware,
can extract fine-grained vibration signatures of different surfaces, and is robust to environmental
noise and hardware based irregularities. We implemented VibroTag on two different Android phones
and evaluated in multiple different environments where we collected data from 4 individuals for
5 to 20 consecutive days. Our results show that VibroTag achieves an average accuracy of 86.55% while
recognizing 24 different locations/surfaces, even when some of those surfaces were made of similar
material. VibroTag's accuracy is 37% higher than the average accuracy of 49.25% achieved by one
of the state-of-the-art IMUs based schemes, which we implemented for comparison with VibroTag.
