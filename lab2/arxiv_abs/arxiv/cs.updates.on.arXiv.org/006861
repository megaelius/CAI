In order to meet the performance/privacy requirements of future data-intensive mobile applications,
e.g., self-driving cars, mobile data analytics, and AR/VR, service providers are expected to draw
on shared storage/computation/connectivity resources at the network "edge". To be cost-effective,
a key functional requirement for such infrastructure is enabling the sharing of heterogeneous
resources amongst tenants/service providers supporting spatially varying and dynamic user demands.
This paper proposes a resource allocation criterion, namely, Share Constrained Slicing (SCS),
for slices allocated predefined shares of the network's resources, which extends the traditional
alpha-fairness criterion, by striking a balance among inter- and intra-slice fairness vs. overall
efficiency. We show that SCS has several desirable properties including slice-level protection,
envyfreeness, and load driven elasticity. In practice, mobile users' dynamics could make the cost
of implementing SCS high, so we discuss the feasibility of using a simpler (dynamically) weighted
max-min as a surrogate resource allocation scheme. For a setting with stochastic loads and elastic
user requirements, we establish a sufficient condition for the stability of the associated coupled
network system. Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, we show via extensive simulations that while
SCS (and/or the surrogate weighted max-min allocation) provides inter-slice protection, they
can achieve improved job delay and/or perceived throughput, as compared to other weighted max-min
based allocation schemes whose intra-slice weight allocation is not share-constrained, e.g.,
traditional max-min or discriminatory processor sharing.
