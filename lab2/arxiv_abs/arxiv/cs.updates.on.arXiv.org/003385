In this paper, the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constraints is considered with delayed
channel state information at transmitters (CSIT). We propose a novel secure retrospective interference
alignment scheme in which the transmitters carefully mix information symbols with artificial
noises to ensure confidentiality. Achieving positive secure degrees of freedom (SDoF) is challenging
due to the delayed nature of CSIT, and the distributed nature of the transmitters. Our scheme works
over two phases: phase one in which each transmitter sends information symbols mixed with artificial
noises, and repeats such transmission over multiple rounds. In the next phase, each transmitter
uses delayed CSIT of the previous phase and sends a function of the net interference and artificial
noises (generated in previous phase), which is simultaneously useful for all receivers. These
phases are designed to ensure the decodability of the desired messages while satisfying the secrecy
constraints. We present our achievable scheme for three models, namely: 1) $K$-user interference
channel with confidential messages (IC-CM), and we show that $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -6) $ SDoF
is achievable, 2) $K$-user interference channel with an external eavesdropper (IC-EE), and 3)
$K$-user IC with confidential messages and an external eavesdropper (IC-CM-EE). We show that for
the $K$-user IC-EE, $\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -3) $ SDoF is achievable, and for the $K$-user IC-CM-EE,
$\frac{1}{2} (\sqrt{K} -6) $ is achievable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result
on the $K$-user interference channel with secrecy constrained models and delayed CSIT that achieves
a SDoF which scales with $K$, the number of users.
