Landmark-based human action recognition in videos is a challenging task in computer vision. One
key step is to design a generic approach that generates discriminative features for the spatial
structure and temporal dynamics. To this end, we regard the evolving landmark data as a high-dimensional
path and apply non-linear path signature techniques to provide an expressive, robust, non-linear,
and interpretable representation for the sequential events. We do not extract signature features
from the raw path, rather we propose path disintegrations and path transformations as preprocessing
steps. Path disintegrations turn a high-dimensional path linearly into a collection of lower-dimensional
paths; some of these paths are in pose space while others are defined over a multiscale collection
of temporal intervals. Path transformations decorate the paths with additional coordinates in
standard ways to allow the truncated signatures of transformed paths to expose additional features.
For spatial representation, we apply the signature transform to vectorize the paths that arise
out of pose disintegration, and for temporal representation, we apply it again to describe this
evolving vectorization. Finally, all the features are collected together to constitute the input
vector of a linear single-hidden-layer fully-connected network for classification. Experimental
results on four datasets demonstrated that the proposed feature set with only a linear shallow network
and Dropconnect is effective and achieves comparable state-of-the-art results to the advanced
deep networks, and meanwhile, is capable of interpretation.
