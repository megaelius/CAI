In discrete search and optimization problems where the elements that may or not be included in a solution
correspond to humans, individual fairness needs to be expressed in terms of each individual's satisfaction
probability (the probability of being included in the solution). In this paper we introduce the
maxmin fairness framework which provides, on any given input instance, the strongest guarantee
possible for all individuals, in terms of satisfaction probability. A probability distribution
over valid solutions is maxmin-fair if it is not possible to improve the satisfaction probability
of any individual without decreasing it for some other individual which is no better off. We provide
an efficient exact algorithm for maxmin-fair bipartite matching combining flow-based methods
with algorithms for edge-coloring regular bipartite graphs. As shown in our experimental evaluation,
our algorithm scales to graphs with millions of vertices and hundreds of millions of edges, taking
only a few minutes on a simple architecture. We generalize our method to the case where the structure
of valid solutions forms a matroid, in which case the price of fairness is zero, and show that then
maxmin-fair distributions mini- mize social inequality among Pareto-efficient distributions.
More generally, we prove that a maxmin-fair distribution of solutions to any combinatorial search
problem may be found efficiently under the sole assumption that, given an arbitrary assignment
of non-negative weights to individuals, a maximum-weight solution may be found in polynomial time.
This class of problems extends beyond matchings and matroids, and includes the vast majority of
search problems for which exact algorithms are known.
