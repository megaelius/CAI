Abstract argumentation has emerged as a method for non-monotonic reasoning that has gained tremendous
traction in the symbolic artificial intelligence community. In the literature, the different
approaches to abstract argumentation that were refined over the years are typically evaluated
from a logics perspective; an analysis that is based on models of ideal, rational decision-making
does not exist. In this paper, we close this gap by analyzing abstract argumentation from the perspective
of the rational man paradigm in microeconomic theory. To assess under which conditions abstract
argumentation-based choice functions can be considered economically rational, we define a new
argumentation principle that ensures compliance with the rational man's reference independence
property, which stipulates that a rational agent's preferences over two choice options should
not be influenced by the absence or presence of additional options. We show that the argumentation
semantics as proposed in Dung's classical paper, as well as all of a range of other semantics we evaluate
do not fulfill this newly created principle. Consequently, we investigate how structural properties
of argumentation frameworks impact the reference independence principle, and propose a restriction
to argumentation expansions that allows all of the evaluated semantics to fulfill the requirements
for economically rational argumentation-based choice. For this purpose, we define the rational
man's expansion as a normal and non-cyclic expansion. Finally, we put reference independence into
the context of preference-based argumentation and show that for this argumentation variant, which
explicitly model preferences, the rational man's expansion cannot ensure reference independence.
