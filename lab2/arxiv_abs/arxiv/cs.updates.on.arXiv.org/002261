Turbulence-degraded image frames are distorted by both turbulent deformations and space-time-varying
blurs. To suppress these effects, we propose a multi-frame reconstruction scheme to recover a latent
image from the observed image sequence. Recent approaches are commonly based on registering each
frame to a reference image, by which geometric turbulent deformations can be estimated and a sharp
image can be restored. A major challenge is that a fine reference image is usually unavailable, as
every turbulence-degraded frame is distorted. A high-quality reference image is crucial for the
accurate estimation of geometric deformations and fusion of frames. Besides, it is unlikely that
all frames from the image sequence are useful, and thus frame selection is necessary and highly beneficial.
In this work, we propose a variational model for joint subsampling of frames and extraction of a clear
image. A fine image and a suitable choice of subsample are simultaneously obtained by iteratively
reducing an energy functional. The energy consists of a fidelity term measuring the discrepancy
between the extracted image and the subsampled frames, as well as regularization terms on the extracted
image and the subsample. Different choices of fidelity and regularization terms are explored.
By carefully selecting suitable frames and extracting the image, the quality of the reconstructed
image can be significantly improved. Extensive experiments have been carried out, which demonstrate
the efficacy of our proposed model. In addition, the extracted subsamples and images can be put in
existing algorithms to produce improved results.
