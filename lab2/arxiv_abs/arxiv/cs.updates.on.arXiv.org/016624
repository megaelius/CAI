In this paper we introduce the concept of additive approximation schemes and apply it to load balancing
problems. Additive approximation schemes aim to find a solution with an absolute error in the objective
of at most $\epsilon h$ for some suitable parameter $h$. In the case that the parameter $h$ provides
a lower bound an additive approximation scheme implies a standard multiplicative approximation
scheme and can be much stronger when $h \ll$ OPT. On the other hand, when no PTAS exists (or is unlikely
to exist), additive approximation schemes can provide a different notion for approximation. We
consider the problem of assigning jobs to identical machines with lower and upper bounds for the
loads of the machines. This setting generalizes problems like makespan minimization, the Santa
Claus problem (on identical machines), and the envy-minimizing Santa Claus problem. For the last
problem, in which the objective is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum load,
the optimal objective value may be zero and hence it is NP-hard to obtain any multiplicative approximation
guarantee. For this class of problems we present additive approximation schemes for $h = p_{\max}$,
the maximum processing time of the jobs. Our technical contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce
a new relaxation based on integrally assigning slots to machines and fractionally assigning jobs
to the slots (the slot-MILP). We identify structural properties of (near-)optimal solutions of
the slot-MILP, which allow us to solve it efficiently, assuming that there are $O(1)$ different
lower and upper bounds on the machine loads (which is the relevant setting for the three problems
mentioned above). The second technical contribution is a local-search based algorithm which rounds
a solution to the slot-MILP introducing an additive error on the target load intervals of at most
$\epsilon\cdot p_{\max}$.
