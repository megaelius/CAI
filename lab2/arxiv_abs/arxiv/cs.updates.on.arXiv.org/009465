Electronic control systems are becoming more and more complicated, which makes it difficult to
test them sufficiently only through experiments. Simulation is an efficient way in the development
and testing of complex electronic systems, but the simulation results are always doubtful by people
due to the lack of credible simulation platforms and assessment methods. This paper proposes a credible
simulation platform based on real-time FPGA-based hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation, and
then an assessment method is proposed to quantitatively assess its simulation credibility. By
using the FPGA to simulate all sensor chips, the simulation platform can ensure that the tested electronic
system maintains the same hardware and software operating environment in both simulations and
experiments, which makes it possible to perform the same tests in the simulation platform and the
real experiment to compare and analyze the simulation errors. Then, the testing methods and assessment
indices are proposed to assess the simulation platform from various perspectives, such as performance,
time-domain response, and frequency-domain response. These indices are all normalized to the
same scale (from 0 to 1) and mapped to a uniform assessment criterion, which makes it convenient to
compare and synthesize different assessment indices. Finally, an overall assessment index is
proposed by combining all assessment indices obtained from different tests to assess the simulation
credibility of the whole simulation platform. The simulation platform and the proposed assessment
method are applied to a multicopter system, where the effectiveness and practicability are verified
by simulations and experiments.
