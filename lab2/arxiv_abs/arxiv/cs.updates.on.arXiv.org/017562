Graph burning is a process of information spreading through the network by an agent in discrete steps.
The problem is to find an optimal sequence of nodes which have to be given information so that the network
is covered in least number of steps. Graph burning problem is NP-Hard for which two approximation
algorithms and a few heuristics have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we propose three
heuristics, namely, Backbone Based Greedy Heuristic (BBGH), Improved Cutting Corners Heuristic
(ICCH) and Component Based Recursive Heuristic (CBRH). These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality
measure. BBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily from the vertices
of the backbone. ICCH is a shortest path based heuristic and picks vertex to burn greedily from best
central nodes. The burning number problem on disconnected graphs is harder than on the connected
graphs. For example, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on disjoint paths.
In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and moreover even if the input graph is connected,
during the burning process the graph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected
graphs, ordering of the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected graphs as it prioritizes
the components. All the heuristics have been implemented and tested on several bench-mark networks
including large networks of size more than $50$K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison
to the approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they are much simpler
to implement and also several orders faster than the heuristics proposed in the literature.
