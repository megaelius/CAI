Motivation: Working with a large number of genomes simultaneously is of great interest in genetic
population and comparative genomics research. Bubbles discovery in multi-genomes coloured de
bruijn graph for de novo genome assembly is a problem that can be translated to cycles enumeration
in graph theory. Cycle enumerations algorithms in big and complex de Bruijn graphs are time consuming.
Specialised fast algorithms for efficient bubble search are needed for coloured de bruijn graph
variant calling applications. In coloured de Bruijn graphs, bubble paths coverages are used in
downstream variants calling analysis. Results: In this paper, we introduce a fast parallel graph
search for different K-mer cycle sizes. Coloured path coverages are used for SNP prediction. The
graph search method uses a combined multi-node and multi-core design to speeds up cycles enumeration.
The search algorithm uses an index extracted from the raw assembly of a coloured de Bruijn graph stored
in a hash table. The index is distributed across different CPU-cores, in a shared memory HPC compute
node, to build undirected subgraphs then search independently and simultaneously specific cycle
sizes. This same index can also be split between several HPC compute nodes to take advantage of as
many CPU-cores available to the user. The local neighbourhood parallel search approach reduces
the graph's complexity and facilitate cycles search of a multi-colour de Bruijn graph. The search
algorithm is incorporated into $\Pi$-cyc application and tested on a number of Schizosaccharomyces
Pombe genomes. Availability: $\Pi$-cyc is an open-source software available at www.github.com/2kplus2P
