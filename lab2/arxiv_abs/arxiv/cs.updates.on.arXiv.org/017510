With this contribution, we give a complete and comprehensive framework for modeling the dynamics
of complex mechanical structures as port-Hamiltonian systems. This is motivated by research on
the potential of lightweight construction using active load-bearing elements integrated into
the structure. Such adaptive structures are of high complexity and very heterogeneous in nature.
Port-Hamiltonian systems theory provides a promising approach for their modeling and control.
Subsystem dynamics can be formulated in a domain-independent way and interconnected by means of
power flows. The modular approach is also suitable for robust decentralized control schemes. Starting
from a distributed-parameter port-Hamiltonian formulation of beam dynamics, we show the application
of an existing structure-preserving mixed finite element method to arrive at finite-dimensional
approximations. In contrast to the modeling of single bodies with a single boundary, we consider
complex structures composed of many simple elements interconnected at the boundary. This is analogous
to the usual way of modeling civil engineering structures which has not been transferred to port-Hamiltonian
systems before. A block diagram representation of the interconnected systems is used to generate
coupling constraints which leads to differential algebraic equations of index one. After the elimination
of algebraic constraints, systems in input-state-output(ISO) port-Hamiltonian form are obtained.
Port-Hamiltonian system models for the considered class of systems can also be constructed from
the mass and stiffness matrices obtained via conventional finite element methods. We show how this
relates to the presented approach and discuss the differences, promoting a better understanding
across engineering disciplines.
