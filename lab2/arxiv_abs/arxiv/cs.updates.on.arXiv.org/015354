Numerical simulation is indispensable in industrial design processes. It can replace expensive
experiments and even reduce the need for prototypes. While products designed with the aid of numerical
simulation undergo continuous improvement, this must also be true for numerical simulation itself.
Up to date, no general purpose numerical method is available which can accurately resolve a variety
of physics ranging from fluid to solid mechanics including large deformations and free surface
flow phenomena. These complex multi-physics problems occur for example in Additive Manufacturing
processes. In this sense, the recent developments in Machine Learning display promise for numerical
simulation. It has recently been shown that instead of solving a system of equations as in standard
numerical methods, a neural network can be trained solely based on initial and boundary conditions.
Neural networks are smooth, differentiable functions that can be used as a global ansatz for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). While this idea dates back to more than 20 years ago [Lagaris et al.,
1998], it is only recently that an approach for the solution of time dependent problems has been developed
[Raissi et al., 2019]. With the latter, implicit Runge Kutta schemes with unprecedented high order
have been constructed to solve scalar-valued PDEs. We build on the aforementioned work in order
to develop an Updated Lagrangian method for the solution of incompressible free surface flow subject
to the inviscid Euler equations. The method is easy to implement and does not require any specific
algorithmic treatment which is usually necessary to accurately resolve the incompressibility
constraint. Due to its meshfree character, we will name it the Neural Particle Method (NPM). It will
be demonstrated that the NPM remains stable and accurate even if the location of discretization
points is highly irregular.
