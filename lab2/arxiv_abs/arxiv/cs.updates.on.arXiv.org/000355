In this paper, we study the downlink multi-user scheduling problem for a time-slotted system with
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. In particular, in each time slot, a single
user is scheduled to receive information, while the remaining users opportunistically harvest
the ambient radio frequency (RF) energy. We devise novel scheduling schemes in which the tradeoff
between the users' ergodic capacities and their average amount of harvested energy can be controlled.
To this end, we modify two fair scheduling schemes used in information-only transfer systems. First,
proportionally fair maximum normalized signal-to-noise ratio (N-SNR) scheduling is modified
by scheduling the user having the jth ascendingly ordered (rather than the maximum) N-SNR. We refer
to this scheme as order-based N-SNR scheduling. Second, conventional equal-throughput (ET) fair
scheduling is modified by scheduling the user having the minimum moving average throughput among
the set of users whose N-SNR orders fall into a certain set of allowed orders Sa (rather than the set
of all users). We refer to this scheme as order-based ET scheduling. The feasibility conditions
required for the users to achieve ET with this scheme are also derived. We show that the smaller the
selection order j for the order-based N-SNR scheme, and the lower the orders in Sa for the order-based
ET scheme, the higher the average amount of energy harvested by the users at the expense of a reduction
in their ergodic capacities. We analyze the performance of the considered scheduling schemes for
independent and non-identically distributed (i.n.d.) Ricean fading channels, and provide closed-form
results for the special case of i.n.d. Rayleigh fading.
