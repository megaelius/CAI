Representative subset selection (RSS) is an important tool for users to draw insights from massive
datasets. Existing literature models RSS as the submodular maximization problem to capture the
"diminishing returns" property of the representativeness of selected subsets, but often only
has a single constraint (e.g., cardinality), which limits its applications in many real-world
problems. To capture the data recency issue and support different types of constraints, we formulate
dynamic RSS in data streams as maximizing submodular functions subject to general $d$-knapsack
constraints (SMDK) over sliding windows. We propose a \textsc{KnapWindow} framework (KW) for
SMDK. KW utilizes the \textsc{KnapStream} algorithm (KS) for SMDK in append-only streams as a subroutine.
It maintains a sequence of checkpoints and KS instances over the sliding window. Theoretically,
KW is $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{1+d}$-approximate for SMDK. Furthermore, we propose a \textsc{KnapWindowPlus}
framework (KW$^{+}$) to improve upon KW. KW$^{+}$ builds an index \textsc{SubKnapChk} to manage
the checkpoints and KS instances. \textsc{SubKnapChk} deletes a checkpoint whenever it can be
approximated by its successors. By keeping much fewer checkpoints, KW$^{+}$ achieves higher efficiency
than KW while still guaranteeing a $\frac{1-\varepsilon'}{2+2d}$-approximate solution for
SMDK. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency and solution quality of KW and KW$^{+}$ in real-world
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that KW achieves more than two orders of magnitude
speedups over the batch baseline and preserves high-quality solutions for SMDK over sliding windows.
KW$^{+}$ further runs 5-10 times faster than KW while providing solutions with equivalent or even
better utilities.
