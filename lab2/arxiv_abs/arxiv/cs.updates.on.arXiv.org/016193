In this paper, we provide a new theoretical framework of pyramid Markov processes to solve some open
and fundamental problems of blockchain selfish mining. To this end, we first describe a more general
blockchain selfish mining with both a two-block leading competitive criterion and a new economic
incentive, and establish a pyramid Markov process to express the dynamic behavior of the selfish
mining from both consensus protocol and economic incentive. Then we show that the pyramid Markov
process is stable and so is the blockchain, and its stationary probability vector is matrix-geometric
with an explicitly representable rate matrix. Furthermore, we use the stationary probability
vector to be able to analyze the waste of computational resource due to generating a lot of orphan
(or stale) blocks. Nextly, we set up a pyramid Markov reward process to investigate the long-run
average profits of the honest and dishonest mining pools, respectively. Specifically, we show
that the long-run average profits are multivariate linear such that we can measure the improvement
of mining efficiency of the dishonest mining pool comparing to the honest mining pool. As a by-product,
we build three approximative Markov processes when the system states are described as the block-number
difference of two forked block branches. Also, by using their special cases with non network latency,
we can further provide some useful interpretation for both the Markov chain (Figure 1) and the revenue
analysis ((1) to (3)) of the seminal work by Eyal and Sirer (2014). Finally, we use some numerical
examples to verify the correctness and computability of our theoretical results. We hope that the
methodology and results developed in this paper shed light on the blockchain selfish mining such
that a series of promising research can be produced potentially.
