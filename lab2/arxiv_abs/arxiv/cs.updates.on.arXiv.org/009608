Real-world social networks often exhibit high levels of clustering, positive degree assortativity,
short average path lengths (small-world property) and bounded, which means not scale-free, degree
distributions. At the same time homophily, defined as the propensity of similar agents to connect
to each other, is one of the characteristic features observed in many human and animal societies.
In this paper we examine an extent to which homophily may be considered an important force generating
and structuring social networks. To do so, we conduct a simulation study based on Social Distance
Attachment (SDA) network model in which nodes are embedded in an abstract social space and connection
probabilities depend functionally on distances between nodes. We find that homophily, especially
when combined with random edge rewiring, can reproduce many of the characteristic features of social
networks. Additionally, we devise a hybrid model combining SDA with configuration model that allows
to generate homophily-driven networks with arbitrary degree distributions and we use it to study
interactions of homophily with processes imposing constraints on degree distributions. We show
that the effects of homophily on clustering are robust with respect to distribution constraints,
while degree assortativity can be highly dependent on the particular kind of enforced degree sequence.
Numerical results are additionally enriched with a review of theoretical and/or analytical arguments
supporting both the general geometric approach to social networks and homophily as well as the particular
functional form of the connection probability function assumed in SDA model.
