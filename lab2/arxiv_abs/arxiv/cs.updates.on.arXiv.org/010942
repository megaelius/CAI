As the robot explores the environment, the map grows over time in the simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM) system, especially for the large scale environment. The ever-growing map prevents
long-term mapping. In this paper, we developed a compact cognitive mapping approach inspired by
neurobiological experiments. Inspired from neighborhood cells, neighborhood fields determined
by movement information, i.e. translation and rotation, are proposed to describe one of distinct
segments of the explored environment. The vertices and edges with movement information below the
threshold of the neighborhood fields are avoided adding to the cognitive map. The optimization
of the cognitive map is formulated as a robust non-linear least squares problem, which can be efficiently
solved by the fast open linear solvers as a general problem. According to the cognitive decision-making
of familiar environments, loop closure edges are clustered depending on time intervals, and then
parallel computing is applied to perform batch global optimization of the cognitive map for ensuring
the efficiency of computation and real-time performance. After the loop closure process, scene
integration is performed, in which revisited vertices are removed subsequently to further reduce
the size of the cognitive map. A monocular visual SLAM system is developed to test our approach in
a rat-like maze environment. Our results suggest that the method largely restricts the growth of
the size of the cognitive map over time, and meanwhile, the compact cognitive map correctly represents
the overall layer of the environment as the standard one. Experiments demonstrate that our method
is very suited for compact cognitive mapping to support long-term robot mapping. Our approach is
simple, but pragmatic and efficient for achieving the compact cognitive map.
