Individual pig detection and tracking is an important requirement in many video-based pig monitoring
applications. However, it still remains a challenging task in complex scenes, due to problems of
light fluctuation, similar appearances of pigs, shape deformations and occlusions. To tackle
these problems, we propose a robust real time multiple pig detection and tracking method which does
not require manual marking or physical identification of the pigs, and works under both daylight
and infrared light conditions. Our method couples a CNN-based detector and a correlation filter-based
tracker via a novel hierarchical data association algorithm. The detector gains the best accuracy/speed
trade-off by using the features derived from multiple layers at different scales in a one-stage
prediction network. We define a tag-box for each pig as the tracking target, and the multiple object
tracking is conducted in a key-points tracking manner using learned correlation filters. Under
challenging conditions, the tracking failures are modelled based on the relations between responses
of detector and tracker, and the data association algorithm allows the detection hypotheses to
be refined, meanwhile the drifted tracks can be corrected by probing the tracking failures followed
by the re-initialization of tracking. As a result, the optimal tracklets can sequentially grow
with on-line refined detections, and tracking fragments are correctly integrated into respective
tracks while keeping the original identifications. Experiments with a dataset captured from a
commercial farm show that our method can robustly detect and track multiple pigs under challenging
conditions. The promising performance of the proposed method also demonstrates a feasibility
of long-term individual pig tracking in a complex environment and thus promises a commercial potential.
