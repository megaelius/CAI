An automata network is a finite graph where each node holds a state from some finite alphabet and is
equipped with an update function that changes its state according to the configuration of neighboring
states. More concisely, it is given by a finite map $f:Q^n\rightarrow Q^n$. They are studied using
various update modes: sequential (one node update at a time), asynchronous (any subset of nodes
at a time) or synchronous (all nodes simultaneously). In this paper we study how some (sets of) automata
networks can be simulated by some other (set of) automata networks with prescribed update mode or
interaction graph. For instance, it is known [Cameron-Fairbairn-Gadouleau-2014] that for any
alphabet $Q$ and network size $n$ (with finite exceptions) there is a universal automaton network
$f$ such that any permutation of $Q^n$ is a composition of sequential updates of $f$. However there
is no such universal $f$ for the whole set of transformations. Our contributions are the following.
For non-Boolean alphabets and for any network size, there are intrinsically non-sequential transformations
(that can not be obtained as composition of sequential updates of some network). Moreover there
is no universal automaton network that can produce all non-bijective functions via compositions
of asynchronous updates. On the other hand, we show that there are universal automata networks for
sequential updates if one allows to use a larger alphabet and then use either projection onto or restriction
to the original alphabet. We also characterize the set of functions that are generated by non-bijective
sequential updates. Following [Tchuente-1986], we characterize the interaction graphs $D$ whose
semigroup of transformations is the full semigroup of transformations on $Q^n$, and we show that
they are the same if we force either sequential updates only, or all asynchronous updates.
