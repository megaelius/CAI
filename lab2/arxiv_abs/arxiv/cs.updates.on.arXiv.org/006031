Series elastic actuators (SEAs) support the development of energy-efficient lightweight robotic
systems that interact in uncertain environments. Compared to rigid actuators, SEAs offer a potential
reduction of energy consumption and peak power, though these benefits are highly dependent on the
design of the elastic element. The method of natural dynamics is traditionally used for this design,
but it has two major limitations: arbitrary load trajectories are difficult or impossible to analyze
and it does not consider actuator constraints. Parametric optimization is also a popular design
method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within the space of the
parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric convex optimization problem
for the design of the elastic element such that energy consumption and peak power are minimized for
arbitrary periodic reference trajectories. To obtain convexity, we introduce a convex approximation
to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is shown to be convex without approximation.
The combination of peak power and energy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective
convex optimization framework that comprises the main contribution of the present work. As a case
study, we show the approach can recover the elongation-torque profile of a cubic spring when given
its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs for an ankle prosthesis
that minimize energy consumption and peak power for different trajectories and extend the range
of achievable tasks when subject to actuator constraints.
