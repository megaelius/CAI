A prominent characteristic of write operation in Phase-Change Memory (PCM) is that its latency
and energy are sensitive to the data to be written as well as the content that is overwritten. We observe
that overwriting unknown memory content can incur significantly higher latency and energy compared
to overwriting known all-zeros or all-ones content. This is because all-zeros or all-ones content
is overwritten by programming the PCM cells only in one direction, i.e., using either SET or RESET
operations, not both. In this paper, we propose data content aware PCM writes (DATACON), a new mechanism
that reduces the latency and energy of PCM writes by redirecting these requests to overwrite memory
locations containing all-zeros or all-ones. DATACON operates in three steps. First, it estimates
how much a PCM write access would benefit from overwriting known content (e.g., all-zeros, or all-ones)
by comprehensively considering the number of set bits in the data to be written, and the energy-latency
trade-offs for SET and RESET operations in PCM. Second, it translates the write address to a physical
address within memory that contains the best type of content to overwrite, and records this translation
in a table for future accesses. We exploit data access locality in workloads to minimize the address
translation overhead. Third, it re-initializes unused memory locations with known all-zeros
or all-ones content in a manner that does not interfere with regular read and write accesses. DATACON
overwrites unknown content only when it is absolutely necessary to do so. We evaluate DATACON with
workloads from state-of-the-art machine learning applications, SPEC CPU2017, and NAS Parallel
Benchmarks. Results demonstrate that DATACON significantly improves system performance and
memory system energy consumption compared to the best of performance-oriented state-of-the-art
techniques.
