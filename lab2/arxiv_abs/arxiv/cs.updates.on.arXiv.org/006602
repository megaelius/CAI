The $k$-center problem is a canonical and long-studied facility location and clustering problem
with many applications in both its symmetric and asymmetric forms. Both versions of the problem
have tight approximation factors on worst case instances. Therefore to improve on these ratios,
one must go beyond the worst case. In this work, we take this approach and provide strong positive
results both for the asymmetric and symmetric $k$-center problems under a natural input stability
(promise) condition called $\alpha$-perturbation resilience [Bilu and Linia 2012], which states
that the optimal solution does not change under any alpha-factor perturbation to the input distances.
We provide algorithms that give strong guarantees simultaneously for stable and non-stable instances:
our algorithms always inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation algorithms,
and output the optimal solution if the input is $2$-perturbation resilient. Furthermore, we prove
our result is tight by showing symmetric $k$-center under $(2-\epsilon)$-perturbation resilience
is hard unless $NP=RP$. The impact of our results are multifaceted. This is the first tight result
for any problem under perturbation resilience. Furthermore, our results illustrate a surprising
relationship between symmetric and asymmetric $k$-center instances under perturbation resilience.
Unlike approximation ratio, for which symmetric $k$-center is easily solved to a factor of 2 but
asymmetric $k$-center cannot be approximated to any constant factor, both symmetric and asymmetric
$k$-center can be solved optimally under resilience to 2-perturbations. Finally, our guarantees
in the setting where only part of the data satisfies perturbation resilience makes these algorithms
more applicable to real-life instances.
