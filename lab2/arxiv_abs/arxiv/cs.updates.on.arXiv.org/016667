Deriving disease subtypes from electronic health records (EHRs) can guide next-generation personalized
medicine. However, challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread
practice of scalable EHR-based stratification analysis. Here we present an unsupervised framework
based on deep learning to process heterogeneous EHRs and derive patient representations that can
efficiently and effectively enable patient stratification at scale. We considered EHRs of 1,608,741
patients from a diverse hospital cohort comprising of a total of 57,464 clinical concepts. We introduce
a representation learning model based on word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, and
autoencoders (i.e., ConvAE) to transform patient trajectories into low-dimensional latent vectors.
We evaluated these representations as broadly enabling patient stratification by applying hierarchical
clustering to different multi-disease and disease-specific patient cohorts. ConvAE significantly
outperformed several baselines in a clustering task to identify patients with different complex
conditions, with 2.61 entropy and 0.31 purity average scores. When applied to stratify patients
within a certain condition, ConvAE led to various clinically relevant subtypes for different disorders,
including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, largely related to comorbidities,
disease progression, and symptom severity. With these results, we demonstrate that ConvAE can
generate patient representations that lead to clinically meaningful insights. This scalable
framework can help better understand varying etiologies in heterogeneous sub-populations and
unlock patterns for EHR-based research in the realm of personalized medicine.
