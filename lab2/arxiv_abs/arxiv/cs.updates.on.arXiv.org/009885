While simulations have been utilized in diverse domains, such as urban growth modeling, market
dynamics modeling, etc; some of these applications may require validations based upon some real-world
observations modeled in the simulation, as well. This validation has been categorized into either
qualitative face-validation or quantitative empirical validation, but as the importance and
the accumulation of data grows, the importance of the quantitative validation has been highlighted
in the recent studies, i.e. digital twin. The key component of quantitative validation is finding
a calibrated set of parameters to regenerate the real-world observations with simulation models.
While this parameter calibration has been fixed throughout a simulation execution, this paper
expands the static parameter calibration in two dimensions: dynamic calibration and heterogeneous
calibration. First, dynamic calibration changes the parameter values over the simulation period
by reflecting the simulation output trend. Second, heterogeneous calibration changes the parameter
values per simulated entity clusters by considering the similarities of entity states. We experimented
the suggested calibrations on one hypothetical case and another real-world case. As a hypothetical
scenario, we use the Wealth Distribution Model to illustrate how our calibration works. As a real-world
scenario, we selected Real Estate Market Model because of three reasons. First, the models have
heterogeneous entities as being agent-based models; second, they are economic models with real-world
trends over time; and third, they are applicable to the real-world scenarios where we can gather
validation data.
