Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenged by uncontrollable, large, and irregular
fetal movements. Fetal MRI is performed in a fully interactive manner in which a technologist monitors
motion to prescribe slices in right angles with respect to the anatomy of interest. Current practice
involves repeated acquisitions to ensure diagnostic-quality images are acquired; and the scans
are retrospectively registered slice-by-slice to reconstruct 3D images. Nonetheless, manual
monitoring of 3D fetal motion based on displayed 2D slices and navigation at the level of stacks-of-slices
(instead of slices) is sub-optimal and inefficient. The current process is highly operator-dependent,
requires extensive training, and significantly increases the length of fetal MRI scans which makes
them difficult for pregnant women, and costly. With that motivation, we presented a new real-time
image-based motion tracking technique in MRI using deep learning that can significantly improve
state of the art. Through a combination of spatial and temporal encoder-decoder networks, our system
learns to predict 3D pose of the fetal head based on dynamics of motion inferred directly from sequences
of acquired slices. Compared to recent works that estimate static 3D pose of the subject from slices,
our method learns to predict dynamics of 3D motion. We compared our trained network on held-out test
sets (including data with different characteristics, e.g. different age ranges, and motion trajectories
recorded from volunteer subjects) with networks designed for estimation as well as methods adopted
to make predictions. The results of all estimation and prediction tasks show that we achieved reliable
motion tracking in fetal MRI. This technique can be augmented with deep learning based fast anatomy
detection, segmentation, and image registration techniques to build real-time motion tracking
and navigation systems.
