In the classic polyline simplification problem we want to replace a given polygonal curve $P$, consisting
of $n$ vertices, by a subsequence $P'$ of $k$ vertices from $P$ such that the polygonal curves $P$
and $P'$ are as close as possible. Closeness is usually measured using the Hausdorff or Fr\'echet
distance. These distance measures can be applied "globally", i.e., to the whole curves $P$ and $P'$,
or "locally", i.e., to each simplified subcurve and the line segment that it was replaced with separately
(and then taking the maximum). This gives rise to four problem variants: Global-Hausdorff (known
to be NP-hard), Local-Hausdorff (in time $O(n^3)$), Global-Fr\'echet (in time $O(k n^5)$), and
Local-Fr\'echet (in time $O(n^3)$). Our contribution is as follows. - Cubic time for all variants:
For Global-Fr\'echet we design an algorithm running in time $O(n^3)$. This shows that all three
problems (Local-Hausdorff, Local-Fr\'echet, and Global-Fr\'echet) can be solved in cubic time.
All these algorithms work over a general metric space such as $(\mathbb{R}^d,L_p)$, but the hidden
constant depends on $p$ and (linearly) on $d$. - Cubic conditional lower bound: We provide evidence
that in high dimensions cubic time is essentially optimal for all three problems (Local-Hausdorff,
Local-Fr\'echet, and Global-Fr\'echet). Specifically, improving the cubic time to $O(n^{3-\epsilon}
\textrm{poly}(d))$ for polyline simplification over $(\mathbb{R}^d,L_p)$ for $p = 1$ would violate
plausible conjectures. We obtain similar results for all $p \in [1,\infty), p \ne 2$. In total, in
high dimensions and over general $L_p$-norms we resolve the complexity of polyline simplification
with respect to Local-Hausdorff, Local-Fr\'echet, and Global-Fr\'echet, by providing new algorithms
and conditional lower bounds.
