With the advent of consumer-grade products for presenting an immersive virtual environment (VE),
there is a growing interest in utilizing VEs for testing human navigation behavior. However, preparing
a VE still requires a high level of technical expertise in computer graphics and virtual reality,
posing a significant hurdle to embracing the emerging technology. To address this issue, this paper
presents Delayed Feedback based Immersive Navigation Environment (DeFINE), a framework that
allows for easy creation and administration of navigation tasks within customizable VEs via intuitive
graphical user interfaces and simple settings files. Importantly, DeFINE has a built-in capability
to provide performance feedback to participants during an experiment, a feature that is critically
missing in other similar frameworks. To demonstrate the usability of DeFINE from both experimentalists'
and participants' perspectives, a case study was conducted in which participants navigated to
a hidden goal location with feedback that differentially weighted speed and accuracy of their responses.
In addition, the participants evaluated DeFINE in terms of its ease of use, required workload, and
proneness to induce cybersickness. Results showed that the participants' navigation performance
was affected differently by the types of feedback they received, and they rated DeFINE highly in
the evaluations, validating DeFINE's architecture for investigating human navigation in VEs.
With its rich out-of-the-box functionality and great customizability due to open-source licensing,
DeFINE makes VEs significantly more accessible to many researchers.
