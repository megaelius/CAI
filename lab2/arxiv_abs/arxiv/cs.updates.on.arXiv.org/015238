Modern decision-making in fixed income asset management benefits from intelligent systems, which
involve the use of state-of-the-art machine learning models and appropriate methodologies. We
conduct the first study of bond yield forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks,
validating its potential and identifying its memory advantage. Specifically, we model the 10-year
bond yield using univariate LSTMs with three input sequences and five forecasting horizons. We
compare those with multilayer perceptrons (MLP), univariate and with the most relevant features.
To demystify the notion of black box associated with LSTMs, we conduct the first internal study of
the model. To this end, we calculate the LSTM signals through time, at selected locations in the memory
cell, using sequence-to-sequence architectures, uni and multivariate. We then proceed to explain
the states' signals using exogenous information, for what we develop the LSTM-LagLasso methodology.
The results show that the univariate LSTM model with additional memory is capable of achieving similar
results as the multivariate MLP using macroeconomic and market information. Furthermore, shorter
forecasting horizons require smaller input sequences and vice-versa. The most remarkable property
found consistently in the LSTM signals, is the activation/deactivation of units through time,
and the specialisation of units by yield range or feature. Those signals are complex but can be explained
by exogenous variables. Additionally, some of the relevant features identified via LSTM-LagLasso
are not commonly used in forecasting models. In conclusion, our work validates the potential of
LSTMs and methodologies for bonds, providing additional tools for financial practitioners.
