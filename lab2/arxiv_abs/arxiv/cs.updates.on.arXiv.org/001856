Bilateral trade is a fundamental economic scenario comprising a strategically acting buyer and
seller, each holding valuations for the item, drawn from publicly known distributions. A mechanism
is supposed to facilitate trade between these agents, if such trade is beneficial. It was recently
shown that the only mechanisms that are simultaneously DSIC, SBB, and ex-post IR, are fixed price
mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are parametrised by a price p, and trade occurs if and only if the
valuation of the buyer is at least p and the valuation of the seller is at most p. The gain from trade
is the increase in welfare that results from applying a mechanism; here we study the gain from trade
achievable by fixed price mechanisms. We explore this question for both the bilateral trade setting,
and a double auction setting where there are multiple buyers and sellers. We first identify a fixed
price mechanism that achieves a gain from trade of at least 2/r times the optimum, where r is the probability
that the seller's valuation does not exceed the buyer's valuation. This extends a previous result
by McAfee. Subsequently, we improve this approximation factor in an asymptotic sense, by showing
that a more sophisticated rule for setting the fixed price results in an expected gain from trade
within a factor O(log(1/r)) of the optimal gain from trade. This is asymptotically the best approximation
factor possible. Lastly, we extend our study of fixed price mechanisms to the double auction setting
defined by a set of multiple i.i.d. unit demand buyers, and i.i.d. unit supply sellers. We present
a fixed price mechanism that achieves a gain from trade that achieves for all epsilon > 0 a gain from
trade of at least (1-epsilon) times the expected optimal gain from trade with probability 1 - 2/e^{#T
epsilon^2 /2}, where #T is the expected number of trades resulting from the double auction.
