Purpose: To present a method that automatically detects and quantifies abnormal tomographic patterns
commonly present in COVID-19, namely Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) and consolidations. Given that
high opacity abnormalities (i.e., consolidations) were shown to correlate with severe disease,
the paper introduces two combined severity measures (Percentage of Opacity, Percentage of High
Opacity) and (Lung Severity Score, Lung High Opacity Score). They quantify the extent of overall
COVID-19 abnormalities and the presence of high opacity abnormalities, global and lobe-wise,
respectively, being computed based on 3D segmentations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Materials
and Methods: The proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted Chest CT and segments the lesions,
lungs, and lobes in 3D. It outputs two combined measures of the severity of lung/lobe involvement,
quantifying both the extent of COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on
deep learning and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure (POO, POHO) is global, while the
second (LSS, LHOS) is lobe-wise. Evaluation is reported on CTs of 100 subjects (50 COVID-19 confirmed
and 50 controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and US. Ground truth is established by manual
annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Results: Pearson Correlation Coefficient between method
prediction and ground truth is 0.97 (POO), 0.98 (POHO), 0.96 (LSS), 0.96 (LHOS). Automated processing
time to compute the severity scores is 10 seconds/case vs 30 mins needed for manual annotations.
Conclusion: A new method identifies regions of abnormalities seen in COVID-19 non-contrasted
Chest CT and computes (POO, POHO) and (LSS, LHOS) severity scores.
