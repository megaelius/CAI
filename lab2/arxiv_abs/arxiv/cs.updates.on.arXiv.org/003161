An obstacle representation of a graph is a mapping of the vertices onto points in the plane and a set
of connected regions of the plane (called obstacles) such that the straight-line segment connecting
the points corresponding to two vertices does not intersect any obstacles if and only if the vertices
are adjacent in the graph. The obstacle representation and its plane variant (in which the resulting
representation is a plane straight-line embedding of the graph) have been extensively studied
with the main objective of minimizing the number of obstacles. Recently, Biedl and Mehrabi (GD 2017)
studied grid obstacle representations of graphs in which the vertices of the graph are mapped onto
the points in the plane while the straight-line segments representing the adjacency between the
vertices is replaced by the $L_1$ (Manhattan) shortest paths in the plane that avoid obstacles.
In this paper, we introduce the notion of geodesic obstacle representations of graphs with the main
goal of providing a generalized model, which comes naturally when viewing line segments as shortest
paths in the Euclidean plane. To this end, we extend the definition of obstacle representation by
allowing some obstacles-avoiding shortest path between the corresponding points in the underlying
metric space whenever the vertices are adjacent in the graph. We consider both general and plane
variants of geodesic obstacle representations (in a similar sense to obstacle representations)
under any polyhedral distance function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as shortest path distances in
graphs. Our results generalize and unify the notions of obstacle representations, plane obstacle
representations and grid obstacle representations, leading to a number of questions on such embeddings.
