This work proposes a distributed power allocation scheme for maximizing energy efficiency in the
uplink of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based heterogeneous networks
(HetNets). The user equipment (UEs) in the network are modeled as rational agents that engage in
a non-cooperative game where each UE allocates its available transmit power over the set of assigned
subcarriers so as to maximize its individual utility (defined as the user's throughput per Watt
of transmit power) subject to minimum-rate constraints. In this framework, the relevant solution
concept is that of Debreu equilibrium, a generalization of Nash equilibrium which accounts for
the case where an agent's set of possible actions depends on the actions of its opponents. Since the
problem at hand might not be feasible, Debreu equilibria do not always exist. However, using techniques
from fractional programming, we provide a characterization of equilibrial power allocation profiles
when they do exist. In particular, Debreu equilibria are found to be the fixed points of a water-filling
best response operator whose water level is a function of minimum rate constraints and circuit power.
Moreover, we also describe a set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Debreu
equilibria exploiting the contraction properties of the best response operator. This analysis
provides the necessary tools to derive a power allocation scheme that steers the network to equilibrium
in an iterative and distributed manner without the need for any centralized processing. Numerical
simulations are then used to validate the analysis and assess the performance of the proposed algorithm
as a function of the system parameters.
