We present a framework for random access that is based on three elements: physical-layer network
coding (PLNC), signature codes and tree splitting. In presence of a collision, physical-layer
network coding enables the receiver to decode, i.e. compute, the sum of the packets that were transmitted
by the individual users. For each user, the packet consists of the user's signature, as well as the
data that the user wants to communicate. As long as no more than K users collide, their identities
can be recovered from the sum of their signatures. This framework for creating and transmitting
packets can be used as a fundamental building block in random access algorithms, since it helps to
deal efficiently with the uncertainty of the set of contending terminals. In this paper we show how
to apply the framework in conjunction with a tree-splitting algorithm, which is required to deal
with the case that more than K users collide. We demonstrate that our approach achieves throughput
that tends to 1 rapidly as K increases. We also present results on net data-rate of the system, showing
the impact of the overheads of the constituent elements of the proposed protocol. We compare the
performance of our scheme with an upper bound that is obtained under the assumption that the active
users are a priori known. Also, we consider an upper bound on the net data-rate for any PLNC based strategy
in which one linear equation per slot is decoded. We show that already at modest packet lengths, the
net data-rate of our scheme becomes close to the second upper bound, i.e. the overhead of the contention
resolution algorithm and the signature codes vanishes.
