Human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data has been an attractive research topic
due to its application in areas such as healthcare and smart environments. In this context, many
works have presented remarkable results using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data
to represent the activities categories. However, current studies do not consider important issues
that lead to skewed results, making it hard to assess the quality of sensor-based human activity
recognition and preventing a direct comparison of previous works. These issues include the samples
generation processes and the validation protocols used. We emphasize that in other research areas,
such as image classification and object detection, these issues are already well-defined, which
brings more efforts towards the application. Inspired by this, we conduct an extensive set of experiments
that analyze different sample generation processes and validation protocols to indicate the vulnerable
points in human activity recognition based on wearable sensor data. For this purpose, we implement
and evaluate several top-performance methods, ranging from handcrafted-based approaches to
convolutional neural networks. According to our study, most of the experimental evaluations that
are currently employed are not adequate to perform the activity recognition in the context of wearable
sensor data, in which the recognition accuracy drops considerably when compared to an appropriate
evaluation approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that tackles essential
issues that compromise the understanding of the performance in human activity recognition based
on wearable sensor data.
