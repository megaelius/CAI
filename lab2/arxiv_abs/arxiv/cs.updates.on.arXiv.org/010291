The evolution of modern voice controlled devices (VCDs) in recent years has revolutionized the
Internet of Things, and resulted in increased realization of smart homes, personalization and
home automation through voice commands. The introduction of VCDs in IoT is expected to give emergence
of new subfield of IoT, called Multimedia of Thing (MoT). These VCDs can be exploited in IoT driven
environment to generate various spoofing attacks including the replays. Replay attacks are generated
through replaying the recorded audio of legitimate human speaker with the intent of deceiving the
VCDs having speaker verification system. The connectivity among the VCDs can easily be exploited
in IoT driven environment to generate a chain of replay attacks (multi-order replay attacks). Existing
spoofing detection datasets like ASVspoof and ReMASC contain only the first-order replay recordings
against the bonafide audio samples. These datasets can not offer evaluation of the anti-spoofing
algorithms capable of detecting the multi-order replay attacks. Additionally, these datasets
do not capture the characteristics of microphone arrays, which is an important characteristic
of modern VCDs. We need a diverse replay spoofing detection corpus that consists of multi-order
replay recordings against the bonafide voice samples. This paper presents a novel voice spoofing
detection corpus (VSDC) to evaluate the performance of multi-order replay anti-spoofing methods.
The proposed VSDC consists of first and second-order-replay samples against the bonafide audio
recordings. Additionally, the proposed VSDC can also be used to evaluate the performance of speaker
verification systems as our corpus includes the audio samples of fifteen different speakers. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available replay spoofing detection corpus
comprising of first-order and second-order-replay samples.
