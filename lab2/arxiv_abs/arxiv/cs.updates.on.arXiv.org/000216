We study arithmetic proof systems P_c(F) and P_f(F) operating with arithmetic circuits and arithmetic
formulas, respectively, that prove polynomial identities over a field F. We establish a series
of structural theorems about these proof systems, the main one stating that P_c(F) proofs can be
balanced: if a polynomial identity of syntactic degree d and depth k has a P_c(F) proof of size s, then
it also has a P_c(F) proof of size poly(s,d) and depth O(k+\log^2 d + \log d\cd \log s). As a corollary,
we obtain a quasipolynomial simulation of P_c(F) by P_f(F), for identities of a polynomial syntactic
degree. Using these results we obtain the following: consider the identities det(XY) = det(X)det(Y)
and det(Z)= z_{11}... z_{nn}, where X,Y and Z are nxn square matrices and Z is a triangular matrix
with z_{11},..., z_{nn} on the diagonal (and det is the determinant polynomial). Then we can construct
a polynomial-size arithmetic circuit det such that the above identities have P_c(F) proofs of polynomial-size
and O(\log^2 n) depth. Moreover, there exists an arithmetic formula det of size n^{O(\log n)} such
that the above identities have P_f(F) proofs of size n^{O(\log n)}. This yields a solution to a basic
open problem in propositional proof complexity, namely, whether there are polynomial-size NC^2-Frege
proofs for the determinant identities and the hard matrix identities, as considered, e.g., in Soltys
and Cook (2004) (cf., Beame and Pitassi (1998)). We show that matrix identities like AB=I {\to} BA=I
(for matrices over the two element field) as well as basic properties of the determinant have polynomial-size
NC^2-Frege proofs, and quasipolynomial-size Frege proofs.
