Vehicle electronic systems currently utilize wired networks for power delivery (from the main
battery) and communication (e.g., LIN, CAN, FlexRay) between nodes. Wired networks cannot practically
accommodate nodes in moving parts (e.g., tires) and with the increasing functional complexity
in vehicles, they require kilometer-long harnesses, significantly increasing fuel consumption
and manufacturing and design costs. As an alternative, energy harvesting intra-vehicular wireless
sensor networks (IVWSN) can accommodate nodes in all locations and they obviate the need for wiring,
significantly lowering costs. In this paper, we empirically analyze the feasibility of such an
IVWSN framework via extensive in-vehicle measurements for communications at 2.4 GHz, ultra wideband
(UWB) and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies together with radio frequency (RF), thermal and
vibration energy harvesting. Our analyses show that mmWave performs best for short line-of-sight
(LoS) links in the engine compartment with performance close to UWB for LoS links in the chassis and
passenger compartments in terms of worst case signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio. For
non-LoS links, which appear especially more in the engine compartment and chassis, UWB provides
the highest security and reliability. 2.4 GHz suffers heavily from interference in all compartments
while UWB utilizes narrowband suppression techniques at the cost of lower bandwidth; mmWave inherently
experiences very low interference due to its propagation characteristics. On the other hand, RF
energy harvesting provides up to 1 mW of power in all compartments. Vibration and thermal energy
harvesters can supply all nodes consuming <10 mW in the engine compartment and all <5 mW nodes in the
chassis. In the passenger compartment, thermal harvesting is not available due to low temperature
gradients but vibration and RF sources can supply <1 mW nodes.
