The concept of matrix rigidity was first introduced by Valiant in [Val77]. Roughly speaking, a matrix
is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly by changing a small number of entries. There
has been extensive interest in rigid matrices as Valiant showed that rigidity can be used to prove
arithmetic circuit lower bounds. In a surprising result, Alman and Williams [AW16] showed that
the (real valued) Hadamard matrix, which was conjectured to be rigid, is actually not very rigid.
This line of work was extended by [DE17] to a family of matrices related to the Hadamard matrix, but
over finite fields. In our work, we take another step in this direction and show that for any abelian
group $G$ and function $f:G \rightarrow \mathbb C$, the matrix given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y
\in G$ is not rigid. In particular, we get that complex valued Fourier matrices, circulant matrices,
and Toeplitz matrices are all not rigid and cannot be used to carry out Valiant's approach to proving
circuit lower bounds. This complements a recent result of Goldreich and Tal who showed that Toeplitz
matrices are nontrivially rigid (but not enough for Valiant's method). Our work differs from previous
non-rigidity results in that those works considered matrices whose underlying group of symmetries
was of the form $\mathbb F_p^n$ with $p$ fixed and $n$ tending to infinity, while in the families of
matrices we study, the underlying group of symmetries can be any abelian group and, in particular
cyclic groups which have very different structure. Our results also suggest natural new candidates
for rigidity in the form of matrices whose symmetry groups are highly non-abelian.
