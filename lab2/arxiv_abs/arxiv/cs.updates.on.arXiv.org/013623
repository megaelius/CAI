This paper introduces two subcycling algorithms for particle orbits in variational, geometric
particle-in-cell methods that address the Vlasov--Maxwell system in magnetized plasmas. The
purpose of subcycling is to allow for time steps in the global field solves at or longer than the gyroperiod
time scale while sampling the local particle cyclotron orbits accurately. Both algorithms retain
the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the discrete action, guaranteeing a local charge conservation
law, and the variational approach provides a bounded long-time energy behavior. In the first algorithm,
the global field solves are explicit and the local particle push implicit for each particle individually.
The requirement for gauge invariance leads to a peculiar subcycling scheme where the magnetic field
is orbit-averaged and the effect of the electric field on the particle orbits is evaluated once during
the sybcycling period. Numerical tests with this algorithm indicate that artificial oscillations
may occur if the relative electric field impulse on the particles grows large. The oscillations
are observed to vanish if orbit-averaging is enforced also for the electric field but then the variational
particle push is lost. The second algorithm, a fully implicit one, is proposed to remedy the possible
issues of the semi-explicit algorithm. It is observed that both magnetic and electric field can
be orbit-averaged, the gauge invariance and consequently the charge conservation retained, while
the algorithm remains variational. These requirements, however, appear to require a fully implicit
approach. Numerical experiments with and adaptive time-step control for the implicit scheme are
left for a future study.
