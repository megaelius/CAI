The paper is devoted to the approximate consensus problem for networks of nonlinear agents with
switching topology, noisy and delayed measurements. In contrast to the existing stochastic approximation-based
control algorithms (protocols), a local voting protocol with nonvanishing step size is proposed.
Nonvanishing (e.g., constant) step size protocols give the opportunity to achieve better convergence
rate (by choosing proper step sizes) in coping with time-varying loads and agent states. The price
to pay is replacement of the mean square convergence with an approximate one. To analyze dynamics
of the closed loop system, the so-called method of averaged models is used. It allows to reduce analysis
complexity of the closed loop system. In this paper the upper bounds for mean square distance between
the initial system and its approximate averaged model are proposed. The proposed upper bounds are
used to obtain conditions for approximate consensus achievement. The method is applied to the load
balancing problem in stochastic dynamic networks with incomplete information about the current
states of agents and with changing set of communication links. The load balancing problem is formulated
as consensus problem in noisy model with switched topology. The conditions to achieve the optimal
level of load balancing (in the sense that if no new task arrives, all agents will finish at the same
time) are obtained. The performance of the system is evaluated analytically and by simulation.
It is shown that the performance of the adaptive multi-agent strategy with the redistribution of
tasks among "connected" neighbors is significantly better than the performance without redistribution.
The obtained results are important for control of production networks, multiprocessor, sensor
or multicomputer networks, etc.
