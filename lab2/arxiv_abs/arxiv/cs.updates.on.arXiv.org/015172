Robotic grasping plays an important role in the field of robotics. The current state-of-the-art
robotic grasping detection systems are usually built on the conventional vision, such as RGB-D
camera. Compared to traditional frame-based computer vision, neuromorphic vision is a small and
young community of research. Currently, there are limited event-based datasets due to the troublesome
annotation of the asynchronous event stream. Annotating large scale vision dataset often takes
lots of computation resources, especially the troublesome data for video-level annotation. In
this work, we consider the problem of detecting robotic grasps in a moving camera view of a scene containing
objects. To obtain more agile robotic perception, a neuromorphic vision sensor (DAVIS) attaching
to the robot gripper is introduced to explore the potential usage in grasping detection. We construct
a robotic grasping dataset named Event-Stream Dataset with 91 objects. A spatio-temporal mixed
particle filter (SMP Filter) is proposed to track the led-based grasp rectangles which enables
video-level annotation of a single grasp rectangle per object. As leds blink at high frequency,
the Event-Stream dataset is annotated in a high frequency of 1 kHz. Based on the Event-Stream dataset,
we develop a deep neural network for grasping detection which consider the angle learning problem
as classification instead of regression. The method performs high detection accuracy on our Event-Stream
dataset with 93% precision at object-wise level. This work provides a large-scale and well-annotated
dataset, and promotes the neuromorphic vision applications in agile robot.
