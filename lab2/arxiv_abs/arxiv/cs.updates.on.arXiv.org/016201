Secure delegated quantum computing allows a computationally weak client to outsource an arbitrary
quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the promising
candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote
state preparation ($RSP_{CC}$), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical
channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing $RSP_{CC}$ as a sub-module is unclear.
In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer
and Renner (ICS'11). We first identify the goal of $RSP_{CC}$ as the construction of ideal RSP resources
from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using $RSP_{CC}$. First, we
uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources (from classical
channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal RSP resource
must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated
quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the
realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible
due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific $RSP_{CC}$
protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum
Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al. (FOCS '09). However, we show that the resulting UBQC
protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as $RSP_{CC}$ is used as a subroutine.
Third, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the above UBQC protocol by the $RSP_{CC}$ protocol
QFactory of Cojocaru et al. (Asiacrypt '19), preserves the weaker, game-based, security of UBQC.
