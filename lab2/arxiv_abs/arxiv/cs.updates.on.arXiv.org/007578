Networks of dyadic relationships between entities have emerged as a dominant paradigm for modeling
complex systems. Many empirical "networks" -- such as collaboration networks; co-occurrence
networks; and communication networks -- are intrinsically polyadic, with multiple entities interacting
simultaneously. Historically, such polyadic data has been represented dyadically via a standard
projection operation. While convenient, this projection often has unintended and uncontrolled
impact on downstream analysis, especially null hypothesis-testing. In this work, we develop a
class of random null models for polyadic data in the framework of hypergraphs, therefore circumventing
the need for projection. The null models we define are uniform on the space of hypergraphs sharing
common degree and edge dimension sequences, and thus provide direct generalizations of the classical
configuration model of network science. We also derive Metropolis-Hastings algorithms in order
to sample from these spaces. We then apply the model to study two classical network topics -- clustering
and assortativity -- as well as one contemporary, polyadic topic -- simplicial closure. In each
application, we emphasize the importance of randomizing over hypergraph space rather than projected
graph space, showing that this choice can dramatically alter directional study conclusions and
statistical findings. For example, we find that many of the social networks we study are less clustered
than would be expected at random, a finding in tension with much conventional wisdom within network
science. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully choosing appropriate null spaces
for polyadic relational data, and demonstrate the utility of random hypergraphs in many study contexts.
