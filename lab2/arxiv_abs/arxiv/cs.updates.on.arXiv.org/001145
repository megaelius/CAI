Computational modeling of the structural behavior of continuous fiber composite materials often
takes into account the periodicity of the underlying micro-structure. A well established method
dealing with the structural behavior of periodic micro-structures is the so- called Asymptotic
Expansion Homogenization (AEH). By considering a periodic perturbation of the material displacement,
scale bridging functions, also referred to as elastic correctors, can be derived in order to connect
the strains at the level of the macro-structure with micro- structural strains. For complicated
inhomogeneous micro-structures, the derivation of such functions is usually performed by the
numerical solution of a PDE problem - typically with the Finite Element Method. Moreover, when dealing
with uncertain micro-structural geometry and material parameters, there is considerable uncertainty
introduced in the actual stresses experienced by the materials. Due to the high computational cost
of computing the elastic correctors, the choice of a pure Monte-Carlo approach for dealing with
the inevitable material and geometric uncertainties is clearly computationally intractable.
This problem is even more pronounced when the effect of damage in the micro-scale is considered,
where re-evaluation of the micro-structural representative volume element is necessary for every
occurring damage. The novelty in this paper is that a non-intrusive surrogate modeling approach
is employed with the purpose of directly bridging the macro-scale behavior of the structure with
the material behavior in the micro-scale, therefore reducing the number of costly evaluations
of corrector functions, allowing for future developments on the incorporation of fatigue or static
damage in the analysis of composite structural components.
