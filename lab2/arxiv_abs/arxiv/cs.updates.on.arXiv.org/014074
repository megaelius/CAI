Part-level representations are important for robust person re-identification (ReID), but in
practice feature quality suffers due to the body part misalignment problem. In this paper, we present
a robust, compact, and easy-to-use method called the Multi-task Part-aware Network (MPN), which
is designed to extract semantically aligned part-level features from pedestrian images. MPN solves
the body part misalignment problem via multi-task learning (MTL) in the training stage. More specifically,
it builds one main task (MT) and one auxiliary task (AT) for each body part on the top of the same backbone
model. The ATs are equipped with a coarse prior of the body part locations for training images. ATs
then transfer the concept of the body parts to the MTs via optimizing the MT parameters to identify
part-relevant channels from the backbone model. Concept transfer is accomplished by means of two
novel alignment strategies: namely, parameter space alignment via hard parameter sharing and
feature space alignment in a class-wise manner. With the aid of the learned high-quality parameters,
MTs can independently extract semantically aligned part-level features from relevant channels
in the testing stage. MPN has three key advantages: 1) it does not need to conduct body part detection
in the inference stage; 2) its model is very compact and efficient for both training and testing;
3) in the training stage, it requires only coarse priors of body part locations, which are easy to
obtain. Systematic experiments on four large-scale ReID databases demonstrate that MPN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins.
