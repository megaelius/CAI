The ambitious high data rate applications in the envisioned future B5G wireless networks require
new solutions, including the advent of more advanced architectures than the ones already used in
5G networks, and the coalition of different communications schemes and technologies to enable
these applications requirements. Among the candidate communications schemes for future wireless
networks are NOMA schemes that allow serving more than one user in the same resource block by multiplexing
users in other domains than frequency or time. In this way, NOMA schemes tend to offer several advantages
over OMA schemes such as improved user fairness and spectral efficiency, higher cell-edge throughput,
massive connectivity support, and low transmission latency. With these merits, NOMA schemes are
being increasingly looked at as promising multiple access schemes for future wireless networks.
When the power domain is used to multiplex the users, it is referred to as the PD-NOMA. In this paper,
we survey the integration of PD-NOMA with the other enabling communication schemes and technologies
that are expected to satisfy the requirements of B5G networks. In particular, this paper surveys
the different rate optimization scenarios studied in the literature when PD-NOMA is combined with
one or more of the candidate schemes and technologies for B5G networks including advanced antenna
architectures, mmWave and THz communications, CoMP, FD communications, cognitive radio, VLC,
UAV communications and others. The considered system models, the optimization methods used to
maximize the achievable rates, and the main lessons learnt on the optimization and the performance
of these NOMA-enabled schemes and technologies are discussed in details along with the future research
directions for these combined schemes. Moreover, the role of machine learning in optimizing these
NOMA-enabled technologies is addressed.
