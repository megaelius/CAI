Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the existing world constituting one-third of the cancer
cases. Benign skin cancers are not fatal, can be cured with proper medication. But it is not the same
as the malignant skin cancers. In the case of malignant melanoma, in its peak stage, the maximum life
expectancy is less than or equal to 5 years. But, it can be cured if detected in early stages. Though
there are numerous clinical procedures, the accuracy of diagnosis falls between 49% to 81% and is
time-consuming. So, dermoscopy has been brought into the picture. It helped in increasing the accuracy
of diagnosis but could not demolish the error-prone behaviour. A quick and less error-prone solution
is needed to diagnose this majorly growing skin cancer. This project deals with the usage of deep
learning in skin lesion classification. In this project, an automated model for skin lesion classification
using dermoscopic images has been developed with CNN(Convolution Neural Networks) as a training
model. Convolution neural networks are known for capturing features of an image. So, they are preferred
in analyzing medical images to find the characteristics that drive the model towards success. Techniques
like data augmentation for tackling class imbalance, segmentation for focusing on the region of
interest and 10-fold cross-validation to make the model robust have been brought into the picture.
This project also includes usage of certain preprocessing techniques like brightening the images
using piece-wise linear transformation function, grayscale conversion of the image, resize the
image. This project throws a set of valuable insights on how the accuracy of the model hikes with the
bringing of new input strategies, preprocessing techniques. The best accuracy this model could
achieve is 0.886
