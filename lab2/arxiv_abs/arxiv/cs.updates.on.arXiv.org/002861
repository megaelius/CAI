Multiple studies have illustrated the potential for dramatic societal, environmental and economic
benefits from significant penetration of autonomous driving. However, all the current approaches
to autonomous driving require the automotive manufacturers to shoulder the primary responsibility
and liability associated with replacing human perception and decision making with automation,
potentially slowing the penetration of autonomous vehicles, and consequently slowing the realization
of the societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. We propose here a new approach to autonomous driving
that will re-balance the responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous driving between
traditional automotive manufacturers, infrastructure players, and third-party players. Our
proposed distributed intelligence architecture leverages the significant advancements in connectivity
and edge computing in the recent decades to partition the driving functions between the vehicle,
edge computers on the road side, and specialized third-party computers that reside in the vehicle.
Infrastructure becomes a critical enabler for autonomy. With this Infrastructure Enabled Autonomy
(IEA) concept, the traditional automotive manufacturers will only need to shoulder responsibility
and liability comparable to what they already do today, and the infrastructure and third-party
players will share the added responsibility and liabilities associated with autonomous functionalities.
We propose a Bayesian Network Model based framework for assessing the risk benefits of such a distributed
intelligence architecture. An additional benefit of the proposed architecture is that it enables
"autonomy as a service" while still allowing for private ownership of automobiles.
