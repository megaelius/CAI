Background. DevOps is a set of practices and cultural values that aims to reduce the barriers between
development and operations teams. Due to its increasing interest and imprecise definitions, existing
research works have tried to characterize DevOps---mainly using a set of concepts and related practices.
Aims. Nevertheless, little is known about thepractitioners practitioners' understanding about
successful paths for DevOps adoption. The lack of such understanding might hinder institutions
to adopt DevOps practices. Therefore, our goal here is to present a theory about DevOps adoption,
highlighting the main related concepts that contribute to its adoption in industry. Method. Our
work builds upon Classic Grounded Theory. We interviewed practitioners that contributed to DevOps
adoption in 15 companies from different domains and across 5 countries. We empirically evaluate
our model through a case study, whose goal is to increase the maturity level of DevOps adoption at
the Brazilian Federal Court of Accounts, a Brazilian Government institution.Results. This paper
presents a model to improve both the understanding and guidance of DevOps adoption. The model increments
the existing view of DevOps by explaining the role and motivation of each category (and their relationships)
in the DevOps adoption process. We organize this model in terms of DevOps enabler categories and
DevOps outcome categories. We provide evidence that collaboration is the core DevOps concern,
contrasting with an existing wisdom that implanting specific tools to automate building, deployment,
and infrastructure provisioning and management is enough to achieve DevOps. Conclusions. Altogether,
our results contribute to (a) generating an adequate understanding of DevOps, from the perspective
of practitioners; and (b) assisting other institutions in the migration path towards DevOps adoption.
