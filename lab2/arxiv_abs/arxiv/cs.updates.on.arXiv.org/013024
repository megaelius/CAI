This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of recovering the unknown signal components, along
with extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs), governed by the adaptive harmonic model
(AHM), from discrete (and possibly non-uniform) samples of the blind-source composite signal.
None of the existing decomposition methods and algorithms, including the most popular empirical
mode decomposition (EMD) computational scheme and its current modifications, is capable of solving
this inverse problem. In order to meet the AHM formulation and to extract the IFs of the decomposed
components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each IMF of EMD is extended to an analytic function
in the upper half of the complex plane via the Hilbert transform, followed by taking the real part
of the polar form of the analytic extension. Unfortunately, this approach most often fails to resolve
the inverse problem satisfactorily. More recently, to resolve the inverse problem, the notion
of synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST) was proposed by Daubechies and Maes, and further developed
in many other papers, while a more direct method, called signal separation operation (SSO), was
proposed and developed in our previous work published in the journal, Applied and Computational
Harmonic Analysis, vol. 30(2):243-261, 2016. In the present paper, we propose a synthesis of SSO
using a deep neural network, based directly on a discrete sample set, that may be non-uniformly sampled,
of the blind-source signal. Our method is localized, as illustrated by a number of numerical examples,
including components with different signal arrival and departure times. It also yields short-term
prediction of the signal components, along with their IFs. Our neural networks are inspired by theory,
designed so that they do not require any training in the traditional sense.
