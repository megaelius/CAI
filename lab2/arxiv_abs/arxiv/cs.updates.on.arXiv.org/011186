Accurate and consistent mental interpretation of fluoroscopy to determine the position and orientation
of acetabular bone fragments in 3D space is difficult. We propose a computer assisted approach that
uses a single fluoroscopic view and quickly reports the pose of an acetabular fragment without any
user input or initialization. Intraoperatively, but prior to any osteotomies, two constellations
of metallic ball-bearings (BBs) are injected into the wing of a patient's ilium and lateral superior
pubic ramus. One constellation is located on the expected acetabular fragment, and the other is
located on the remaining, larger, pelvis fragment. The 3D locations of each BB are reconstructed
using three fluoroscopic views and 2D/3D registrations to a preoperative CT scan of the pelvis.
The relative pose of the fragment is established by estimating the movement of the two BB constellations
using a single fluoroscopic view taken after osteotomy and fragment relocation. BB detection and
inter-view correspondences are automatically computed throughout the processing pipeline.
The proposed method was evaluated on a multitude of fluoroscopic images collected from six cadaveric
surgeries performed bilaterally on three specimens. Mean fragment rotation error was 2.4 +/- 1.0
degrees, mean translation error was 2.1 +/- 0.6 mm, and mean 3D lateral center edge angle error was
1.0 +/- 0.5 degrees. The average runtime of the single-view pose estimation was 0.7 +/- 0.2 seconds.
The proposed method demonstrates accuracy similar to other state of the art systems which require
optical tracking systems or multiple-view 2D/3D registrations with manual input. The errors reported
on fragment poses and lateral center edge angles are within the margins required for accurate intraoperative
evaluation of femoral head coverage.
