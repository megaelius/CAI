The control landscape of a quantum system $A$ interacting with another quantum system $B$ is studied.
Only system $A$ is accessible through time dependent controls, while system B is not accessible.
The objective is to find controls that implement a desired unitary transformation on $A$, regardless
of the evolution on $B$, at a sufficiently large final time. The freedom in the evolution on $B$ is
used to define an \emph{extended control landscape} on which the critical points are investigated
in terms of kinematic and dynamic gradients. A spectral decomposition of the corresponding extended
unitary system simplifies the landscape analysis which provides: (i) a sufficient condition on
the rank of the dynamic gradient of the extended landscape that guarantees a trap free search for
the final time unitary matrix of system $A$, and (ii) a detailed decomposition of the components
of the overall dynamic gradient matrix. Consequently, if the rank condition is satisfied, a gradient
algorithm will find the controls that implements the target unitary on system $A$. It is shown that
even if the dynamic gradient with respect to the controls alone is not full rank, the additional flexibility
due to the parameters that define the extended landscape still can allow for the rank condition of
the extended landscape to hold. Moreover, satisfaction of the latter rank condition subsumes any
assumptions about controllability, reachability and control resources. Here satisfaction of
the rank condition is taken as an assumption. The conditions which ensure that it holds remain an
open research question. We lend some numerical support with two common examples for which the rank
condition holds.
