Discovering pulsars is a significant and meaningful research topic in the field of radio astronomy.
With the advent of astronomical instruments such as he Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical
Telescope (FAST) in China, data volumes and data rates are exponentially growing. This fact necessitates
a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can perform the automatic pulsar candidate
identification to mine large astronomical data sets. Automatic pulsar candidate identification
can be considered as a task of determining potential candidates for further investigation and eliminating
noises of radio frequency interferences or other non-pulsar signals. It is very hard to raise the
performance of DCNN-based pulsar identification because the limited training samples restrict
network structure to be designed deep enough for learning good features as well as the crucial class
imbalance problem due to very limited number of real pulsar samples. To address these problems,
we proposed a framework which combines deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN)
with support vector machine (SVM) to deal with imbalance class problem and to improve pulsar identification
accuracy. DCGAN is used as sample generation and feature learning model, and SVM is adopted as the
classifier for predicting candidate's labels in the inference stage. The proposed framework is
a novel technique which not only can solve imbalance class problem but also can learn discriminative
feature representations of pulsar candidates instead of computing hand-crafted features in preprocessing
steps too, which makes it more accurate for automatic pulsar candidate selection. Experiments
on two pulsar datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.
