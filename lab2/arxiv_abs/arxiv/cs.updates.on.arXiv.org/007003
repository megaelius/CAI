Network topology is a fundamental aspect of network science that allows us to gather insights into
the complicated relational architectures of the world we inhabit. We provide a first specific study
of neighbourhood degree sequences in complex networks. We consider how to explicitly characterise
important physical concepts such as symmetry, heterogeneity and organisation in neighbourhood
degree sequences, as well as updating the notion of hierarchical complexity to reflect previously
unnoticed organisational principles. This entails the development of novel network indices which
we apply to a comprehensive array of graph models and over 200 real-world networks. We find that these
indices are neither highly correlated with each other nor with classical network indices, indicating
a rich, new area of analysis in network topology. Neighbourhood degree sequences of a wide variety
of real world networks are found to be more symmetric, organised and complex than is expected for
networks of their given degree distributions. Notably, while biological, social and technological
networks all showed consistently large neighbourhood symmetry and organisation, only technological
networks showed a small amount of hierarchical complexity. Particularly, no statistical difference
in hierarchical complexity was found between connectomes of different animal species and their
configuration models. This hints that hierarchical complexity may be a special feature of the human
connectome. We also found a possible 2-year cyclical decrease in neighbourhood organisation of
director co-affilitations after major changes to legislation of directorships in a temporal network.
The versatility of this newly recognised topologically descriptive tool shows potential for describing
unique and important characteristics of complex networks.
