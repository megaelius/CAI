The DSM-1 was published in 1952, contains 128 diagnostic categories, described in 132 pages. The
DSM-5 appeared in 2013, contains 541 diagnostic categories, described in 947 pages. The field of
psychology is characterised by a steady proliferation of diagnostic models and subcategories,
that seems to be inspired by the principle of "divide and inflate". This approach is in contrast with
experimental evidence, which suggests on one hand that traumas of various kind are often present
in the anamnesis of patients and, on the other, that the gene variants implicated are shared across
a wide range of diagnoses. In this work I propose a holistic approach, built with tools borrowed from
the field of Artificial Intelligence. My model is based on two pillars. The first one is trauma, which
represents the attack to the mind, is psychological in nature and has its origin in the environment.
The second pillar is dissociation, which represents the mind defence in both physiological and
pathological conditions, and incorporates all other defence mechanisms. Damages to dissociation
can be considered as another category of attacks, that are neurobiological in nature and can be of
genetic or environmental origin. They include, among other factors, synaptic over-pruning, abuse
of drugs and inflammation. These factors concur to weaken the defence, represented by the neural
networks that implement the dissociation mechanism in the brain. The model is subsequently used
to interpret five mental conditions: PTSD, complex PTSD, dissociative identity disorder, schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder. Ideally, this is a first step towards building a model that aims to explain
a wider range of psychopathological affections with a single theoretical framework. The last part
is dedicated to sketching a new psychotherapy for psychological trauma.
