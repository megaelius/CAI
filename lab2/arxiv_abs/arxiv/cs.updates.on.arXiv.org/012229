Gradient porous structured materials possess significant potential of being applied in many engineering
fields. To accelerate the design process of infill graded microstructures, a novel asymptotic
homogenisation topology optimisation method was proposed by Zhu et al.(2019), aiming for 1) significantly
enriching the pool of representable graded microstructures; 2) deriving an homogenised formulation
for stress analysis in consistency with fine-scale results. But the work is severely confined from
being widely applied, mainly due to the following two reasons. Firstly, to circumvent the macroscopically
pointwise computation for solving various microscopic cell problems, linearisation had to be
adopted for its numerical implementation, and this significantly reduces the design freedom.
Secondly, lacking of sensitive analysis, genetic algorithm was chosen for optimisation, inevitably
decreasing the computational efficiency. To address these bottleneck challenging issues, a zoning
scheme empowered by computational parallelism is introduced, and the sensitivity analysis associated
with the new asymptotic framework is conducted. Through comparisons with fine-scale simulation
results, the proposed algorithm is shown to be an effective tool for evaluating the mechanical behaviour
of graded microstructures. As an optimisation tool, the mapping function takes a concise and explicit
form. But its parameterisation still needs further investigation, so as to improve the solution
optimality of the present approach, especially in comparison with another recently proposed method
by Groen et al (2018). The high computational efficiency shown by the proposed scheme is also demonstrated
with optimisation results for three-dimensional graded microstructures, which are not frequently
discussed in literature, possibly because of the high computational cost generated.
