Objective: A patient medical insurance coverage plays an essential role in determining the post-acute
care (PAC) discharge disposition. The prior health insurance authorization process postpones
the PAC discharge disposition, increases the inpatient length of stay, and effects patient health.
Our study implements predictive analytics for the early prediction of the PAC discharge disposition
to reduce the deferments caused by prior health insurance authorization, the inpatient length
of stay and inpatient stay expenses. Methodology: We conducted a group discussion involving 25
patient care facilitators (PCFs) and two registered nurses (RNs) and retrieved 1600 patient data
records from the initial nursing assessment and discharge notes to conduct a retrospective analysis
of PAC discharge dispositions using predictive analytics. Results: The chi-squared automatic
interaction detector (CHAID) algorithm enabled the early prediction of the PAC discharge disposition,
accelerated the prior health insurance process, decreased the inpatient length of stay by an average
of 22.22%, and reduced inpatient stay expenses by $1,974 for state government hospitals, $2,346
for non-profit hospitals and $1,798 for for-profit hospitals per day. The CHAID algorithm produced
an overall accuracy of 84.16% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
value of 0.81. Conclusion: The early prediction of PAC discharge dispositions can condense the
PAC deferment caused by the prior health insurance authorization process and simultaneously minimize
the inpatient length of stay and related expenses incurred by the hospital.
