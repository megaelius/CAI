A new wave of growing antisemitism, driven by fringe Web communities, is an increasingly worrying
presence in the socio-political realm. The ubiquitous and global nature of the Web has provided
tools used by these groups to spread their ideology to the rest of the Internet. Although the study
of antisemitism and hate is not new, the scale and rate of change of online data has impacted the efficacy
of traditional approaches to measure and understand these troubling trends. In this paper, we present
a large-scale, quantitative study of online antisemitism. We collect hundreds of million posts
and images from alt-right Web communities like 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) and
Gab. Using scientifically grounded methods, we quantify the escalation and spread of antisemitic
memes and rhetoric across the Web. We find the frequency of antisemitic content greatly increases
(in some cases more than doubling) after major political events such as the 2016 US Presidential
Election and the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville. We extract semantic embeddings from
our corpus of posts and demonstrate how automated techniques can discover and categorize the use
of antisemitic terminology. We additionally examine the prevalence and spread of the antisemitic
"Happy Merchant" meme, and in particular how these fringe communities influence its propagation
to more mainstream communities like Twitter and Reddit. Taken together, our results provide a data-driven,
quantitative framework for understanding online antisemitism. Our methods serve as a framework
to augment current qualitative efforts by anti-hate groups, providing new insights into the growth
and spread of hate online.
