Integer linear programs of configurations, or configuration IPs, are a classical tool in the design
of algorithms for scheduling and packing problems, where a set of items has to be placed in multiple
target locations. Herein a configuration describes a possible placement on one of the target locations,
and the IP is used to chose suitable configurations covering the items. We give an augmented IP formulation,
which we call the module configuration IP. It can be described within the framework of $n$-fold integer
programming and therefore be solved efficiently using the algorithm by Hemmecke, Onn, and Romanchuk.
Furthermore, we investigate how structural properties can be applied to reduce the description
of the IP and thereby speed up the resulting algorithms. As an application, we consider scheduling
problems with setup times, in which a set of jobs has to be scheduled on a set of identical machines,
with the objective of minimizing the makespan. For instance, we investigate the case that jobs can
be split and scheduled on multiple machines. However, before a part of a job can be processed an uninterrupted
setup depending on the job has to be paid. For both of the variants that jobs can be executed in parallel
or not, we obtain an efficient polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) of running time $f(1/\varepsilon)\times
\mathrm{poly}(|I|)$ with a single exponential term in $f$ for the first and a double exponential
one for the second case. Previously only constant factor approximations of $5/3$ and $4/3 + \varepsilon$
respectively were known. Furthermore, we present an EPTAS for a problem where classes of (non-splittable)
jobs are given, and a setup has to be paid for each class of jobs being executed on one machine.
