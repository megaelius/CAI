Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are effective in solving inverse problems based on differential
and integral equations with sparse, noisy, unstructured, and multi-fidelity data. PINNs incorporate
all available information into a loss function, thus recasting the original problem into an optimization
problem. In this paper, we extend PINNs to parameter and function inference for integral equations
such as nonlocal Poisson and nonlocal turbulence models, and we refer to them as nonlocal PINNs (nPINNs).
The contribution of the paper is three-fold. First, we propose a unified nonlocal operator, which
converges to the classical Laplacian as one of the operator parameters, the nonlocal interaction
radius $\delta$ goes to zero, and to the fractional Laplacian as $\delta$ goes to infinity. This
universal operator forms a super-set of classical Laplacian and fractional Laplacian operators
and, thus, has the potential to fit a broad spectrum of data sets. We provide theoretical convergence
rates with respect to $\delta$ and verify them via numerical experiments. Second, we use nPINNs
to estimate the two parameters, $\delta$ and $\alpha$. The strong non-convexity of the loss function
yielding multiple (good) local minima reveals the occurrence of the operator mimicking phenomenon:
different pairs of estimated parameters could produce multiple solutions of comparable accuracy.
Third, we propose another nonlocal operator with spatially variable order $\alpha(y)$, which
is more suitable for modeling turbulent Couette flow. Our results show that nPINNs can jointly infer
this function as well as $\delta$. Also, these parameters exhibit a universal behavior with respect
to the Reynolds number, a finding that contributes to our understanding of nonlocal interactions
in wall-bounded turbulence.
