Vehicle tracking in Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) relies on associating vehicle detections across
multiple WAMI frames to form tracks corresponding to individual vehicles. The temporal window
length, i.e., the number $M$ of sequential frames, over which associations are collectively estimated
poses a trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. A larger $M$ improves performance
because the increased temporal context enables the use of motion models and allows occlusions and
spurious detections to be handled better. The number of total hypotheses tracks, on the other hand,
grows exponentially with increasing $M$, making larger values of $M$ computationally challenging
to tackle. In this paper, we introduce SPAAM an iterative approach that progressively grows $M$
with each iteration to improve estimated tracks by exploiting the enlarged temporal context while
keeping computation manageable through two novel approaches for pruning association hypotheses.
First, guided by a road network, accurately co-registered to the WAMI frames, we disregard unlikely
associations that do not agree with the road network. Second, as $M$ is progressively enlarged at
each iteration, the related increase in association hypotheses is limited by revisiting only the
subset of association possibilities rendered open by stochastically determined dis-associations
for the previous iteration. The stochastic dis-association at each iteration maintains each estimated
association according to an estimated probability for confidence, obtained via a probabilistic
model. Associations at each iteration are then estimated globally over the $M$ frames by (approximately)
solving a binary integer programming problem for selecting a set of compatible tracks. Vehicle
tracking results obtained over test WAMI datasets indicate that our proposed approach provides
significant performance improvements over 3 alternatives.
