Nowadays public opinion formation is deeply influenced by social networks and faces unprecedented
challenges such as opinion radicalization, echo chambers, and ideologization of public debates.
Mathematical modeling of opinion dynamics plays a fundamental role in understanding the microscopic
mechanisms of social interactions behind these macroscopic phenomena. The weighted-averaging
opinion update is arguably the most widely adopted microscopic mechanism for opinion dynamics.
However, such models based on weighted averaging are restricted in their predictive power and limited
to stylized continuous opinion spectra. Here we point out that these models' limitation in predictability
is not due to the lack of complexity, but because the weighted-averaging mechanism itself features
a non-negligible unrealistic implication. By resolving this unrealistic feature in the framework
of cognitive dissonance theory, we propose a novel opinion dynamics model based on a weighted-median
mechanism instead. Surprisingly, such an inconspicuous change in microscopic mechanism leads
to dramatic macroscopic consequences. In the spirit of Occam's razor, our new model, despite its
simplicity in form, exhibits a sophisticated consensus-disagreement phase transition depending
on the influence network structure. Our model gives perhaps the simplest answers to various open
problems in sociology and political science, such as the connection between social marginalization
and opinion radicalization, the mechanism for echo chambers, and the formation of multipolar opinion
distributions. Remarkably, the weighted-median opinion dynamics are the first model applicable
to ordered multiple-choice issues, which are prevalent in modern-day public debates and elections.
