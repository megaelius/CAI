As one type of efficient unsupervised learning methods, clustering algorithms have been widely
used in data mining and knowledge discovery with noticeable advantages. However, clustering algorithms
based on density peak have limited clustering effect on data with varying density distribution
(VDD), equilibrium distribution (ED), and multiple domain-density maximums (MDDM), leading
to the problems of sparse cluster loss and cluster fragmentation. To address these problems, we
propose a Domain-Adaptive Density Clustering (DADC) algorithm, which consists of three steps:
domain-adaptive density measurement, cluster center self-identification, and cluster self-ensemble.
For data with VDD features, clusters in sparse regions are often neglected by using uniform density
peak thresholds, which results in the loss of sparse clusters. We define a domain-adaptive density
measurement method based on K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to adaptively detect the density peaks of
different density regions. We treat each data point and its KNN neighborhood as a subgroup to better
reflect its density distribution in a domain view. In addition, for data with ED or MDDM features,
a large number of density peaks with similar values can be identified, which results in cluster fragmentation.
We propose a cluster center self-identification and cluster self-ensemble method to automatically
extract the initial cluster centers and merge the fragmented clusters. Experimental results demonstrate
that compared with other comparative algorithms, the proposed DADC algorithm can obtain more reasonable
clustering results on data with VDD, ED and MDDM features. Benefitting from a few parameter requirements
and non-iterative nature, DADC achieves low computational complexity and is suitable for large-scale
data clustering.
