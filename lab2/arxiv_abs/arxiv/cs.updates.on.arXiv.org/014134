This paper concerns the problem of detecting the use of information hiding at anti-copying 2D barcodes.
Prior hidden information detection schemes are either heuristicbased or Machine Learning (ML)
based. The key limitation of prior heuristics-based schemes is that they do not answer the fundamental
question of why the information hidden at a 2D barcode can be detected. The key limitation of prior
MLbased information schemes is that they lack robustness because a printed 2D barcode is very much
environmentally dependent, and thus an information hiding detection scheme trained in one environment
often does not work well in another environment. In this paper, we propose two hidden information
detection schemes at the existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. The first scheme is to directly use
the pixel distance to detect the use of an information hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred as to
the Pixel Distance Based Detection (PDBD) scheme. The second scheme is first to calculate the variance
of the raw signal and the covariance between the recovered signal and the raw signal, and then based
on the variance results, detects the use of information hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred as
to the Pixel Variance Based Detection (PVBD) scheme. Moreover, we design advanced IC attacks to
evaluate the security of two existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. We implemented our schemes and
conducted extensive performance comparison between our schemes and prior schemes under different
capturing devices, such as a scanner and a camera phone. Our experimental results show that the PVBD
scheme can correctly detect the existence of the hidden information at both the 2LQR code and the
LCAC 2D barcode. Moreover, the probability of successfully attacking of our IC attacks achieves
0.6538 for the 2LQR code and 1 for the LCAC 2D barcode.
