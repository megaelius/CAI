This paper concerns itself with the question of list decoding for general adversarial channels,
e.g., bit-flip ($\textsf{XOR}$) channels, erasure channels, $\textsf{AND}$ ($Z$-) channels,
$\textsf{OR}$ channels, real adder channels, noisy typewriter channels, etc. We precisely characterize
when exponential-sized (or positive rate) $(L-1)$-list decodable codes (where the list size $L$
is a universal constant) exist for such channels. Our criterion asserts that: "For any given general
adversarial channel, it is possible to construct positive rate $(L-1)$-list decodable codes if
and only if the set of completely positive tensors of order-$L$ with admissible marginals is not
entirely contained in the order-$L$ confusability set associated to the channel." The sufficiency
is shown via random code construction (combined with expurgation or time-sharing). The necessity
is shown by 1. extracting equicoupled subcodes (generalization of equidistant code) from any large
code sequence using hypergraph Ramsey's theorem, and 2. significantly extending the classic Plotkin
bound in coding theory to list decoding for general channels using duality between the completely
positive tensor cone and the copositive tensor cone. In the proof, we also obtain a new fact regarding
asymmetry of joint distributions, which be may of independent interest. Other results include
1. List decoding capacity with asymptotically large $L$ for general adversarial channels; 2. A
tight list size bound for most constant composition codes (generalization of constant weight codes);
3. Rederivation and demystification of Blinovsky's [Bli86] characterization of the list decoding
Plotkin points (threshold at which large codes are impossible); 4. Evaluation of general bounds
([WBBJ]) for unique decoding in the error correction code setting.
