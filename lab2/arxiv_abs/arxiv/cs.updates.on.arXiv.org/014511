Accurately predicting the possible behaviors of traffic participants is an essential capability
for autonomous vehicles. Since autonomous vehicles need to navigate in dynamically changing environments,
they are expected to make accurate predictions regardless of where they are and what driving circumstances
they encountered. A number of methodologies have been proposed to solve prediction problems under
different traffic situations. However, these works either focus on one particular driving scenario
(e.g. highway, intersection, or roundabout) or do not take sufficient environment information
(e.g. road topology, traffic rules, and surrounding agents) into account. In fact, the limitation
to certain scenario is mainly due to the lackness of generic representations of the environment.
The insufficiency of environment information further limits the flexibility and transferability
of the predictor. In this paper, we propose a scenario-transferable and interaction-aware probabilistic
prediction algorithm based on semantic graph reasoning, which predicts behaviors of selected
agents. We put forward generic representations for various environment information and utilize
them as building blocks to construct their spatio-temporal structural relations. We then take
the advantage of these structured representations to develop a flexible and transferable prediction
algorithm, where the predictor can be directly used under unforeseen driving circumstances that
are completely different from training scenarios. The proposed algorithm is thoroughly examined
under several complicated real-world driving scenarios to demonstrate its flexibility and transferability
with the generic representation for autonomous driving systems.
