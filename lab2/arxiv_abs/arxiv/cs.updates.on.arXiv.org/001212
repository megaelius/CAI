As a favorite urban public transport mode, the bike sharing system is a large-scale and complicated
system, and there exists a key requirement that a user and a bike should be matched sufficiently in
time. Such matched behavior makes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging.
This paper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two important views: (a)
Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related to geographical structure of the bike sharing
system; and (b) Markovian arrival processes (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and
burst behavior of bike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates
that the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in practice. For such a
complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a multiclass closed queueing network
by means of some virtual ideas, for example, bikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations
and roads are regarded as virtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station
nodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road nodes. Further, to deal
with this multiclass closed queueing network, we provide a detailed observation practically on
physical behavior of the bike sharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives
a nonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the product-form solution
to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths at the virtual nodes. Based on this, we
can compute the steady-state probability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting
performance measures of the bike sharing system. We hope that the methodology and results of this
paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike sharing systems through multiclass closed
queueing networks.
