In this paper, we propose a preference-aware cooperative video streaming system for videos encoded
using Scalable Video Coding (SVC) where all the collaborating users are interested in watching
a video together on a shared screen. However, each user's willingness to cooperate is subject to
her own constraints such as user data plans and/or energy consumption. Using SVC, each layer of every
chunk can be fetched through any of the cooperating users. We formulate the problem of finding the
optimal quality decisions and fetching policy of the SVC layers of video chunks subject to the available
bandwidth, chunk deadlines, and cooperation willingness of the different users as an optimization
problem. The objective is to optimize a QoE metric that maintains a trade-off between maximizing
the playback rate of every chunk while ensuring fairness among all chunks for the minimum skip/stall
duration without violating any of the imposed constraints. We propose an offline algorithm to solve
the non-convex optimization problem when the bandwidth prediction is non-causally known. This
algorithm has a run-time complexity that is polynomial in the video length and the number of cooperating
users. Furthermore, we propose an online version of the algorithm for more practical scenarios
where erroneous bandwidth prediction for a short window is used. Real implementation with android
devices using SVC encoded video on public bandwidth traces' dataset reveals the robustness and
performance of the proposed algorithm and shows that the algorithm significantly outperforms
round robin based mechanisms in terms of avoiding skips/stalls and fetching video chunks at their
highest quality possible.
