The spread of social networking services has created an increasing demand for selecting, editing,
and generating impressive images. This trend increases the importance of evaluating image aesthetics
as a complementary function of automatic image processing. We propose a multi-patch method, named
MPA-Net (Multi-Patch Aggregation Network), to predict image aesthetics scores by maintaining
the original aspect ratios of contents in the images. Through an experiment involving the large-scale
AVA dataset, which contains 250,000 images, we show that the effectiveness of the equal-interval
multi-patch selection approach for aesthetics score prediction is significant compared to the
single-patch prediction and random patch selection approaches. For this dataset, MPA-Net outperforms
the neural image assessment algorithm, which was regarded as a baseline method. In particular,
MPA-Net yields a 0.073 (11.5%) higher linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of aesthetics scores
and a 0.088 (14.4%) higher Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC). MPA-Net also reduces
the mean square error (MSE) by 0.0115 (4.18%) and achieves results for the LCC and SRCC that are comparable
to those of the state-of-the-art continuous aesthetics score prediction methods. Most notably,
MPA-Net yields a significant lower MSE especially for images with aspect ratios far from 1.0, indicating
that MPA-Net is useful for a wide range of image aspect ratios. MPA-Net uses only images and does not
require external information during the training nor prediction stages. Therefore, MPA-Net has
great potential for applications aside from aesthetics score prediction such as other human subjectivity
prediction.
