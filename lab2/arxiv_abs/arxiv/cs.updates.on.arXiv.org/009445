Timely, accurate and automatic detection of pavement cracks is necessary for making cost-effective
decisions concerning road maintenance. Conventional crack detection algorithms focus on the
design of single or multiple crack features and classifiers. However, complicated topological
structures, varying degrees of damage and oil stains make the design of crack features difficult.
In addition, the contextual information around a crack is not investigated extensively in the design
process. Accordingly, these design features have limited discriminative adaptability and cannot
fuse effectively with the classifiers. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a deep learning
network for pavement crack detection. Using the Encoder-Decoder structure, crack characteristics
with multiple contexts are automatically learned, and end-to-end crack detection is achieved.
Specifically, we first propose the Multi-Dilation (MD) module, which can synthesize the crack
features of multiple context sizes via dilated convolution with multiple rates. The crack MD features
obtained in this module can describe cracks of different widths and topologies. Next, we propose
the SE-Upsampling (SEU) module, which uses the Squeeze-and-Excitation learning operation to
optimize the MD features. Finally, the above two modules are integrated to develop the fast crack
detection network, namely, FPCNet. This network continuously optimizes the MD features step-by-step
to realize fast pixel-level crack detection. Experiments are conducted on challenging public
CFD datasets and G45 crack datasets involving various crack types under different shooting conditions.
The distinct performance and speed improvements over all the datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms other state-of-the-art crack detection methods.
