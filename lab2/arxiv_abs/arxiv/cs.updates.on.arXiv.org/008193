As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part
of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems.
However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk
tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated
with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should
have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose
a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify
the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices in the presence of an adversaries who manipulate
the data. We consider an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism that monitors the data being sent
from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred.
These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with
three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate
data is. We use a prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate
the trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. Furthermore, we also model the
system using the traditionally used expected utility theory and compare the results with that obtained
using prospect theory. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models:
one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive
simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors
like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.
