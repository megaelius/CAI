We have recently seen many successful applications of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on electronic
medical records (EMRs), which contain histories of patients' diagnoses, medications, and other
various events, in order to predict the current and future states of patients. Despite the strong
performance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the model makes a particular
prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede its wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore,
we have no established methods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge
as inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a visual analytics
solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of RNNs via a joint effort of medical experts,
artificial intelligence scientists, and visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative
design process between the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool
called RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable and interactive RNN-based model
called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of EMR data in the context of prediction
tasks. Our study shows the effective use of RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical
codes contribute to making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and cataract
symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes to the state-of-the-art
RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of temporal information and increase interactivity.
This study will provide a useful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and
interactive visual analytics tool for RNNs.
