In this report, we propose a decentralised motion control algorithm for the mobile robots to intercept
an intruder entering (k-intercepting) or escaping (e-intercepting) a protected region. In continuation,
we propose a decentralized navigation strategy (dynamic-intercepting) for a multi-robot team
known as predators to intercept the intruders or in the other words, preys, from escaping a siege
ring which is created by the predators. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
a solution of this problem is obtained. Furthermore, we propose an intelligent game-based decision-making
algorithm (IGD) for a fleet of mobile robots to maximize the probability of detection in a bounded
region. We prove that the proposed decentralised cooperative and non-cooperative game-based
decision-making algorithm enables each robot to make the best decision to choose the shortest path
with minimum local information. Then we propose a leader-follower based collision-free navigation
control method for a fleet of mobile robots to traverse an unknown cluttered environment where is
occupied by multiple obstacles to trap a target. We prove that each individual team member is able
to traverse safely in the region, which is cluttered by many obstacles with any shapes to trap the
target while using the sensors in some indefinite switching points and not continuously, which
leads to saving energy consumption and increasing the battery life of the robots consequently.
And finally, we propose a novel navigation strategy for a unicycle mobile robot in a cluttered area
with moving obstacles based on virtual field force algorithm. The mathematical proof of the navigation
laws and the computer simulations are provided to confirm the validity, robustness, and reliability
of the proposed methods.
