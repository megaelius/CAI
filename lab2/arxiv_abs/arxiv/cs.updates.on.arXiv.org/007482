Orthogonal drawings, i.e., embeddings of graphs into grids, are a classic topic in Graph Drawing.
Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the number of bends on the edges. A key ingredient
for bend minimization algorithms is the existence of an orthogonal representation that allows
to describe such drawings purely combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges around
each vertex and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any kind of geometric information
such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths. Barth et al. [2] have established the existence of an
analogous ortho-radial representation for ortho-radial drawings, which are embeddings into
an ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are concentric circles around the origin and straight-line
spokes emanating from the origin but excluding the origin itself. While any orthogonal representation
admits an orthogonal drawing, it is the circularity of the ortho-radial grid that makes the problem
of characterizing valid ortho-radial representations all the more complex and interesting. Barth
et al. prove such a characterization. However, the proof is existential and does not provide an efficient
algorithm for testing whether a given ortho-radial representation is valid, let alone actually
obtaining a drawing from an ortho-radial representation. In this paper we give quadratic-time
algorithms for both of these tasks. They are based on a suitably constrained left-first DFS in planar
graphs and several new insights on ortho-radial representations. Our validity check requires
quadratic time, and a naive application of it would yield a quartic algorithm for constructing a
drawing from a valid ortho-radial representation. Using further structural insights we speed
up the drawing algorithm to quadratic running time.
