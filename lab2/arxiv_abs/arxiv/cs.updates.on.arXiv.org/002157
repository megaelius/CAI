The next-generation wireless networks are evolving into very complex systems because of the very
diversified service requirements, heterogeneity in applications, devices, and networks. The
mobile network operators (MNOs) need to make the best use of the available resources, for example,
power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive,
centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches and conventional data analysis tools that
have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve
that future complex networks in terms of operation and optimization in a cost-effective way. A novel
paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self- adaptive and predictive networking is much needed. The
MNOs have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic
exploitation of the big data greatly helps in making the network smart, intelligent and facilitates
cost-effective operation and optimization. In view of this, we consider a data-driven next-generation
wireless network model, where the MNOs employ advanced data analytics for their networks. We discuss
the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics and the role of machine
learning, artificial intelligence in making the network intelligent in terms of being self-aware,
self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes are
presented with respect to data analytics. The paper is concluded with a discussion of challenges
and benefits of adopting big data analytics and artificial intelligence in the next-generation
communication system.
