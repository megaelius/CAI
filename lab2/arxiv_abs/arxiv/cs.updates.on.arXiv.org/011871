Network visualization has established as a key complement to network analysis since the large variety
of existing network layouts are able to graphically highlight different properties of networks.
However, signed networks, i.e., networks whose edges are labeled as friendly (positive) or antagonistic
(negative), are target of few of such layouts and none, to our knowledge, is able to show structural
balance, i.e., the tendency of cycles towards including an even number of negative edges, which
is a well-known theory for studying friction and polarization. In this work we present Structural-balance-viz:
a novel visualization method showing whether a connected signed network is balanced or not and,
in the latter case, how close the network is to be balanced. Structural-balance-viz exploits spectral
computations of the signed Laplacian matrix to place network's nodes in a Cartesian coordinate
system resembling a balance (a scale). Moreover, it uses edge coloring and bundling to distinguish
positive and negative interactions. The proposed visualization method has characteristics desirable
in a variety of network analysis tasks: Structural-balance-viz is able to provide indications
of balance/polarization of the whole network and of each node, to identify two factions of nodes
on the basis of their polarization, and to show their cumulative characteristics. Moreover, the
layout is reproducible and easy to compare. Structural-balance-viz is validated over synthetic-generated
networks and applied to a real-world dataset about political debates confirming that it is able
to provide meaningful interpretations.
