Lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) is becoming the dominant energy storage solution in many applications
such as hybrid electric and electric vehicles, due to its higher energy density and longer life cycle.
For these applications, the battery should perform reliably and pose no safety threats. However,
the performance of Li-ion batteries can be affected by abnormal thermal behaviors, defined as faults.
It is essential to develop reliable thermal management system to accurately predict and monitor
thermal behaviors of Li-ion battery. Using the first-principle models of batteries, this work
presents a stochastic fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithm to identify two particular
faults in the Li-ion battery cells, using easily measured quantities such as temperatures. Models
of Li-ion battery are typically derived from the underlying physical phenomena. To make model tractable
and useful, it is common to make simplifications during model development, which may consequently
introduce mismatch between models and battery cells. Further, FDD algorithms can be affected by
uncertainty, which may originate from either intrinsic time varying phenomena or model calibration
with noisy data. A two-step FDD algorithm is developed in this work to correct model of Li-ion battery
cells and to identify faulty operations from a normal operating condition. An iterative optimization
problem is proposed to correct the model by incorporating the errors between measured quantities
and model predictions, which is followed by an optimization-based FDD to provide a probabilistic
description of the occurrence of possible faults, while taking the uncertainty into account. The
two-step stochastic FDD algorithm in this work is shown to be efficient in terms of fault detection
rate for both individual and simultaneous faults in Li-ion batteries, as compared to Monte Carlo
(MC) simulations.
