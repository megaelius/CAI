The first-fit coloring is a heuristic that assigns to each vertex, arriving in a specified order
$\sigma$, the smallest available color. The problem Grundy Coloring asks how many colors are needed
for the most adversarial vertex ordering $\sigma$, i.e., the maximum number of colors that the first-fit
coloring requires over all possible vertex orderings. Since its inception by Grundy in 1939, Grundy
Coloring has been examined for its structural and algorithmic aspects. A brute-force $f(k)n^{2^{k-1}}$-time
algorithm for Grundy Coloring on general graphs is not difficult to obtain, where $k$ is the number
of colors required by the most adversarial vertex ordering. It was asked several times whether the
dependency on $k$ in the exponent of $n$ can be avoided or reduced, and its answer seemed elusive until
now. We prove that Grundy Coloring is W[1]-hard and the brute-force algorithm is essentially optimal
under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, thus settling this question by the negative. The key ingredient
in our W[1]-hardness proof is to use so-called half-graphs as a building block to transmit a color
from one vertex to another. Leveraging the half-graphs, we also prove that b-Chromatic Core is W[1]-hard,
whose parameterized complexity was posed as an open question by Panolan et al. [JCSS '17]. A natural
follow-up question is, how the parameterized complexity changes in the absence of (large) half-graphs.
We establish fixed-parameter tractability on $K_{t,t}$-free graphs for b-Chromatic Core and
Partial Grundy Coloring, making a step toward answering this question. The key combinatorial lemma
underlying the tractability result might be of independent interest.
