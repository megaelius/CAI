Millions of users on the Internet discuss a variety of topics on Question-and-Answer (Q&A) instances.
However, not all instances and topics receive the same amount of attention, as some thrive and achieve
self-sustaining levels of activity, while others fail to attract users and either never grow beyond
being a small niche community or become inactive. Hence, it is imperative to not only better understand
but also to distill deciding factors and rules that define and govern sustainable Q&A instances.
We aim to empower community managers with quantitative methods for them to better understand, control
and foster their communities, and thus contribute to making the Web a more efficient place to exchange
information. To that end, we extract, model and cluster user activity-based time series from $50$
randomly selected Q&A instances from the Stack Exchange network to characterize user behavior.
We find four distinct types of user activity temporal patterns, which vary primarily according
to the users' activity frequency. Finally, by breaking down total activity in our 50 Q&A instances
by the previously identified user activity profiles, we classify those 50 Q&A instances into three
different activity profiles. Our parsimonious categorization of Q&A instances aligns with the
stage of development and maturity of the underlying communities, and can potentially help operators
of such instances: We not only quantitatively assess progress of Q&A instances, but we also derive
practical implications for optimizing Q&A community building efforts, as we e.g. recommend which
user types to focus on at different developmental stages of a Q&A community.
