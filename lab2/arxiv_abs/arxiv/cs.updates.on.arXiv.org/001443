Let $k,d,\lambda \geqslant 1$ be integers with $d\geqslant \lambda $ and let $X$ be a finite set of
points in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. A $(d-\lambda)$-plane $L$ transversal to the convex hulls of all $k$-sets
of $X$ is called Kneser transversal. If in addition $L$ contains $(d-\lambda)+1$ points of $X$,
then $L$ is called complete Kneser transversal.In this paper, we present various results on the
existence of (complete) Kneser transversals for $\lambda =2,3$. In order to do this, we introduce
the notions of stability and instability for (complete) Kneser transversals.We first give a stability
result for collections of $d+2(k-\lambda)$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $k-\lambda\geqslant
2$ and $\lambda =2,3$. We then present a description of Kneser transversals $L$ of collections of
$d+2(k-\lambda)$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $k-\lambda\geqslant 2$ for $\lambda =2,3$. We
show that either $L$ is a complete Kneser transversal or it contains $d-2(\lambda-1)$ points and
the remaining $2(k-1)$ points of $X$ are matched in $k-1$ pairs in such a way that $L$ intersects the
corresponding closed segments determined by them. The latter leads to new upper and lower bounds
(in the case when $\lambda =2$ and $3$) for $m(k,d,\lambda)$ defined as the maximum positive integer
$n$ such that every set of $n$ points (not necessarily in general position) in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
admit a Kneser transversal.Finally, by using oriented matroid machinery, we present some computational
results (closely related to the stability and unstability notions). We determine the existence
of (complete) Kneser transversals for each of the $246$ different order types of configurations
of $7$ points in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
