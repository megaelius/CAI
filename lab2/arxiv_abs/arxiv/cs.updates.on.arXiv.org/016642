The performance of most speaker diarization systems with x-vector embeddings is both vulnerable
to noisy environments and lacks domain robustness. Earlier work on speaker diarization using generative
adversarial network (GAN) with an encoder network (ClusterGAN) to project input x-vectors into
a latent space has shown promising performance on meeting data. In this paper, we extend the ClusterGAN
network to improve diarization robustness and enable rapid generalization across various challenging
domains. To this end, we fetch the pre-trained encoder from the ClusterGAN and fine-tune it by using
prototypical loss (meta-ClusterGAN or MCGAN) under the meta-learning paradigm. Experiments
are conducted on CALLHOME telephonic conversations, AMI meeting data, DIHARD II (dev set) which
includes challenging multi-domain corpus, and two child-clinician interaction corpora (ADOS,
BOSCC) related to the autism spectrum disorder domain. Extensive analyses of the experimental
data are done to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed ClusterGAN and MCGAN embeddings
over x-vectors. The results show that the proposed embeddings with normalized maximum eigengap
spectral clustering (NME-SC) back-end consistently outperform Kaldi state-of-the-art z-vector
diarization system. Finally, we employ embedding fusion with x-vectors to provide further improvement
in diarization performance. We achieve a relative diarization error rate (DER) improvement of
6.67% to 53.93% on the aforementioned datasets using the proposed fused embeddings over x-vectors.
Besides, the MCGAN embeddings provide better performance in the number of speakers estimation
and short speech segment diarization as compared to x-vectors and ClusterGAN in telephonic data.
