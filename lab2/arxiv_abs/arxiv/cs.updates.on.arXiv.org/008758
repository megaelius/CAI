Proving that there are problems in $\mathsf{P}^\mathsf{NP}$ that require boolean circuits of
super-linear size is a major frontier in complexity theory. While such lower bounds are known for
larger complexity classes, existing results only show that the corresponding problems are hard
on infinitely many input lengths. For instance, proving almost-everywhere circuit lower bounds
is open even for problems in $\mathsf{MAEXP}$. Giving the notorious difficulty of proving lower
bounds that hold for all large input lengths, we ask the following question: Can we show that a large
set of techniques cannot prove that $\mathsf{NP}$ is easy infinitely often? Motivated by this and
related questions about the interaction between mathematical proofs and computations, we investigate
circuit complexity from the perspective of logic. Among other results, we prove that for any parameter
$k \geq 1$ it is consistent with theory $T$ that computational class $\mathcal{C} \nsubseteq \textit{i.o.}\mathsf{SIZE}(n^k)$,
where $(T, \mathcal{C})$ is one of the pairs: $T = \mathsf{T}^1_2\;$ and $\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{P}^\mathsf{NP}$,
$\quad T = \mathsf{S}^1_2\;$ and $\;{\cal C} = \mathsf{NP}$, $\quad T = \mathsf{PV}\;$ and $\;{\cal
C} = \mathsf{P}$. In other words, these theories cannot establish infinitely often circuit upper
bounds for the corresponding problems. This is of interest because the weaker theory $\mathsf{PV}$
already formalizes sophisticated arguments, such as a proof of the PCP Theorem (Pich, 2015). These
consistency statements are unconditional and improve on earlier theorems of Krajicek and Oliveira
(2017) and Bydzovsky and Muller (2018) on the consistency of lower bounds with $\mathsf{PV}$.
