One major shortcoming of popular permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is that
they are un-suitable for running Computationally Intensive smart Contracts (CICs). This prevents
such blockchains from running Machine Learning, Zero-Knowledge proofs, etc. which may need non-trivial
computation. In this paper, we present YODA, which is to the best of our knowledge the first solution
for efficient computation of CICs in permissionless blockchains that gives guarantees for a threat
model which allows both Byzantine and selfish nodes in the system. YODA selects one or more execution
sets (ES) via Sortition to execute a particular CIC off-chain. A key innovation is a MultI-Round
Adaptive Consensus using Likelihood Estimation (MiRACLE) algorithm based on sequential hypothesis
testing which allows the execution sets to be small thus making YODA efficient while ensuring correct
CIC execution with high probability. MiRACLE adapts the number of ES sets automatically depending
on the concentration of Byzantine nodes in the system and is optimal in terms of the number of ES sets
used in certain scenarios. Through a suite of economic incentives and technical mechanisms such
as the novel Randomness Inserted Contract Execution (RICE) algorithm, we force selfish nodes to
behave honestly. We also prove that the honest behavior of selfish nodes is an approximate-Nash
Equilibrium. We present the system design and details of YODA and prove the security properties
of MiRACLE and RICE. Our prototype implementation built on top of Ethereum demonstrates the ability
of YODA to run CICs with orders of magnitude higher gas per unit time as well as total gas requirements
than Ethereum currently supports. It also demonstrates the low overheads of RICE.
