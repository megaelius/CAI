Knowledge distillation, which involves extracting the "dark knowledge" from a teacher network
to guide the learning of a student network, has emerged as an important technique for model compression
and transfer learning. Unlike previous works that exploit architecture-specific cues such as
activation and attention for distillation, here we wish to explore a more general and model-agnostic
approach for extracting "richer dark knowledge" from the pre-trained teacher model. We show that
the seemingly different self-supervision task can serve as a simple yet powerful solution. For
example, when performing contrastive learning between transformed entities, the noisy predictions
of the teacher network reflect its intrinsic composition of semantic and pose information. By exploiting
the similarity between those self-supervision signals as an auxiliary task, one can effectively
transfer the hidden information from the teacher to the student. In this paper, we discuss practical
ways to exploit those noisy self-supervision signals with selective transfer for distillation.
We further show that self-supervision signals improve conventional distillation with substantial
gains under few-shot and noisy-label scenarios. Given the richer knowledge mined from self-supervision,
our knowledge distillation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks,
i.e., CIFAR100 and ImageNet, under both similar-architecture and cross-architecture settings.
The advantage is even more pronounced under the cross-architecture setting, where our method outperforms
the state of the art CRD by an average of 2.3% in accuracy rate on CIFAR100 across six different teacher-student
pairs.
