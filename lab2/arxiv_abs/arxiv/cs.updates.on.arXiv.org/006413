Modeling action units (AUs) on human faces is challenging because various AUs cause subtle facial
appearance changes over various regions at different scales. Current works have attempted to recognize
AUs by emphasizing important regions. However, the incorporation of prior knowledge into region
definition remains under-exploited, and current AU detection systems do not use regional convolutional
neural networks (R-CNN) with expert prior knowledge to directly focus on AU-related regions adaptively.
By incorporating expert prior knowledge, we propose a novel R-CNN based model named AU R-CNN. The
proposed solution offers two main contributions: (1) AU R-CNN directly observes different facial
regions, where various AUs are located. Expert prior knowledge is encoded in the region and the RoI-level
label definition. This design produces considerably better detection performance than do existing
approaches. (2) We also integrate various dynamic models (including convolutional long short-term
memory, two stream network, conditional random field, and temporal action localization network)
into AU R-CNN and then investigate and analyze the reason behind the performance of dynamic models.
Experiment results demonstrate that only static RGB image information and no optical flow-based
AU R-CNN surpasses the one fused with dynamic models. AU R-CNN is also superior to traditional CNNs
that use the same backbone on varying image resolutions. State-of-the-art recognition performance
of AU detection is achieved. The complete network is end-to-end trainable. Experiments on BP4D
and DISFA datasets show the effectiveness of our approach. Code will be made available.
