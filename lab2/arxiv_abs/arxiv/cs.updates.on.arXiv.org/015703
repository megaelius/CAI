This paper resolves two of the handful of remaining questions on the computability of market equilibria,
a central theme within algorithmic game theory (AGT). Our results are as follows: 1. We show FIXP-hardness
of computing equilibria in Arrow-Debreu markets under Leontief utility functions, and Arrow-Debreu
markets under linear utility functions and Leontief production sets. We note that these are the
first FIXP-hardness results ever since the introduction of the class FIXP and the hardness of 3-Nash
established therein. 2. We note that for the problems stated above, the corresponding results showing
membership in FIXP were established after imposing suitable sufficiency conditions to render
the problems total, as is customary in economics. However, if all instances are under consideration,
then in both cases we prove that the problem of deciding if a given instance admits an equilibrium
is \Exists-R-complete, where \Exists-R is the class of decision problems which can be reduced in
polynomial time to Existential Theory of the Reals. 3. For Arrow-Debreu markets under Leontief
utility functions and a constant number of agents, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing
an equilibrium. This settles part of an open problem of Devanur and Kannan (FOCS'08). We note that
PLC utilities are about the most general utilities of interest in economics and several fundamental
utility functions studied within AGT are special cases of it. Several important problems, which
have been shown to be in FIXP, are waiting for proofs of FIXP-hardness. In this context, our technique
of reducing from 3-Nash to Multivariate Polynomial Equations and then to the problem is likely to
be useful in the future.
