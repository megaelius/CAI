The graph parameter of pathwidth can be seen as a measure of the topological resemblance of a graph
to a path. A popular definition of pathwidth is given in terms of node search where we are given a system
of tunnels that is contaminated by some infectious substance and we are looking for a search strategy
that, at each step, either places a searcher on a vertex or removes a searcher from a vertex and where
an edge is cleaned when both endpoints are simultaneously occupied by searchers. It was proved that
the minimum number of searchers required for a successful cleaning strategy is equal to the pathwidth
of the graph plus one. Two desired characteristics for a cleaning strategy is to be monotone (no recontamination
occurs) and connected (clean territories always remain connected). Under these two demands, the
number of searchers is equivalent to a variant of pathwidth called {\em connected pathwidth}. We
prove that connected pathwidth is fixed parameter tractable, in particular we design a $2^{O(k^2)}\cdot
n$ time algorithm that checks whether the connected pathwidth of $G$ is at most $k.$ This resolves
an open question by [Dereniowski, Osula, and Rz{\k{a}}{\.{z}}ewski, Finding small-width connected
path-decompositions in polynomial time. Theor. Comput. Sci., 794:85-100, 2019]. For our algorithm,
we enrich the typical sequence technique that is able to deal with the connectivity demand. Typical
sequences have been introduced in [Bodlaender and Kloks. Efficient and constructive algorithms
for the pathwidth and treewidth of graphs. J. Algorithms, 21(2):358-402, 1996] for the design of
linear parameterized algorithms for treewidth and pathwidth. The proposed extension is based
on an encoding of the connectivity property that is quite versatile and may be adapted so to deliver
linear parameterized algorithms for the connected variants of other width parameters as well.
