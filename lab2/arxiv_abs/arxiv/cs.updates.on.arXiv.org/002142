Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a kind of nature-inspired general-purpose optimization algorithm,
and have shown empirically good performance in solving various real-word optimization problems.
However, due to the highly randomized and complex behavior, the theoretical analysis of EAs is difficult
and is an ongoing challenge, which has attracted a lot of research attentions. During the last two
decades, promising results on the running time analysis (one essential theoretical aspect) of
EAs have been obtained, while most of them focused on isolated combinatorial optimization problems,
which do not reflect the general-purpose nature of EAs. To provide a general theoretical explanation
of the behavior of EAs, it is desirable to study the performance of EAs on a general class of combinatorial
optimization problems. To the best of our knowledge, this direction has been rarely touched and
the only known result is the provably good approximation guarantees of EAs for the problem class
of maximizing monotone submodular set functions with matroid constraints, which includes many
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. The aim of this work is to contribute to this line
of research. As many combinatorial optimization problems also involve non-monotone or non-submodular
objective functions, we consider these two general problem classes, maximizing non-monotone
submodular functions without constraints and maximizing monotone non-submodular functions
with a size constraint. We prove that a simple multi-objective EA called GSEMO can generally achieve
good approximation guarantees in polynomial expected running time.
