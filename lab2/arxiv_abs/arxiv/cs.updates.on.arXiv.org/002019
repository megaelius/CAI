Person re-identification (re-id) is to match people across disjoint camera views in a multi-camera
system, and re-id has been an important technology applied in smart city in recent years. However,
the majority of existing person re-id methods are not designed for processing sequential data in
an online way. This ignores the real-world scenario that person images detected from multi-cameras
system are coming sequentially. While there is a few work on discussing online re-id, most of them
require considerable storage of all passed data samples that have been ever observed, and this could
be unrealistic for processing data from a large camera network. In this work, we present an onepass
person re-id model that adapts the re-id model based on each newly observed data and no passed data
are directly used for each update. More specifically, we develop an Sketch online Discriminant
Analysis (SoDA) by embedding sketch processing into Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). SoDA
can efficiently keep the main data variations of all passed samples in a low rank matrix when processing
sequential data samples, and estimate the approximate within-class variance (i.e. within-class
covariance matrix) from the sketch data information. We provide theoretical analysis on the effect
of the estimated approximate within-class covariance matrix. In particular, we derive upper and
lower bounds on the Fisher discriminant score (i.e. the quotient between between-class variation
and within-class variation after feature transformation) in order to investigate how the optimal
feature transformation learned by SoDA sequentially approximates the offline FDA that is learned
on all observed data. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our SoDA and
empirically support our theoretical analysis.
