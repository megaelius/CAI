High fidelity reproductions of paintings provide new opportunities to museums in preserving and
providing access to cultural heritage. This paper presents an integrated system which is able to
capture and fabricate color, topography and gloss of a painting, of which gloss capturing forms
the most important contribution. A 3D imaging system, using fringe-encoded stereo imaging, is
extended to capture spatially-varying gloss, utilizing specular reflectance polarization.
The gloss is measured by sampling the specular reflection around Brewster's angle, where these
reflections are effectively polarized, and can be separated from the unpolarized, diffuse reflectance.
Off-center gloss measurements are calibrated relative to the center measurement. Off-specular
gloss measurements, following from local variation of the surface normal, are masked based on the
height map and corrected. Shadowed regions, caused by the 3D relief, are treated similarly. The
area of a single capture is approximately 180x90mm at a resolution of 25x25micron. Aligned color,
height, and gloss tiles are stitched together, registering overlapping color areas. These maps
are inputs for a 3D printer. Two paintings were reproduced to verify the effectiveness and efficiency
of the proposed system. One painting was scanned four times, consecutively rotated by 90 degrees,
to evaluate the influence of the scanning system geometric configuration on the gloss measurement.
Experimental results show that the method is sufficiently fast for practical application. The
results can well be used for the purpose of physical reproduction and other applications needing
first-order estimates of the appearance. Our method to extend appearance scanning with gloss measurements
is a valuable addition in the quest for realistic reproductions, in terms of its practical applicability
and its perceptual added value, when added to color and topography.
