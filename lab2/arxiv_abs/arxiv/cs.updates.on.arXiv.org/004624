In this paper we study the task of approach of two mobile agents having the same limited range of vision
and moving asynchronously in the plane. This task consists in getting them in finite time within
each other's range of vision. The agents execute the same deterministic algorithm and are assumed
to have a compass showing the cardinal directions as well as a unit measure. On the other hand, they
do not share any global coordinates system (like GPS), cannot communicate and have distinct labels.
Each agent knows its label but does not know the label of the other agent or the initial position of
the other agent relative to its own. The route of an agent is a sequence of segments that are subsequently
traversed in order to achieve approach. For each agent, the computation of its route depends only
on its algorithm and its label. An adversary chooses the initial positions of both agents in the plane
and controls the way each of them moves along every segment of the routes, in particular by arbitrarily
varying the speeds of the agents. A deterministic approach algorithm is a deterministic algorithm
that always allows two agents with any distinct labels to solve the task of approach regardless of
the choices and the behavior of the adversary. The cost of a complete execution of an approach algorithm
is the length of both parts of route travelled by the agents until approach is completed. Let $\Delta$
and $l$ be the initial distance separating the agents and the length of the shortest label, respectively.
Assuming that $\Delta$ and $l$ are unknown to both agents, does there exist a deterministic approach
algorithm always working at a cost that is polynomial in $\Delta$ and $l$? In this paper, we provide
a positive answer to the above question by designing such an algorithm.
