It is not clear how to target patients who are most likely to benefit from digital care management
programs ex-ante, a shortcoming of current risk score based approaches. This study focuses on defining
impactability by identifying those patients most likely to benefit from technology enabled care
management, delivered through a digital health platform, including a mobile app and clinician
web dashboard. Anonymized insurance claims data were used from a commercially insured population
across several U.S. states and combined with inferred sociodemographic data and data derived from
the patient-held mobile application itself. Our approach involves the creation of two models and
the comparative analysis of the methodologies and performances therein. We first train a cost prediction
model to calculate the differences in predicted (without intervention) versus actual (with onboarding
onto digital health platform) healthcare expenditure for patients (N = 1,242). This enables the
classification of impactability if differences in predicted versus actual costs meet a predetermined
threshold. A random forest machine learning model was then trained to accurately categorize new
patients as impactable versus not impactable, reaching an overall accuracy of 71.9%. We then modify
these parameters through grid search to define the parameters that deliver optimal performance.
A roadmap is proposed to iteratively improve the performance of the model. As the number of newly
onboarded patients and length of use continues to increase, the accuracy of predicting impactability
will improve commensurately as more advanced machine learning techniques such as deep learning
become relevant. This approach is generalizable to analyzing the impactability of any intervention
and is a key component of realising closed loop feedback systems for continuous improvement in healthcare.
