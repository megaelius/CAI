We study a novel economic network (supply chain) comprised of wire transfers (electronic payment
transactions) among the universe of firms in Brazil (6.2 million firms). We construct a directed
and weighted network in which vertices represent cities and edges connote pairwise economic dependence
between cities. Cities (vertices) represent the collection of all firms in that location and links
denote intercity wire transfers. We find a high degree of economic integration among cities in the
trade network, which is consistent with the high degree of specialization found across Brazilian
cities. We are able to identify which cities have a dominant role in the entire supply chain process
using centrality network measures. We find that the trade network has a disassortative mixing pattern,
which is consistent with the power-law shape of the firm size distribution in Brazil. After the Brazilian
recession in 2014, we find that the disassortativity becomes even stronger as a result of the death
of many small firms and the consequent concentration of economic flows on large firms. Our results
suggest that recessions have a large impact on the trade network with meaningful and heterogeneous
economic consequences across municipalities. We run econometric exercises and find that courts
efficiency plays a dual role. From the customer perspective, it plays an important role in reducing
contractual frictions as it increases economic transactions between different cities. From the
supplier perspective, cities that are central suppliers to the supply chain seem to use courts inefficiency
as a lawsuit barrier from their customers.
