Generative models, either by simple clustering algorithms or deep neural network architecture,
have been developed as a probabilistic estimation method for dimension reduction or to model the
underlying properties of data structures. Although their apparent use has largely been limited
to image recognition and classification, generative machine learning algorithms can be a powerful
tool for travel behaviour research. In this paper, we examine the generative machine learning approach
for analyzing multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour data to understand the underlying
heterogeneity and correlation, increasing the representational power of such travel behaviour
models. We show that generative models are conceptually similar to choice selection behaviour
process through information entropy and variational Bayesian inference. Specifically, we consider
a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layer,
formulated as a variational Bayesian inference optimization problem. We systematically describe
the proposed machine learning algorithm and develop a process of analyzing travel behaviour data
from a generative learning perspective. We show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation
tests on an open dataset with multiple discrete-continuous dimensions and a size of 293,330 observations.
For interpretability, we derive analytical methods for conditional probabilities as well as elasticities.
Our results indicate that latent variables in generative models can accurately represent joint
distribution consistently w.r.t multiple discrete-continuous variables. Lastly, we show that
our model can generate statistically similar data distributions for travel forecasting and prediction.
