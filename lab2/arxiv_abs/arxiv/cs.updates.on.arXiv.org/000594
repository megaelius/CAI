Influence maximization is the task of finding a set of seed nodes in a social network such that the
influence spread of these seed nodes is maximized. Influence maximization has a wide range of applications
including viral marketing, rumor detection and control, network diffusion analysis, and even
text summarization, and thus it has been extensively studied over the past decade. Most existing
researches on influence maximization model pairwise influence strength by a single parameter.
However, pairs of individuals usually have different influence strength on different topics,
and information, ideas, innovations, rumors, etc., being propagated in networks (referred collectively
as items in this paper), are typically mixtures of topics. To address this issue, topic-aware influence
propagation models have been recently proposed, and influence analysis on real data based on their
models have been conducted (most noticeably in Barbieri et al.'s work). In this paper, we follow
this line of work and focus on the topic-aware influence maximization task. In particular, since
items to be propagated are mixtures of topics, we study preprocessing methods for these topics to
avoid redoing influence maximization for each item from scratch. We explore several preprocessing
schemes of different design choices and apply them to existing topic-aware influence model data
obtained in a couple of existing studies. We provide theoretical justifications to our algorithms,
and our empirical results demonstrate that one of our algorithms stands out as a strong candidate
providing millisecond online response time and competitive influence spread.
