Logit models are usually applied when studying individual travel behavior, i.e., to predict travel
mode choice and to gain behavioral insights on traveler preferences. Recently, some studies have
applied machine learning to model travel mode choice and reported higher out-of-sample predictive
accuracy than traditional logit models (e.g., multinomial logit). However, little research focuses
on comparing the interpretability of machine learning with logit models. In other words, how to
draw behavioral insights from the high-performance "black-box" machine-learning models remains
largely unsolved in the field of travel behavior modeling. This paper aims at providing a comprehensive
comparison between the two approaches by examining the key similarities and differences in model
development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning
models for travel mode choice modeling. To complement the theoretical discussions, the paper also
empirically evaluates the two approaches on the stated-preference survey data for a new type of
transit system integrating high-frequency fixed-route services and ridesourcing. The results
show that machine learning can produce significantly higher predictive accuracy than logit models.
Moreover, machine learning and logit models largely agree on many aspects of behavioral interpretations.
In addition, machine learning can automatically capture the nonlinear relationship between the
input features and choice outcomes. The paper concludes that there is great potential in merging
ideas from machine learning and conventional statistical methods to develop refined models for
travel behavior research and suggests some new research directions.
