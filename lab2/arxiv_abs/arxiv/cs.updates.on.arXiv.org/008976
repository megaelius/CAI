In online debates, as in offline ones, individual utterances or arguments support or attack each
other, leading to some subset of arguments winning (potentially from different sides of the debate).
However, online conversations are much larger in scale than offline ones, with often hundreds of
thousands of users weighing in, and so, readers are often forced to sample a subset of the arguments
or arguments being put forth. Since such sampling is rarely done in a principled manner, users may
not get all the relevant "winning" arguments to get a full picture of the debate from a sample. This
paper is interested in answering the question of how users should sample online conversations to
selectively favour winning arguments. We apply techniques from argumentation theory and complex
networks to build a model that predicts the probabilities of the normatively winning arguments
given their location in idealised online discussions. Online discussions are modeled as reply
networks where nodes represent the comments exchanged and directed edges represent replies that
can either be supporting or attacking. Our model shows that the proportion of replies that are supporting
in the network, the network's in-degree distribution and the locations of unrebutted arguments
("the last words") all determine the behaviour of the probability that a comment is a winning argument
given its location. This is also verified with data scraped from the online debating platform Kialo.
In predicting the locations of the winning arguments in reply networks, we can therefore suggest
which arguments a reader should sample and read if he or she would like to grasp the winning opinions
in such discussions. Our models have important implications for the design of future online discussion
platforms.
