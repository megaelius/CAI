Background: Compilers tend to produce cryptic and uninformative error messages, leaving programmers
confused and requiring them to spend precious time to resolve the underlying error. To find help,
programmers often take to online question-and-answer forums such as Stack Overflow to start discussion
threads about the errors they encountered. Aims: We conjecture that information from Stack Overflow
threads which discuss compiler errors can be automatically collected and repackaged to provide
programmers with enhanced compiler error messages, thus saving programmers' time and energy.
Method: We present Pycee, a plugin integrated with the popular Sublime Text IDE to provide enhanced
compiler error messages for the Python programming language. Pycee automatically queries Stack
Overflow to provide customised and summarised information within the IDE. We evaluated two Pycee
variants through a think-aloud user study during which 16 programmers completed Python programming
tasks while using Pycee. Results: The majority of participants agreed that Pycee was helpful while
completing the study tasks. When compared to a baseline relying on the official Python documentation
to enhance compiler error messages, participants generally preferred Pycee in terms of helpfulness,
citing concrete suggestions for fixes and example code as major benefits. Conclusions: Our results
confirm that data from online sources such as Stack Overflow can be successfully used to automatically
enhance compiler error messages. Our work opens up venues for future work to further enhance compiler
error messages as well as to automatically reuse content from Stack Overflow for other aspects of
programming.
