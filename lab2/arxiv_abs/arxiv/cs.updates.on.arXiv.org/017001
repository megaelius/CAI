SC-Flip (SCF) decoding algorithm shares the attention with the common polar code decoding approaches
due to its low-complexity and improved error-correction performance. However, the inefficient
criterion for locating the correct bit-flipping position in SCF decoding limits its improvements.
Due to its improved bit-flipping criterion, Thresholded SCF (TSCF) decoding algorithm exhibits
a superior error-correction performance and lower computational complexity than SCF decoding.
However, the parameters of TSCF decoding depend on multiple channel and code parameters, and are
obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations. Our main goal is to realize TSCF decoding as a practical polar
decoder implementation. To this end, we first realize an approximated threshold value that is independent
of the code parameters and precomputations. The proposed approximation has negligible error-correction
performance degradation on the TSCF decoding. Then, we validate an alternative approach for forming
a critical set that does not require precomputations, which also paves the way to the implementation
of the Fast-TSCF decoder. Compared to the existing fast SCF implementations, the proposed Fast-TSCF
decoder has $0.24$ to $0.41$ dB performance gain at frame error rate of $10^{-3}$, without any extra
cost. Compared to the TSCF decoding, Fast-TSCF does not depend on precomputations and requires
$87\%$ fewer decoding steps. Finally, implementation results in TSMC 65nm CMOS technology show
that the Fast-TSCF decoder is $20\%$ and $82\%$ more area-efficient than the state-of-the-art
fast SCF and fast SC-List decoder architectures, respectively.
