Energy is often the most constrained resource in networks of battery-powered devices, and as devices
become smaller, they spend a larger fraction of their energy on communication (transceiver usage)
not computation. As an imperfect proxy for true energy usage, we define energy complexity to be the
number of time slots a device transmits/listens; idle time and computation are free. In this paper
we investigate the energy complexity of fundamental communication primitives such as broadcast
in multi-hop radio networks. We consider models with collision detection (CD) and without (No-CD),
as well as both randomized and deterministic algorithms. Some take-away messages from this work
include: 1. The energy complexity of broadcast in a multi-hop network is intimately connected to
the time complexity of leader election in a single-hop (clique) network. Many existing lower bounds
on time complexity immediately transfer to energy complexity. For example, in the CD and No-CD models,
we need $\Omega(\log n)$ and $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ energy, respectively. 2. The energy lower bounds
above can almost be achieved, given sufficient ($\Omega(n)$) time. In the CD and No-CD models we
can solve broadcast using $O(\frac{\log n\log\log n}{\log\log\log n})$ energy and $O(\log^3
n)$ energy, respectively. 3. The complexity measures of Energy and Time are in conflict, and it is
an open problem whether both can be minimized simultaneously. We give a tradeoff showing it is possible
to be nearly optimal in both measures simultaneously. For any constant $\epsilon>0$, broadcast
can be solved in $O(D^{1+\epsilon}\log^{O(1/\epsilon)} n)$ time with $O(\log^{O(1/\epsilon)}
n)$ energy, where $D$ is the diameter of the network.
