Given a finite point set $P$ in general position in the plane, a full triangulation is a maximal straight-line
embedded plane graph on $P$. A partial triangulation on $P$ is a full triangulation of some subset
$P'$ of $P$ containing all extreme points in $P$. A bistellar flip on a partial triangulation either
flips an edge, removes a non-extreme point of degree 3, or adds a point in $P \setminus P'$ as vertex
of degree 3. The bistellar flip graph has all partial triangulations as vertices; a pair of partial
triangulations is adjacent if they can be obtained from one another by a bistellar flip. The goal
of this paper is to investigate the structure of this graph, with emphasis on connectivity. For sets
$P$ of $n$ points in general position, we show that the bistellar flip graph is $(n-3)$-connected,
answering, for sets in general position, an open questions raised in a book (by De Loera, Rambau,
and Santos) and a survey (by Lee and Santos). This matches the situation for regular triangulations
(partial triangulations obtained by lifting the points and projecting the lower convex hull),
where $(n-3)$-connectivity has been known since the 1980s via the secondary polytope (Gelfand,
Kapranov, Zelevinsky) and Balinski's Theorem. Our methods yield further results for regular triangulations.
Among others, we show that there are arbitrarily large sets P with non-regular partial triangulations,
while every proper subset has only regular triangulations, i.e., there are no small certificates
for the existence of non-regular partial triangulations (answering a question by F. Santos in the
unexpected direction).
