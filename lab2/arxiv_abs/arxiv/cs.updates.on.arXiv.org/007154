Recent advances in deep learning have improved the segmentation accuracy of subcortical brain
structures, which would be useful in neuroimaging studies of many neurological disorders. However,
most of the previous deep learning work does not investigate the specific difficulties that exist
in segmenting extremely small but important brain regions such as the amygdala and its subregions.
To tackle this challenging task, a novel 3D Bayesian fully convolutional neural network was developed
to apply a dilated dualpathway approach that retains fine details and utilizes both local and more
global contextual information to automatically segment the amygdala and its subregions at high
precision. The proposed method provides insights on network design and sampling strategy that
target segmentations of small 3D structures. In particular, this study confirms that a large context,
enabled by a large field of view, is beneficial for segmenting small objects; furthermore, precise
contextual information enabled by dilated convolutions allows for better boundary localization,
which is critical for examining the morphology of the structure. In addition, it is demonstrated
that the uncertainty information estimated from our network may be leveraged to identify atypicality
in data. Our method was compared with two state-of-the-art deep learning models and a traditional
multi-atlas approach, and exhibited excellent performance as measured both by Dice overlap as
well as average symmetric surface distance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first deep
learning-based approach that targets the subregions of the amygdala.
