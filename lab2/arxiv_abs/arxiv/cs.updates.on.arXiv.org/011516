Motivated by the growing popularity of smart TVs, we present a large-scale measurement study of
smart TVs by collecting and analyzing their network traffic from two different vantage points.
First, we analyze aggregate network traffic of smart TVs in-the-wild, collected from residential
gateways of tens of homes and several different smart TV platforms, including Apple, Samsung, Roku,
and Chromecast. In addition to accessing video streaming and cloud services, we find that smart
TVs frequently connect to well-known as well as platform-specific advertising and tracking services
(ATS). Second, we instrument Roku and Amazon Fire TV, two popular smart TV platforms, by setting
up a controlled testbed to systematically exercise the top-1000 apps on each platform, and analyze
their network traffic at the granularity of the individual apps. We again find that smart TV apps
connect to a wide range of ATS, and that the key players of the ATS ecosystems of the two platforms are
different from each other and from that of the mobile platform. Third, we evaluate the (in)effectiveness
of state-of-the-art DNS-based blocklists in filtering advertising and tracking traffic for smart
TVs. We find that personally identifiable information (PII) is exfiltrated to platform-related
Internet endpoints and third parties, and that blocklists are generally better at preventing exposure
of PII to third parties than to platform-related endpoints. Our work demonstrates the segmentation
of the smart TV ATS ecosystem across platforms and its differences from the mobile ATS ecosystem,
thus motivating the need for designing privacy-enhancing tools specifically for each smart TV
platform.
