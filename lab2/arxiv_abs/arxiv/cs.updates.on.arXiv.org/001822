Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have been considered as a key technology for next generation
cellular systems and Wi-Fi networks because of its advances in providing orders-of-magnitude
wider bandwidth than current wireless networks. Economical and energy efficient analog/digial
hybrid precoding and combining transceivers have been often proposed for mmWave massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems to overcome the severe propagation loss of mmWave channels. One
major shortcoming of existing solutions lies in the assumption of infinite or high-resolution
phase shifters (PSs) to realize the analog beamformers. However, low-resolution PSs are typically
adopted in practice to reduce the hardware cost and power consumption. Motivated by this fact, in
this paper, we investigate the practical design of hybrid precoders and combiners with low-resolution
PSs in mmWave MIMO systems. In particular, we propose an iterative algorithm which successively
designs the low-resolution analog precoder and combiner pair for each data stream, aiming at conditionally
maximizing the spectral efficiency. Then, the digital precoder and combiner are computed based
on the obtained effective baseband channel to further enhance the spectral efficiency. In an effort
to achieve an even more hardware-efficient large antenna array, we also investigate the design
of hybrid beamformers with one-bit resolution (binary) PSs, and present a novel binary analog precoder
and combiner optimization algorithm with quadratic complexity in the number of antennas. The proposed
low-resolution hybrid beamforming design is further extended to multiuser MIMO communication
systems. Simulation results demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed algorithms
compared to existing low-resolution hybrid beamforming designs, particularly for the one-bit
resolution PS scenario.
