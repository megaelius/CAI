Standard estimators of the global average treatment effect can be biased in the presence of interference.
This paper proposes regression adjustment estimators for removing bias due to interference in
Bernoulli randomized experiments. We use a fitted model to predict the counterfactual outcomes
of global control and global treatment. Our work differs from standard regression adjustments
in that the adjustment variables are constructed from functions of the treatment assignment vector,
and that we allow the researcher to use a collection of any functions correlated with the response,
turning the problem of detecting interference into a feature engineering problem. We characterize
the distribution of the proposed estimator in a linear model setting and connect the results to the
standard theory of regression adjustments under SUTVA. We then propose an estimator that allows
for flexible machine learning estimators to be used for fitting a nonlinear interference functional
form. We propose conducting statistical inference via bootstrap and resampling methods, which
allow us to sidestep the complicated dependences implied by interference and instead rely on empirical
covariance structures. Such variance estimation relies on an exogeneity assumption akin to the
standard unconfoundedness assumption invoked in observational studies. In simulation experiments,
our methods are better at debiasing estimates than existing inverse propensity weighted estimators
based on neighborhood exposure modeling. We use our method to reanalyze an experiment concerning
weather insurance adoption conducted on a collection of villages in rural China.
