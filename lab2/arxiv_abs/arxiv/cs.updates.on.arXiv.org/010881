The conditioning of implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) integration for linear finite element approximation
of diffusion equations on general anisotropic meshes is investigated. Bounds are established
for the condition number of the resulting linear system with and without diagonal preconditioning
for the implicit Euler and general implicit RK methods. Two solution strategies are considered
for the linear system resulting from general implicit RK integration: the simultaneous solution
(the system is solved as a whole) and a successive solution which follows the commonly used implementation
of implicit RK methods to first transform the system into smaller systems using the Jordan normal
form of the RK matrix and then solve them successively. For the simultaneous solution in case of a
positive semidefinite symmetric part of the RK coefficient matrix and for the successive solution
it is shown that . If the smallest eigenvalue of the symmetric part of the RK coefficient matrix is
negative and the simultaneous solution strategy is used, an upper bound on the time step is given
so that the system matrix is positive definite. The obtained bounds for the condition number have
explicit geometric interpretations and take the interplay between the diffusion matrix and the
mesh geometry into full consideration. They show that there are three mesh-dependent factors that
can affect the conditioning: the number of elements, the mesh nonuniformity measured in the Euclidean
metric, and the mesh nonuniformity with respect to the inverse of the diffusion matrix. They also
reveal that the preconditioning using the diagonal of the system matrix, the mass matrix, or the
lumped mass matrix can effectively eliminate the effects of the mesh nonuniformity measured in
the Euclidean metric. Numerical examples are given.
