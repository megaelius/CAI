In the coming years, the interconnection of a large number of devices is expected, which will lead
to a new form of interaction between the real and the virtual world. In this promising scenario, known
as the Internet of Things, it is expected that different objects, such as sensors, industrial robots,
cars, appliances, will be connected to the Internet. One of the main challenges of the Internet of
Things is the interoperability of highly heterogeneous devices, mainly in terms of the communication
capabilities and network protocols used. As consequence, the interconnection model of the different
devices involves an intermediary device, known as gateway. This gateway is a centralized element
for the management of the devices that make up an IoT application. In addition, it is essential for
the transmission of information to the Internet, especially when many IoT devices are not IP-based.
This paper describes the implementation of an IoT gateway that allows the exchange of data through
different wireless technologies and forwarding of such data to the Internet. The proposed gateway
has important advantages such as: supporting for multiprotocol interconnectivity; remote configuration
of wireless nodes for sensor and actuators management; a flexible algorithm to translate the data
obtained by sensors into a uniform format for transmission to a cloud server; low energy consumption
due to efficient data transfer over the MQTT protocol. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of
the developed gateway, a proof-of-concept test was implemented. The implemented scenario consists
of 2 wireless nodes responsible for sensing environmental variables and transmitting data to the
gateway node through different communication protocols. The obtained results show the feasibility
for simultaneous data transmission from the remote wireless nodes to the gateway.
