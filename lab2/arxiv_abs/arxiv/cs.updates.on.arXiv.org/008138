This work is about graphs arising from Reuleaux polyhedra. Such graphs must necessarily be planar,
$3$-connected and strongly self-dual. We study the question of when these conditions are sufficient.
If $G$ is any such a graph with isomorphism $\tau : G \to G^*$ (where $G^*$ is the unique dual graph),
a metric mapping is a map $\eta : V(G) \to \mathbb R^3$ such that the diameter of $\eta(G)$ is $1$ and
for every pair of vertices $(u,v)$ such that $u\in \tau(v)$ we have dist$(\eta(u),\eta(v)) = 1$.
If $\eta$ is injective, it is called a metric embedding. Note that a metric embedding gives rise to
a Reuleaux Polyhedra. Our contributions are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any planar, $3$-connected,
strongly self-dual graph has a metric mapping by proving that the chromatic number of the diameter
graph (whose vertices are $V(G)$ and whose edges are pairs $(u,v)$ such that $u\in \tau(v)$) is at
most $4$, which means there exists a metric mapping to the tetrahedron. Furthermore, we use the Lov\'asz
neighborhood-complex theorem in algebraic topology to prove that the chromatic number of the diameter
graph is exactly $4$. Secondly, we develop algorithms that allow us to obtain every such graph with
up to $14$ vertices. Furthermore, we numerically construct metric embeddings for every such graph.
From the theorem and this computational evidence we conjecture that every such graph is realizable
as a Reuleaux polyhedron in $\mathbb R^3$. In previous work the first and last authors described
a method to construct a constant-width body from a Reuleaux polyhedron. So in essence, we also construct
hundreds of new examples of constant-width bodies. This is related to a problem of V\'azsonyi, and
also to a problem of Blaschke-Lebesgue.
