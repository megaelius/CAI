Due to escalating healthcare costs, accurately predicting which patients will incur high costs
is an important task for payers and providers of healthcare. High-cost claimants (HiCCs) are patients
who have annual costs above $\$250,000$ and who represent just 0.16% of the insured population but
currently account for 9% of all healthcare costs. In this study, we aimed to develop a high-performance
algorithm to predict HiCCs to inform a novel care management system. Using health insurance claims
from 48 million people and augmented with census data, we applied machine learning to train binary
classification models to calculate the personal risk of HiCC. To train the models, we developed
a platform starting with 6,006 variables across all clinical and demographic dimensions and constructed
over one hundred candidate models. The best model achieved an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve of 91.2%. The model exceeds the highest published performance (84%) and remains
high for patients with no prior history of high-cost status (89%), who have less than a full year of
enrollment (87%), or lack pharmacy claims data (88%). It attains an area under the precision-recall
curve of 23.1%, and precision of 74% at a threshold of 0.99. A care management program enrolling 500
people with the highest HiCC risk is expected to treat 199 true HiCCs and generate a net savings of
$\$7.3$ million per year. Our results demonstrate that high-performing predictive models can
be constructed using claims data and publicly available data alone, even for rare high-cost claimants
exceeding $\$250,000$. Our model demonstrates the transformational power of machine learning
and artificial intelligence in care management, which would allow healthcare payers and providers
to introduce the next generation of care management programs.
