As the largest e-commerce platform, Taobao helps advertisers reach billions of search requests
each day with its sponsored search service, which has also contributed considerable revenue to
the platform. How to design a suit of marketing optimization tool to cater various advertiser demands
while balancing platform revenue and consumer experience is significant to a healthy and sustainable
marketing ecosystem, among which bidding strategy plays a critical role. Traditional keyword-level
bidding optimization only provides a coarse-grained match between advertisement and impression.
Meanwhile impression-level expected value bidder is not applicable to various demand optimization
of massive advertisers, not to mention its lack of mechanism to balance benefits of three parties.
In this paper we propose \emph{Customer Intelligent Agent}, a bidding optimization framework
which designs an impression-level bidding strategy to reflect advertiser's conversion willingness
and budget control. In this way, with a simplified control ability for advertisers, CIA is capable
of fulfilling various e-commerce advertiser demands in different levels, such as GMV optimization,
style comparison etc. Additionally, a replay based simulation system is designed to predict the
performance of different take-rate. CIA unifies the benefits of three parties in the marketing
ecosystem without changing the classic expected Cost Per Mille mechanism. Our extensive offline
simulations and large-scale online experiments on \emph{Taobao Search Advertising} platform
verify the high effectiveness of the CIA framework. Moreover, CIA has been deployed online as a major
bidding tool for advertisers in TSA.
