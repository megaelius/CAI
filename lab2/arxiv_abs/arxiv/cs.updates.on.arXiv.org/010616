Brouwer's fixed point theorem states that any continuous function from a compact convex space to
itself has a fixed point. Roughgarden and Weinstein (FOCS 2016) initiated the study of fixed point
computation in the two-player communication model, where each player gets a function from $[0,1]^n$
to $[0,1]^n$, and their goal is to find an approximate fixed point of the composition of the two functions.
They left it as an open question to show a lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$ for the (randomized) communication
complexity of this problem, in the range of parameters which make it a total search problem. We answer
this question affirmatively. Additionally, we introduce two natural fixed point problems in the
two-player communication model. $\bullet$ Each player is given a function from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]^{n/2}$,
and their goal is to find an approximate fixed point of the concatenation of the functions. $\bullet$
Each player is given a function from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]^{n}$, and their goal is to find an approximate
fixed point of the interpolation of the functions. We show a randomized communication complexity
lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$ for these problems (for some constant approximation factor). Finally,
we initiate the study of finding a panchromatic simplex in a Sperner-coloring of a triangulation
(guaranteed by Sperner's lemma) in the two-player communication model: A triangulation $T$ of
the $d$-simplex is publicly known and one player is given a set $S_A\subset T$ and a coloring function
from $S_A$ to $\{0,\ldots ,d/2\}$, and the other player is given a set $S_B\subset T$ and a coloring
function from $S_B$ to $\{d/2+1,\ldots ,d\}$, such that $S_A\dot\cup S_B=T$, and their goal is
to find a panchromatic simplex. We show a randomized communication complexity lower bound of $|T|^{\Omega(1)}$
for the aforementioned problem as well.
