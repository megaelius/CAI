A well-known challenge in beamforming is how to optimally utilize the degrees of freedom (DoF) of
the array to design a robust beamformer, especially when the array DoF is smaller than the number
of sources in the environment. In this paper, we leverage the tool of constrained convex optimization
and propose a penalized inequality-constrained minimum variance (P-ICMV) beamformer to address
this challenge. Specifically, we propose a beamformer with a well-targeted objective function
and inequality constraints to achieve the design goals. The constraints on interferences penalize
the maximum gain of the beamformer at any interfering directions. This can efficiently mitigate
the total interference power regardless of whether the number of interfering sources is less than
the array DoF or not. Multiple robust constraints on the target protection and interference suppression
can be introduced to increase the robustness of the beamformer against steering vector mismatch.
By integrating the noise reduction, interference suppression, and target protection, the proposed
formulation can efficiently obtain a robust beamformer design while optimally trade off various
design goals. When the array DoF is fewer than the number of interferences, the proposed formulation
can effectively align the limited DoF to all of the sources to obtain the best overall interference
suppression. $\ $To numerically solve this problem, we formulate the P-ICMV beamformer design
as a convex second-order cone program (SOCP) and propose a low complexity iterative algorithm based
on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Three applications are simulated to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.
