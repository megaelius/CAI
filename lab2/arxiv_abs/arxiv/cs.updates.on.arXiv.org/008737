Modern applications significantly enhance user experience by adapting to each user's individual
condition and/or preferences. While this adaptation can greatly improve a user's experience or
be essential for the application to work, the exposure of user data to the application presents a
significant privacy threat to the users\textemdash even when the traces are anonymized\textemdash
since the statistical matching of an anonymized trace to prior user behavior can identify a user
and their habits. Because of the current and growing algorithmic and computational capabilities
of adversaries, provable privacy guarantees as a function of the degree of anonymization and obfuscation
of the traces are necessary. Our previous work has established the requirements on anonymization
and obfuscation in the case that data traces are independent between users. However, the data traces
of different users will be dependent in many applications, and an adversary can potentially exploit
such. In this paper, we consider the impact of dependency between user traces on their privacy. First,
we demonstrate that the adversary can readily identify the association graph of the obfuscated
and anonymized version of the data, revealing which user data traces are dependent. Next, we demonstrate
that the adversary can use this association graph to break user privacy with significantly shorter
traces than in the case of independent users, and that obfuscating data traces independently across
users is often insufficient to remedy such leakage. Finally, we discuss how users can improve privacy
by employing joint obfuscation that removes or reduces the data dependency.
