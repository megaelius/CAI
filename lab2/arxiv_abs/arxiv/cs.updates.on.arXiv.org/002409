Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant interest recently in assisting wireless
communication due to their high maneuverability, flexible deployment, and low cost. This paper
considers a multi-UAV enabled wireless communication system, where multiple UAV-mounted aerial
base stations (BSs) are employed to serve a group of users on the ground. To achieve fair performance
among users, we maximize the minimum throughput over all ground users in the downlink communication
by optimizing the multiuser communication scheduling and association jointly with the UAVs' trajectory
and power control. The formulated problem is a mixed integer non-convex optimization problem that
is challenging to solve. As such, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm for solving it by applying
the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Specifically, the
user scheduling and association, UAV trajectory, and transmit power are alternately optimized
in each iteration. In particular, for the non-convex UAV trajectory and transmit power optimization
problems, two approximate convex optimization problems are solved, respectively. We further
show that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to at least a locally optimal solution.
To speed up the algorithm convergence and achieve good throughput, a low-complexity and systematic
initialization scheme is also proposed for the UAV trajectory design based on the simple circular
trajectory and the circle packing scheme. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate
the significant throughput gains of the proposed design as compared to other benchmark schemes.
