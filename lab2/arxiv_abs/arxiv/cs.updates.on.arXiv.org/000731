The Data Access System (DAS) is a metadata and data management software system, providing a reusable
solution for the storage of data acquired both from telescopes and auxiliary data sources during
the instrument development phases and operations. It is part of the Customizable Instrument WorkStation
system (CIWS-FW), a framework for the storage, processing and quick-look at the data acquired from
scientific instruments. The DAS provides a data access layer mainly targeted to software applications:
quick-look displays, pre-processing pipelines and scientific workflows. It is logically organized
in three main components: an intuitive and compact Data Definition Language (DAS DDL) in XML format,
aimed for user-defined data types; an Application Programming Interface (DAS API), automatically
adding classes and methods supporting the DDL data types, and providing an object-oriented query
language; a data management component, which maps the metadata of the DDL data types in a relational
Data Base Management System (DBMS), and stores the data in a shared (network) file system. With the
DAS DDL, developers define the data model for a particular project, specifying for each data type
the metadata attributes, the data format and layout (if applicable), and named references to related
or aggregated data types. Together with the DDL user-defined data types, the DAS API acts as the only
interface to store, query and retrieve the metadata and data in the DAS system, providing both an
abstract interface and a data model specific one in C, C++ and Python. The mapping of metadata in the
back-end database is automatic and supports several relational DBMSs, including MySQL, Oracle
and PostgreSQL.
