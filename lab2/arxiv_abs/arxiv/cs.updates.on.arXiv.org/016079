We examine some combinatorial properties of parallel cut elimination in multiplicative linear
logic (MLL) proof nets. We show that, provided we impose a constraint on some paths, we can bound the
size of all the nets satisfying this constraint and reducing to a fixed resultant net. This result
gives a sufficient condition for an infinite weighted sum of nets to reduce into another sum of nets,
while keeping coefficients finite. We moreover show that our constraints are stable under reduction.
Our approach is motivated by the quantitative semantics of linear logic: many models have been proposed,
whose structure reflect the Taylor expansion of multiplicative exponential linear logic (MELL)
proof nets into infinite sums of differential nets. In order to simulate one cut elimination step
in MELL, it is necessary to reduce an arbitrary number of cuts in the differential nets of its Taylor
expansion. It turns out our results apply to differential nets, because their cut elimination is
essentially multiplicative. We moreover show that the set of differential nets that occur in the
Taylor expansion of an MELL net automatically satisfies our constraints. Interestingly, our nets
are untyped: we only rely on the sequentiality of linear logic nets and the dynamics of cut elimination.
The paths on which we impose bounds are the switching paths involved in the Danos--Regnier criterion
for sequentiality. In order to accommodate multiplicative units and weakenings, our nets come
equipped with jumps: each weakening node is connected to some other node. Our constraint can then
be summed up as a bound on both the length of switching paths, and the number of weakenings that jump
to a common node.
