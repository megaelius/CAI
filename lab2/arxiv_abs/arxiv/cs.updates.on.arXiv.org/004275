Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) is an intra-operative imaging modality that facilitates observing
and appraising the vessel wall structure of the human coronary arteries. Segmentation of arterial
wall boundaries from the IVUS images is not only crucial for quantitative analysis of the vessel
walls and plaque characteristics, but is also necessary for generating 3D reconstructed models
of the artery. The aim of this study is twofold. Firstly, we investigate the feasibility of using
a recently proposed region detector, namely Extremal Region of Extremum Level (EREL) to delineate
the luminal and media-adventitia borders in IVUS frames acquired by 20 MHz probes. Secondly, we
propose a region selection strategy to label two ERELs as lumen and media based on the stability of
their textural information. We extensively evaluated our selection strategy on the test set of
a standard publicly available dataset containing 326 IVUS B-mode images. We showed that in the best
case, the average Hausdorff Distances (HD) between the extracted ERELs and the actual lumen and
media were $0.22$ mm and $0.45$ mm, respectively. The results of our experiments revealed that our
selection strategy was able to segment the lumen with $\le 0.3$ mm HD to the gold standard even though
the images contained major artifacts such as bifurcations, shadows, and side branches. Moreover,
when there was no artifact, our proposed method was able to delineate media-adventitia boundaries
with $0.31$ mm HD to the gold standard. Furthermore, our proposed segmentation method runs in time
that is linear in the number of pixels in each frame. Based on the results of this work, by using a 20
MHz IVUS probe with controlled pullback, not only can we now analyze the internal structure of human
arteries more accurately, but also segment each frame during the pullback procedure because of
the low run time of our proposed segmentation method.
