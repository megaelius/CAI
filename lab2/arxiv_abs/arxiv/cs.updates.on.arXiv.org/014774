Motivation: High throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies generate an excessive number of
small DNA segments -called short reads- that cause significant computational burden. To analyze
the entire genome, each of the billions of short reads must be mapped to a reference genome based on
the similarity between a read and "candidate" locations in that reference genome. The similarity
measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate string matching problem, is the computational
bottleneck because: (1) it is implemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms,
and (2) the majority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a given read
due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such incorrect candidate locations consumes
an overwhelming majority of a modern read mapper's execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop
a fast and effective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate them before
using computationally costly alignment operations. Results: We propose GateKeeper, a new hardware
accelerator that functions as a pre-alignment step that quickly filters out most incorrect candidate
locations. GateKeeper is the first design to accelerate pre-alignment using Field-Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can perform pre-alignment much faster than software. GateKeeper can
be integrated with any mapper that performs sequence alignment for verification. When implemented
on a single FPGA chip, GateKeeper maintains high accuracy (on average >96%) while providing up to
105-fold and 215-fold speedup over the state-of-the-art software pre-alignment techniques,
Adjacency Filter and Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD), respectively. Availability: GateKeeper
