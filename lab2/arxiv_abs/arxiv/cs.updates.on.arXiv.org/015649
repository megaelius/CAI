Safety is a top priority for civil aviation. Data mining in digital Flight Data Recorder (FDR) or
Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data, commonly referred as black box data on aircraft, has gained interest
from researchers, airlines, and aviation regulation agencies for safety management. New anomaly
detection methods based on supervised or unsupervised learning have been developed to monitor
pilot operations and detect any risks from onboard digital flight data recorder data. However,
all existing anomaly detection methods are offline learning - the models are trained once using
historical data and used for all future predictions. In practice, new QAR data are generated by every
flight and collected by airlines whenever a datalink is available. Offline methods cannot respond
to new data in time. Though these offline models can be updated by being re-trained after adding new
data to the original training set, it is time-consuming and computational costly to train a new model
every time new data come in. To address this problem, we propose a novel incremental anomaly detection
method to identify common patterns and detect outliers in flight operations from FDR data. The proposed
method is based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). An initial GMM cluster model is trained on historical
offline data. Then, it continuously adapts to new incoming data points via an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. To track changes in flight operation patterns, only model parameters need to be
saved, not the raw flight data. The proposed method was tested on two sets of simulation data. Comparable
results were found from the proposed online method and a classic offline model. A real-world application
of the proposed method is demonstrated using FDR data from daily operations of an airline. Results
are presented and future challenges of using online learning scheme for flight data analytics are
discussed.
