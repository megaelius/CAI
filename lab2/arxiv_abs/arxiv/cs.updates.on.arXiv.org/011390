There is increasing interest in using deep learning approach for EEG analysis as there are still
rooms for the improvement of EEG analysis in its accuracy. Convolutional long short-term (CNNLSTM)
has been successfully applied in time series data with spatial structure through end-to-end learning.
Here, we proposed a CNNLSTM based neural network architecture termed EEG_CNNLSTMNet for the classification
of EEG signals in response to grating stimuli with different spatial frequencies. EEG_CNNLSTMNet
comprises two convolutional layers and one bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer.
The convolutional layers capture local temporal characteristics of the EEG signal at each channel
as well as global spatial characteristics across channels, while the LSTM layer extracts long-term
temporal dependency of EEG signals. Our experiment showed that EEG_CNNLSTMNet performed much
better at EEG classification than a traditional machine learning approach, i.e. a support vector
machine (SVM) with features. Additionally, EEG_CNNLSTMNet outperformed EEGNet, a state-of-art
neural network architecture for the intra-subject case. We infer that the underperformance when
using an LSTM layer in the inter-subject case is due to long-term dependency characteristics in
the EEG signal that vary greatly across subjects. Moreover, the inter-subject fine-tuned classification
model using very little data of the new subject achieved much higher accuracy than that trained only
on the data from the other subjects. Our study suggests that the fine-tuned inter-subject model
can be a potential end-to-end EEG analysis method considering both the accuracy and the required
training data of the new subject.
