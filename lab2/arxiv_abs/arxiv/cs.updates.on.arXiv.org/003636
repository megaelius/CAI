In this paper, we prove new relations between the bias of multilinear forms, the correlation between
multilinear forms and lower degree polynomials, and the rank of tensors over $GF(2)= \{0,1\}$.
We show the following results for multilinear forms and tensors. 1. Correlation bounds : We show
that a random $d$-linear form has exponentially low correlation with low-degree polynomials.
More precisely, for $d \ll 2^{o(k)}$, we show that a random $d$-linear form $f(X_1,X_2, \dots, X_d)
: \left(GF(2)^{k}\right)^d \rightarrow GF(2)$ has correlation $2^{-k(1-o(1))}$ with any polynomial
of degree at most $d/10$. This result is proved by giving near-optimal bounds on the bias of random
$d$-linear form, which is in turn proved by giving near-optimal bounds on the probability that a
random rank-$t$ $d$-linear form is identically zero. 2. Tensor-rank vs Bias : We show that if a $d$-dimensional
tensor has small rank, then the bias of the associated $d$-linear form is large. More precisely,
given any $d$-dimensional tensor $$T :\underbrace{[k]\times \ldots [k]}_{\text{$d$ times}}\to
GF(2)$$ of rank at most $t$, the bias of the associated $d$-linear form $$f_T(X_1,\ldots,X_d) :=
\sum_{(i_1,\dots,i_d) \in [k]^d} T(i_1,i_2,\ldots, i_d) X_{1,i_1}\cdot X_{1,i_2}\cdots X_{d,i_d}$$
is at least $\left(1-\frac1{2^{d-1}}\right)^t$. The above bias vs tensor-rank connection suggests
a natural approach to proving nontrivial tensor-rank lower bounds for $d=3$. In particular, we
use this approach to prove that the finite field multiplication tensor has tensor rank at least $3.52
k$ matching the best known lower bound for any explicit tensor in three dimensions over $GF(2)$.
