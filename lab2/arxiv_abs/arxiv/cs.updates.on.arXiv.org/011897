This paper considers a collaborative tracking control problem using a group of fixed-wing unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) with constant and non-identical speeds. The dynamics of fixed-wing UAVs
are modelled by unicycle-type equations, with nonholonomic constraints by assuming that UAVs
fly at constant altitudes in the nominal operation mode. The control focus is on the design of a collective
tracking controller such that all fixed-wing UAVs as a group can collaboratively track a desired
target's position and velocity. We first present conditions on the relative speeds of tracking
UAVs and the target to ensure that the tracking objective can be achieved when UAVs are subject to
constant speed constraints. We construct a reference velocity that includes both the target's
velocity and position as feedback, which is to be tracked by the group centroid. In this way, all vehicles'
headings are controlled such that the group centroid follows a reference trajectory that successfully
tracks the target's trajectory. We consider three cases of reference velocity tracking: the constant
velocity case, the turning velocity case with constant speed, and the time-varying velocity case.
An additive spacing controller is further devised to ensure that all vehicles stay close to the group
centroid trajectory. Trade-offs in the controller design and performance limitations of the target
tracking control due to the constant-speed constraint are also discussed in detail. Experimental
results with three fixed-wing UAVs tracking a target rotorcraft are shown to validate the effectiveness
and performance of the proposed tracking controllers.
