Currently, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is dependent upon a subjective, time-consuming
evaluation of behavioral tests by an expert clinician. Non-invasive functional MRI (fMRI) characterizes
brain connectivity and may be used to inform diagnoses and democratize medicine. However, successful
construction of deep learning models from fMRI requires addressing key choices about the model's
architecture, including the number of layers and number of neurons per layer. Meanwhile, deriving
functional connectivity (FC) features from fMRI requires choosing an atlas with an appropriate
level of granularity. Once a model has been built, it is vital to determine which features are predictive
of ASD and if similar features are learned across atlas granularity levels. To identify aptly suited
architectural configurations, probability distributions of the configurations of high versus
low performing models are compared. To determine the effect of atlas granularity, connectivity
features are derived from atlases with 3 levels of granularity and important features are ranked
with permutation feature importance. Results show the highest performing models use between 2-4
hidden layers and 16-64 neurons per layer, granularity dependent. Connectivity features identified
as important across all 3 atlas granularity levels include FC to the supplementary motor gyrus and
language association cortex, regions associated with deficits in social and sensory processing
in ASD. Importantly, the cerebellum, often not included in functional analyses, is also identified
as a region whose abnormal connectivity is highly predictive of ASD. Results of this study identify
important regions to include in future studies of ASD, help assist in the selection of network architectures,
and help identify appropriate levels of granularity to facilitate the development of accurate
diagnostic models of ASD.
