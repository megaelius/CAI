In this paper, we introduce the concept of spatially coupled turbo-like codes (SC-TCs) as the spatial
coupling of a number of turbo-like code ensembles. In particular, we consider the spatial coupling
of Berrou et al. parallel concatenated codes (PCCs) and Benedetto et al. serially concatenated
codes (SCCs). Furthermore, we propose two extensions of braided convolutional codes (BCCs), a
class of turbo-like codes which have an inherent spatially coupled structure, to higher coupling
memories, and show that these yield improved belief propagation (BP) thresholds as compared to
the original BCC ensemble. We derive the exact density evolution (DE) equations for SC-TCs and analyze
their asymptotic behavior on the binary erasure channel. We also consider the construction of families
of rate-compatible SC-TC ensembles. Our numerical results show that threshold saturation of the
belief propagation (BP) decoding threshold to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying
uncoupled ensembles occurs for large enough coupling memory. The improvement of the BP threshold
is especially significant for SCCs and BCCs, whose uncoupled ensembles suffer from a poor BP threshold.
For a wide range of code rates, SC-TCs show close-to-capacity performance as the coupling memory
increases. We further give a proof of threshold saturation for SC-TC ensembles with identical component
encoders. In particular, we show that the DE of SC-TC ensembles with identical component encoders
can be properly rewritten as a scalar recursion. This allows us to define potential functions and
prove threshold saturation using the proof technique recently introduced by Yedla et al..
