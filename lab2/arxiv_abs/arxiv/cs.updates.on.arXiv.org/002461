A large number of applications such as querying sensor networks, and analyzing protein-protein
interaction (PPI) networks, rely on mining uncertain graph and hypergraph databases. In this work
we study the following problem: given an uncertain, weighted (hyper)graph, how can we efficiently
find a (hyper)matching with high expected reward, and low risk? This problem naturally arises in
the context of several important applications, such as online dating, kidney exchanges, and team
formation. We introduce a novel formulation for finding matchings with maximum expected reward
and bounded risk under a general model of uncertain weighted (hyper)graphs that we introduce in
this work. Our model generalizes probabilistic models used in prior work, and captures both continuous
and discrete probability distributions, thus allowing to handle privacy related applications
that inject appropriately distributed noise to (hyper)edge weights. Given that our optimization
problem is NP-hard, we turn our attention to designing efficient approximation algorithms. For
the case of uncertain weighted graphs, we provide a $\frac{1}{3}$-approximation algorithm, and
a $\frac{1}{5}$-approximation algorithm with near optimal run time. For the case of uncertain
weighted hypergraphs, we provide a $\Omega(\frac{1}{k})$-approximation algorithm, where $k$
is the rank of the hypergraph (i.e., any hyperedge includes at most $k$ nodes), that runs in almost
(modulo log factors) linear time. We complement our theoretical results by testing our approximation
algorithms on a wide variety of synthetic experiments, where we observe in a controlled setting
interesting findings on the trade-off between reward, and risk. We also provide an application
of our formulation for providing recommendations of teams that are likely to collaborate, and have
high impact.
