Pervasive computing involves the placement of processing services close to end users to support
intelligent applications. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Edge Computing
(EC), one can find room for placing services at various points in the interconnection of the aforementioned
infrastructures. Of significant importance is the processing of the collected data. Such a processing
can be realized upon the EC nodes that exhibit increased computational capabilities compared to
IoT devices. An ecosystem of intelligent nodes is created at the EC giving the opportunity to support
cooperative models. Nodes become the hosts of geo-distributed datasets formulated by the IoT devices
reports. Upon the datasets, a number of queries/tasks can be executed. Queries/tasks can be offloaded
for performance reasons. However, an offloading action should be carefully designed being always
aligned with the data present to the hosting node. In this paper, we present a model to support the
cooperative aspect in the EC infrastructure. We argue on the delivery of data synopses to EC nodes
making them capable to take offloading decisions fully aligned with data present at peers. Nodes
exchange data synopses to inform their peers. We propose a scheme that detects the appropriate time
to distribute synopses trying to avoid the network overloading especially when synopses are frequently
extracted due to the high rates at which IoT devices report data to EC nodes. Our approach involves
a Deep Learning model for learning the distribution of calculated synopses and estimate future
trends. Upon these trends, we are able to find the appropriate time to deliver synopses to peer nodes.
We provide the description of the proposed mechanism and evaluate it based on real datasets. An extensive
experimentation upon various scenarios reveals the pros and cons of the approach by giving numerical
results.
