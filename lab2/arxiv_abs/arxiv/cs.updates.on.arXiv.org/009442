Wireless network slicing (i.e., network virtualization) is one of the potential technologies
for addressing the issue of rapidly growing demand in mobile data services related to 5G cellular
networks. It logically decouples the current cellular networks into two entities; infrastructure
providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The resources of base stations
(e.g., resource blocks, transmission power, antennas) which are owned by the InP are shared to multiple
MVNOs who need resources for their mobile users. Specifically, the physical resources of an InP
are abstracted into multiple isolated network slices, which are then allocated to MVNO's mobile
users. In this paper, two-level allocation problem in network slicing is examined, whilst enabling
efficient resource utilization, inter-slice isolation (i.e., no interference amongst slices),
and intra-slice isolation (i.e., no interference between users in the same slice). A generalized
Kelly mechanism (GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource allocation
issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed. The benefit of using such a resource bidding
and allocation framework is that the seller (InP) does not need to know the true valuation of the bidders
(MVNOs). For solving the lower level of resource allocation issue (i.e., between MVNOs and their
mobile users), the optimal resource allocation is derived from each MVNO to its mobile users by using
KKT conditions. Then, bandwidth resources are allocated to the users of MVNOs. Finally, the results
of simulation are presented to verify the theoretical analysis of our proposed two-level resource
allocation problem in wireless network slicing.
