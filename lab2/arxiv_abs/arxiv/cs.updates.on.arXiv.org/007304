Fast and precise robot motion is needed in certain applications such as electronic manufacturing,
additive manufacturing and assembly. Most industrial robot motion controllers allow externally
commanded motion profile, but the trajectory tracking performance is affected by the robot dynamics
and joint servo controllers which users have no direct access and little information. The performance
is further compromised by time delays in transmitting the external command as a setpoint to the inner
control loop. This paper presents an approach of combining neural networks and iterative learning
control to improve the trajectory tracking performance for a multi-axis articulated industrial
robot. For a given desired trajectory, the external command is iteratively refined using a high
fidelity dynamical simulator to compensate for the robot inner loop dynamics. These desired trajectories
and the corresponding refined input trajectories are then used to train multi-layer neural networks
to emulate the dynamical inverse of the nonlinear inner loop dynamics. We show that with a sufficiently
rich training set, the trained neural networks can generalize well to trajectories beyond the training
set. In applying the trained neural networks to the physical robot, the tracking performance still
improves but not as much as in the simulator. We show that transfer learning can effectively bridge
the gap between simulation and the physical robot. In the end, we test the trained neural networks
on other robot models in simulation and demonstrate the possibility of a general purpose network.
Development and evaluation of this methodology is based on the ABB IRB6640-180 industrial robot
and ABB RobotStudio software packages.
