Random forests have become an important tool for improving accuracy in regression problems since
their popularization by (Breiman, 2001) and others. In this paper, we revisit a random forest model
originally proposed by (Breiman, 2004) and later studied by (Biau, 2012), where a feature is selected
at random and the split occurs at the midpoint of the box containing the chosen feature. If the Lipschitz
regression function is sparse and depends only on a small, unknown subset of $S$ out of $d$ features,
we show that given $n$ observations, this random forest model outputs a predictor that has a mean-squared
prediction error of order $(n(\sqrt{\log n})^{S-1})^{-\frac{1}{S\log2+1}}$. When $S \leq \lfloor
0.72 d \rfloor$, this rate is better than the minimax optimal rate $n^{-\frac{2}{d+2}}$ for $d$-dimensional,
Lipschitz function classes. The second part of this article shows that the prediction error for
this random forest model cannot generally be improved. As a striking consequence of our analysis,
we show that if $\ell_{avg}$ (resp. $\ell_{max}$) is the average (resp. maximum) number of observations
per leaf node, then the variance of this forest is $\Theta(\ell^{-1}_{avg}(\sqrt{\log n})^{-(S-1)})$,
which for the case of $S = d$, is similar in form to the lower bound $\Omega(\ell^{-1}_{max}(\log
n)^{-(d-1)})$ of (Lin and Jeon, 2006) for any random forest model with a nonadaptive splitting scheme.
We also show that the bias is tight for any linear model with nonzero parameter vector. Our new analysis
also implies that better theoretical performance can be achieved if the trees are grown to a shallower
depth than previous work would otherwise recommend.
