Blind rendezvous is a fundamental problem in cognitive radio networks. The problem involves a collection
of agents (radios) that wish to discover each other in the blind setting where there is no shared infrastructure
and they initially have no knowledge of each other. Time is divided into discrete slots; spectrum
is divided into discrete channels, $\{1,2,..., n\}$. Each agent may access a single channel in a
single time slot and we say that two agents rendezvous when they access the same channel in the same
time slot. The model is asymmetric: each agent $A_i$ may only use a particular subset $S_i$ of the
channels and different agents may have access to different subsets of channels. The goal is to design
deterministic channel hopping schedules for each agent so as to guarantee rendezvous between any
pair of agents with overlapping channel sets. Two independent sets of authors, Shin et al. and Lin
et al., gave the first constructions guaranteeing asynchronous blind rendezvous in $O(n^2)$ and
$O(n^3)$ time, respectively. We present a substantially improved construction guaranteeing
that any two agents, $A_i$, $A_j$, will rendezvous in $O(|S_i| |S_j| \log\log n)$ time. Our results
are the first that achieve nontrivial dependence on $|S_i|$, the size of the set of available channels.
This allows us, for example, to save roughly a quadratic factor over the best previous results in
the important case when channel subsets have constant size. We also achieve the best possible bound
of $O(1)$ time for the symmetric situation; previous works could do no better than $O(n)$. Using
the probabilistic method and Ramsey theory we provide evidence in support of our suspicion that
our construction is asymptotically optimal for small size channel subsets: we show both a $c |S_i||S_j|$
lower bound and a $c \log\log n$ lower bound when $|S_i|, |S_j| \leq n/2$.
