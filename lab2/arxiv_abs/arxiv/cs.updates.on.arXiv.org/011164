While Standard gradient descent is one very popular optimisation method, its convergence cannot
be proven beyond the class of functions whose gradient is globally Lipschitz continuous. As such,
it is not actually applicable to realistic applications such as Deep Neural Networks. In this paper,
we prove that its backtracking variant behaves very nicely, in particular convergence can be shown
for all Morse functions. The main theoretical result of this paper is as follows. Theorem. Let $f:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ be a $C^1$ function, and $\{z_n\}$ a sequence constructed from the Backtracking gradient
descent algorithm. (1) Either $\lim _{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_n||=\infty$ or $\lim _{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_{n+1}-z_n||=0$.
(2) Assume that $f$ has at most countably many critical points. Then either $\lim _{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_n||=\infty$
or $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point of $f$. (3) More generally, assume that all connected
components of the set of critical points of $f$ are compact. Then either $\lim _{n\rightarrow\infty}||z_n||=\infty$
or $\{z_n\}$ is bounded. Moreover, in the latter case the set of cluster points of $\{z_n\}$ is connected.
Some generalised versions of this result, including an inexact version, are included. Another
result in this paper concerns the problem of saddle points. We then present a heuristic argument
to explain why Standard gradient descent method works so well, and modifications of the backtracking
versions of GD, MMT and NAG. Experiments with datasets CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 on various popular architectures
verify the heuristic argument also for the mini-batch practice and show that our new algorithms,
while automatically fine tuning learning rates, perform better than current state-of-the-art
methods such as MMT, NAG, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSProp, Adam and Adamax.
