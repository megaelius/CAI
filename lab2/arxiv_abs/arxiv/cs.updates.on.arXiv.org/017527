Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has emerged as a promising novel paradigm to achieve better
coverage and higher capacity for future wireless network by exploiting the more favorable line-of-sight
(LoS) propagation. To reap the potential gains of UAV swarm, the remote control signal sent by ground
control unit (GCU) is essential, whereas the control signal quality are susceptible in practice
due to the effect of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the external interference (EI)
from radiation sources distributed across the region. To tackle these challenges, this paper considers
priority-aware resource coordination in a multi-UAV communication system, where multiple UAVs
are controlled by a GCU to perform certain tasks with a pre-defined trajectory. Specifically, we
maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the UAVs by jointly
optimizing channel assignment and power allocation strategy under stringent resource availability
constraints. According to the intensity of ACI, we consider the corresponding problem in two scenarios,
i.e., Null-ACI and ACI systems. By virtue of the particular problem structure in Null-ACI case,
we first recast the formulation into an equivalent yet more tractable form and obtain the global
optimal solution via Hungarian algorithm. For general ACI systems, we develop an efficient iterative
algorithm for its solution based on the smooth approximation and alternating optimization methods.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly enhance
the minimum SINR among all the UAVs and adapt the allocation of communication resources to diverse
mission priority.
