We propose a setting for two-phase opinion dynamics in social networks, where a node's final opinion
in the first phase acts as its initial biased opinion in the second phase. In this setting, we study
the problem of two camps aiming to maximize adoption of their respective opinions, by strategically
investing on nodes in the two phases. A node's initial opinion in the second phase naturally plays
a key role in determining the final opinion of that node, and hence also of other nodes in the network
due to its influence on them. More importantly, this bias also determines the effectiveness of a
camp's investment on that node in the second phase. To formalize this two-phase investment setting,
we propose an extension of Friedkin-Johnsen model, and hence formulate the utility functions of
the camps. There is a tradeoff while splitting the budget between the two phases. A lower investment
in the first phase results in worse initial biases for the second phase, while a higher investment
spares a lower available budget for the second phase. We first analyze the non-competitive case
where only one camp invests, for which we present a polynomial time algorithm for determining an
optimal way to split the camp's budget between the two phases. We then analyze the case of competing
camps, where we show the existence of Nash equilibrium and that it can be computed in polynomial time
under reasonable assumptions. We conclude our study with simulations on real-world network datasets,
in order to quantify the effects of the initial biases and the weightage attributed by nodes to their
initial biases, as well as that of a camp deviating from its equilibrium strategy. Our main conclusion
is that, if nodes attribute high weightage to their initial biases, it is advantageous to have a high
investment in the first phase, so as to effectively influence the biases to be harnessed in the second
phase.
