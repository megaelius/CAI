As an emerging field of aerial robotics, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant
research interest within the wireless networking research community. As soon as national legislations
allow UAVs to fly autonomously, we will see swarms of UAV populating the sky of our smart cities to
accomplish different missions: parcel delivery, infrastructure monitoring, event filming,
surveillance, tracking, etc. The UAV ecosystem can benefit from existing 5G/B5G cellular networks,
which can be exploited in different ways to enhance UAV communications. Because of the inherent
characteristics of UAV pertaining to flexible mobility in 3D space, autonomous operation and intelligent
placement, these smart devices cater to wide range of wireless applications and use cases. This
work aims at presenting an in-depth exploration of integration synergies between 5G/B5G cellular
systems and UAV technology, where the UAV is integrated as a new aerial User Equipment (UE) to existing
cellular networks. In this integration, the UAVs perform the role of flying users within cellular
coverage, thus they are termed as cellular-connected UAVs (a.k.a. UAV-UE, drone-UE, 5G-connected
drone, or aerial user). The main focus of this work is to present an extensive study of integration
challenges along with key 5G/B5G technological innovations and ongoing efforts in design prototyping
and field trials corroborating cellular-connected UAVs. This study highlights recent progress
updates with respect to 3GPP standardization and emphasizes socio-economic concerns that must
be accounted before successful adoption of this promising technology. Various open problems paving
the path to future research opportunities are also discussed.
