Large-scale decentralized systems of autonomous agents interacting via asynchronous communication
often experience the following self-healing dilemma: Fault-detection inherits network uncertainties
making a faulty process indistinguishable from a slow process. The implications can be dramatic:
Self-healing mechanisms become biased and cost-ineffective. In particular, triggering an undesirable
fault-correction results in new faults that could be prevented with fault-tolerance instead.
Nevertheless, fault-tolerance alone without eventually correcting persistent faults makes
systems underperforming as well. Measuring, understanding and resolving such self-healing dilemmas
is a timely challenge and critical requirement given the rise of distributed ledgers, edge computing,
the Internet of Things in several application domains of energy, transport and health. This paper
introduces a novel and general-purpose modeling of fault scenarios. They can accurately measure
and predict inconsistencies generated by fault-correction and fault-tolerance when each node
in a network can monitor the health status of another node, while both can defect. In contrast to related
work, no information about the computational/application scenario, overlying algorithms or
application data is required. A rigorous experimental methodology is designed that evaluates
696 experimental settings of different fault scales, fault profiles and fault detection thresholds,
each with almost 9M measurements of inconsistencies in a prototyped decentralized network of 3000
nodes. The prediction performance of the modeled fault scenarios is validated in a challenging
application scenario of decentralized and dynamic in-network aggregation using real-world data
from a Smart Grid pilot project. Findings confirm the origin of inconsistencies at design phase
and provide new insights how to tune self-healing mechanisms at design phase.
