Production forecasting is a key step to design the future development of a reservoir. A classical
way to generate such forecasts consists in simulating future production for numerical models representative
of the reservoir. However, identifying such models can be very challenging as they need to be constrained
to all available data. In particular, they should reproduce past production data, which requires
to solve a complex non-linear inverse problem. In this paper, we thus propose to investigate the
potential of machine learning algorithms to predict the future production of a reservoir based
on past production data without model calibration. We focus more specifically on robust online
aggregation, a deterministic approach that provides a robust framework to make forecasts on a regular
basis. This method does not rely on any specific assumption or need for stochastic modeling. Forecasts
are first simulated for a set of base reservoir models representing the prior uncertainty, and then
combined to predict production at the next time step. The weight associated to each forecast is related
to its past performance. Three different algorithms are considered for weight computations: the
exponentially weighted average algorithm, ridge regression and the Lasso regression. They are
applied on a synthetic reservoir case study, the Brugge case, for sequential predictions. To estimate
the potential of development scenarios, production forecasts are needed on long periods of time
without intermediary data acquisition. An extension of the deterministic aggregation approach
is thus proposed in this paper to provide such multi-step-ahead forecasts.
