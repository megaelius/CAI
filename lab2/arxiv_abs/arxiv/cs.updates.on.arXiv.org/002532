Deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based architectures have shown great potential
in medical image segmentation. However, such architectures usually have millions of parameters
and inadequate number of training samples leading to over-fitting and poor generalization. In
this paper, we present a novel highly parameter and memory efficient FCN based architecture for
medical image analysis. We propose a novel up-sampling path which incorporates long skip and short-cut
connections to overcome the feature map explosion in FCN like architectures. In order to processes
the input images at multiple scales and view points simultaneously, we propose to incorporate Inception
module's parallel structures. We also propose a novel dual loss function whose weighting scheme
allows to combine advantages of cross-entropy and dice loss. We have validated our proposed network
architecture on two publicly available datasets, namely: (i) Automated Cardiac Disease Diagnosis
Challenge (ACDC-2017), (ii) Left Ventricular Segmentation Challenge (LV-2011). Our approach
in ACDC-2017 challenge stands second place for segmentation and first place in automated cardiac
disease diagnosis tasks with an accuracy of 100%. In the LV-2011 challenge our approach attained
0.74 Jaccard index, which is so far the highest published result in fully automated algorithms.
From the segmentation we extracted clinically relevant cardiac parameters and hand-crafted features
which reflected the clinical diagnostic analysis to train an ensemble system for cardiac disease
classification. Our approach combined both cardiac segmentation and disease diagnosis into a
fully automated framework which is computational efficient and hence has the potential to be incorporated
in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for clinical application.
