A large share of all online display advertisements (ads) are never seen by a human. For instance,
an ad could appear below the page fold, where a user never scrolls. Yet, an ad is essentially ineffective
if it is not at least somewhat viewable. Ad viewability - which refers to the pixel percentage-in-view
and the exposure duration of an online display ad - has recently garnered great interest among digital
advertisers and publishers. However, we know very little about the impact of ad viewability on advertising
effectiveness. We work to close this gap by analyzing a large-scale observational data set with
more than 350,000 ad impressions similar to the data sets that are typically available to digital
advertisers and publishers. This analysis reveals that longer exposure durations (>10 seconds)
and 100% visible pixels do not appear to be optimal in generating view-throughs. The highest view-through
rates seem to be generated with relatively lower pixel/second-combinations of 50%/1, 50%/5, 75%/1,
and 75%/5. However, this analysis does not account for user behavior that may be correlated with
or even drive ad viewability and may therefore result in endogeneity issues. Consequently, we manipulated
ad viewability in a randomized online experiment for a major European news website, finding the
highest ad recognition rates among relatively higher pixel/second-combinations of 75%/10, 100%/5
and 100%/10. Everything below 75\% or 5 seconds performs worse. Yet, we find that it may be sufficient
to have either a long exposure duration or high pixel percentage-in-view to reach high advertising
effectiveness. Our results provide guidance to advertisers enabling them to establish target
viewability rates more appropriately and to publishers who wish to differentiate their viewability
products.
