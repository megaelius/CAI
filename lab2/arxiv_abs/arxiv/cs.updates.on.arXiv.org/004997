Research into the classification of time series has made enormous progress in the last decade. The
UCR time series archive has played a significant role in challenging and guiding the development
of new learners for time series classification. The largest dataset in the UCR archive holds 10 thousand
time series only; which may explain why the primary research focus has been in creating algorithms
that have high accuracy on relatively small datasets. This paper introduces Proximity Forest,
an algorithm that learns accurate models from datasets with millions of time series, and classifies
a time series in milliseconds. The models are ensembles of highly randomized Proximity Trees. Whereas
conventional decision trees branch on attribute values (and usually perform poorly on time series),
Proximity Trees branch on the proximity of time series to one exemplar time series or another; allowing
us to leverage the decades of work into developing relevant measures for time series. Proximity
Forest gains both efficiency and accuracy by stochastic selection of both exemplars and similarity
measures. Our work is motivated by recent time series applications that provide orders of magnitude
more time series than the UCR benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Proximity Forest is
highly competitive on the UCR archive: it ranks among the most accurate classifiers while being
significantly faster. We demonstrate on a 1M time series Earth observation dataset that Proximity
Forest retains this accuracy on datasets that are many orders of magnitude greater than those in
the UCR repository, while learning its models at least 100,000 times faster than current state of
the art models Elastic Ensemble and COTE.
