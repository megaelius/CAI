During spinal fusion surgery, screws are placed close to critical nerves suggesting the need for
highly accurate screw placement. Verifying screw placement on high-quality tomographic imaging
is essential. C-arm Cone-beam CT (CBCT) provides intraoperative 3D tomographic imaging which
would allow for immediate verification and, if needed, revision. However, the reconstruction
quality attainable with commercial CBCT devices is insufficient, predominantly due to severe
metal artifacts in the presence of pedicle screws. These artifacts arise from a mismatch between
the true physics of image formation and an idealized model thereof assumed during reconstruction.
Prospectively acquiring views onto anatomy that are least affected by this mismatch can, therefore,
improve reconstruction quality. We propose to adjust the C-arm CBCT source trajectory during the
scan to optimize reconstruction quality with respect to a certain task, i.e. verification of screw
placement. Adjustments are performed on-the-fly using a convolutional neural network that regresses
a quality index for possible next views given the current x-ray image. Adjusting the CBCT trajectory
to acquire the recommended views results in non-circular source orbits that avoid poor images,
and thus, data inconsistencies. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained on
realistically simulated data are capable of predicting quality metrics that enable scene-specific
adjustments of the CBCT source trajectory. Using both realistically simulated data and real CBCT
acquisitions of a semi-anthropomorphic phantom, we show that tomographic reconstructions of
the resulting scene-specific CBCT acquisitions exhibit improved image quality particularly
in terms of metal artifacts. Since the optimization objective is implicitly encoded in a neural
network, the proposed approach overcomes the need for 3D information at run-time.
