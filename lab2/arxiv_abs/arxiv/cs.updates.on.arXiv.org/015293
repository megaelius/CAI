This paper illustrates five different techniques to assess the distinctiveness of topics, key
terms and features, speed of information dissemination, and network behaviors for Covid19 tweets.
First, we use pattern matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare workers, and personal
protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S. cases would start to uptick immediately
after live White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying
attention to government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously
reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method, Uniform Manifold Approximation
and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve
our understanding of important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics.
Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about Covid19 propagates
on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus
in March 2020 was 2.87 hours, approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social
media about H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by visualizing
the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As the time to retweet increases,
the density of connections also increase where in our sample, we found distinct users dominating
the attention of Covid19 retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage
descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify high-level themes which
were consistently verified as important through every subsequent analysis.
