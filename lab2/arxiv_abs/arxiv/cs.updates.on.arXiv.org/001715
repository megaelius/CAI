The response time of jobs with multiple parallel tasks is a critical performance metric in many systems,
including MapReduce systems, coded data storage systems, etc. However, tight analytical characterizations
of the response time of such jobs are largely unknown except for highly degenerate cases. The difficulty
is rooted in the fact that a job with multiple tasks is considered complete only when all of its tasks
complete processing; i.e., the job response time is the maximum of the response times of its tasks,
which is hard to analyze since these task response times are generally not independent. In this paper,
we approach this problem by studying when the response times of a job's tasks are close to being independent.
We consider a limited fork-join model with $n$ servers, where each job consists of $k^{(n)}\le n$
tasks. Upon arrival, each job chooses $k^{(n)}$ distinct servers uniformly at random and sends
one task to each server. We assume Poisson job arrivals and generally distributed task service times.
We establish that under the condition $k^{(n)} = o(n^{1/4})$, the steady state response times at
any $k^{(n)}$ servers are asymptotically independent, as $n$ grows large. This result greatly
generalizes the asymptotic-independence type of results in the literature where asymptotic independence
is shown only for a fixed constant number of queues. We then further show that the job response time
converges to the maximum of independent task response times, in a proper sense. This gives the first
asymptotically tight analytical characterization of the response time of a multi-task parallel
job. To complement the asymptotic independence result, we also show that when $k^{(n)}=\Theta(n)$,
any number of multiple queues are not asymptotically independent. Analysis for the regime of $k^{(n)}$
between $o(n^{1/4})$ and $\Theta(n)$ remains open.
