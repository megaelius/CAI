Phase interfaces in melting and solidification processes are strongly affected by the presence
of convection in the liquid. One way of modeling their transient evolution is to couple an incompressible
flow model to an energy balance in enthalpy formulation. Two strong nonlinearities arise, which
account for the viscosity variation between phases and the latent heat of fusion at the phase interface.
The resulting coupled system of PDE's can be solved by a single-domain semi-phase-field, variable
viscosity, finite element method with monolithic system coupling and global Newton linearization.
A robust computational model for realistic phase-change regimes furthermore requires a flexible
implementation based on sophisticated mesh adaptivity. In this article, we present first steps
towards implementing such a computational model into a simulation tool which we call Phaseflow.
Phaseflow utilizes the finite element software FEniCS, which includes a dual-weighted residual
method for goal-oriented adaptive mesh refinement. Phaseflow is an open-source, dimension-independent
implementation that, upon an appropriate parameter choice, reduces to classical benchmark situations
including the lid-driven cavity and the Stefan problem. We present and discuss numerical results
for these, an octadecane PCM convection-coupled melting benchmark, and a preliminary 3D convection-coupled
melting example, demonstrating the flexible implementation. Though being preliminary, the latter
is, to our knowledge, the first published 3D result for this method. In our work, we especially emphasize
reproducibility and provide an easy-to-use portable software container using Docker.
