The rapid evolution of the blockchain community has brought together stakeholders from fundamentally
different backgrounds: cryptographers, protocol designers, software developers, startup entrepreneurs,
corporate executives and investors, academics of various disciplines, and end users. The result
is a diverse ecosystem, presently exemplified by the development of a wide range of different blockchain
protocols. This raises questions for policy and decision makers: How do different protocols compare?
What are their trade-offs? Existing efforts to survey the area reveal a fragmented terminology,
and the lack of a unified framework to make the different desirable properties of blockchain protocols
explicit. In this paper, we work towards bridging this gap. We evaluate protocols within a five-dimensional
design space with the following axes. Optimality: does the protocol achieve its main goals? Stability:
are the incentives of its participating agents well-aligned? Efficiency: is its output maximal
relative to its use of resources? Robustness: can it cope when its operational assumptions are invalid
or perturbed? Persistence: can it recover from catastrophic events? Based on the relevant literature,
we organize the properties of existing protocols in subcategories of increasing granularity.
The result is a dynamic scheme -- termed the PREStO framework. Its scope is to aid the communication
between stakeholders of different backgrounds, including managers and investors, and to identify
research challenges and opportunities for blockchain protocols in a systematic way. We illustrate
this via use cases and make a first step to understand the blockchain ecosystem through a more comprehensive
lens.
