The automatic design of controllers for mobile robots usually requires two stages. In the first
stage,sensorial data are preprocessed or transformed into high level and meaningful values of
variables whichare usually defined from expert knowledge. In the second stage, a machine learning
technique is applied toobtain a controller that maps these high level variables to the control commands
that are actually sent tothe robot. This paper describes an algorithm that is able to embed the preprocessing
stage into the learningstage in order to get controllers directly starting from sensorial raw data
with no expert knowledgeinvolved. Due to the high dimensionality of the sensorial data, this approach
uses Quantified Fuzzy Rules(QFRs), that are able to transform low-level input variables into high-level
input variables, reducingthe dimensionality through summarization. The proposed learning algorithm,
called Iterative QuantifiedFuzzy Rule Learning (IQFRL), is based on genetic programming. IQFRL
is able to learn rules with differentstructures, and can manage linguistic variables with multiple
granularities. The algorithm has been testedwith the implementation of the wall-following behavior
both in several realistic simulated environmentswith different complexity and on a Pioneer 3-AT
robot in two real environments. Results have beencompared with several well-known learning algorithms
combined with different data preprocessingtechniques, showing that IQFRL exhibits a better and
statistically significant performance. Moreover,three real world applications for which IQFRL
plays a central role are also presented: path and objecttracking with static and moving obstacles
avoidance.
