Effective triage is critical to mitigating the effect of increased volume by accurately determining
patient acuity, need for resources, and establishing effective acuity-based patient prioritization.
The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine whether historical EHR data can be extracted
and synthesized with clinical natural language processing (C-NLP) and the latest ML algorithms
(KATE) to produce highly accurate ESI predictive models. An ML model (KATE) for the triage process
was developed using 166,175 patient encounters from two participating hospitals. The model was
then tested against a gold set that was derived from a random sample of triage encounters at the study
sites and correct acuity assignments were recorded by study clinicians using the Emergency Severity
Index (ESI) standard as a guide. At the two study sites, KATE predicted accurate ESI acuity assignments
75.9% of the time, compared to nurses (59.8%) and average individual study clinicians (75.3%).
KATE accuracy was 26.9% higher than the average nurse accuracy (p-value < 0.0001). On the boundary
between ESI 2 and ESI 3 acuity assignments, which relates to the risk of decompensation, KATE was
93.2% higher with 80% accuracy, compared to triage nurses with 41.4% accuracy (p-value < 0.0001).
KATE provides a triage acuity assignment substantially more accurate than the triage nurses in
this study sample. KATE operates independently of contextual factors, unaffected by the external
pressures that can cause under triage and may mitigate the racial and social biases that can negatively
affect the accuracy of triage assignment. Future research should focus on the impact of KATE providing
feedback to triage nurses in real time, KATEs impact on mortality and morbidity, ED throughput,
resource optimization, and nursing outcomes.
