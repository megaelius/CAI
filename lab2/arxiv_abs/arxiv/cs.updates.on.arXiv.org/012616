Finite element simulations of frictional multi-body contact problems via conformal meshes can
be challenging and computationally demanding. To render geometrical features, unstructured
meshes must be used and this unavoidably increases the degrees of freedom and therefore makes the
construction of slave/master pairs more demanding. In this work, we introduce an implicit material
point method designed to bypass the meshing of bodies by employing level set functions to represent
boundaries at structured grids. This implicit function representation provides an elegant mean
to link an unbiased intermediate reference surface with the true boundaries by closest point projection
as shown in leichner et al. (2019). We then enforce the contact constraints by a penalty method where
the Coulomb friction law is implemented as an elastoplastic constitutive model such that a return
mapping algorithm can be used to provide constitutive updates for both the stick and slip states.
To evolve the geometry of the contacts properly, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is solved incrementally
such that the level set and material points are both updated accord to the deformation field. To improve
the accuracy and regularity of the numerical integration of the material point method, a moving
least square method is used to project numerical values of the material points back to the standard
locations for Gaussian-Legendre quadrature. Several benchmarks are used to verify the proposed
model. Comparisons with discrete element simulations are made to analyze the importance of stress
fields on predicting the macroscopic responses of granular assemblies.
