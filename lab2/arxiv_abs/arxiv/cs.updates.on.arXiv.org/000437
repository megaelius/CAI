The existence of quantum uncertainty relations is the essential reason that some classically impossible
cryptographic primitives become possible when quantum communication is allowed. One direct operational
manifestation of these uncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information
locking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit
message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n. Without the
key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information
about the message, in which case the message is said to be "locked". Furthermore, knowing the key,
it is possible to recover, that is "unlock", the message. In this paper, we make the following contributions
by exploiting a connection between uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2
into L1. We introduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to low-distortion
embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also implies an entropic uncertainty relation.
We prove that random bases satisfy uncertainty relations with a stronger definition and better
parameters than previously known. Our proof is also considerably simpler than earlier proofs.
We apply this result to show the existence of locking schemes with key size independent of the message
length. We give efficient constructions of metric uncertainty relations. The bases defining these
metric uncertainty relations are computable by quantum circuits of almost linear size. This leads
to the first explicit construction of a strong information locking scheme. Moreover, we present
a locking scheme that is close to being implementable with current technology. We apply our metric
uncertainty relations to exhibit communication protocols that perform quantum equality testing.
