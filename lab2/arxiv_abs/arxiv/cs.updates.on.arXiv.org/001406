The proliferation of wireless communications has recently created a bottleneck in terms of spectrum
availability. Motivated by the observation that the root of the spectrum scarcity is not a lack of
resources but an inefficient managing that can be solved, dynamic opportunistic exploitation
of spectral bands has been considered, under the name of Cognitive Radio (CR). This technology allows
secondary users to access currently idle spectral bands by detecting and tracking the spectrum
occupancy. The CR application revisits this traditional task with specific and severe requirements
in terms of spectrum sensing and detection performance, real-time processing, robustness to noise
and more. Unfortunately, conventional methods do not satisfy these demands for typical signals,
that often have very high Nyquist rates. Recently, several sampling methods have been proposed
that exploit signals' a priori known structure to sample them below the Nyquist rate. Here, we review
some of these techniques and tie them to the task of spectrum sensing in the context of CR. We then show
how issues related to spectrum sensing can be tackled in the sub-Nyquist regime. First, to cope with
low signal to noise ratios, we propose to recover second-order statistics from the low rate samples,
rather than the signal itself. In particular, we consider cyclostationary based detection, and
investigate CR networks that perform collaborative spectrum sensing to overcome channel effects.
To enhance the efficiency of the available spectral bands detection, we present joint spectrum
sensing and direction of arrival estimation methods. Throughout this work, we highlight the relation
between theoretical algorithms and their practical implementation. We show hardware simulations
performed on a prototype we built, demonstrating the feasibility of sub-Nyquist spectrum sensing
in the context of CR.
