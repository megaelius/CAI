A semiorder is a model of preference relations where each element $x$ is associated with a utility
value $\alpha(x)$, and there is a threshold $t$ such that $y$ is preferred to $x$ iff $\alpha(y) >
\alpha(x)+t$. These are motivated by the notion that there is some uncertainty in the utility values
we assign an object or that a subject may be unable to distinguish a preference between objects whose
values are close. However, they fail to model the well-known phenomenon that preferences are not
always transitive. Also, if we are uncertain of the utility values, it is not logical that preference
is determined absolutely by a comparison of them with an exact threshold. We propose a new model in
which there are two thresholds, $t_1$ and $t_2$; if the difference $\alpha(y) - \alpha(x)$ less
than $t_1$, then $y$ is not preferred to $x$; if the difference is greater than $t_2$ then $y$ is preferred
to $x$; if it is between $t_1$ and $t_2$, then then $y$ may or may not be preferred to $x$. We call such
a relation a double-threshold semiorder, and the corresponding directed graph $G = (V,E)$ a double
threshold digraph. Every directed acyclic graph is a double threshold graph; bounds on $t_2/t_1$
give a nested hierarchy of subclasses of the directed acyclic graphs. In this paper we characterize
the subclasses in terms of forbidden subgraphs, and give algorithms for finding an assignment of
of utility values that explains the relation in terms of a given $(t_1,t_2)$ or else produces a forbidden
subgraph, and finding the minimum value $\lambda$ of $t_2/t_1$ that is satisfiable for a given directed
acyclic graph. We show that $\lambda$ gives a measure of the complexity of a directed acyclic graph
with respect to several optimization problems that are NP-hard on arbitrary directed acyclic graphs.
