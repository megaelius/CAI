Consistency and duplicability in Computed Tomography (CT) output is essential to quantitative
imaging for lung cancer detection and monitoring. This study of CT-detected lung nodules investigated
the reproducibility of volume-, density-, and texture-based features (outcome variables) over
routine ranges of radiation-dose, reconstruction kernel, and slice thickness. CT raw data of 23
nodules were reconstructed using 320 acquisition/reconstruction conditions (combinations
of 4 doses, 10 kernels, and 8 thicknesses). Scans at 12.5%, 25%, and 50% of protocol dose were simulated;
reduced-dose and full-dose data were reconstructed using conventional filtered back-projection
and iterative-reconstruction kernels at a range of thicknesses (0.6-5.0 mm). Full-dose/B50f
kernel reconstructions underwent expert segmentation for reference Region-Of-Interest (ROI)
and nodule volume per thickness; each ROI was applied to 40 corresponding images (combinations
of 4 doses and 10 kernels). Typical texture analysis metrics (including 5 histogram features, 13
Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix, 5 Run Length Matrix, 2 Neighboring Gray-Level Dependence Matrix,
and 2 Neighborhood Gray-Tone Difference Matrix) were computed per ROI. Reconstruction conditions
resulting in no significant change in volume, density, or texture metrics were identified as "compatible
pairs" for a given outcome variable. Our results indicate that as thickness increases, volumetric
reproducibility decreases, while reproducibility of histogram- and texture-based features
across different acquisition and reconstruction parameters improves. In order to achieve concomitant
reproducibility of volumetric and radiomic results across studies, balanced standardization
of the imaging acquisition parameters is required.
