Searching for a person's name is a common online activity. However, Web search engines provide few
accurate results to queries containing names. In contrast to a general text which has only one correct
spelling, there are several legitimate spellings of a given name. Today, most techniques used to
suggest synonyms in online search are based on pattern matching and phonetic encoding, however,
they frequently have poor performance. As a result, there is a need for an effective tool for improved
synonym suggestion. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary approach for tackling the problem
of synonym suggestion. Our novel algorithm titled GRAFT utilizes historical data collected from
genealogy websites, along with network algorithms. This is a general algorithm that suggests synonyms
based on the construction of a graph-based on names derived from generated digitized ancestral
family trees. Synonyms are extracted from this graph constructed using generic ordering functions
that outperform other algorithms that suggest synonyms based on a single dimension, a factor that
limits their performance. We evaluated GRAFT's performance on forenames and surnames, including
the utilization of a large-scale online genealogy dataset with over 17 million profiles and more
than 200,000 unique forenames and surnames. For comparison, we compared its performance at suggesting
synonyms to nine algorithms, including phonetic encoding, string similarity algorithms, and
machine and deep learning techniques. The results show that GRAFT found superior to the evaluated
algorithms with respect to both forenames and surnames and demonstrate its use as a tool to improve
synonym suggestion.
