Chunked-reward advertising is commonly used in the industry, such as the guaranteed delivery in
display advertising and the daily-deal services (e.g., Groupon) in online shopping. In chunked-reward
advertising, the publisher promises to deliver at least a certain volume (a.k.a. tipping point
or lower bound) of user traffic to an advertiser according to their mutual contract. At the same time,
the advertiser may specify a maximum volume (upper bound) of traffic that he/she would like to pay
for according to his/her budget constraint. The objective of the publisher is to design an appropriate
mechanism to allocate the user traffic so as to maximize the overall revenue obtained from all such
advertisers. In this paper, we perform a formal study on this problem, which we call Chunked-reward
Allocation Problem (\CAP). In particular, we formulate \CAP\ as a knapsack-like problem with variable-sized
items and majorization constraints. Our main results regarding \CAP\ are as follows. (1) We first
show that for a special case of \CAP, in which the lower bound equals the upper bound for each contract,
there is a simple dynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial
time. (2) The general case of \CAP\ is much more difficult than the special case. To solve the problem,
we first discover several structural properties of the optimal allocation, and then design a two-layer
dynamic programming-based algorithm that can find an optimal allocation in pseudo-polynomial
time by leveraging these properties. (3) We convert the two-layer dynamic programming based algorithm
to a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). Besides these results, we also investigate
some natural generalizations of \CAP, and propose effective algorithms to solve them.
