Since edge device failures (i.e., anomalies) seriously affect the production of industrial products
in Industrial IoT (IIoT), accurately and timely detecting anomalies is becoming increasingly
important. Furthermore, data collected by the edge device may contain the user's private data,
which is challenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the public
concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new communication-efficient on-device
federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time-series data
in IIoT. Specifically, we first introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to
collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its generalization ability.
Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term
Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention
mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby preventing memory
loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of LSTM
unit in predicting time series data. Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of
industrial anomaly detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-\textit{k}
selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately and timely detect anomalies and
also reduce the communication overhead by 50\% compared to the federated learning framework that
does not use a gradient compression scheme.
