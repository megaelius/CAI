In this paper, we study some decision problems both for {\it multi-letter quantum finite automata}
and {\it measure many multi-letter quantum finite automata}. We first show that given a $k_1$-letter
quantum finite automaton $\mathcal{A}_1$ and a $k_2$-letter quantum finite automaton $\mathcal{A}_2$
over the same input alphabet $\Sigma$, they are equivalent if and only if they are $(n_1^2+n_2^2-1)|\Sigma|^{k-1}+k$-equivalent
where $n_i$, $i=1,2$, are the number of states in $\mathcal{A}_i$ respectively, and $k=\max\{k_1,k_2\}$.
By applying a method, due to the author, used to deal with the equivalence problem of {\it measure
many one-way quantum finite automata}, we also show that a $k_1$-letter measure many quantum finite
automaton $\mathcal{A}_1$ and a $k_2$-letter measure many quantum finite automaton $\mathcal{A}_2$
are equivalent if and only if they are $(n_1^2+n_2^2-1)|\Sigma|^{k-1}+k$-equivalent where $n_i$,
$i=1,2$, are the number of states in $\mathcal{A}_i$ respectively, and $k=\max\{k_1,k_2\}$.
Next, we study the emptiness problem of those two kinds of quantum finite automata. We show that whether
the language recognized by a $k$-letter quantum finite automaton with non-strict cut-point is
empty is undecidable, but we leave open the emptiness of language reorganized by a $k$-letter quantum
finite automaton with strict cutpoint. We also show that whether the languages recognized by a $k$-letter
measure many quantum finite automaton with both nonstrict and strict cutpoints are undecidable.
And the direct consequences of the above outcomes are summarized in the paper. Finally, we suggest
some comments on existing proofs about the minimization problem of one way quantum finite automata
not only because we have been showing great interest in this kind of problem, which is very important
in classical automata theory
