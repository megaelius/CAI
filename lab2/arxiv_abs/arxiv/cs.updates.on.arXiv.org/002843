Internet social networks have become a ubiquitous application allowing people to easily share
text, pictures, and audio and video files. Popular networks include WhatsApp, Facebook, Reddit
and LinkedIn. We present an extensive study of the usage of the WhatsApp social network, an Internet
messaging application that is quickly replacing SMS messaging. In order to better understand people's
use of the network, we provide an analysis of over 6 million messages from over 100 users, with the
objective of building demographic prediction models using activity data. We performed extensive
statistical and numerical analysis of the data and found significant differences in WhatsApp usage
across people of different genders and ages. We also inputted the data into the Weka data mining package
and studied models created from decision tree and Bayesian network algorithms. We found that different
genders and age demographics had significantly different usage habits in almost all message and
group attributes. We also noted differences in users' group behavior and created prediction models,
including the likelihood a given group would have relatively more file attachments, if a group would
contain a larger number of participants, a higher frequency of activity, quicker response times
and shorter messages. We were successful in quantifying and predicting a user's gender and age demographic.
Similarly, we were able to predict different types of group usage. All models were built without
analyzing message content. We present a detailed discussion about the specific attributes that
were contained in all predictive models and suggest possible applications based on these results.
