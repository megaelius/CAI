This paper presents a novel scheme, based on a unique combination of genetic algorithms (GAs) and
deep learning (DL), for the automatic reconstruction of Portuguese tile panels, a challenging
real-world variant of the jigsaw puzzle problem (JPP) with important national heritage implications.
Specifically, we introduce an enhanced GA-based puzzle solver, whose integration with a novel
DL-based compatibility measure (DLCM) yields state-of-the-art performance, regarding the above
application. Current compatibility measures consider typically (the chromatic information
of) edge pixels (between adjacent tiles), and help achieve high accuracy for the synthetic JPP variant.
However, such measures exhibit rather poor performance when applied to the Portuguese tile panels,
which are susceptible to various real-world effects, e.g., monochromatic panels, non-squared
tiles, edge degradation, etc. To overcome such difficulties, we have developed a novel DLCM to extract
high-level texture/color statistics from the entire tile information. Integrating this measure
with our enhanced GA-based puzzle solver, we have demonstrated, for the first time, how to deal most
effectively with large-scale real-world problems, such as the Portuguese tile problem. Specifically,
we have achieved 82% accuracy for the reconstruction of Portuguese tile panels with unknown piece
rotation and puzzle dimension (compared to merely 3.5% average accuracy achieved by the best method
known for solving this problem variant). The proposed method outperforms even human experts in
several cases, correcting their mistakes in the manual tile assembly.
