We study the parameterized complexity of approximating the $k$-Dominating Set (DomSet) problem
where an integer $k$ and a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices are given as input, and the goal is to find a dominating
set of size at most $F(k) \cdot k$ whenever the graph $G$ has a dominating set of size $k$. When such
an algorithm runs in time $T(k) \cdot poly(n)$ (i.e., FPT-time) for some computable function $T$,
it is said to be an $F(k)$-FPT-approximation algorithm for $k$-DomSet. We prove the following for
every computable functions $T, F$ and every constant $\varepsilon > 0$: $\bullet$ Assuming $W[1]\neq
FPT$, there is no $F(k)$-FPT-approximation algorithm for $k$-DomSet. $\bullet$ Assuming the
Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), there is no $F(k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-DomSet
that runs in $T(k) \cdot n^{o(k)}$ time. $\bullet$ Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis
(SETH), for every integer $k \geq 2$, there is no $F(k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-DomSet
that runs in $T(k) \cdot n^{k - \varepsilon}$ time. $\bullet$ Assuming the $k$-Sum Hypothesis,
for every integer $k \geq 3$, there is no $F(k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-DomSet that runs
in $T(k) \cdot n^{\lceil k/2 \rceil - \varepsilon}$ time. Our results are obtained by establishing
a connection between communication complexity and hardness of approximation, generalizing the
ideas from a recent breakthrough work of Abboud et al. [FOCS 2017]. Specifically, we show that to
prove hardness of approximation of a certain parameterized variant of the label cover problem,
it suffices to devise a specific protocol for a communication problem that depends on which hypothesis
we rely on. Each of these communication problems turns out to be either a well studied problem or a
variant of one; this allows us to easily apply known techniques to solve them.
