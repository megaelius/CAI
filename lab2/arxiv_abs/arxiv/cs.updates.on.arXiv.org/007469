On-line social networks, such as in Facebook and Twitter, are often studied from the perspective
of friendship ties between agents in the network. Adversarial ties, however, also play an important
role in the structure and function of social networks, but are often hidden. Underlying generative
mechanisms of social networks are predicted by structural balance theory, which postulates that
triads of agents, prefer to be transitive, where friends of friends are more likely friends, or anti-transitive,
where adversaries of adversaries become friends. The previously proposed Iterated Local Transitivity
(ILT) and Iterated Local Anti-Transitivity (ILAT) models incorporated transitivity and anti-transitivity,
respectively, as evolutionary mechanisms. These models resulted in graphs with many observable
properties of social networks, such as low diameter, high clustering, and densification. We propose
a new, generative model, referred to as the Iterated Local Model (ILM) for social networks synthesizing
both transitive and anti-transitive triads over time. In ILM, we are given a countably infinite
binary sequence as input, and that sequence determines whether we apply a transitive or an anti-transitive
step. The resulting model exhibits many properties of complex networks observed in the ILT and ILAT
models. In particular, for any input binary sequence, we show that asymptotically the model generates
finite graphs that densify, have clustering coefficient bounded away from 0, have diameter at most
3, and exhibit bad spectral expansion. We also give a thorough analysis of the chromatic number,
domination number, Hamiltonicity, and isomorphism types of induced subgraphs of ILM graphs.
