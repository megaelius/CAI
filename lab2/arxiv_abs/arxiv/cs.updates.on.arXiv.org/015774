This study investigates a parameterization of all retrofit controllers. Retrofit control can
accomplish modular design of control systems, i.e., independent design of subcontrollers only
with its corresponding subsystem model in a dynamical network system. In the retrofit control framework,
the network system to be controlled is regarded as an interconnected system composed of the subsystem
of interest and an environment. Existing studies have revealed that all retrofit controllers can
be characterized as a constrained Youla parameterization under the technical assumption that
the subsystem of interest is stable. It has also been discovered that all of the retrofit controllers
that belong to a particular tractable class have a distinctive internal structure composed of a
rectifier and an internal controller under the additional technical assumption that the interconnection
signal from the environment to the subsystem of interest is measurable or that the internal state
of the subsystem of interest is measurable. Due to the internal structure, the retrofit controller
design problem under the assumptions can be reduced to a standard controller design problem to which
existing controller synthesis techniques can be applied. The aim of this paper is to extend the above
results without the technical assumptions. It is found that the existing developments can naturally
be generalized through the Youla parameterization for unstable systems and an explicit description
of the inverse system with the geometric control theory. The result leads to the conclusion that
retrofit controllers can readily be designed even in the general case.
