The problem of cyber attacks with bounded sensor reading edits for partially-observed discrete
event systems is considered. An operator observes a plant through an observation mask that does
not allow him to detect the occurrence of certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted
by an attacker who can insert and erase some sensor readings. The operator observes the system evolution
in order to validate if a state in a given set of unsafe states is reached. The attacker corrupts the
observation with the aim of preventing the operator to verify when an interesting state has been
reached. Furthermore, the attacker wants to remain stealthy, namely he wants the operator does
not realize that someone is corrupting his observation. An automaton, called attack structure
is proposed, which supports the attacker in defining an effective attack. In more detail, first,
the unbounded attack structure is obtained by doing the concurrent composition of two state observers,
the attacker observer and the operator observer. Then, the n-bounded attack structure, for a given
integer value of n, is obtained by doing the concurrent composition of the unbounded attack structure
and an n-bounded attack automaton. Finally, the n-bounded attack structure can be made supremal
and stealthy by appropriately trimming the previous attack structure. A stealthy attacker can
elaborate his strategy looking at the supremal stealthy attack substructure and may result in different
degrees of effectiveness: strong, weak or vain. The proposed approach can be dually used to verify
if such an attack could be effective for the given system, thus to establish if the system is safe under
attack.
