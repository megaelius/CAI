Evolution sculpts both the body plans and nervous systems of agents together over time. In contrast,
in AI and robotics, a robot's body plan is usually designed by hand, and control policies are then
optimized for that fixed design. The task of simultaneously co-optimizing the morphology and controller
of an embodied robot has remained a challenge. In psychology, the theory of embodied cognition posits
that behavior arises from a close coupling between body plan and sensorimotor control, which suggests
why co-optimizing these two subsystems is so difficult: most evolutionary changes to morphology
tend to adversely impact sensorimotor control, leading to an overall decrease in behavioral performance.
Here, we further examine this hypothesis and demonstrate a technique for "morphological innovation
protection", which temporarily reduces selection pressure on recently morphologically-changed
individuals, thus enabling evolution some time to "readapt" to the new morphology with subsequent
control policy mutations. We show the potential for this method to avoid local optima and converge
to similar highly fit morphologies across widely varying initial conditions, while sustaining
fitness improvements further into optimization. While this technique is admittedly only the first
of many steps that must be taken to achieve scalable optimization of embodied machines, we hope that
theoretical insight into the cause of evolutionary stagnation in current methods will help to enable
the automation of robot design and behavioral training -- while simultaneously providing a testbed
to investigate the theory of embodied cognition.
