Organizations use diverse types of security solutions to prevent cyberattacks. Multiple vendors
provide security solutions developed using heterogeneous technologies and paradigms. Hence,
it is a challenging rather impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion.
Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools that can effectively
and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given
the increasing role and importance of security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount
of literature on different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been
no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We report a Multivocal Literature
Review that has systematically selected and reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages,
white papers) literature on different aspects of security orchestration published from January
2007 until July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of security orchestration
and classify the main functionalities of security orchestration into three main areas: unification,
orchestration, and automation. We have also identified the core components of a security orchestration
platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration based on technical and socio-technical
aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of security orchestration based on the execution environment,
automation strategy, deployment type, mode of task and resource type. This review has helped us
to reveal several areas of further research and development in security orchestration.
