Performance monitoring is an essential function for margin measurements in live systems. Historically,
system budgets have been described by the Q-factor converted from the bit error rate (BER) under
binary modulation and direct detection. The introduction of hard-decision forward error correction
(FEC) did not change this. In recent years technologies have changed significantly to comprise
coherent detection, multilevel modulation and soft FEC. In such advanced systems, different metrics
such as (nomalized) generalized mutual information (GMI/NGMI) and asymmetric information (ASI)
are regarded as being more reliable. On the other hand, Q budgets are still useful because pre-FEC
BER monitoring is established in industry for live system monitoring. The pre-FEC BER is easily
estimated from available information of the number of flipped bits in the FEC decoding, which does
not require knowledge of the transmitted bits that are unknown in live systems. Therefore, the use
of metrics like GMI/NGMI/ASI for performance monitoring has not been possible in live systems.
However, in this work we propose a blind soft-performance estimation method. Based on a histogram
of log-likelihood-values without the knowledge of the transmitted bits, we show how the ASI can
be estimated. We examined the proposed method experimentally for 16 and 64-ary quadrature amplitude
modulation (QAM) and probabilistically shaped 16, 64, and 256-QAM in recirculating loop experiments.
We see a relative error of 2.4%, which corresponds to around 0.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio difference
for binary modulation, in the regime where the ASI is larger than the assumed FEC threshold. For this
proposed method, the digital signal processing circuitry requires only a minimal additional function
of storing the L-value histograms before the soft-decision FEC decoder.
