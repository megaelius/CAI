A methodology for using random sketching in the context of model order reduction for high-dimensional
parameter-dependent systems of equations was introduced in [Balabanov and Nouy 2019, Part I].
Following this framework, we here construct a reduced model from a small, efficiently computable
random object called a sketch of a reduced model, using minimal residual methods. We introduce a
sketched version of the minimal residual based projection as well as a novel nonlinear approximation
method, where for each parameter value, the solution is approximated by minimal residual projection
onto a subspace spanned by several vectors picked (online) from a dictionary of candidate basis
vectors. It is shown that random sketching technique can improve not only efficiency but also numerical
stability. A rigorous analysis of the conditions on the random sketch required to obtain a given
accuracy is presented. These conditions may be ensured a priori with high probability by considering
for the sketching matrix an oblivious embedding of sufficiently large size. Furthermore, a simple
and reliable procedure for a posteriori verification of the quality of the sketch is provided. This
approach can be used for certification of the approximation as well as for adaptive selection of
the size of the random sketching matrix. We also propose a two-step procedure for an efficient and
stable estimation of an inner product between parameter-dependent vectors having affine decompositions
with many terms (possibly expensive to maintain). This procedure can be used for extraction of a
quantity of interest (linear or quadratic functional of the solution), estimation of the primal-dual
correction, etc.
