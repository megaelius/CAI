Sybil detection in social networks is a basic security research problem. Structure-based methods
have been shown to be promising at detecting Sybils. Existing structure-based methods can be classified
into Random Walk (RW)-based methods and Loop Belief Propagation (LBP)-based methods. RW-based
methods cannot leverage labeled Sybils and labeled benign users simultaneously, which limits
their detection accuracy, and/or they are not robust to noisy labels. LBP-based methods are not
scalable and cannot guarantee convergence. In this work, we propose SybilSCAR, a novel structure-based
method to detect Sybils in social networks. SybilSCAR is Scalable, Convergent, Accurate, and Robust
to label noise. We first propose a framework to unify RW-based and LBP-based methods. Under our framework,
these methods can be viewed as iteratively applying a (different) local rule to every user, which
propagates label information among a social graph. Second, we design a new local rule, which SybilSCAR
iteratively applies to every user to detect Sybils. We compare SybilSCAR with state-of-the-art
RW-based and LBP-based methods theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we show that, with
proper parameter settings, SybilSCAR has a tighter asymptotical bound on the number of Sybils that
are falsely accepted into a social network than existing structure-based methods. Empirically,
we perform evaluation using both social networks with synthesized Sybils and a large-scale Twitter
dataset (41.7M nodes and 1.2B edges) with real Sybils. Our results show that 1) SybilSCAR is substantially
more accurate and more robust to label noise than state-of-the-art RW-based methods; 2) SybilSCAR
is more accurate and one order of magnitude more scalable than state-of-the-art LBP-based methods.
