Homogenization in terms of multiscale limits transforms a multiscale problem with $n+1$ asymptotically
separated microscales posed on a physical domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ into a one-scale problem
posed on a product domain of dimension $(n+1)d$ by introducing $n$ so-called "fast variables".
This procedure allows to convert $n+1$ scales in $d$ physical dimensions into a single-scale structure
in $(n+1)d$ dimensions. We prove here that both the original, physical multiscale problem and the
corresponding high-dimensional, one-scale limiting problem can be efficiently treated numerically
with the recently developed quantized tensor-train finite-element method (QTT-FEM). The method
is based on restricting computation to sequences of nested subspaces of low dimensions (which are
called tensor ranks) within a vast but generic "virtual" (background) discretization space. In
the course of computation, these subspaces are computed iteratively and data-adaptively at runtime,
bypassing any "offline precomputation". For the purpose of theoretical analysis, such low-dimensional
subspaces are constructed analytically to bound the tensor ranks vs. error $\tau>0$. We consider
a model linear elliptic multiscale problem in several physical dimensions and show, theoretically
and experimentally, that both (i) the solution of the associated high-dimensional one-scale problem
and (ii) the corresponding approximation to the solution of the multiscale problem admit efficient
approximation by the QTT-FEM. These problems can therefore be numerically solved in a scale-robust
fashion by standard (low-order) PDE discretizations combined with state-of-the-art general-purpose
solvers for tensor-structured linear systems. We prove scale-robust exponential convergence,
i.e., that QTT-FEM achieves accuracy $\tau$ with the number of effective degrees of freedom scaling
polynomially in $\log \tau$.
