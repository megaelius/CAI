Data plays an important role in applications, analytic processes, and many aspects of human activity.
As data grows in size and complexity, we are met with an imperative need for tools that promote understanding
and explanations over data-related operations. Data management research on explanations has
focused on the assumption that data resides in a single dataset, under one common schema. But the
reality of today's data is that it is frequently un-integrated, coming from different sources with
different schemas. When different datasets provide different answers to semantically similar
questions, understanding the reasons for the discrepancies is challenging and cannot be handled
by the existing single-dataset solutions. In this paper, we propose Explain3D, a framework for
explaining the disagreements across disjoint datasets (3D). Explain3D focuses on identifying
the reasons for the differences in the results of two semantically similar queries operating on
two datasets with potentially different schemas. Our framework leverages the queries to perform
a semantic mapping across the relevant parts of their provenance; discrepancies in this mapping
point to causes of the queries' differences. Exploiting the queries gives Explain3D an edge over
traditional schema matching and record linkage techniques, which are query-agnostic. Our work
makes the following contributions: (1) We formalize the problem of deriving optimal explanations
for the differences of the results of semantically similar queries over disjoint datasets. (2)
We design a 3-stage framework for solving the optimal explanation problem. (3) We develop a smart-partitioning
optimizer that improves the efficiency of the framework by orders of magnitude. (4)~We experiment
with real-world and synthetic data to demonstrate that Explain3D can derive precise explanations
efficiently.
