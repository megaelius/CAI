Millimeter-wave (mmWave) with large spectrum available is considered as the most promising frequency
band for future wireless communications. The IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay operating on 60 GHz
mmWave are the two most expected wireless local area network (WLAN) technologies for ultra-high-speed
communications. For the IEEE 802.11ay standard still under development, there are plenty of proposals
from companies and researchers who are involved with the IEEE 802.11ay task group. In this survey,
we conduct a comprehensive review on the medium access control layer (MAC) related issues for the
IEEE 802.11ay, some cross-layer between physical layer (PHY) and MAC technologies are also included.
We start with MAC related technologies in the IEEE 802.11ad and discuss design challenges on mmWave
communications, leading to some MAC related technologies for the IEEE 802.11ay. We then elaborate
on important design issues for IEEE 802.11ay. Specifically, we review the channel bonding and aggregation
for the IEEE 802.11ay, and point out the major differences between the two technologies. Then, we
describe channel access and channel allocation in the IEEE 802.11ay, including spatial sharing
and interference mitigation technologies. After that, we present an in-depth survey on beamforming
training (BFT), beam tracking, single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) beamforming
and multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) beamforming. Finally, we discuss
some open design issues and future research directions for mmWave WLANs. We hope that this paper
provides a good introduction to this exciting research area for future wireless systems.
