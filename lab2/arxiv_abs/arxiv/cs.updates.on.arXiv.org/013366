Spot prices in deregulated electricity markets in the United States and Europe have historically
displayed high volatility, leading to loss of revenue in high electricity costs, weakening economic
growth and lost business from long blackouts. With rapidly increasing supply of intermittent solar
and wind-based power, conditions in the foreseeable future are only expected to deteriorate. Geographic
price variations, while capable of being quite dramatic themselves, are a natural outcome of Locational
Marginal Pricing (LMP) that takes finite transmission capacity and congestion into consideration,
to produce localized electricity prices. Temporal price volatility (considerable fluctuation
over periods as short as an hour in particular), however, is harder to explain. In an effort to unearth
the cause of these price fluctuations, we propose to model the electricity market as a discrete time
controlled stochastic process. While this is a stylized model, it facilitates the analysis of spot
markets and helps exclude extraneous details that do not contribute significantly to the discussion.
We show that in any such market, improving social welfare must necessarily be traded off with volatility
in prices, i.e., it is impossible to reduce volatility in the price of electricity without sacrificing
social welfare. We also show that, akin to communication systems, every market has a Capacity Region
associated with it, that dictates and quantifies how much welfare is achievable at a given level
of price volatility. In the context of renewable power sources, our investigation uncovers an intriguing
phenomenon we term the volatility cliff, which suggests that with increasing penetration of intermittent
renewable production, price volatility could increase to unacceptable levels, prompting the
need for a complete restructuring of existing electricity markets.
