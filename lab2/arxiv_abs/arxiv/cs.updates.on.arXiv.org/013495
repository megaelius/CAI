The presence of residual and dense neural networks which greatly promotes the development of image
Super-Resolution(SR) have witnessed a lot of impressive results. Depending on our observation,
although more layers and connections could always improve performance, the increase of model parameters
is not conducive to launch application of SR algorithms. Furthermore, algorithms supervised by
L1/L2 loss can achieve considerable performance on traditional metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, yet
resulting in blurry and over-smoothed outputs without sufficient high-frequency details, namely
low perceptual index(PI). Regarding the issues, this paper develops a perception-oriented single
image SR algorithm via dual relativistic average generative adversarial networks. In the generator
part, a novel residual channel attention block is proposed to recalibrate significance of specific
channels, further increasing feature expression capabilities. Parameters of convolutional
layers within each block are shared to expand receptive fields while maintain the amount of tunable
parameters unchanged. The feature maps are subsampled using sub-pixel convolution to obtain reconstructed
high-resolution images. The discriminator part consists of two relativistic average discriminators
that work in pixel domain and feature domain, respectively, fully exploiting the prior that half
of data in a mini-batch are fake. Different weighted combinations of perceptual loss and adversarial
loss are utilized to supervise the generator to equilibrate perceptual quality and objective results.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that our proposed algorithm can rival state-of-the-art
SR algorithms, both perceptually(PI-minimization) and objectively(PSNR-maximization) with
fewer parameters.
