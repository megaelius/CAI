HEP event selection is traditionally considered a binary classification problem, involving the
dichotomous categories of signal and background. In distribution fits for particle masses or couplings,
however, signal events are not all equivalent, as the signal differential cross section has different
sensitivities to the measured parameter in different regions of phase space. In this paper, I describe
a mathematical framework for the evaluation and optimization of HEP parameter fits, where this
sensitivity is defined on an event-by-event basis, and for MC events it is modeled in terms of their
MC weight derivatives with respect to the measured parameter. Minimising the statistical error
on a measurement implies the need to resolve (i.e. separate) events with different sensitivities,
which ultimately represents a non-dichotomous classification problem. Since MC weight derivatives
are not available for real data, the practical strategy I suggest consists in training a regressor
of weight derivatives against MC events, and then using it as an optimal partitioning variable for
1-dimensional fits of data events. This CHEP2019 paper is an extension of the study presented at
CHEP2018: in particular, event-by-event sensitivities allow the exact computation of the "FIP"
ratio between the Fisher information obtained from an analysis and the maximum information that
could possibly be obtained with an ideal detector. Using this expression, I discuss the relationship
between FIP and two metrics commonly used in Meteorology (Brier score and MSE), and the importance
of "sharpness" both in HEP and in that domain. I finally point out that HEP distribution fits should
be optimized and evaluated using probabilistic metrics (like FIP or MSE), whereas ranking metrics
(like AUC) or threshold metrics (like accuracy) are of limited relevance for these specific problems.
