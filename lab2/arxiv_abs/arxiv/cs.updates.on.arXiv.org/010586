In this paper we study the quantum learnability of constant-depth classical circuits under the
uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent framework of PAC learning. In order
to attain our results, we establish connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure cryptosystems.
We then achieve the following results. 1) Hardness of learning AC$^0$ and TC$^0$ under the uniform
distribution. Our first result concerns the concept class TC$^0$ (resp. AC$^0$), the class of constant-depth
and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates).
We show that if there exists no quantum polynomial-time (resp. strong sub-exponential time) algorithm
to solve the Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial-time quantum
learning algorithm for TC$^0$ (resp. AC$^0$) under the uniform distribution (even with access
to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this result uses explicit pseudo-random
functions that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn
quantumly under the uniform distribution. 2) Hardness of learning TC$^0_2$ in the PAC setting.
Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem,
then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the class TC$^0_2$, i.e.,
depth-2 TC$^0$ circuits. The main technique in this result is to establish a connection between
the quantum security of public-key cryptosystems and the learnability of a concept class that consists
of decryption functions of the cryptosystem. This gives a strong (conditional) negative answer
to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson [Aar05],
who asked if AC$^0$ and TC$^0$ can be PAC-learned in quantum polynomial time.
