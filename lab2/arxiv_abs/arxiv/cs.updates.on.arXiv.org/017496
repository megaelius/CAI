We study large-scale systems operating under the JSQ$(d)$ policy in the presence of stringent task-server
compatibility constraints. Consider a system with $N$ identical single-server queues and $M(N)$
task types, where each server is able to process only a small subset of possible task types. Each arriving
task selects $d\geq 2$ random servers compatible to its type, and joins the shortest queue among
them. The compatibility constraint is naturally captured by a fixed bipartite graph $G_N$ between
the servers and the task types. When $G_N$ is complete bipartite, the meanfield approximation is
proven to be accurate. However, such dense compatibility graphs are infeasible due to their overwhelming
implementation cost and prohibitive storage capacity requirement at the servers. Our goal in this
paper is to characterize the class of sparse compatibility graphs for which the meanfield approximation
remains valid. To achieve this, first, we introduce a novel graph expansion-based notion, called
proportional sparsity, and establish that systems with proportionally sparse compatibility
graphs match the performance of a fully flexible system, asymptotically in the large-system limit.
Furthermore, for any $c(N)$ satisfying $$\frac{Nc(N)}{M(N)\ln(N)}\to \infty\quad \text{and}\quad
c(N)\to \infty,$$ as $N\to\infty$, we show that proportionally sparse random compatibility graphs
can be designed, so that the degree of each server is at most $c(N)$. This reduces the server-degree
almost by a factor $N/\ln(N)$, compared to the complete bipartite compatibility graph, while maintaining
the same asymptotic performance. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to corroborate
the theoretical results.
