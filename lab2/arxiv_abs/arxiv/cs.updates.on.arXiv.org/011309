This work presents a computational method for the design of architected truss lattice materials
where each strut can be made of one of a set of available materials. We design the lattices to extremize
effective properties. As customary in topology optimization, we design a periodic unit cell of
the lattice and obtain the effective properties via numerical homogenization. Each bar is represented
as a cylindrical offset surface of a medial axis parameterized by the positions of the endpoints
of the medial axis. These parameters are smoothly mapped onto a continuous density field for the
primal and sensitivity analysis via the geometry projection method. A size variable per material
is ascribed to each bar and penalized as in density-based topology optimization to facilitate the
entire removal of bars from the design. During the optimization, we allow bars to be made of a mixture
of the available materials. However, to ensure each bar is either exclusively made of one material
or removed altogether from the optimal design, we impose optimization constraints that ensure
each size variable is 0 or 1, and that at most one material size variable is 1. The proposed material
interpolation scheme readily accommodates any number of materials. To obtain lattices with desired
material symmetries, we design only a reference region of the unit cell and reflect its geometry
projection with respect to the appropriate planes of symmetry. Also, to ensure bars remain whole
upon reflection inside the unit cell or with respect to the periodic boundaries, we impose a no-cut
constraint on the bars. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via numerical examples of bulk
and shear moduli maximization and Poisson's ratio minimization for two- and three-material lattices
with cubic symmetry.
