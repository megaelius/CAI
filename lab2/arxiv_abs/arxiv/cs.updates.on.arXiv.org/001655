The conflicting problems of growing mobile service demand and underutilization of dedicated spectrum
has given rise to a paradigm where mobile network operators (MNOs) share their infrastructure among
themselves in order to lower their operational costs, while at the same time increase the usage of
their existing network resources. We model and analyze such an infrastructure sharing system considering
a single buyer MNO and multiple seller MNOs. Assuming that the locations of the BSs can be modeled
as a homogeneous Poisson point process, we find the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) coverage probability for a user served by the buyer MNO in an infrastructure sharing
environment. We analyze the trade-off between increasing the transmit power of a BS and the intensity
of BSs owned by the buyer MNO required to achieve a given quality-of-service (QoS) in terms of the
SINR coverage probability. Also, for a seller MNO, we analyze the power consumption of the network
per unit area (i.e., areal power consumption) which is shown to be a piecewise continuous function
of BS intensity, composed of a linear and a convex function. Accordingly, the BS intensity of the
seller MNO can be optimized to minimize the areal power consumption while achieving a minimum QoS
for the buyer MNO. We then use these results to formulate a single-buyer multiple-seller BS infrastructure
market. The buyer MNO is concerned with finding which seller MNO to purchase from and what fraction
of BSs to purchase. On the sellers' side, the problem of pricing and determining the fraction of infrastructure
to be sold is formulated as a Cournot oligopoly market. We prove that the iterative update of each
seller's best response always converges to the Nash Equilibrium.
