Missing values, irregularly collected samples, and multi-resolution signals commonly occur
in multivariate time series data, making predictive tasks difficult. These challenges are especially
prevalent in the healthcare domain, where patients' vital signs and electronic records are collected
at different frequencies and have occasionally missing information due to the imperfections in
equipment or patient circumstances. Researchers have handled each of these issues differently,
often handling missing data through mean value imputation and then using sequence models over the
multivariate signals while ignoring the different resolution of signals. We propose a unified
model named Multi-resolution Flexible Irregular Time series Network (Multi-FIT). The building
block for Multi-FIT is the FIT network. The FIT network creates an informative dense representation
at each time step using signal information such as last observed value, time difference since the
last observed time stamp and overall mean for the signal. Vertical FIT (FIT-V) is a variant of FIT
which also models the relationship between different temporal signals while creating the informative
dense representations for the signal. The multi-FIT model uses multiple FIT networks for sets of
signals with different resolutions, further facilitating the construction of flexible representations.
Our model has three main contributions: a.) it does not impute values but rather creates informative
representations to provide flexibility to the model for creating task-specific representations
b.) it models the relationship between different signals in the form of support signals c.) it models
different resolutions in parallel before merging them for the final prediction task. The FIT, FIT-V
and Multi-FIT networks improve upon the state-of-the-art models for three predictive tasks, including
the forecasting of patient survival.
