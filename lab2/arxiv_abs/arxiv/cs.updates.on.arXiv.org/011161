In this paper we give provable sieving algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest
Vector Problem (CVP) on lattices in $\ell_p$ norm for $1\leq p\leq\infty$. The running time we get
is better than existing provable sieving algorithms, except the Discrete Gaussian based algorithm
by Aggarwal et al. [2015], but this algorithm works only for the Euclidean norm. We build on the randomized
sieving framework of Ajtai, Kumar and Sivakumar [2001,2002], where they used a sieving sub-routine
that runs in time quadratic in the number of sampled vectors. We give a new sieving procedure that
works for all $\ell_p$ norm and runs in time linear in the number of sampled vectors. The main idea
is to divide the space (hyperball) into sub-regions (hypercubes) such that each vector can be mapped
efficiently to a sub-region. This is an extension of the sieving technique in Aggarwal and Mukhopadhyay
[2018], where it has been used only for the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Prior to these works Blomer and
Naewe [2009] generalised the AKS algorithm and our analysis shows that their algorithm can achieve
a time complexity of $2^{3.849n+o(n)}$, while our algorithm has a running time $2^{2.751n+o(n)}$.
We further modify our linear sieving technique and introduce a mixed sieving procedure. At first
a point is mapped to a hypercube within a ball and then within each hypercube we perform a quadratic
seve like AKS. This improves the running time, specially in the $\ell_2$ norm, where we achieve a
time complexity of $2^{2.25n+o(n)}$, while the List Sieve Birthday algorithm [Pujol an Stehle,
2009] has a running time $2^{2.465n+o(n)}$ in the same norm. We also adopt our sieving techniques
to approximation algorithms for SVP and CVP in $\ell_p$ norm and achieve a running time of $2^{2.001n+o(n)}$,
while algorithms like [BN, 2009] have a time complexity of $2^{3.169n+o(n)}$.
