The backhaul of hundreds of light fidelity (LiFi) base stations (BSs) constitutes a major challenge.
Indoor wireless optical backhauling is a novel approach whereby the interconnections between
adjacent LiFi BSs are provided by way of directed line-of-sight (LOS) wireless infrared (IR) links.
Building on the aforesaid approach, this paper presents the top-down design of a multi-hop wireless
backhaul configuration for multi-tier optical attocell networks by proposing the novel idea of
super cells. Such cells incorporate multiple clusters of attocells that are connected to the core
network via a single gateway based on multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. Consequently,
new challenges arise for managing the bandwidth and power resources of the bottleneck backhaul.
By putting forward user-based bandwidth scheduling (UBS) and cell-based bandwidth scheduling
(CBS) policies, the system-level modeling and analysis of the end-to-end multi-user sum rate is
elaborated. In addition, optimal bandwidth scheduling under both UBS and CBS policies are formulated
as constrained convex optimization problems, which are solved by using the projected subgradient
method. Furthermore, the transmission power of the backhaul system is opportunistically reduced
by way of an innovative fixed power control (FPC) strategy. The notion of backhaul bottleneck occurrence
(BBO) is introduced. An accurate approximate expression of the probability of BBO is derived, and
then verified using Monte Carlo simulations. Several insights are provided into the offered gains
of the proposed schemes through extensive computer simulations, by studying different aspects
of the performance of super cells including the average sum rate, the BBO probability and the backhaul
power efficiency (PE).
