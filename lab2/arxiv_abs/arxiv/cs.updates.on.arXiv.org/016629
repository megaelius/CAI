Our chapter presents a scoping review of published scientific studies or case studies of scientific
studies that utilise both citizen scientists and Internet of Things devices. Specifically, we
selected studies where the authors had included at least a short discussion of the ethical issues
encountered during the research process. Having conducted a search of five databases (IEEE Xplore,
Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and PubMed), we identified 631 potential results. Following
abstract and title screening, and then full text eligibility assessment, we identified 34 published
articles that matched our criteria. We then analysed the full text for these articles inductively
and deductively, coding ethical issues into three main categories. These categories were autonomy
and data privacy, data quality, and intellectual property. We also analysed the full text of these
articles to see what strategies researchers took to resolve these ethical issues, as well as any
legal implications raised. Following this analysis, our discussion provides recommendations
for researchers who wish to integrate citizen scientists and Internet of Things devices into their
research. First, all citizen science projects should integrate a data privacy protocol to protect
the confidentiality of participants. Secondly, scientific researchers should consider any potential
issues of data quality, including whether compromises might be required, before establishing
a project. Finally, all intellectual property issues should be clarified both at the start of the
project and during its lifecycle. Researchers should also consider any ethical issues that might
flow from the use of commercially available Internet of Things devices for research.
