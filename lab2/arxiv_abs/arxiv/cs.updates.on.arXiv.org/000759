The computation of the geometric transformation between a reference and a target image, known as
registration or alignment, corresponds to the projection of the target image onto the transformation
manifold of the reference image (the set of images generated by its geometric transformations).
It, however, often takes a nontrivial form such that the exact computation of projections on the
manifold is difficult. The tangent distance method is an effective algorithm to solve this problem
by exploiting a linear approximation of the manifold. As theoretical studies about the tangent
distance algorithm have been largely overlooked, we present in this work a detailed performance
analysis of this useful algorithm, which can eventually help its implementation. We consider a
popular image registration setting using a multiscale pyramid of lowpass filtered versions of
the (possibly noisy) reference and target images, which is particularly useful for recovering
large transformations. We first show that the alignment error has a nonmonotonic variation with
the filter size, due to the opposing effects of filtering on both manifold nonlinearity and image
noise. We then study the convergence of the multiscale tangent distance method to the optimal solution.
We finally examine the performance of the tangent distance method in image classification applications.
Our theoretical findings are confirmed by experiments on image transformation models involving
translations, rotations and scalings. Our study is the first detailed study of the tangent distance
algorithm that leads to a better understanding of its efficacy and to the proper selection of its
design parameters.
