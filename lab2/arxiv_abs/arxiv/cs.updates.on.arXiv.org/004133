Big Data is characterized by Volume, Velocity, Veracity and Complexity. The interaction between
this huge data is complex with an associated free will having dynamic and non linear nature. We reduced
big data based on its characteristics, conceptually driven by quantum field theory and utilizing
the physics of condensed matter theory in a complex nonlinear dynamic system: Quantum Topological
Field Theory of Data. The model is formulated from the dynamics and evolution of single datum, eventually
defining the global properties and evolution of collective data space via action, partition function,
green propagators in almost polynomially solvable O(nlogn) complexity. The simulated results
show that the time complexity of our algorithm for global optimization via quantum adiabatic evolution
is almost in O(logn) Our algorithm first mines the space via greedy approach and makes a list of all
ground state Hamiltonians, then utilizing the tunnelling property of quantum mechanics optimizes
the algorithm unlike up hill and iterative techniques and doesnot let algorithm to get localized
in local minima or sharp valley due to adiabatic evolution of the system. The loss in quantumness,
non realizable, no clone, noise, decoherence, splitting of energy states due to electric and magnetic
fields, variant to perturbations and less lifetime makes it inefficient for practical implementation.
The inefficiencies of qubit can be overcome via property that remains invariant to perturbation
and Cartesian independent having well defined mathematical structure. It can be well addressed
via topological field theory of data.
