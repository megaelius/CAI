All the state-of-the-art rowhammer attacks can break the MMU-enforced inter-domain isolation
based on the fact that the physical memory owned by each domain is adjacent to each other. To mitigate
such attacks, CATT as the first generic and practical technique, essentially separates each domain
physically. It divides the physical memory into multiple partitions and keeps each partition occupied
by only one domain, called the single ownership invariant. Hence, all existing rowhammer attacks
are effectively defeated. In this paper, we develop a novel practical exploit, which could effectively
defeat CATT and gain both root and kernel privileges, without exhausting page cache and system memory,
or relying on any virtual-to-physical mapping information. Specifically, our key observation
is that on the modern OSes there exist double-ownership kernel buffers (e.g., video buffers) owned
concurrently by the kernel and user domains, invalidating the singleownership invariant enforced
by CATT and making the rowhammer-based attack become possible again. In contrast to existing conspicuous
rowhammer exploits that exhaust page cache or even the whole system memory, we propose a new attack
technique, named memory ambush, which is able to place the hammerable kernel buffers physically
adjacent to the target objects (e.g., page tables) with only a small amount of memory, making our
exploit stealthier and fewer memory fingerprints. We also replace the inefficient rowhammer algorithm
that blindly picks up addresses for hammering with an efficient one, which probes suitable addresses
using a side channel. We implement our exploit on the Linux kernel 4.10.0-generic. Our experiment
results indicate that our exploit is able to gain the root and kernel privileges within roughly 1
to 36 minutes. The occupied memory could be reduced to 128MB.
