A reassembling of a simple graph G = (V,E) is an abstraction of a problem arising in earlier studies
of network analysis. There are several equivalent definitions of graph reassembling; in this report
we use a definition which makes it closest to the notion of graph carving. A reassembling is a rooted
binary tree whose nodes are subsets of V and whose leaf nodes are singleton sets, with each of the latter
containing a distinct vertex of G. The parent of two nodes in the reassembling is the union of the two
children's vertex sets. The root node of the reassembling is the full set V. The edge-boundary degree
of a node in the reassembling is the number of edges in G that connect vertices in the node's set to vertices
not in the node's set. A reassembling's alpha-measure is the largest edge-boundary degree of any
node in the reassembling. A reassembling of G is alpha-optimal if its alpha-measure is the minimum
among all alpha-measures of G's reassemblings. The problem of finding an alpha-optimal reassembling
of a simple graph in general was already shown to be NP-hard. In this report we present an algorithm
which, given a 3-regular plane graph G = (V,E) as input, returns a reassembling of G with an alpha-measure
independent of n (number of vertices in G) and upper-bounded by 2k, where k is the edge-outerplanarity
of G. (Edge-outerplanarity is distinct but closely related to the usual notion of outerplanarity;
as with outerplanarity, for a fixed edge-outerplanarity k, the number n of vertices can be arbitrarily
large.) Our algorithm runs in time linear in n. Moreover, we construct a class of $3$-regular plane
graphs for which this alpha-measure is optimal, by proving that 2k is the lower bound on the alpha-measure
of any reassembling of a graph in that class.
