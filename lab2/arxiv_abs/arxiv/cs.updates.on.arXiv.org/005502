Probabilistic databases (PDBs) introduce uncertainty into relational databases by specifying
probabilities for several possible instances. Traditionally, they are finite probability spaces
over database instances. Such finite PDBs inherently make a closed-world assumption: non-occurring
facts are assumed to be impossible, rather than just unlikely. As convincingly argued by Ceylan
et al. (KR '16), this results in implausibilities and clashes with intuition. An open-world assumption,
where facts not explicitly listed may have a small positive probability can yield more reasonable
results. The corresponding open-world model of Ceylan et al., however, assumes that all entities
in the PDB come from a fixed finite universe. In this work, we take one further step and propose a model
of "truly" open-world PDBs with an infinite universe. This is natural when we consider entities
from typical domains such as integers, real numbers, or strings. While the probability space might
become infinitely large, all instances of a PDB remain finite. We provide a sound mathematical framework
for infinite PDBs generalizing the existing theory of finite PDBs. Our main results are concerned
with countable, tuple-independent PDBs; we present a generic construction showing that such PDBs
exist in the infinite and provide a characterization of their existence. This construction can
be used to give an open-world semantics to finite PDBs. The construction can also be extended to so-called
block-independent-disjoint probabilistic databases. Algorithmic questions are not the focus
of this paper, but we show how query evaluation algorithms can be lifted from finite PDBs to perform
approximate evaluation (with an arbitrarily small additive approximation error) in countably
infinite tuple-independent PDBs.
