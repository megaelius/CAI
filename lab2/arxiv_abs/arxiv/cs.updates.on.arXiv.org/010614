With the advent of social media, our online feeds increasingly consist of short, informal, and unstructured
text. This textual data can be analyzed for the purpose of improving user recommendations and detecting
trends. Instagram is one of the largest social media platforms, containing both text and images.
However, most of the prior research on text processing in social media is focused on analyzing Twitter
data, and little attention has been paid to text mining of Instagram data. Moreover, many text mining
methods rely on annotated training data, which in practice is both difficult and expensive to obtain.
In this paper, we present methods for unsupervised mining of fashion attributes from Instagram
text, which can enable a new kind of user recommendation in the fashion domain. In this context, we
analyze a corpora of Instagram posts from the fashion domain, introduce a system for extracting
fashion attributes from Instagram, and train a deep clothing classifier with weak supervision
to classify Instagram posts based on the associated text. With our experiments, we confirm that
word embeddings are a useful asset for information extraction. Experimental results show that
information extraction using word embeddings outperforms a baseline that uses Levenshtein distance.
The results also show the benefit of combining weak supervision signals using generative models
instead of majority voting. Using weak supervision and generative modeling, an F1 score of 0.61
is achieved on the task of classifying the image contents of Instagram posts based solely on the associated
text, which is on level with human performance. Finally, our empirical study provides one of the
few available studies on Instagram text and shows that the text is noisy, that the text distribution
exhibits the long-tail phenomenon, and that comment sections on Instagram are multi-lingual.
