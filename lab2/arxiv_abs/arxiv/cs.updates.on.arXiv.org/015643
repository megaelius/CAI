Automated methods for granular categorization of large corpora of text documents have become increasingly
more important with the rate scientific, news, medical, and web documents are growing in the last
few years. Automatic keyphrase extraction (AKE) aims to automatically detect a small set of single
or multi-words from within a single textual document that captures the main topics of the document.
AKE plays an important role in various NLP and information retrieval tasks such as document summarization
and categorization, full-text indexing, and article recommendation. Due to the lack of sufficient
human-labeled data in different textual contents, supervised learning approaches are not ideal
for automatic detection of keyphrases from the content of textual bodies. With the state-of-the-art
advances in text embedding techniques, NLP researchers have focused on developing unsupervised
methods to obtain meaningful insights from raw datasets. In this work, we introduce Global and Local
Embedding Automatic Keyphrase Extractor (GLEAKE) for the task of AKE. GLEAKE utilizes single and
multi-word embedding techniques to explore the syntactic and semantic aspects of the candidate
phrases and then combines them into a series of embedding-based graphs. Moreover, GLEAKE applies
network analysis techniques on each embedding-based graph to refine the most significant phrases
as a final set of keyphrases. We demonstrate the high performance of GLEAKE by evaluating its results
on five standard AKE datasets from different domains and writing styles and by showing its superiority
with regards to other state-of-the-art methods.
