Image reconstruction from insufficient data is common in computed tomography (CT), e.g., image
reconstruction from truncated data, limited-angle data and sparse-view data. Deep learning has
achieved impressive results in this field. However, the robustness of deep learning methods is
still a concern for clinical applications due to the following two challenges: a) With limited access
to sufficient training data, a learned deep learning model may not generalize well to unseen data;
b) Deep learning models are sensitive to noise. Therefore, the quality of images processed by neural
networks only may be inadequate. In this work, we investigate the robustness of deep learning in
CT image reconstruction by showing false negative and false positive lesion cases. Since learning-based
images with incorrect structures are likely not consistent with measured projection data, we propose
a data consistent reconstruction (DCR) method to improve their image quality, which combines the
advantages of compressed sensing and deep learning: First, a prior image is generated by deep learning.
Afterwards, unmeasured projection data are inpainted by forward projection of the prior image.
Finally, iterative reconstruction with reweighted total variation regularization is applied,
integrating data consistency for measured data and learned prior information for missing data.
The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in cone-beam CT with truncated data, limited-angle
data and sparse-view data, respectively. For example, for truncated data, DCR achieves a mean root-mean-square
error of 24 HU and a mean structure similarity index of 0.999 inside the field-of-view for different
patients in the noisy case, while the state-of-the-art U-Net method achieves 55 HU and 0.995 respectively
for these two metrics.
