The Apperception Engine is an unsupervised learning system. Given a sequence of sensory inputs,
it constructs a symbolic causal theory that both explains the sensory sequence and also satisfies
a set of unity conditions. The unity conditions insist that the constituents of the theory - objects,
properties, and laws - must be integrated into a coherent whole. Once a theory has been constructed,
it can be applied to predict future sensor readings, retrodict earlier readings, or impute missing
readings. In this paper, we evaluate the Apperception Engine in a diverse variety of domains, including
cellular automata, rhythms and simple nursery tunes, multi-modal binding problems, occlusion
tasks, and sequence induction intelligence tests. In each domain, we test our engine's ability
to predict future sensor values, retrodict earlier sensor values, and impute missing sensory data.
The engine performs well in all these domains, significantly outperforming neural net baselines
and state of the art inductive logic programming systems. These results are significant because
neural nets typically struggle to solve the binding problem (where information from different
modalities must somehow be combined together into different aspects of one unified object) and
fail to solve occlusion tasks (in which objects are sometimes visible and sometimes obscured from
view). We note in particular that in the sequence induction intelligence tests, our system achieved
human-level performance. This is notable because our system is not a bespoke system designed specifically
to solve intelligence tests, but a general-purpose system that was designed to make sense of any
sensory sequence.
