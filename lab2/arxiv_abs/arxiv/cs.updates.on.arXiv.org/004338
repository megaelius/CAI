In Interactive IR, researchers consider the user behaviour towards systems and search tasks in
order to adapt search results and to improve the search experience of users. Analysing the users'
past interactions with the system is one typical approach. In this paper, we analyse the user behaviour
in retrieval sessions towards Marcia Bates' search stratagems such as Footnote Chasing, Citation
Searching, Keyword Searching, Author Searching and Journal Run in a real-life academic search
engine. In fact, search stratagems represent high-level search behaviour as the users go beyond
simple execution of queries and investigate more of the system functionalities. We performed analyses
of these five search stratagems using two datasets extracted from the social sciences search engine
sowiport. A specific focus was the detection of the search phase and frequency of the usage of these
stratagems. In addition, we explored the impact of these stratagems on the whole search process
performance. We addressed mainly the usage patterns' observation of the stratagems, their impact
on the conduct of retrieval sessions and explore whether they are used similarly in both datasets.
From the observation and metrics proposed, we can conclude that the utilisation of search stratagems
in real retrieval sessions leads to an improvement of the precision in terms of positive interactions.
However, the difference is that Footnote Chasing, Citation Searching and Journal Run appear mostly
at the end of a session while Keyword and Author Searching appear typically at the beginning. Thus,
we can conclude from the log analysis that the improvement of search functionalities including
personalisation and/or recommendation could be achieved by considering references, citations,
and journals in the ranking process.
