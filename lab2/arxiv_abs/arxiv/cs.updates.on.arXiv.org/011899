Knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side is one of the primary sources
of information that can be used for the efficient allocation of wireless resources. Obtaining downlink
(DL) CSI in Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems from uplink (UL) CSI is not as straightforward
as in TDD systems. Therefore, users usually feed the DL-CSI back to the transmitter. To remove the
need for feedback (and thus having less signaling overhead), we propose to use two recent deep neural
network structures, i.e., convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks
(GANs) to infer the DL-CSI by observing the UL-CSI. The core idea of our data-driven scheme is exploiting
the fact that both DL and UL channels share the same propagation environment. As such, we extracted
the environment information from the UL channel response to a latent domain and then transferred
the derived environment information from the latent domain to predict the DL channel. To overcome
incorrect latent domain and the problem of oversimplistic assumptions, in this work, we did not
use any specific parametric model and instead used data-driven approaches to discover the underlying
structure of data without any prior model assumptions. To overcome the challenge of capturing the
UL-DL joint distribution, we used a mean square error-based variant of the GAN structure with improved
convergence properties called boundary equilibrium GAN (BEGAN). For training and testing we used
simulated data of Extended Vehicular-A (EVA) and Extended Typical Urban (ETU) models. Simulation
results verified that our methods can accurately infer and predict the downlink CSI from the uplink
CSI for different multipath environments in FDD communications.
