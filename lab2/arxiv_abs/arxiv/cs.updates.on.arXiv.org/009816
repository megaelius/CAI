JPEG is one of the popular image compression algorithms that provide efficient storage and transmission
capabilities in consumer electronics, and hence it is the most preferred image format over the internet
world. In the present digital and Big-data era, a huge volume of JPEG compressed document images
are being archived and communicated through consumer electronics on daily basis. Though it is advantageous
to have data in the compressed form on one side, however, on the other side processing with off-the-shelf
methods becomes computationally expensive because it requires decompression and recompression
operations. Therefore, it would be novel and efficient, if the compressed data are processed directly
in their respective compressed domains of consumer electronics. In the present research paper,
we propose to demonstrate this idea taking the case study of printed text line segmentation. Since,
JPEG achieves compression by dividing the image into non overlapping 8x8 blocks in the pixel domain
and using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); it is very likely that the partitioned 8x8 DCT blocks
overlap the contents of two adjacent text-lines without leaving any clue for the line separator,
thus making text-line segmentation a challenging problem. Two approaches of segmentation have
been proposed here using the DC projection profile and AC coefficients of each 8x8 DCT block. The
first approach is based on the strategy of partial decompression of selected DCT blocks, and the
second approach is with intelligent analysis of F10 and F11 AC coefficients and without using any
type of decompression. The proposed methods have been tested with variable font sizes, font style
and spacing between lines, and a good performance is reported.
