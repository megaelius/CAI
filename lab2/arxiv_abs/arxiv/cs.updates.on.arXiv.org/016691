It has become very essential to address the limited spectrum capacity and their efficient utilization
to support the increasing number of Internet of Things devices. When it comes to medical infrastructure,
it becomes very imperative for medical devices to communicate with the base station. In such situations,
communication over the wireless medium must provide optimized throughput (data rate) with effectual
energy usage, which will ensure precise medical feedback by the responsible staff. Taking into
account, it is necessary to operate wireless communication precisely at a higher frequency with
more substantial bandwidth and low latency. Cognitive Radio (CR) is traditionally a viable choice,
where it identifies and utilizes the vacant spectrum, thus maximizing the primary user's capacity
and achieving spectral efficiency. To ensure such outcomes, the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access
(NOMA) techniques have proven to deliver an effective solution to the increasing number of devices
with unimpaired performance, especially when the communication shifts towards a higher frequency
band such as the mmWave band. In this chapter, IoT based CR network in uplink communication is proposed
alongside employing NOMA techniques for optimal throughput, and energy efficiency for a medical
infrastructure. Numerical results show that effectual throughput and energy efficiency for a
High Reliable Communication (HRC) device and Moderate Reliable Communication (MRC) device improve
over 83.13% and 73.95%, respectively and their corresponding energy efficacy values show vast
improvement (83.11% and 73.96% respectively). Likewise, for interference case both the throughput
and the energy efficiency improve approximately over 93% for all devices.
