Archival aerial imagery is a source of worldwide very high resolution data for documenting paste
3-D changes. However, external information is required so that accurate 3-D models can be computed
from archival aerial imagery. In this research, we propose and test a new method, termed Time-SIFT
(Scale Invariant Feature Transform), which allows for computing coherent multi-temporal Digital
Elevation Models (DEMs) with almost exclusively image information. This method is based on the
invariance properties of the SIFT-like methods which are at the root of the Structure from Motion
(SfM) algorithms. On a test site of 170 km2, we applied SfM algorithms to a unique image block with
all the images of four different dates covering forty years. We compared this method to more classical
methods based on the use of affordable additional data such as ground control points collected in
recent orthophotos. We did extensive tests to determine which processing choices were most impacting
on the final result. With these tests, we aimed at evaluating the potential of the proposed Time-SIFT
method for the detection and mapping of 3-D changes. Our study showed that the Time-SIFT method was
the prime criteria that allowed for computing informative DEMs of difference with almost exclusively
image information and limited photogrammetric expertise and human intervention. Due to the fact
that the proposed Time-SIFT method can be automatically applied with exclusively image information,
our results pave the way to a systematic processing of the archival aerial imagery on very large spatio-temporal
windows, and should hence greatly help the unlocking of archival aerial imagery for the documenting
of past 3-D changes.
