The problem of decomposing non-manifold object has already been studied in solid modeling. However,
the few proposed solutions are limited to the problem of decomposing solids described through their
boundaries. In this thesis we study the problem of decomposing an arbitrary non-manifold simplicial
complex into more regular components. A formal notion of decomposition is developed using combinatorial
topology. The proposed decomposition is unique, for a given complex, and is computable for complexes
of any dimension. A decomposition algorithm is proposed that is linear w.r.t. the size of the input.
In three or higher dimensions a decomposition into manifold parts is not always possible. Thus,
in higher dimensions, we decompose a non-manifold into a decidable super class of manifolds, that
we call, Initial-Quasi-Manifolds. We also defined a two-layered data structure, the Extended
Winged data structure. This data structure is a dimension independent data structure conceived
to model non-manifolds through their decomposition into initial-quasi-manifold parts. Our two
layered data structure describes the structure of the decomposition and each component separately.
In the second layer we encode the connectivity structure of the decomposition. We analyze the space
requirements of the Extended Winged data structure and give algorithms to build and navigate it.
Finally, we discuss time requirements for the computation of topological relations and show that,
for surfaces and tetrahedralizations, embedded in real 3D space, all topological relations can
be extracted in optimal time. This approach offers a compact, dimension independent, representation
for non-manifolds that can be useful whenever the modeled object has few non-manifold singularities.
