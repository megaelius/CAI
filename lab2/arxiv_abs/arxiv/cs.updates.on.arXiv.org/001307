Digital forensic science is very much still in its infancy, but is becoming increasingly invaluable
to investigators. A popular area for research is seeking a standard methodology to make the digital
forensic process accurate, robust, and efficient. The first digital forensic process model proposed
contains four steps: Acquisition, Identification, Evaluation and Admission. Since then, numerous
process models have been proposed to explain the steps of identifying, acquiring, analysing, storage,
and reporting on the evidence obtained from various digital devices. In recent years, an increasing
number of more sophisticated process models have been proposed. These models attempt to speed up
the entire investigative process or solve various of problems commonly encountered in the forensic
investigation. In the last decade, cloud computing has emerged as a disruptive technological concept,
and most leading enterprises such as IBM, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have set up their own cloud-based
services. In the field of digital forensic investigation, moving to a cloud-based evidence processing
model would be extremely beneficial and preliminary attempts have been made in its implementation.
Moving towards a Digital Forensics as a Service model would not only expedite the investigative
process, but can also result in significant cost savings - freeing up digital forensic experts and
law enforcement personnel to progress their caseload. This paper aims to evaluate the applicability
of existing digital forensic process models and analyse how each of these might apply to a cloud-based
evidence processing paradigm.
