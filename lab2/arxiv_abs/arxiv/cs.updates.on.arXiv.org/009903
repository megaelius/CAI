The interconnectivity of cyber and physical systems and Internet of things has created ubiquitous
concerns of cyber threats for enterprise system managers. It is common that the asset owners and
enterprise network operators need to work with cybersecurity professionals to manage the risk
by remunerating them for their efforts that are not directly observable. In this paper, we use a principal-agent
framework to capture the service relationships between the two parties, i.e., the asset owner (principal)
and the cyber risk manager (agent). Specifically, we consider a dynamic systemic risk management
problem with asymmetric information where the principal can only observe cyber risk outcomes of
the enterprise network rather than directly the efforts that the manager expends on protecting
the resources. Under this information pattern, the principal aims to minimize the systemic cyber
risks by designing a dynamic contract that specifies the compensation flows and the anticipated
efforts of the manager by taking into account his incentives and rational behaviors. We formulate
a bi-level mechanism design problem for dynamic contract design within the framework of a class
of stochastic differential games. We show that the principal has rational controllability of the
systemic risk by designing an incentive compatible estimator of the agent's hidden efforts. We
characterize the optimal solution by reformulating the problem as a stochastic optimal control
program which can be solved using dynamic programming. We further investigate a benchmark scenario
with complete information and identify conditions that yield zero information rent and lead to
a new certainty equivalence principle for principal-agent problems. Finally, case studies over
networked systems are carried out to illustrate the theoretical results obtained.
