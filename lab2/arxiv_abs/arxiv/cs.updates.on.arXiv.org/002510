Executive function emerges late in development and displays different developmental trends in
males and females. Sex differences in executive function in youth have been linked to vulnerability
to psychopathology as well as to behaviors that impinge on health. Yet, the neurobiological basis
of these differences is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that sex differences in
executive function in youth stem from sex differences in the controllability of structural brain
networks as they rewire over development. Combining methods from network neuroscience and network
control theory, we characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks estimated
from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample of 882 youth aged 8-22 years.
We summarize the control properties of these networks by estimating average and modal controllability,
two statistics that probe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy- versus
difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal controllability in frontal,
parietal, and subcortical regions while males have higher average controllability in frontal
and subcortical regions. Furthermore, average controllability values in the medial frontal cortex
and subcortex, both higher in males, are negatively related to executive function. Finally, we
find that average controllability predicts sex-dependent individual differences in activation
during an n-back working memory task. Taken together, our findings support the notion that sex differences
in the controllability of structural brain networks can partially explain sex differences in executive
function. Controllability of structural brain networks also predicts features of task-relevant
activation, suggesting the potential for controllability to represent context-specific constraints
on network state more generally.
