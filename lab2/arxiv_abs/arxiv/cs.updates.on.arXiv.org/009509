In this paper we show that a large class of parallel server networks, with $\sqrt n$-safety staffing,
and no abandonment, in the Halfin-Whitt regime are exponentially ergodic and their invariant probability
distributions are tight. This includes all networks with a single nonleaf server pool, such as the
'N' and 'M' models, as well as networks with class-dependent service rates. We first give a simple
algebraic characterization of a parameter that plays the role of the spare capacity (safety staffing)
for the diffusion limit. We show that if the spare capacity parameter is negative, the controlled
diffusion is transient under any stationary Markov control, and it cannot be positive recurrent
when this parameter is zero. On the other hand, if this parameter is positive, then, for the aforementioned
classes of networks, the limiting diffusion is uniformly exponentially ergodic over all Markov
controls. We establish the analogous stability properties for the prelimit diffusion-scaled
queueing processes. We use a unified approach in which the Lyapunov function employed in the study
of the diffusion limit paves the way. As well known, joint work conservation, that is, keeping all
servers busy unless all queues are empty, cannot be always enforced in multiclass multi-pool networks,
and as a result the diffusion limit and the prelimit do not "match" on the entire state space. We introduce
the concept of "system-wide work conserving policies," which are defined as policies that minimize
the number of idle servers at all times. This is a natural extension of work conservation for multiclass
multi-pool networks. We show that, provided that the spare capacity parameter is positive, the
diffusion-scaled processes are geometrically ergodic and the invariant distributions are tight,
uniformly over system-wide work conserving policies. This also results in an interchange of limits
property.
