To keep the competitive advantage and adapt to changes in the market and technology, companies need
to innovate in an organised, purposeful and systematic manner. However, due to their size and complexity,
large companies tend to focus on maintaining their business, which can potentially lower their
agility to innovate. This study aims to provide an overview of the current research on innovation
initiatives and to identify the challenges of implementing the initiatives in the context of large
software companies. The investigation was performed using a systematic mapping approach of published
literature on corporate innovation and entrepreneurship. Then it was complemented with interviews
with four experts with rich industry experience. Our study results suggest that, there is a lack
of high quality empirical studies on innovation initiative in the context of large software companies.
A total of 7 studies are conducted in such context, which reported 5 types of initiatives: intrapreneurship,
bootlegging, internal venture, spin-off and crowdsourcing. Our study offers three contributions.
First, this paper represents the map of existing literature on innovation initiatives inside large
companies. The second contribution is to provide an innovation initiative tree. The third contribution
is to identify key challenges faced by each initiative in large software companies. At the strategic
and tactical levels, there is no difference between large software companies and other companies.
At the operational level, large software companies are highly influenced by the advancement of
Internet technology. Large software companies use open innovation paradigm as part of their innovation
initiatives. We envision a future work is to further empirically evaluate the innovation initiative
tree in large software companies, which involves more practitioners from different companies.
