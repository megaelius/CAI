Autonomous vehicles should be able to generate accurate probabilistic predictions for uncertain
behavior of other road users. Moreover, reactive predictions are necessary in highly interactive
driving scenarios to answer "what if I take this action in the future" for autonomous vehicles. There
is no existing unified framework to homogenize the problem formulation, representation simplification,
and evaluation metric for various prediction methods, such as probabilistic graphical models
(PGM), neural networks (NN) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). In this paper, we formulate
a probabilistic reaction prediction problem, and reveal the relationship between reaction and
situation prediction problems. We employ prototype trajectories with designated motion patterns
other than "intention" to homogenize the representation so that probabilities corresponding
to each trajectory generated by different methods can be evaluated. We also discuss the reasons
why "intention" is not suitable to serve as a motion indicator in highly interactive scenarios.
We propose to use Brier score as the baseline metric for evaluation. In order to reveal the fatality
of the consequences when the predictions are adopted by decision-making and planning, we propose
a fatality-aware metric, which is a weighted Brier score based on the criticality of the trajectory
pairs of the interacting entities. Conservatism and non-defensiveness are defined from the weighted
Brier score to indicate the consequences caused by inaccurate predictions. Modified methods based
on PGM, NN and IRL are provided to generate probabilistic reaction predictions in an exemplar scenario
of nudging from a highway ramp. The results are evaluated by the baseline and proposed metrics to
construct a mini benchmark. Analysis on the properties of each method is also provided by comparing
the baseline and proposed metric scores.
