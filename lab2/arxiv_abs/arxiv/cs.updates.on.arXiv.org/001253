With the wide application of machine learning algorithms to the real world, class imbalance and
concept drift have become crucial learning issues. Class imbalance happens when the data categories
are not equally represented, i.e., at least one category is minority compared to other categories.
It can cause learning bias towards the majority class and poor generalization. Concept drift is
a change in the underlying distribution of the problem, and is a significant issue specially when
learning from data streams. It requires learners to be adaptive to dynamic changes. Class imbalance
and concept drift can significantly hinder predictive performance, and the problem becomes particularly
challenging when they occur simultaneously. This challenge arises from the fact that one problem
can affect the treatment of the other. For example, drift detection algorithms based on the traditional
classification error may be sensitive to the imbalanced degree and become less effective; and class
imbalance techniques need to be adaptive to changing imbalance rates, otherwise the class receiving
the preferential treatment may not be the correct minority class at the current moment. Therefore,
the mutual effect of class imbalance and concept drift should be considered during algorithm design.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from the areas of class imbalance learning
and concept drift in order to encourage discussions and new collaborations on solving the combined
issue of class imbalance and concept drift. It provides a forum for international researchers and
practitioners to share and discuss their original work on addressing new challenges and research
issues in class imbalance learning, concept drift, and the combined issues of class imbalance and
concept drift. The proceedings include 8 papers on these topics.
