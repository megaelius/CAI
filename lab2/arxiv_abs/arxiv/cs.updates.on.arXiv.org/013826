The identification of synthetic routes that end with a desired product has been an inherently time-consuming
process that is largely dependent on expert knowledge regarding a limited fraction of the entire
reaction space. At present, emerging machine-learning technologies are overturning the process
of retrosynthetic planning. The objective of this study is to discover synthetic routes backwardly
from a given desired molecule to commercially available compounds. The problem is reduced to a combinatorial
optimization task with the solution space subject to the combinatorial complexity of all possible
pairs of purchasable reactants. We address this issue within the framework of Bayesian inference
and computation. The workflow consists of two steps: a deep neural network is trained that forwardly
predicts a product of the given reactants with a high level of accuracy, following which this forward
model is inverted into the backward one via Bayes' law of conditional probability. Using the backward
model, a diverse set of highly probable reaction sequences ending with a given synthetic target
is exhaustively explored using a Monte Carlo search algorithm. The Bayesian retrosynthesis algorithm
could successfully rediscover 80.3% and 50.0% of known synthetic routes of single-step and two-step
reactions within top-10 accuracy, respectively, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms
in terms of the overall accuracy. Remarkably, the Monte Carlo method, which was specifically designed
for the presence of diverse multiple routes, often revealed a ranked list of hundreds of reaction
routes to the same synthetic target. We investigated the potential applicability of such diverse
candidates based on expert knowledge from synthetic organic chemistry.
