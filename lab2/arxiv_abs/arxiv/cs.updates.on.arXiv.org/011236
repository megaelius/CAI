Knowledge graph contains well-structured external information and has shown to be useful for recommender
systems. Most existing knowledge-aware methods assume that the item from recommender systems
can be linked to an entity in a knowledge graph, thus item embeddings can be better learned by jointly
modeling of both recommender systems and a knowledge graph. However, this is not the situation for
news recommendation, where items, namely news articles, are in fact related to a collection of knowledge
entities. The importance score and semantic information of entities in one article differ from
each other, which depend on the topic of the article and relations among co-occurred entities. How
to fully utilize these entities for better news recommendation service is non-trivial. In this
paper, we propose a fast and effective knowledge-aware representation enhancement model for improving
news document understanding. The model, named \emph{KRED}, consists of three layers: (1) an entity
representation layer; (2) a context embedding layer; and (3) an information distillation layer.
An entity is represented by the embeddings of itself and its surrounding entities. The context embedding
layer is designed to distinguish dynamic context of different entities such as frequency, category
and position. The information distillation layer will aggregate the entity embeddings under the
guidance of the original document vector, transforming the document vector into a new one. We have
conduct extensive experiments on a real-world news reading dataset. The results demonstrate that
our proposed model greatly benefits a variety of news recommendation tasks, including personalized
news recommendation, article category classification, article popularity prediction and local
news detection.
