Identifying the arrival times of seismic P-phases plays a significant role in real-time seismic
monitoring, which provides critical guidance for emergency response activities. While considerable
research has been conducted on this topic, efficiently capturing the arrival times of seismic P-phases
hidden within intensively distributed and noisy seismic waves, such as those generated by the aftershocks
of destructive earthquakes, remains a real challenge since most common existing methods in seismology
rely on laborious expert supervision. To this end, in this paper, we present a machine learning-enhanced
framework based on ensemble learning strategy, EL-Picker, for the automatic identification of
seismic P-phase arrivals on continuous and massive waveforms. More specifically, EL-Picker consists
of three modules, namely, Trigger, Classifier, and Refiner, and an ensemble learning strategy
is exploited to integrate several machine learning classifiers. An evaluation of the aftershocks
following the MS 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake demonstrates that EL-Picker can not only achieve the best
identification performance but also identify 120% more seismic P-phase arrivals as complementary
data. Meanwhile, experimental results also reveal both the applicability of different machine
learning models for waveforms collected from different seismic stations and the regularities
of seismic P-phase arrivals that might be neglected during manual inspection. These findings clearly
validate the effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility and stability of EL-Picker. Note that this
