In this work, we address the liability issues that may arise due to unauthorized sharing of personal
data. We consider a scenario in which an individual shares his sequential data (such as genomic data
or location patterns) with several service providers (SPs). In such a scenario, if his data is shared
with other third parties without his consent, the individual wants to determine the service provider
that is responsible for this unauthorized sharing. To provide this functionality, we propose a
novel optimization-based watermarking scheme for sharing of sequential data. Thus, in the case
of an unauthorized sharing of sensitive data, the proposed scheme can find the source of the leakage
by checking the watermark inside the leaked data. In particular, the proposed schemes guarantees
with a high probability that (i) the SP that receives the data cannot understand the watermarked
data points, (ii) when more than one SPs aggregate their data, they still cannot determine the watermarked
data points, (iii) even if the unauthorized sharing involves only a portion of the original data
or modified data (to damage the watermark), the corresponding SP can be kept responsible for the
leakage, and (iv) the added watermark is compliant with the nature of the corresponding data. That
is, if there are inherent correlations in the data, the added watermark still preserves such correlations.
Watermarking typically means changing certain parts of the data, and hence it may have negative
effects on data utility. The proposed scheme also minimizes such utility loss while it provides
the aforementioned security guarantees. Furthermore, we conduct a case study of the proposed scheme
on genomic data and show the security and utility guarantees of the proposed scheme.
