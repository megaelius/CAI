The fundamental problem of sampling from the limiting distribution of quantum walks on networks,
known as \emph{mixing}, finds widespread applications in several areas of quantum information
and computation. Of particular interest in most of these applications, is the minimum time beyond
which the instantaneous probability distribution of the quantum walk remains close to this limiting
distribution, known as the \emph{quantum mixing time}. However this quantity is only known for
a handful of specific networks. In this letter, we prove an upper bound on the quantum mixing time
for \emph{almost all networks}, i.e.\ the fraction of networks for which our bound holds, goes to
one in the asymptotic limit. To this end, using several results in random matrix theory, we find the
quantum mixing time of Erd\"os-Renyi random networks: networks of $n$ nodes where each edge exists
with probability $p$ independently. For example for dense random networks, where $p$ is a constant,
we show that the quantum mixing time is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\right)$. Besides opening
avenues for the analytical study of quantum dynamics on random networks, our work could find applications
beyond quantum information processing. Owing to the universality of Wigner random matrices, our
results on the spectral properties of random graphs hold for general classes of random matrices
that are ubiquitous in several areas of physics. In particular, our results could lead to novel insights
into the equilibration times of isolated quantum systems defined by random Hamiltonians, a foundational
problem in quantum statistical mechanics.
