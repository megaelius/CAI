Resource constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are highly likely to be compromised by
attackers because strong security protections may not be suitable to be deployed. This requires
an alternative approach to protect vulnerable components in IoT networks. In this paper, we propose
an integrated defense technique to achieve intrusion prevention by leveraging cyberdeception
(i.e., a decoy system) and moving target defense (i.e., network topology shuffling). We verify
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed technique analytically based on a graphical security
model in a software defined networking (SDN)-based IoT network. We develop four strategies (i.e.,
fixed/random and adaptive/hybrid) to address "when" to perform network topology shuffling and
three strategies (i.e., genetic algorithm/decoy attack path-based optimization/random) to
address "how" to perform network topology shuffling on a decoy-populated IoT network, and analyze
which strategy can best achieve a system goal such as prolonging the system lifetime, maximizing
deception effectiveness, maximizing service availability, or minimizing defense cost. Our results
demonstrate that a software defined IoT network running our intrusion prevention technique at
the optimal parameter setting prolongs system lifetime, increases attack complexity of compromising
critical nodes, and maintains superior service availability compared with a counterpart IoT network
without running our intrusion prevention technique. Further, when given a single goal or a multi-objective
goal (e.g., maximizing the system lifetime and service availability while minimizing the defense
cost) as input, the best combination of "how" and "how" strategies is identified for executing our
proposed technique under which the specified goal can be best achieved.
