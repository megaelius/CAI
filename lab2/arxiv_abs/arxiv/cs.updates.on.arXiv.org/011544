Until 2014, admissions to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were conducted under one umbrella,
whereas the admissions to the non-IIT Centrally Funded Government Institutes (CFTIs) were conducted
under a different umbrella, the Central Seat Allocation Board. In 2015, a new Multi-Round Multi-Run
Deferred Acceptance joint seat allocation process was implemented, improving the efficiency
and productivity of concerned stakeholders. The process brings all CFTIs under one umbrella for
admissions: 100 institutes and approximately 39000 seats in 2018. In this scheme, each candidate
submits a single choice list over all available programs, and receives no more than a single seat
from the system, based on the choices and the ranks in the relevant merit lists. Significantly, overbooking
of seats is forbidden. In this report, we provide details of our safe, fair and optimal algorithm.
Novel features include the ability to handle multiple merit lists, seat guarantee across multiple
rounds, implementing reservation, and de-reservation rules, handling escalation of ranks due
to a revision of marks by state boards during the allocation process, and dealing with last minute
de-recognition of other backward caste categories. A notable rule required the allocation of supernumerary
seats to females, provided the program did not have a sufficient desired percentage, while, at the
same time, not reducing the number of seats available to non-females. Looking forward, we posit
first that it is inevitable that different colleges will prefer different mechanisms of judging
merit, and assigning relative rank. We believe the ability of our algorithm to gracefully handle
multiple merit lists gives us hope to express optimism that all undergraduate admissions in the
country, beyond the CFTIs, can beneficially use the suggested scheme.
