Objective: There is a lot of information about cancer in Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes that
can be useful for biomedical research provided natural language processing (NLP) methods are available
to extract and structure this information. In this paper, we present a scoping review of existing
clinical NLP literature for cancer. Methods: We identified studies describing an NLP method to
extract specific cancer-related information from EHR sources from PubMed, Google Scholar, ACL
Anthology, and existing reviews. Two exclusion criteria were used in this study. We excluded articles
where the extraction techniques used were too broad to be represented as frames and also where very
low-level extraction methods were used. 79 articles were included in the final review. We organized
this information according to frame semantic principles to help identify common areas of overlap
and potential gaps. Results: Frames were created from the reviewed articles pertaining to cancer
information such as cancer diagnosis, tumor description, cancer procedure, breast cancer diagnosis,
prostate cancer diagnosis and pain in prostate cancer patients. These frames included both a definition
as well as specific frame elements (i.e. extractable attributes). We found that cancer diagnosis
was the most common frame among the reviewed papers (36 out of 79), with recent work focusing on extracting
information related to treatment and breast cancer diagnosis. Conclusion: The list of common frames
described in this paper identifies important cancer-related information extracted by existing
NLP techniques and serves as a useful resource for future researchers requiring cancer information
extracted from EHR notes. We also argue, due to the heavy duplication of cancer NLP systems, that
a general purpose resource of annotated cancer frames and corresponding NLP tools would be valuable.
