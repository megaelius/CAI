Regression-based text detection methods have already achieved promising performances with simple
network structure and high efficiency. However, they are behind in accuracy comparing with recent
segmentation-based text detectors. In this work, we discover that one important reason to this
case is that regression-based methods usually utilize a fixed feature selection way, i.e. selecting
features in a single location or in neighbor regions, to predict components of the bounding box,
such as the distances to the boundaries or the rotation angle. The features selected through this
way sometimes are not the best choices for predicting every component of a text bounding box and thus
degrade the accuracy performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Location-Aware feature
Selection text detection Network (LASNet). LASNet selects suitable features from different locations
to separately predict the five components of a bounding box and gets the final bounding box through
the combination of these components. Specifically, instead of using the classification score
map to select one feature for predicting the whole bounding box as most of the existing methods did,
the proposed LASNet first learn five new confidence score maps to indicate the prediction accuracy
of the bounding box components, respectively. Then, a Location-Aware Feature Selection mechanism
(LAFS) is designed to weightily fuse the top-$K$ prediction results for each component according
to their confidence score, and to combine the all five fused components into a final bounding box.
As a result, LASNet predicts the more accurate bounding boxes by using a learnable feature selection
way. The experimental results demonstrate that our LASNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
with single-model and single-scale testing, outperforming all existing regression-based detectors.
