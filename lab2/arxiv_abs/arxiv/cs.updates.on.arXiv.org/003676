Network reliability is a well-studied problem that requires to measure the probability that a target
node is reachable from a source node in a probabilistic (or uncertain) graph, i.e., a graph where
every edge is assigned a probability of existence. Many approaches and problem variants have been
considered in the literature, all assuming that edge-existence probabilities are fixed. Nevertheless,
in real-world graphs, edge probabilities typically depend on external conditions. In metabolic
networks a protein can be converted into another protein with some probability depending on the
presence of certain enzymes. In social influence networks the probability that a tweet of some user
will be re-tweeted by her followers depends on whether the tweet contains specific hashtags. In
transportation networks the probability that a network segment will work properly or not might
depend on external conditions such as weather or time of the day. In this paper we overcome this limitation
and focus on conditional reliability, that is assessing reliability when edge-existence probabilities
depend on a set of conditions. In particular, we study the problem of determining the k conditions
that maximize the reliability between two nodes. We deeply characterize our problem and show that,
even employing polynomial-time reliability-estimation methods, it is NP-hard, does not admit
any PTAS, and the underlying objective function is non-submodular. We then devise a practical method
that targets both accuracy and efficiency. We also study natural generalizations of the problem
with multiple source and target nodes. An extensive empirical evaluation on several large, real-life
graphs demonstrates effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods.
