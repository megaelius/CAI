The available butterfly data sets comprise a few limited species, and the images in the data sets
are always standard patterns without the images of butterflies in their living environment. To
overcome the aforementioned limitations in the butterfly data sets, we build a butterfly data set
composed of all species of butterflies in China with 4270 standard pattern images of 1176 butterfly
species, and 1425 images from living environment of 111 species. We propose to use the deep learning
technique Faster-Rcnn to train an automatic butterfly identification system including butterfly
position detection and species recognition. We delete those species with only one living environment
image from data set, then partition the rest images from living environment into two subsets, one
used as test subset, the other as training subset respectively combined with all standard pattern
butterfly images or the standard pattern butterfly images with the same species of the images from
living environment. In order to construct the training subset for FasterRcnn, nine methods were
adopted to amplifying the images in the training subset including the turning of up and down, and
left and right, rotation with different angles, adding noises, blurring, and contrast ratio adjusting
etc. Three prediction models were trained. The mAP (Mean Average prediction) criterion was used
to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. The experimental results demonstrate that
our Faster-Rcnn based butterfly automatic identification system performed well, and its worst
mAP is up to 60%, and can simultaneously detect the positions of more than one butterflies in one images
from living environment and recognize the species of those butterflies as well.
