Motivation: The biomedical literature contains a wealth of chemical-protein interactions (CPIs).
Automatically extracting CPIs described in biomedical literature is essential for drug discovery,
precision medicine, as well as basic biomedical research. Most existing methods focus only on the
sentence sequence to identify these CPIs. However, the local structure of sentences and external
biomedical knowledge also contain valuable information. Effective use of such information may
improve the performance of CPI extraction. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel neural network-based
approach to improve CPI extraction. Specifically, the approach first employs BERT to generate
high-quality contextual representations of the title sequence, instance sequence, and knowledge
sequence. Then, the Gaussian probability distribution is introduced to capture the local structure
of the instance. Meanwhile, the attention mechanism is applied to fuse the title information and
biomedical knowledge, respectively. Finally, the related representations are concatenated
and fed into the softmax function to extract CPIs. We evaluate our proposed model on the CHEMPROT
corpus. Our proposed model is superior in performance as compared with other state-of-the-art
models. The experimental results show that the Gaussian probability distribution and external
knowledge are complementary to each other. Integrating them can effectively improve the CPI extraction
performance. Furthermore, the Gaussian probability distribution can effectively improve the
extraction performance of sentences with overlapping relations in biomedical relation extraction
tasks. Availability: Data and code are available at https://github.com/CongSun-dlut/CPI_extraction.
