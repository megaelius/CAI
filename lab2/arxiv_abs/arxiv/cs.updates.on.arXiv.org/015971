Network function virtualization (NFV) is an emerging design paradigm that replaces physical middlebox
devices with software modules running on general purpose commodity servers. While gradually transitioning
to NFV, Internet service providers face the problem of where to introduce NFV in order to make the
most benefit of that; here, we measure the benefit by the amount of traffic that can be served in an
NFV-enabled network. This problem is non-trivial as it is composed of two challenging subproblems:
1) placement of nodes to support virtual network functions (referred to as VNF-nodes); 2) allocation
of the VNF-nodes' resources to network flows. This problem has been studied for the one-dimensional
setting, where all network flows require one network function, which requires a unit of resource
to process a unit of flow. In this work, we consider the multi-dimensional setting, where flows can
require multiple network functions, which can also require a different amount of each resource
to process a unit of flow. The multi-dimensional setting introduces new challenges in addition
to those of the one-dimensional setting (e.g., NP-hardness and non-submodularity) and also makes
the resource allocation subproblem a multi-dimensional generalization of the generalized assignment
problem with assignment restrictions. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel two-level
relaxation method that allows us to draw a connection to the sequence submodular theory and utilize
the property of sequence submodularity along with the primal-dual technique to design two approximation
algorithms. We further prove that the proposed algorithms have a non-trivial approximation ratio
that depends on the number of VNF-nodes, resources, and a measure of the available resource compared
to flow demand. Finally, we perform extensive trace-driven simulations to show the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithms.
