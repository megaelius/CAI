High-fidelity complex engineering simulations are highly predictive, but also computationally
expensive and often require substantial computational efforts. The mitigation of computational
burden is usually enabled through parallelism in high-performance cluster (HPC) architecture.
In this paper, an asynchronous constrained batch-parallel Bayesian optimization method is proposed
to efficiently solve the computationally-expensive simulation-based optimization problems
on the HPC platform, with a budgeted computational resource, where the maximum number of simulations
is a constant. The advantages of this method are three-fold. First, the efficiency of the Bayesian
optimization is improved, where multiple input locations are evaluated massively parallel in
an asynchronous manner to accelerate the optimization convergence with respect to physical runtime.
This efficiency feature is further improved so that when each of the inputs is finished, another
input is queried without waiting for the whole batch to complete. Second, the method can handle both
known and unknown constraints. Third, the proposed method considers several acquisition functions
at the same time and sample based on an evolving probability mass distribution function using GP-Hedge
scheme, where parameters are corresponding to the performance of each acquisition function. The
proposed framework is termed aphBO-2GP-3B, which corresponds to asynchronous parallel hedge
Bayesian optimization with two Gaussian processes and three batches. The aphBO-2GP-3B framework
is demonstrated using two high-fidelity expensive industrial applications, where the first one
is based on finite element analysis (FEA) and the second one is based on computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) simulations.
