Increasing volume of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in recent years provides great opportunities
for data scientists to collaborate on different aspects of healthcare research by applying advanced
analytics to these EHR clinical data. A key requirement however is obtaining meaningful insights
from high dimensional, sparse and complex clinical data. Data science approaches typically address
this challenge by performing feature learning in order to build more reliable and informative feature
representations from clinical data followed by supervised learning. In this paper, we propose
a predictive modeling approach based on deep learning based feature representations and word embedding
techniques. Our method uses different deep architectures (stacked sparse autoencoders, deep
belief network, adversarial autoencoders and variational autoencoders) for feature representation
in higher-level abstraction to obtain effective and robust features from EHRs, and then build prediction
models on top of them. Our approach is particularly useful when the unlabeled data is abundant whereas
labeled data is scarce. We investigate the performance of representation learning through a supervised
learning approach. Our focus is to present a comparative study to evaluate the performance of different
deep architectures through supervised learning and provide insights in the choice of deep feature
representation techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that for small data sets, stacked sparse
autoencoder demonstrates a superior generality performance in prediction due to sparsity regularization
whereas variational autoencoders outperform the competing approaches for large data sets due
to its capability of learning the representation distribution
