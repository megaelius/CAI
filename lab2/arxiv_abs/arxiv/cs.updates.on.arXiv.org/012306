Operating envelope is an important concept in industrial operations. Accurate identification
for operating envelope can be extremely beneficial to stakeholders as it provides a set of operational
parameters that optimizes some key performance indicators (KPI) such as product quality, operational
safety, equipment efficiency, environmental impact, etc. Given the importance, data-driven
approaches for computing the operating envelope are gaining popularity. These approaches typically
use classifiers such as support vector machines, to set the operating envelope by learning the boundary
in the operational parameter spaces between the manually assigned `large KPI' and `small KPI' groups.
One challenge to these approaches is that the assignment to these groups is often ad-hoc and hence
arbitrary. However, a bigger challenge with these approaches is that they don't take into account
two key features that are needed to operationalize operating envelopes: (i) interpretability
of the envelope by the operator and (ii) implementability of the envelope from a practical standpoint.
In this work, we propose a new definition for operating envelope which directly targets the expected
magnitude of KPI (i.e., no need to arbitrarily bin the data instances into groups) and accounts for
the interpretability and the implementability. We then propose a regularized `GA + penalty' algorithm
that outputs an envelope where the user can tradeoff between bias and variance. The validity of our
proposed algorithm is demonstrated by two sets of simulation studies and an application to a real-world
challenge in the mining processes of a flotation plant.
