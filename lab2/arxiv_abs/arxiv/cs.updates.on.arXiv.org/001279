Compared with the legacy wireless networks, the next generation of wireless network targets at
different services with divergent QoS requirements, ranging from bandwidth consuming video service
to moderate and low date rate machine type services, and supporting as well as strict latency requirements.
One emerging new service is to exploit wireless network to improve the efficiency of vehicular traffic
and public safety. However, the stringent packet end-to-end (E2E) latency and ultra-low transmission
failure rates pose challenging requirements on the legacy networks. In other words, the next generation
wireless network needs to support ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) involving
new key performance indicators (KPIs) rather than the conventional metric, such as cell throughput
in the legacy systems. In this paper, a feasibility study on applying today's LTE network infrastructure
and LTE-Uu air interface to provide the URLLC type of services is performed, where the communication
takes place between two traffic participants (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian).
To carry out this study, an evaluation methodology of the cellular vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication
is proposed, where packet E2E latency and successful transmission rate are considered as the key
performance indicators (KPIs). Then, we describe the simulation assumptions for the evaluation.
Based on them, simulation results are depicted that demonstrate the performance of the LTE network
in fulfilling new URLLC requirements. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is also conducted regarding
how to further improve system performance, in order to enable new emerging URLLC services.
