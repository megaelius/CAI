Disaster prediction is one of the most critical tasks towards disaster surveillance and preparedness.
Existing technologies employ different machine learning approaches to predict incoming disasters
from historical environmental data. However, for short-term disasters (e.g., earthquakes),
historical data alone has a limited prediction capability. Therefore, additional sources of warnings
are required for accurate prediction. We consider social media as a supplementary source of knowledge
in addition to historical environmental data. However, social media posts (e.g., tweets) is very
informal and contains only limited content. To alleviate these limitations, we propose the combination
of semantically-enriched word embedding models to represent entities in tweets with their semantic
representations computed with the traditionalword2vec. Moreover, we study how the correlation
between social media posts and typhoons magnitudes (also called intensities)-in terms of volume
and sentiments of tweets-. Based on these insights, we propose an end-to-end based framework that
learns from disaster-related tweets and environmental data to improve typhoon intensity prediction.
This paper is an extension of our work originally published in K-CAP 2019 [32]. We extended this paper
by building our framework with state-of-the-art deep neural models, up-dated our dataset with
new typhoons and their tweets to-date and benchmark our approach against recent baselines in disaster
prediction. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms the accuracy of the state-of-the-art
baselines in terms of F1-score with (CNN by12.1%and BiLSTM by3.1%) improvement compared with last
experiments
