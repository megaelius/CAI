Decentralized intersection control techniques have received attention in the literature as tools
that address scalability issues of network intersection control. Chief among these techniques
are backpressure (BP) control algorithms, which were originally developed of for large wireless
networks. In addition to being light-weight computationally, they come with guarantees of performance
at the network level, specifically network-wide stability. The dynamics in backpressure control
are represented using networks of point queues and this also applies to all of the applications to
traffic control. As such, BP in traffic fail to capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along
the intersection links and, consequently, spill-back dynamics. This paper derives a position
weighted backpressure (PWBP) control policy for network traffic applying continuum modeling
principles of traffic dynamics and thus capture the spatial distribution of vehicles along network
roads and spill-back dynamics. PWBP inherits the computational advantages of traditional BP.
To prove stability of PWBP, (i) a Lyapunov functional that captures the spatial distribution of
vehicles is developed; (ii) the capacity region of the network is formally defined in the context
of macroscopic network traffic; and (iii) it is proved, when exogenous arrival rates are within
the capacity region, that PWBP control is network stabilizing. We conduct comparisons against
a real-world adaptive control implementation for an isolated intersection. Comparisons are also
performed against other BP approaches in addition to optimized fixed timing control at the network
level. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of PWBP over the other control policies in
terms of capacity region, network-wide delay, congestion propagation speed, recoverability
from heavy congestion (outside of the capacity region), and response to incidents.
