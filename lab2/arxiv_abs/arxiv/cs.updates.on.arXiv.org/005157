The spinal cord is frequently affected by atrophy and/or lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
Segmentation of the spinal cord and lesions from MRI data provides measures of damage, which are
key criteria for the diagnosis, prognosis, and longitudinal monitoring in MS. Automating this
operation eliminates inter-rater variability and increases the efficiency of large-throughput
analysis pipelines. Robust and reliable segmentation across multi-site spinal cord data is challenging
because of the large variability related to acquisition parameters and image artifacts. The goal
of this study was to develop a fully-automatic framework, robust to variability in both image parameters
and clinical condition, for segmentation of the spinal cord and intramedullary MS lesions from
conventional MRI data. Scans of 1,042 subjects (459 healthy controls, 471 MS patients, and 112 with
other spinal pathologies) were included in this multi-site study (n=30). Data spanned three contrasts
(T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted) for a total of 1,943 volumes. The proposed cord and lesion automatic
segmentation approach is based on a sequence of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To deal
with the very small proportion of spinal cord and/or lesion voxels compared to the rest of the volume,
a first CNN with 2D dilated convolutions detects the spinal cord centerline, followed by a second
CNN with 3D convolutions that segments the spinal cord and/or lesions. When compared against manual
segmentation, our CNN-based approach showed a median Dice of 95% vs. 88% for PropSeg, a state-of-the-art
spinal cord segmentation method. Regarding lesion segmentation on MS data, our framework provided
a Dice of 60%, a relative volume difference of -15%, and a lesion-wise detection sensitivity and
precision of 83% and 77%, respectively. The proposed framework is open-source and readily available
in the Spinal Cord Toolbox.
