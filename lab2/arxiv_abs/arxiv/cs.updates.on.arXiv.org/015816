Security inspection often deals with a piece of baggage or suitcase where objects are heavily overlapped
with each other, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance for prohibited items detection in
X-ray images. In the literature, there have been rare studies and datasets touching this important
topic. In this work, we contribute the first high-quality object detection dataset for security
inspection, named Occluded Prohibited Items X-ray (OPIXray) image benchmark. OPIXray focused
on the widely-occurred prohibited item "cutter", annotated manually by professional inspectors
from the international airport. The test set is further divided into three occlusion levels to better
understand the performance of detectors. Furthermore, to deal with the occlusion in X-ray images
detection, we propose the De-occlusion Attention Module (DOAM), a plug-and-play module that can
be easily inserted into and thus promote most popular detectors. Despite the heavy occlusion in
X-ray imaging, shape appearance of objects can be preserved well, and meanwhile different materials
visually appear with different colors and textures. Motivated by these observations, our DOAM
simultaneously leverages the different appearance information of the prohibited item to generate
the attention map, which helps refine feature maps for the general detectors. We comprehensively
evaluate our module on the OPIXray dataset, and demonstrate that our module can consistently improve
the performance of the state-of-the-art detection methods such as SSD, FCOS, etc, and significantly
outperforms several widely-used attention mechanisms. In particular, the advantages of DOAM
are more significant in the scenarios with higher levels of occlusion, which demonstrates its potential
application in real-world inspections. The OPIXray benchmark and our model are released at https://github.com/OPIXray-author/OPIXray.
