Many real-world networks can be modeled by networks of interacting agents. Analysis of these interactions
can reveal fundamental properties from these networks. Estimating the amount of collaboration
in a network corresponding to connections in a learning environment can reveal to what extent learners
share their experience and knowledge with other learners. Alternatively, analyzing the network
of interactions in an open source software project can manifest indicators showing the efficiency
of collaborations. One central problem in such domains is the low cooperativity values of networks
due to the low cooperativity values of their respective communities. So administrators should
not only understand and predict the cooperativity of networks but also they need to evaluate their
respective community structures. To approach this issue, in this paper, we address two domains
of open source software projects and learning forums. As such, we calculate the amount of cooperativity
in the corresponding networks and communities of these domains by applying several community detection
algorithms. Moreover, we investigated the community properties and identified the significant
properties for estimating the network and community cooperativity. Correspondingly, we identified
to what extent various community detection algorithms affect the identification of significant
properties and prediction of cooperativity. We also fabricated binary and regression prediction
models using the community properties. Our results and constructed models can be used to infer cooperativity
of community structures from their respective properties. When predicting high defective structures
in networks, administrators can look for useful drives to increase the collaborations.
