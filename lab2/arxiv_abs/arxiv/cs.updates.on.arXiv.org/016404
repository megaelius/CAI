The classification of Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR) in kidney transplant remains challenging
even for experienced nephropathologists; this is partly because histological tissue stain analysis
is often characterized by low inter-observer agreement and poor reproducibility. One of the implicated
causes for inter-observer disagreement is the variability of tissue stain quality between (and
within) pathology labs, coupled with the gradual fading of archival sections. Variations in stain
colors and intensities can make tissue evaluation difficult for pathologists, ultimately affecting
their ability to describe relevant morphological features. Being able to accurately predict the
AMR status based on kidney histology images is crucial for improving patient treatment and care.
We propose a novel pipeline to build robust deep neural networks for AMR classification based on
StyPath, a histological data augmentation technique that leverages a light weight style-transfer
algorithm as a means to reduce sample-specific bias. Each image was generated in 1.84 +- 0.03 seconds
using a single GTX TITAN V gpu and pytorch, making it faster than other popular histological data
augmentation techniques. We evaluated our model using a Monte Carlo (MC) estimate of Bayesian performance
and generate an epistemic measure of uncertainty to compare both the baseline and StyPath augmented
models. We also generated Grad-CAM representations of the results which were assessed by an experienced
nephropathologist; we used this qualitative analysis to elucidate on the assumptions being made
by each model. Our results imply that our style-transfer augmentation technique improves histological
classification performance (reducing error from 14.8% to 11.5%) and generalization ability.
