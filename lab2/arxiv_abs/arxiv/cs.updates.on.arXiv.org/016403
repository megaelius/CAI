Social distancing has been proven as an effective measure against the spread of the infectious COronaVIrus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, individuals are not used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters)
distance between themselves and their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of
detecting distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the deadly
disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest (ROI) and modulating inflow
can decrease social distancing violation occurrence chance. On the other hand, recording data
and labeling individuals who do not follow the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies.
Here we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and
warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system should never record/cache
data, (2) the warnings should not target the individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the
detection/warning loop, and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against
this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based real-time object detectors
to measure social distancing. If a violation is detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning
signal is emitted without targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure.
Also, if the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal to modulate
inflow into the ROI. We tested the proposed method across real-world datasets to measure its generality
and performance. The proposed method is ready for deployment, and our code is open-sourced.
