Unsatisfying accuracy of learning methods is mostly caused by omitting the influence of important
parameters such as membership assignments, type of data objects, and distance or similarity functions.
The proposed method, called Bounded Fuzzy Possibilistic Method (BFPM) addresses different issues
that previous clustering or classification methods have not sufficiently considered in their
membership assignments. In fuzzy methods, the object's memberships should sum to 1. Hence, any
data object may obtain full membership in at most one cluster or class. Possibilistic methods relax
this condition, but the method can be satisfied with the results even if just an arbitrary object
obtains the membership from just one cluster, which prevents the objects' movement analysis. Whereas,
BFPM differs from previous fuzzy and possibilistic approaches by removing these restrictions.
Furthermore, BFPM provides the flexible search space for objects' movement analysis. Data objects
are also considered as fundamental keys in learning methods, and knowing the exact type of objects
results in providing a suitable environment for learning algorithms. The Thesis introduces a new
type of object, called critical, as well as categorizing data objects into two different categories:
structural-based and behavioural-based. Critical objects are considered as causes of miss-classification
and miss-assignment in learning procedures. The Thesis also proposes new methodologies to study
the behaviour of critical objects with the aim of evaluating objects' movements (mutation) from
one cluster or class to another. The Thesis also introduces a new type of feature, called dominant,
that is considered as one of the causes of miss-classification and miss-assignments. Then the Thesis
proposes new sets of similarity functions, called Weighted Feature Distance (WFD) and Prioritized
Weighted Feature Distance (PWFD).
