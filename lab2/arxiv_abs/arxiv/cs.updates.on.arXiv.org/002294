To keep pace with the rapid growth of mobile traffic demands, dense deployment of small cells in millimeter
wave (mmWave) bands has become a promising candidate for next generation wireless communication
systems. With a greatly increased data rate from huge bandwidth of mmWave communications, energy
consumption should be mitigated for higher energy efficiency. Due to content popularity, many
content-based mobile applications can be supported by the multicast service. mmWave communications
exploit directional antennas to overcome high path loss, and concurrent transmissions can be enabled
for better multicast service. On the other hand, device-to-device (D2D) communications in physical
proximity should be exploited to improve multicast performance. In this paper, we propose an energy
efficient multicast scheduling scheme, referred to as EMS, which utilizes both D2D communications
and concurrent transmissions to achieve high energy efficiency. In EMS, a D2D path planning algorithm
establishes multi-hop D2D transmission paths, and a concurrent scheduling algorithm allocates
the links on the D2D paths into different pairings. Then the transmission power of links is adjusted
by the power control algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the roles of D2D communications
and concurrent transmissions in reducing energy consumption. Extensive simulations under various
system parameters demonstrate the superior performance of EMS in terms of energy consumption compared
with the state-of-the-art schemes. Furthermore, we also investigate the choice of the interference
threshold to optimize network performance.
