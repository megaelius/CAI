A capacitated covering IP is an integer program of the form $\min\{cx:Ux\geq d, 0\leq x\leq b, x\in
Z^+\}$, where all the entries of $c,U$ and $d$ are nonnegative. The min-knapsack problem, the capacitated
network design problem and the min-sum of tardy jobs scheduling problem are only few examples of
capacitated covering problems. One difficulty in approximating the capacitated covering problems
lies in the fact that the ratio between the optimal IP solution to the optimal LP solution can be as
bad as $||d||_{\infty}$, even when $U$ consists of a single row (i.e. the min-knapsack problem).
The Lasserre hierarchy is a systematic procedure for constructing a sequence of increasingly tight
relaxations that capture the convex relaxations used in the best available algorithms for a wide
variety of problems. For the minimum knapsack problem, using the trick of "lifting the objective
function", Karlin et al. results imply that the Lasserre SDP hierarchy reduces the integrality
gap to $(1+\varepsilon)$ at level $O(1/\varepsilon)$, for any $\varepsilon>0$. In light of
this result, it is natural to ask whether improved results for capacitated covering problems can
be achieved by using the Lasserre hierarchy. In this paper we prove strong Lasserre lower bounds
for two capacitated covering problems that admit FPTASs. If we do not lift the objective function,
we show that the integrality gap of the min-knapsack problem is arbitrarily large even at level $(n-1)$-th
of Lasserre hierarchy. If we lift the objective function, we show that the integrality gap of the
min-sum of tardy jobs scheduling problem is unbounded at level $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. This lower
bound also generalizes directly to other capacitated covering problems, including the capacitated
network design problem.
