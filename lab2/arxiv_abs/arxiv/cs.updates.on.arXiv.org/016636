The amazing advances being made in the fields of machine and deep learning are a highlight of the Big
Data era for both enterprise and research communities. Modern applications require resources
beyond a single node's ability to provide. However this is just a small part of the issues facing the
overall data processing environment, which must also support a raft of data engineering for pre-
and post-data processing, communication, and system integration. An important requirement of
data analytics tools is to be able to easily integrate with existing frameworks in a multitude of
languages, thereby increasing user productivity and efficiency. All this demands an efficient
and highly distributed integrated approach for data processing, yet many of today's popular data
analytics tools are unable to satisfy all these requirements at the same time. In this paper we present
Cylon, an open-source high performance distributed data processing library that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing Big Data and AI/ML frameworks. It is developed with a flexible C++ core
on top of a compact data structure and exposes language bindings to C++, Java, and Python. We discuss
Cylon's architecture in detail, and reveal how it can be imported as a library to existing applications
or operate as a standalone framework. Initial experiments show that Cylon enhances popular tools
such as Apache Spark and Dask with major performance improvements for key operations and better
component linkages. Finally, we show how its design enables Cylon to be used cross-platform with
minimum overhead, which includes popular AI tools such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Jupyter notebooks.
