Nowadays, the interconnection of automotive systems with modern digital devices offers advanced
user experiences to drivers. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) carry out a multitude of operations
using the insecure Controller Area Network (CAN) bus in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).
Therefore, dangerous attacks, such as disabling brakes, are possible and the safety of passengers
is at risk. In this paper, we present TACAN (Transmitter Authentication in CAN), which provides
secure authentication of ECUs by exploiting the covert channels without introducing CAN protocol
modifications or traffic overheads (i.e., no extra bits or messages are used). TACAN turns upside-down
the originally malicious concept of covert channels and exploits it to build an effective defensive
technique that facilitates transmitter authentication via a trusted Monitor Node. TACAN consists
of three different covert channels for ECU authentication: 1) Inter-Arrival Time (IAT)-based,
leveraging the IATs of CAN messages; 2) offset-based, exploiting the clock offsets of CAN messages;
3) Least Significant Bit (LSB)-based, concealing authentication messages into the LSBs of normal
CAN data. We implement the covert channels on the University of Washington (UW) EcoCAR testbed and
evaluate their performance through extensive experiments. We demonstrate the feasibility of
TACAN, highlighting no traffic overheads and attesting the regular functionality of ECUs. In particular,
the bit error ratios are within 0.1% and 0.42% for the IAT-based and offset-based covert channels,
respectively. Furthermore, the bit error ratio of the LSB-based covert channel is equal to that
of a normal CAN bus, which is 3.1x10^-7%.
