Many hearing-impaired listeners struggle to localize sounds due to poor availability of binaural
cues. Listeners with a cochlear implant and a contralateral hearing aid -- so-called bimodal listeners
-- are amongst the worst performers, as both interaural time and level differences are poorly transmitted.
We present a new method to enhance head shadow in the low frequencies. Head shadow enhancement is
achieved with a fixed beamformer with contralateral attenuation in each ear. The method results
in interaural level differences which vary monotonically with angle. It also improves low-frequency
signal-to-noise ratios in conditions with spatially separated speech and noise. We validated
the method in two experiments with acoustic simulations of bimodal listening. In the localization
experiment, performance improved from 50.5{\deg} to 26.8{\deg} root-mean-square error compared
with standard omni-directional microphones. In the speech-in-noise experiment, speech was presented
from the frontal direction. Speech reception thresholds improved by 15.7 dB SNR when the noise was
presented from the cochlear implant side, improved by 7.6 dB SNR when the noise was presented from
the hearing aid side, and was not affected when noise was presented from all directions. Apart from
bimodal listeners, the method might also be promising for bilateral cochlear implant or hearing
aid users. Its low computational complexity makes the method suitable for application in current
clinical devices. Keywords: head shadow enhancement, enhancement of interaural level differences,
