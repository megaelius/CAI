Accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for attaining beamforming gains in single-user
(SU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multiplexing gains in multi-user (MU) MIMO wireless
communication systems. State-of-the-art limited feedback schemes, which rely on pre-defined
codebooks for channel quantization, are only appropriate for a small number of transmit antennas
and low feedback overhead. In order to scale informed transmitter schemes to emerging massive MIMO
systems with a large number of transmit antennas at the base station, one common approach is to employ
time division duplexing (TDD) and to exploit the implicit feedback obtained from channel reciprocity.
However, most existing cellular deployments are based on frequency division duplexing (FDD),
hence it is of great interest to explore backwards compatible massive MIMO upgrades of such systems.
For a fixed feedback rate per antenna, the number of codewords for quantizing the channel grows exponentially
with the number of antennas, hence generating feedback based on look-up from a standard vector quantized
codebook does not scale. In this paper, we propose noncoherent trellis-coded quantization (NTCQ),
whose encoding complexity scales linearly with the number of antennas. The approach exploits the
duality between source encoding in a Grassmannian manifold and noncoherent sequence detection.
Furthermore, since noncoherent detection can be realized near-optimally using a bank of coherent
detectors, we obtain a low-complexity implementation of NTCQ encoding using an off-the-shelf
Viterbi algorithm applied to standard trellis coded quantization. We also develop advanced NTCQ
schemes which utilize various channel properties such as temporal/spatial correlations. Simulation
results show the proposed NTCQ and its extensions can achieve near-optimal performance with moderate
complexity and feedback overhead.
