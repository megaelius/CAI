Concatenation hierarchies are classifications of regular languages. All such hierarchies are
built through the same construction process: start from an initial class of languages and build
new levels using two generic operations. Concatenation hierarchies have gathered a lot of interest
since the 70s, thanks to an alternate logical definition: each concatenation hierarchy is the quantification
alternation hierarchy within a variant of first-order logic over words. Our goal is to understand
such hierarchies. We look at two decision problems: membership and separation. For a class of languages
C, C-separation takes two regular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third one in
C including the first one and disjoint from the second one. Settling whether separation is decidable
for the levels within a given concatenation hierarchy is among the most fundamental and challenging
questions in formal language theory. In all prominent cases, it is open, or answered positively
for low levels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made using a generic approach for a specific kind
of hierarchy: those with a finite basis. In this case, separation is always decidable for levels
1/2, 1 and 3/2. Our main theorem is similar but independent: we consider hierarchies with possibly
infinite bases, but that may only contain group languages. An example is the quantifier alternation
hierarchy of first-order logic with modular predicates: its basis consists of languages counting
the length of words modulo some number. Using a generic approach, we show that for any such hierarchy,
if separation is decidable for the basis, then it is decidable for levels up to 3/2. This complements
the aforementioned result nicely: all bases considered in the literature are either finite or made
of group languages. Thus, one may handle the lower levels of any prominent hierarchy in a generic
way.
