Fox and Lu introduced a Langevin framework for discrete-time stochastic models of randomly gated
ion channels such as the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) system. They derived a Fokker-Planck equation with
state-dependent diffusion tensor $D$ and suggested a Langevin formulation with noise coefficient
matrix $S$ such that $SS^\intercal=D$. Subsequently, several authors introduced a variety of
Langevin equations for the HH system. In this paper, we present a natural 14-dimensional dynamics
for the HH system in which each \emph{directed} edge in the ion channel state transition graph acts
as an independent noise source, leading to a $14\times 28$ noise coefficient matrix $S$. We show
that (i) the corresponding 14D system of ordinary differential \rev{equations} is consistent
with the classical 4D representation of the HH system; (ii) the 14D representation leads to a noise
coefficient matrix $S$ that can be obtained cheaply on each timestep, without requiring a matrix
decomposition; (iii) sample trajectories of the 14D representation are pathwise equivalent to
trajectories of Fox and Lu's system, as well as trajectories of several existing Langevin models;
(iv) our 14D representation (and those equivalent to it) give the most accurate interspike-interval
distribution, not only with respect to moments but under both the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ metric-space
norms; and (v) the 14D representation gives an approximation to exact Markov chain simulations
that are as fast and as efficient as all equivalent models. Our approach goes beyond existing models,
in that it supports a stochastic shielding decomposition that dramatically simplifies $S$ with
minimal loss of accuracy under both voltage- and current-clamp conditions.
