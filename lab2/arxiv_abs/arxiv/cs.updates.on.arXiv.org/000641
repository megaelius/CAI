What lies between `\emph{sensing}' and `\emph{sensibility}'? In other words, what kind of cognitive
processes mediate sensing capability, and the formation of sensible impressions ---e.g., abstractions,
analogies, hypotheses and theory formation, beliefs and their revision, argument formation---
in domain-specific problem solving, or in regular activities of everyday living, working and simply
going around in the environment? How can knowledge and reasoning about such capabilities, as exhibited
by humans in particular problem contexts, be used as a model and benchmark for the development of
collaborative cognitive (interaction) systems concerned with human assistance, assurance,
and empowerment? We pose these questions in the context of a range of assistive technologies concerned
with \emph{visuo-spatial perception and cognition} tasks encompassing aspects such as commonsense,
creativity, and the application of specialist domain knowledge and problem-solving thought processes.
Assistive technologies being considered include: (a) human activity interpretation; (b) high-level
cognitive rovotics; (c) people-centred creative design in domains such as architecture &
digital media creation, and (d) qualitative analyses geographic information systems. Computational
narratives not only provide a rich cognitive basis, but they also serve as a benchmark of functional
performance in our development of computational cognitive assistance systems. We posit that computational
narrativisation pertaining to space, actions, and change provides a useful model of \emph{visual}
and \emph{spatio-temporal thinking} within a wide-range of problem-solving tasks and application
areas where collaborative cognitive systems could serve an assistive and empowering function.
