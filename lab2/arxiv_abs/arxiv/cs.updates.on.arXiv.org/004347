We consider "Thurston maps": branched self-coverings of the sphere with ultimately periodic critical
points, and prove that the Thurston equivalence problem between them (continuous deformation
of maps along with their critical orbits) is decidable. More precisely, we consider the action of
mapping class groups, by pre- and post-composition, on branched coverings, and encode them algebraically
as "mapping class bisets". We show how the mapping class biset of maps preserving a multicurve decomposes
into mapping class bisets of smaller complexity, called "small mapping class bisets". We phrase
the decision problem of Thurston equivalence between branched self-coverings of the sphere in
terms of the conjugacy and centralizer problems in a mapping class biset. Our decomposition results
on mapping class bisets reduce these decision problems to small mapping class bisets; they correspond
to rational maps, homeomorphisms and maps double covered by a torus endomorphism, and their conjugacy
and centralizer problems are solvable respectively in terms of complex analysis, group theory
and linear algebra. Branched coverings themselves are also encoded into bisets, with actions of
the fundamental groups. We characterize those bisets that arise from branched coverings between
topological spheres, and extend this correspondence to maps between spheres with multicurves,
whose algebraic counterparts are "sphere trees of bisets". To illustrate the difference between
Thurston maps and homeomorphisms, we produce a Thurston map with infinitely generated centralizer
--- while centralizers of homeomorphisms are always finitely generated.
