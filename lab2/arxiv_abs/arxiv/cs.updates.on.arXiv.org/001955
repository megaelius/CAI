We develop a systematic approach, based on convex programming and real analysis, for obtaining
upper bounds on the capacity of the binary deletion channel and, more generally, channels with i.i.d.
insertions and deletions. Other than the classical deletion channel, we give a special attention
to the Poisson-repeat channel introduced by Mitzenmacher and Drinea (IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory, 2006). Our framework can be applied to obtain capacity upper bounds for any repetition distribution
(the deletion and Poisson-repeat channels corresponding to the special cases of Bernoulli and
Poisson distributions). Our techniques essentially reduce the task of proving capacity upper
bounds to maximizing a univariate, real-valued, and often concave function over a bounded interval.
We show the following: 1. The capacity of the binary deletion channel with deletion probability
$d$ is at most $(1-d)\log\varphi$ for $d\geq 1/2$, and, assuming the capacity function is convex,
is at most $1-d\log(4/\varphi)$ for $d<1/2$, where $\varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio.
This is the first nontrivial capacity upper bound for any value of $d$ outside the limiting case $d\to
0$ that is fully explicit and proved without computer assistance. 2. We derive the first set of capacity
upper bounds for the Poisson-repeat channel. 3. We derive several novel upper bounds on the capacity
of the deletion channel. All upper bounds are maximums of efficiently computable, and concave,
univariate real functions over a bounded domain. In turn, we upper bound these functions in terms
of explicit elementary and standard special functions, whose maximums can be found even more efficiently
(and sometimes, analytically, for example for $d=1/2$). Along the way, we develop several new techniques
of potentially independent interest in information theory, probability, and mathematical analysis.
