We study pursuit-evasion in a polygonal environment with polygonal obstacles. In this turn based
game, an evader $e$ is chased by pursuers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{\ell}$. The players have full information
about the environment and the location of the other players. The pursuers are allowed to coordinate
their actions. On the pursuer turn, each $p_i$ can move to any point at distance at most 1 from his current
location. On the evader turn, he moves similarly. The pursuers win if some pursuer becomes co-located
with the evader in finite time. The evader wins if he can evade capture forever. It is known that one
pursuer can capture the evader in any simply-connected polygonal environment, and that three pursuers
are always sufficient in any polygonal environment (possibly with polygonal obstacles). We contribute
two new results to this field. First, we fully characterize when an environment with a single obstacles
is one-pursuer-win or two-pursuer-win. Second, we give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions
for an environment to have a winning strategy for two pursuers. Such environments can be swept by
a \emph{leapfrog strategy} in which the two cops alternately guard/increase the currently controlled
area. The running time of this algorithm is $O(n \cdot h \cdot \mbox{diam}(P))$ where $n$ is the number
of vertices, $h$ is the number of obstacles and $\mbox{diam}(P)$ is the diameter of $P$. More concretely,
for an environment with $n$ vertices, we describe an $O(n^2)$ algorithm that (1) determines whether
the obstacles are well-separated, and if so, (2) constructs the required partition for a leapfrog
strategy.
