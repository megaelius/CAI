For the protection of people and society against harm and health threats -- especially for the COVID-19
pandemic -- a variety of different disciplines needs to be involved. The data collection of very
basic and health-related data of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan,
protect, and identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to plan
for or even implement. Thus, every individual, every human, and every inhabitant of the world is
the key player -- very different to many past crises'. And since the individual is involved -- all
individuals -- his/her (a) health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted
balance, not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain aspects. Privacy
remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's data collection can be based on a fully
privacy-preserving application, which can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such
as smartphones, while maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data
collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic and can be achieved
in a democratic and very open, but still and especially privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the
WeTrace approach and application as described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE)
communication channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is being
applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination it had been intended for.
Since literally every other potential participant only listens to random data, even a brute force
attack will not succeed. WeTrace and its Open Source implementation is the only known approach so
far, which ensures that any receiver of a message knows that this is for him/her, but does not know
who the original sender was.
