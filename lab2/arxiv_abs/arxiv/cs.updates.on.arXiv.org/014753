Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a widely used deep architecture for sequence modeling, generation,
and prediction. Despite success in applications such as machine translation and voice recognition,
these stateful models have several critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs generalize poorly
over very long sequences, which limits their applicability to many important temporal processing
and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in recognizing complex context
free languages (CFLs), never reaching 100% accuracy on training. One way to address these shortcomings
is to couple an RNN with an external, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However,
differentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on CFLs nor tested
on sequences longer than those seen in training. The few efforts that have studied them have shown
that continuous differentiable memory structures yield poor generalization for complex CFLs,
making the RNN less interpretable. In this paper, we improve the memory-augmented RNN with important
architectural and state updating mechanisms that ensure that the model learns to properly balance
the use of its latent states with external memory. Our improved RNN models exhibit better generalization
performance and are able to classify long strings generated by complex hierarchical context free
grammars (CFGs). We evaluate our models on CGGs, including the Dyck languages, as well as on the Penn
Treebank language modelling task, and achieve stable, robust performance across these benchmarks.
Furthermore, we show that only our memory-augmented networks are capable of retaining memory for
a longer duration up to strings of length 160.
