Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical method for transforming an observable multi-dimensional
random vector into components that are as statistically independent as possible from each other.
Usually the ICA framework assumes a model according to which the observations are generated (such
as a linear transformation with additive noise). ICA over finite fields is a special case of ICA in
which both the observations and the independent components are over a finite alphabet. In this thesis
we consider a formulation of the finite-field case in which an observation vector is decomposed
to its independent components (as much as possible) with no prior assumption on the way it was generated.
This generalization is also known as Barlow's minimal redundancy representation and is considered
an open problem. We propose several theorems and show that this hard problem can be accurately solved
with a branch and bound search tree algorithm, or tightly approximated with a series of linear problems.
Moreover, we show that there exists a simple transformation (namely, order permutation) which
provides a greedy yet very effective approximation of the optimal solution. We further show that
while not every random vector can be efficiently decomposed into independent components, the vast
majority of vectors do decompose very well (that is, within a small constant cost), as the dimension
increases. In addition, we show that we may practically achieve this favorable constant cost with
a complexity that is asymptotically linear in the alphabet size. Our contribution provides the
first efficient set of solutions to Barlow's problem with theoretical and computational guarantees.
Finally, we demonstrate our suggested framework in multiple source coding applications.
