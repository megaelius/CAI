The work concerns the problem of reducing a pre-trained deep neuronal network to a smaller network,
with just few layers, whilst retaining the network's functionality on a given task The proposed
approach is motivated by the observation that the aim to deliver the highest accuracy possible in
the broadest range of operational conditions, which many deep neural networks models strive to
achieve, may not necessarily be always needed, desired, or even achievable due to the lack of data
or technical constraints. In relation to the face recognition problem, we formulated an example
of such a usecase, the `backyard dog' problem. The `backyard dog', implemented by a lean network,
should correctly identify members from a limited group of individuals, a `family', and should distinguish
between them. At the same time, the network must produce an alarm to an image of an individual who is
not in a member of the family. To produce such a network, we propose a shallowing algorithm. The algorithm
takes an existing deep learning model on its input and outputs a shallowed version of it. The algorithm
is non-iterative and is based on the Advanced Supervised Principal Component Analysis. Performance
of the algorithm is assessed in exhaustive numerical experiments. In the above usecase, the `backyard
dog' problem, the method is capable of drastically reducing the depth of deep learning neural networks,
albeit at the cost of mild performance deterioration. We developed a simple non-iterative method
for shallowing down pre-trained deep networks. The method is generic in the sense that it applies
to a broad class of feed-forward networks, and is based on the Advanced Supervise Principal Component
Analysis. The method enables generation of families of smaller-size shallower specialized networks
tuned for specific operational conditions and tasks from a single larger and more universal legacy
network.
