Data sharing efforts increasingly contribute to the acceleration of scientific discovery. Neuroimaging
data is accumulating in distributed domain-specific databases and there is currently no integrated
access mechanism nor an accepted format for the critically important meta-data that is necessary
for making use of the combined, available neuroimaging data. In this manuscript, we present work
from the Derived Data Working Group, an open-access group sponsored by the Biomedical Informatics
Research Network (BIRN) and the International Neuroimaging Coordinating Facility (INCF) focused
on practical tools for distributed access to neuroimaging data. The working group develops models
and tools facilitating the structured interchange of neuroimaging meta-data and is making progress
towards a unified set of tools for such data and meta-data exchange. We report on the key components
required for integrated access to raw and derived neuroimaging data as well as associated meta-data
and provenance across neuroimaging resources. The components include (1) a structured terminology
that provides semantic context to data, (2) a formal data model for neuroimaging with robust tracking
of data provenance, (3) a web service-based application programming interface (API) that provides
a consistent mechanism to access and query the data model, and (4) a provenance library that can be
used for the extraction of provenance data by image analysts and imaging software developers. We
believe that the framework and set of tools outlined in this manuscript have great potential for
solving many of the issues the neuroimaging community faces when sharing raw and derived neuroimaging
data across the various existing database systems for the purpose of accelerating scientific discovery.
