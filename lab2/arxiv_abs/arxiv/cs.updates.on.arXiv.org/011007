In this paper, an efficient beam and channel acquisition scheme together with joint angle-delay
power profile (JADPP) construction are proposed for single-carrier mm-wave wideband sparse massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels when hybrid beamforming architecture is utilized.
We consider two different modes of operation, namely slow-time beam acquisition and fast-time
instantaneous channel estimation, for training stage of time division duplex based systems. In
the first mode, where pre-structured hybrid beams are formed to scan intended angular sectors,
the joint angle-delay sparsity map together with power intensities of each user channels are obtained
by using a novel constant false alarm rate thresholding algorithm inspired from adaptive radar
detection theory. The proposed thresholding algorithm employs a spatio-temporal adaptive matched
filter type estimator, taking the strong interference due to simultaneously active multipath
components of different user channels into account, in order to estimate JADPP of each user. After
applying the proposed thresholding algorithm on the estimated power profile, the angle-delay
sparsity map of the massive MIMO channel is constructed, based on which the channel covariance matrices
(CCMs) are formed with significantly reduced amount of training snapshots. Then, by using the estimated
CCMs, the analog beamformer is reconstructed by means of a virtual sectorization while taking the
inter-group and inter-symbol interference into account. Finally, for the second mode of operation,
two novel reduced-rank instantaneous channel estimators, operating in a proper beamspace formed
by the hybrid structure, are proposed. The proposed beam and channel acquisition techniques attain
the channel estimation accuracy of minimum mean square error filter with true knowledge of CCMs.
