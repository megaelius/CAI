This paper proposes a practical approach to addressing limitations posed by use of single active
electrodes in applications for sleep stage classification. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based
characterizations of sleep stage progression contribute the diagnosis and monitoring of the many
pathologies of sleep. Several prior reports have explored ways of automating the analysis of sleep
EEG and of reducing the complexity of the data needed for reliable discrimination of sleep stages
in order to make it possible to perform sleep studies at lower cost in the home (rather than only in
specialized clinical facilities). However, these reports have involved recordings from electrodes
placed on the cranial vertex or occiput, which can be uncomfortable or difficult for subjects to
position. Those that have utilized single EEG channels which contain less sleep information, have
showed poor classification performance. We have taken advantage of Rectifier Neural Network for
feature detection and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequential data learning to optimize
classification performance with single electrode recordings. After exploring alternative electrode
placements, we found a comfortable configuration of a single-channel EEG on the forehead and have
shown that it can be integrated with additional electrodes for simultaneous recording of the electroocuolgram
(EOG). Evaluation of data from 62 people (with 494 hours sleep) demonstrated better performance
of our analytical algorithm for automated sleep classification than existing approaches using
vertex or occipital electrode placements. Use of this recording configuration with neural network
deconvolution promises to make clinically indicated home sleep studies practical.
