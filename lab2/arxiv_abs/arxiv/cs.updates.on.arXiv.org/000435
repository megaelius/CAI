In this paper, we study mechanism design problems in the ordinal setting wherein the preferences
of agents are described by orderings over outcomes, as opposed to specific numerical values associated
with them. This setting is relevant when agents can compare outcomes, but aren't able to evaluate
precise utilities for them. Such a situation arises in diverse contexts including voting and matching
markets. Our paper addresses two issues that arise in ordinal mechanism design. To design social
welfare maximizing mechanisms, one needs to be able to quantitatively measure the welfare of an
outcome which is not clear in the ordinal setting. Second, since the impossibility results of Gibbard
and Satterthwaite force one to move to randomized mechanisms, one needs a more nuanced notion of
truthfulness. Our contribution is three fold. 1. We propose rank approximation as a metric for quality
of an outcome allowing us to evaluate mechanisms based on worst-case performance. We demonstrate
robustness properties of this notion making it appealing from various perspectives. 2. We propose
lex-truthfulness as a notion of truthfulness in randomized ordinal mechanisms, which is stronger
than notions studied in the literature, and yet flexible enough to admit a rich class of mechanisms,
thereby circumventing classical impossibility results. We provide a characterization result
for lex-truthful implementability of social choice functions. 3. We demonstrate the usefulness
of the above notions by devising lex-truthful mechanisms achieving good rank-approximations
both in the general ordinal setting, as well as in structured settings such as (one-sided) matching
markets, and its generalizations,the matroid and scheduling markets.
