In this paper, we analyze the tradeoff between coding rate and asymptotic performance of a class
of generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes constructed by including a certain fraction
of generalized constraint (GC) nodes in the graph. The rate of the GLDPC ensemble is bounded using
classical results on linear block codes, namely Hamming bound and Varshamov bound. We also study
the impact of the decoding method used at GC nodes. To incorporate both bounded-distance (BD) and
Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding at GC nodes into our analysis without resorting on multi-edge
type of degree distributions (DDs), we propose the probabilistic peeling decoding (P-PD) algorithm,
which models the decoding step at every GC node as an instance of a Bernoulli random variable with
a successful decoding probability that depends on both the GC block code as well as its decoding algorithm.
The P-PD asymptotic performance over the BEC can be efficiently predicted using standard techniques
for LDPC codes such as density evolution (DE) or the differential equation method. Furthermore,
for a class of GLDPC ensembles, we demonstrate that the simulated P-PD performance accurately predicts
the actual performance of the GLPDC code under ML decoding at GC nodes. We illustrate our analysis
for GLDPC code ensembles with regular and irregular DDs. In all cases, we show that a large fraction
of GC nodes is required to reduce the original gap to capacity, but the optimal fraction is strictly
smaller than one. We then consider techniques to further reduce the gap to capacity by means of random
puncturing, and the inclusion of a certain fraction of generalized variable nodes in the graph.
