We consider coding schemes for computationally bounded channels, which can introduce an arbitrary
set of errors as long as (a) the fraction of errors is bounded with high probability by a parameter
$p$ and (b) the process which adds the errors can be described by a sufficiently simple circuit. Codes
for such channel models are attractive since, like codes for standard adversarial errors, they
can handle channels whose true behavior is unknown or varying over time. For two classes of channels,
we provide explicit, efficiently encodable/decodable codes of optimal rate where only inefficiently
decodable codes were previously known. In each case, we provide one encoder/decoder that works
for every channel in the class. The encoders are randomized, and probabilities are taken over the
(local, unknown to the decoder) coins of the encoder and those of the channel. (1) Unique decoding
for additive errors: We give the first construction of a polynomial-time encodable/decodable
code for additive (a.k.a. oblivious) channels that achieve the Shannon capacity $1-H(p)$. These
channels add an arbitrary error vector $e\in\{0,1\}^N$ of weight at most $pN$ to the transmitted
word; the vector $e$ can depend on the code but not on the particular transmitted word. (2) List-decoding
for polynomial-time channels: For every constant $c>0$, we give a Monte Carlo construction
of an code with optimal rate (arbitrarily close to $1-H(p)$) that efficiently recovers a short list
containing the correct message with high probability for channels describable by circuits of size
at most $N^c$. We justify the relaxation to list-decoding by showing that even with bounded channels,
uniquely decodable codes cannot have positive rate for $p>1/4$.
