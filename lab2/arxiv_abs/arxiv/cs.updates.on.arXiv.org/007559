The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made it inevitable that their
pertinence to digital forensic investigations will increase into the foreseeable future. These
devices produced by various vendors often posses limited standard interfaces for communication,
such as USB ports or WiFi/Bluetooth wireless interfaces. Meanwhile, with an increasing mainstream
focus on the security and privacy of user data, built-in encryption is becoming commonplace in consumer-level
computing devices, and IoT devices are no exception. Under these circumstances, a significant
challenge is presented to digital forensic investigations where data from IoT devices needs to
be analysed. This work explores the electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis literature for
the purpose of assisting digital forensic investigations on IoT devices. EM side-channel analysis
is a technique where unintentional electromagnetic emissions are used for eavesdropping on the
operations and data handling of computing devices. The non-intrusive nature of EM side-channel
approaches makes it a viable option to assist digital forensic investigations as these attacks
require, and must result in, no modification to the target device. The literature on various EM side-channel
analysis attack techniques are discussed - selected on the basis of their applicability in IoT device
investigation scenarios. The insight gained from the background study is used to identify promising
future applications of the technique for digital forensic analysis on IoT devices - potentially
progressing a wide variety of currently hindered digital investigations.
