The incidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) commonly happens in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients,
especially in the adults, which is an independent risk factor affecting short-term and long-term
mortality. Though researchers in recent years highlight the early prediction of AKI, the performance
of existing models are not precise enough. The objective of this research is to precisely predict
AKI by means of Convolutional Neural Network on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The data sets
used in this research are two public Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases: MIMIC-III and eICU
database. In this study, we take several Convolutional Neural Network models to train and test our
AKI predictor, which can precisely predict whether a certain patient will suffer from AKI after
admission in ICU according to the last measurements of the 16 blood gas and demographic features.
The research is based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for AKI definition.
Our work greatly improves the AKI prediction precision, and the best AUROC is up to 0.988 on MIMIC-III
data set and 0.936 on eICU data set, both of which outperform the state-of-art predictors. And the
dimension of the input vector used in this predictor is much fewer than that used in other existing
researches. Compared with the existing AKI predictors, the predictor in this work greatly improves
the precision of early prediction of AKI by using the Convolutional Neural Network architecture
and a more concise input vector. Early and precise prediction of AKI will bring much benefit to the
decision of treatment, so it is believed that our work is a very helpful clinical application.
