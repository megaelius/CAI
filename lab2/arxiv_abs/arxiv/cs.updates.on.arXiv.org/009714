The field of knowledge compilation establishes the tractability of many tasks by studying how to
compile them to Boolean circuit classes obeying some requirements such as structuredness, decomposability,
and determinism. However, in other settings such as intensional query evaluation on databases,
we obtain Boolean circuits that satisfy some width bounds, e.g., they have bounded treewidth or
pathwidth. In this work, we give a systematic picture of many circuit classes considered in knowledge
compilation and show how they can be systematically connected to width measures, through upper
and lower bounds. Our upper bounds show that bounded-treewidth circuits can be constructively
converted to d-SDNNFs, in time linear in the circuit size and singly exponential in the treewidth;
and that bounded-pathwidth circuits can similarly be converted to uOBDDs. We show matching lower
bounds on the compilation of monotone DNF or CNF formulas to structured targets, assuming a constant
bound on the arity (size of clauses) and degree (number of occurrences of each variable): any d-SDNNF
(resp., SDNNF) for such a DNF (resp., CNF) must be of exponential size in its treewidth, and the same
holds for uOBDDs (resp., n-OBDDs) when considering pathwidth. Unlike most previous work, our bounds
apply to any formula of this class, not just a well-chosen family. Hence, we show that pathwidth and
treewidth respectively characterize the efficiency of compiling monotone DNFs to uOBDDs and d-SDNNFs
with compilation being singly exponential in the corresponding width parameter. We also show that
our lower bounds on CNFs extend to unstructured compilation targets, with an exponential lower
bound in the treewidth (resp., pathwidth) when compiling monotone CNFs of constant arity and degree
to DNNFs (resp., nFBDDs).
