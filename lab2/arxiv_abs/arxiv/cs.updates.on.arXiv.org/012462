Computer vision and machine learning are the linchpin of field of automation. The medicine industry
has adopted numerous methods to discover the root causes of many diseases in order to automate detection
process. But, the biomarkers of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are still unknown, let alone automating
its detection. Studies from the neuroscience domain highlighted the fact that corpus callosum
and intracranial brain volume holds significant information for detection of ASD. Such results
and studies are not tested and verified by scientists working in the domain of computer vision / machine
learning. Thus, in this study we have proposed a machine learning based framework for automatic
detection of ASD using features extracted from corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume from
ABIDE dataset. Corpus callosum and intracranial brain volume data is obtained from T1-weighted
MRI scans. Our proposed framework first calculates weights of features extracted from Corpus callosum
and intracranial brain volume data. This step ensures to utilize discriminative capabilities
of only those features that will help in robust recognition of ASD. Then, conventional machine learning
algorithm (conventional refers to algorithms other than deep learning) is applied on features
that are most significant in terms of discriminative capabilities for recognition of ASD. Finally,
for benchmarking and to verify potential of deep learning on analyzing neuroimaging data i.e. T1-weighted
MRI scans, we have done experiment with state of the art deep learning architecture i.e. VGG16 . We
have used transfer learning approach to use already trained VGG16 model for detection of ASD. This
is done to help readers understand benefits and bottlenecks of using deep learning approach for
analyzing neuroimaging data which is difficult to record in large enough quantity for deep learning.
