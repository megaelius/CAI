Until recently, deep steganalyzers in spatial domain have been all designed for gray-scale images.
In this paper, we propose WISERNet (the wider separate-then-reunion network) for steganalysis
of color images. We provide theoretical rationale to claim that the summation in normal convolution
is one sort of "linear collusion attack" which reserves strong correlated patterns while impairs
uncorrelated noises. Therefore in the bottom convolutional layer which aims at suppressing correlated
image contents, we adopt separate channel-wise convolution without summation instead. Conversely,
in the upper convolutional layers we believe that the summation in normal convolution is beneficial.
Therefore we adopt united normal convolution in those layers and make them remarkably wider to reinforce
the effect of "linear collusion attack". As a result, our proposed wide-and-shallow, separate-then-reunion
network structure is specifically suitable for color image steganalysis. We have conducted extensive
experiments on color image datasets generated from BOSSBase raw images and another large-scale
dataset which contains 100,000 raw images, with different demosaicking algorithms and down-sampling
algorithms. The experimental results show that our proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art
color image steganalytic models either hand-crafted or learned using deep networks in the literature
by a clear margin. Specifically, it is noted that the detection performance gain is achieved with
less than half the complexity compared to the most advanced deep-learning steganalyzer as far as
we know, which is scarce in the literature.
