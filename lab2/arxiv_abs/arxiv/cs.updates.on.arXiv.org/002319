The basic goal of group testing is to identify at most very specific $d$ defective items among $N$
items, where $d$ is usually much smaller than $N$. Because testing each item to identify whether
it is defective takes time and is expensive, pooling subsets of $N$ items is more preferable. Normally,
if there is at least one defective item in a subset, the test outcome of that subset would be positive,
and otherwise. However, in many biological applications, it needs more than one defective item
in a test in order to get a positive outcome. In this paper, we consider threshold non-adaptive group
testing in which a test would be positive if it contains at least $u \leq d$ defective items, and negative
otherwise, and all tests are designed in advance. In this model, at most $d$ defective items can be
identified using $t = O \left( \frac{d^2}{d^2 - u^2} \left( \frac{\mathrm{e} (d - u)}{u} \right)^u
\left(u \ln{\frac{d}{u}} + \ln{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} \right) \cdot d^2 \log{N} \right)$ tests
with probability at least $1 - \epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ or $t = O \left( \frac{d^2}{d^2 - u^2}
\left( \frac{\mathrm{e} (d-u)}{u} \right)^u \cdot \left( d\ln{\frac{N}{d}} + u\ln{\frac{d}{u}}
\right) \cdot d^2 \log{N} \right)$ tests with probability of 1. The decoding time is $\frac{t}{O(d^2
\log{N})} \times poly(d^2 \log{N})$, where $poly(\cdot)$ is a polynomial of the input. This result
significantly improves the best known results on decoding threshold non-adaptive group testing,
which are $O(N\log{N} + N \log{\frac{1}{\epsilon}})$ for probabilistic decoding, where $\epsilon
> 0$, and $O(N^u \log{N})$ for deterministic decoding.
