The process of browsing Search Results is one of the major problems with traditional Web search engines
for English, European, and any other languages generally, and for Arabic Language particularly.
This process is absolutely time consuming and the browsing style seems to be unattractive. Organizing
Web search results into clusters facilitates users quick browsing through search results. Traditional
clustering techniques (data-centric clustering algorithms) are inadequate since they don't
generate clusters with highly readable names or cluster labels. To solve this problem, Description-centric
algorithms such as Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm have been introduced and used successfully
and extensively with different adapted versions for English, European, and Chinese Languages.
However, till the day of writing this paper, in our knowledge, STC algorithm has been never applied
for Arabic Web Snippets Search Results Clustering.In this paper, we propose first, to study how
STC can be applied for Arabic Language? We then illustrate by example that is impossible to apply
STC after Arabic Snippets pre-processing (stem or root extraction) because the Merging process
yields many redundant clusters. Secondly, to overcome this problem, we propose to integrate STC
in a new scheme taking into a count the Arabic language properties in order to get the web more and more
adapted to Arabic users. The proposed approach automatically clusters the web search results into
high quality, and high significant clusters labels. The obtained clusters not only are coherent,
but also can convey the contents to the users concisely and accurately. Therefore the Arabic users
can decide at a glance whether the contents of a cluster are of interest.....
