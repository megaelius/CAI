Recently, the research of wireless sensing has achieved more intelligent results, and the intelligent
sensing of human location and activity can be realized by means of WiFi devices. However, most of
the current human environment perception work is limited to a single person's environment, because
the environment in which multiple people exist is more complicated than the environment in which
a single person exists. In order to solve the problem of human behavior perception in a multi-human
environment, we first proposed a solution to achieve crowd counting (inferred population) using
deep learning in a closed environment with WIFI signals - DeepCout, which is the first in a multi-human
environment. step. Since the use of WiFi to directly count the crowd is too complicated, we use deep
learning to solve this problem, use Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to automatically extract
the relationship between the number of people and the channel, and use Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)
to resolve the dependencies of number of people and Channel State Information(CSI) . To overcome
the massive labelled data required by deep learning method, we add an online learning mechanism
to determine whether or not someone is entering/leaving the room by activity recognition model,
so as to correct the deep learning model in the fine-tune stage, which, in turn, reduces the required
training data and make our method evolving over time. The system of DeepCount is performed and evaluated
on the commercial WiFi devices. By massive training samples, our end-to-end learning approach
can achieve an average of 86.4% prediction accuracy in an environment of up to 5 people. Meanwhile,
by the amendment mechanism of the activity recognition model to judge door switch to get the variance
of crowd to amend deep learning predicted results, the accuracy is up to 90%.
