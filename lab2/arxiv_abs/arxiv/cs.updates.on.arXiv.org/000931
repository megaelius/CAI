We consider scheduling problems for unit jobs with release times, where the number or size of the
gaps in the schedule is taken into consideration, either in the objective function or as a constraint.
Except for a few papers on energy minimization, there is no work in the scheduling literature that
uses performance metrics depending on the gap structure of a schedule. One of our objectives is to
initiate the study of such scheduling problems with gaps. We show that such problems often lead to
interesting algorithmic problems, with connections to other areas of algorithmics. We focus on
the model with unit jobs. First we examine scheduling problems with deadlines, where we consider
variants of minimum-gap scheduling, including maximizing throughput with a budget for gaps or
minimizing the number of gaps with a throughput requirement. We then turn to other objective functions.
For example, in some scenarios, gaps in a schedule may be actually desirable, leading to the problem
of maximizing the number of gaps. Other versions we study include minimizing maximum gap or maximizing
minimum gap. The second part of the paper examines the model without deadlines, where we focus on
the tradeoff between the number of gaps and the total or maximum flow time. For all these problems
we provide polynomial time algorithms, with running times ranging from $O(n \log n)$ for some problems,
to $O(n^7)$ for other. The solutions involve a spectrum of algo- rithmic techniques, including
different dynamic programming formulations, speed-up techniques based on searching Monge arrays,
searching X + Y matrices, or implicit binary search.
