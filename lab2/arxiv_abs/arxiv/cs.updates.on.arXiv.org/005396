We present an approach based on machine learning (ML) to distinguish eruption and precursory signals
of Chimay\'{o} geyser (New Mexico, USA) under noisy environments. This geyser can be considered
as a natural analog of $\mathrm{CO}_2$ intrusion into shallow water aquifers. By studying this
geyser, we can understand upwelling of $\mathrm{CO}_2$-rich fluids from depth, which has relevance
to leak monitoring in a $\mathrm{CO}_2$ sequestration project. ML methods such as Random Forests
(RF) are known to be robust multi-class classifiers and perform well under unfavorable noisy conditions.
However, the extent of the RF method's accuracy is poorly understood for this $\mathrm{CO}_2$-driven
geysering application. The current study aims to quantify the performance of RF-classifiers to
discern the geyser state. Towards this goal, we first present the data collected from the seismometer
that is installed near the Chimay\'{o} geyser. The seismic signals collected at this site contain
different types of noises such as daily temperature variations, seasonal trends, animal movement
near the geyser, and human activity. First, we filter the signals from these noises by combining
the Butterworth-Highpass filter and an Autoregressive method in a multi-level fashion. We show
that by combining these filtering techniques, in a hierarchical fashion, leads to reduction in
the noise in the seismic data without removing the precursors and eruption event signals. We then
use RF on the filtered data to classify the state of geyser into three classes -- remnant noise, precursor,
and eruption states. We show that the classification accuracy using RF on the filtered data is greater
than 90\%.These aspects make the proposed ML framework attractive for event discrimination and
signal enhancement under noisy conditions, with strong potential for application to monitoring
leaks in $\mathrm{CO}_2$ sequestration.
