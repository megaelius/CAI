Multilink is a computational model for word retrieval in monolingual and multilingual individuals
under different task circumstances (Dijkstra et al., 2018). In the present study, we added lateral
inhibition to Multilink's lexical network. Parameters were fit on the basis of reaction times from
the English, British, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. We found a maximum correlation of 0.643 (N=1,205)
on these data sets as a whole. Furthermore, the simulations themselves became faster as a result
of adding lateral inhibition. We tested the fitted model to stimuli from a neighbourhood study (Mulder
et al., 2018). Lateral inhibition was found to improve Multilink's correlations for this study,
yielding an overall correlation of 0.67. Next, we explored the role of lateral inhibition as part
of the model's task/decision system by running simulations on data from two studies concerning
interlingual homographs (Vanlangendonck et al., in press; Goertz, 2018). We found that, while
lateral inhibition plays a substantial part in the word selection process, this alone is not enough
to result in a correct response selection. To solve this problem, we added a new task component to
Multilink, especially designed to account for the translation process of interlingual homographs,
cognates, and language-specific control words. The subsequent simulation results showed patterns
remarkably similar to those in the Goertz study. The isomorphicity of the simulated data to the empirical
data was further attested by an overall correlation of 0.538 (N=254) between reaction times and
simulated model cycle times, as well as a condition pattern correlation of 0.853 (N=8). We conclude
that Multilink yields an excellent fit to empirical data, particularly when a task-specific setting
of the inhibition parameters is allowed.
