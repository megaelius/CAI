With the rapid development of online education system, knowledge tracing which aims at predicting
students' knowledge state is becoming a critical and fundamental task in personalized education.
Traditionally, existing methods are domain-specified. However, there are a larger number of domains
(e.g., subjects, schools) in the real world and the lacking of data in some domains, how to utilize
the knowledge and information in other domains to help train a knowledge tracing model for target
domains is increasingly important. We refer to this problem as domain adaptation for knowledge
tracing (DAKT) which contains two aspects: (1) how to achieve great knowledge tracing performance
in each domain. (2) how to transfer good performed knowledge tracing model between domains. To this
end, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptable framework, namely adaptable knowledge tracing
(AKT) to address the DAKT problem. Specifically, for the first aspect, we incorporate the educational
characteristics (e.g., slip, guess, question texts) based on the deep knowledge tracing (DKT)
to obtain a good performed knowledge tracing model. For the second aspect, we propose and adopt three
domain adaptation processes. First, we pre-train an auto-encoder to select useful source instances
for target model training. Second, we minimize the domain-specific knowledge state distribution
discrepancy under maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) measurement to achieve domain adaptation. Third,
we adopt fine-tuning to deal with the problem that the output dimension of source and target domain
are different to make the model suitable for target domains. Extensive experimental results on
two private datasets and seven public datasets clearly prove the effectiveness of AKT for great
knowledge tracing performance and its superior transferable ability.
