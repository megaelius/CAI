With the advent of deep generative models in computational chemistry, in silico anticancer drug
design has undergone an unprecedented transformation. While state-of-the-art deep learning
approaches have shown potential in generating compounds with desired chemical properties, they
disregard the genetic profile and properties of the target disease. Here, we introduce the first
generative model capable of tailoring anticancer compounds for a specific biomolecular profile.
Using a RL framework, the transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells are used as a context for the generation
of candidate molecules. Our molecule generator combines two separately pretrained variational
autoencoders (VAEs) - the first VAE encodes transcriptomic profiles into a smooth, latent space
which in turn is used to condition a second VAE to generate novel molecular structures on the given
transcriptomic profile. The generative process is optimized through PaccMann, a previously developed
drug sensitivity prediction model to obtain effective anticancer compounds for the given context
(i.e., transcriptomic profile). We demonstrate how the molecule generation can be biased towards
compounds with high predicted inhibitory effect against individual cell lines or specific cancer
sites. We verify our approach by investigating candidate drugs generated against specific cancer
types and find the highest structural similarity to existing compounds with known efficacy against
these cancer types. We envision our approach to transform in silico anticancer drug design by leveraging
the biomolecular characteristics of the disease in order to increase success rates in lead compound
discovery.
