Crowdtesting is effective especially when it comes to the feedback on GUI systems, or subjective
opinions about features. Despite of this, we find crowdtesting reports are highly replicated,
i.e., 82% of them are replicates of others. Hence automatically detecting replicate reports could
help reduce triaging efforts. Most of the existing approaches mainly adopted textual information
for replicate detection, and suffered from low accuracy because of the expression gap. Our observation
on real industrial crowdtesting data found that when dealing with crowdtesting reports of GUI systems,
the reports would accompanied with images, i.e., the screenshots of the app. We assume the screenshot
to be valuable for replicate crowdtesting report detection because it reflects the real scenario
of the failure and is not affected by the variety of natural languages. In this work, we propose a replicate
detection approach, TSDetector, which combines information from the screenshots and the textual
descriptions to detect replicate crowdtesting reports. We extract four types of features to characterize
the screenshots and the textual descriptions, and design an algorithm to detect replicates based
on four similarity scores derived from the four different features respectively. We investigate
the effectiveness and advantage of TSDetector on 15 commercial projects with 4,172 reports from
one of the Chinese largest crowdtesting platforms.Results show that TSDetector can outperform
existing state-of-the-art approaches significantly. In addition, we also evaluate its usefulness
using real-world case studies. The feedback from real-world testers demonstrates its practical
value
