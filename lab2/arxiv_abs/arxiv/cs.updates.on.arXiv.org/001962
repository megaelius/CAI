One of the simplest problems on directed graphs is that of identifying the set of vertices reachable
from a designated source vertex. This problem can be solved easily sequentially by performing a
graph search, but efficient parallel algorithms have eluded researchers for decades. For sparse
high-diameter graphs in particular, there is no known work-efficient parallel algorithm with
nontrivial parallelism. This amounts to one of the most fundamental open questions in parallel
graph algorithms: Is there a parallel algorithm for digraph reachability with nearly linear work?
This paper shows that the answer is yes. This paper presents a randomized parallel algorithm for
digraph reachability and related problems with expected work $\tilde{O}(m)$ and span $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$,
and hence parallelism $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$, on any graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs.
This is the first parallel algorithm having both nearly linear work and strongly sublinear span.
The algorithm can be extended to produce a directed spanning tree, determine whether the graph is
acyclic, topologically sort the strongly connected components of the graph, or produce a directed
ear decomposition of a strongly connected graph, all with similar work and span. The main technical
contribution is an \emph{efficient} Monte Carlo algorithm that, through the addition of $\tilde{O}(n)$
shortcuts, reduces the diameter of the graph to $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ with high probability. While
both sequential and parallel algorithms are known with those combinatorial properties, even the
sequential algorithms are not efficient. This paper presents a surprisingly simple sequential
algorithm that achieves the stated diameter reduction and runs in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Parallelizing
that algorithm yields the main result, but doing so involves overcoming several other challenges.
