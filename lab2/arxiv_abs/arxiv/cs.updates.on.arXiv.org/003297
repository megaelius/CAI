In this paper, large-scale content-centric mobile hybrid networks consisting of mobile nodes
and static small base stations (SBSs) (or static helper nodes) are studied, where each node moves
according to the random walk mobility model and requests a content object from the library independently
at random according to a Zipf popularity distribution. Instead of allowing access to content objects
at macro BSs via costly backhaul providing connection to the core network, we consider a more practical
and challenging scenario where mobile nodes and SBSs, each having a finite-size cache space, are
able to cache a subset of content objects so that each request is served by other mobile nodes or SBSs
via multihop transmissions. We analyze the optimal throughput-delay trade-off by presenting
a new cache allocation strategy using variable decoupling. In particular, under a given caching
strategy, we first characterize a fundamental throughput-delay trade-off in terms of scaling
laws by introducing a general content delivery multihop routing protocol. Then, the optimal throughput-delay
trade-off is characterized by presenting the optimal cache allocation strategy, which jointly
finds the replication sets at mobile nodes and SBSs via a novel variable decoupling approach. An
interesting observation is that highly popular content objects are mainly served by mobile nodes
while the rest of content objects are served by static SBSs. We perform numerical evaluation to validate
our analytical results. We also show that the optimal strategy strictly outperforms a baseline
approach, where the replication sets at mobile nodes and SBSs are optimized separately.
