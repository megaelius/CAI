Solutions to the interval observation problem for delayed impulsive and switched systems with
$L_1$-performance are provided. The approach is based on first obtaining stability and $L_1/\ell_1$-to-$L_1/\ell_1$
performance analysis conditions for uncertain linear positive impulsive systems in linear fractional
form with norm-bounded uncertainties using a scaled small-gain argument involving time-varying
$D$-scalings. Both range and minimum dwell-time conditions are formulated -- the case of constant
and maximum dwell-times can be directly obtained as corollaries. The conditions are stated as timer/clock-dependent
conditions taking the form of infinite-dimensional linear programs that can be relaxed into finite-dimensional
ones using polynomial optimization techniques. It is notably shown that under certain conditions,
the scalings can be eliminated from the stability conditions to yield equivalent stability conditions
on the so-called "worst-case system", which is obtained by replacing the uncertainties by the identity
matrix. These conditions are then applied to the special case of linear positive systems with delays,
where the delays are considered as uncertainties. As before, under certain conditions, the scalings
can be eliminated from the conditions to obtain conditions on the worst-case system, coinciding
here with the zero-delay system -- a result that is consistent with all the existing ones in the literature
on linear positive systems with delays. Finally, the case of switched systems with delays is considered.
The approach also encompasses standard continuous-time and discrete-time systems, possibly
with delays and the results are flexible enough to be extended to cope with multiple delays, time-varying
delays, distributed/neutral delays and any other types of uncertain systems that can be represented
as a feedback interconnection of a known system with an uncertainty.
