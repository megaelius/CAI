A new technique is presented for solving the problem of enforcing control limits in power flow studies.
As an added benefit, it greatly increases the achievable precision at nose points. The method is
exemplified for the case of Mvar limits in generators regulating voltage on both local and remote
buses. Based on the framework of the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM), it provides
a rigorous solution to this fundamental problem by framing it in terms of \emph{optimization}.
A novel Lagrangian formulation of power-flow, which is exact for lossless networks, leads to a natural
physics-based minimization criterion that yields the correct solution. For networks with small
losses, as is the case in transmission, the AC power flow problem cannot be framed exactly in terms
of optimization, but the criterion still retains its ability to select the correct solution. This
foundation then provides a way to design a HELM scheme to solve for the minimizing solution. Although
the use of barrier functions evokes interior point optimization, this method, like HELM, is based
on the analytic continuation of a germ (of a particular branch) of the algebraic curve representing
the solutions of the system. In this case, since the constraint equations given by limits result
in an unavoidable singularity at $s=1$, direct analytic continuation by means of standard Pad\'e
approximation is fraught with numerical instabilities. This has been overcome by means of a new
analytic continuation procedure, denominated Pad\'e-Weierstrass, that exploits the covariant
nature of the power flow equations under certain changes of variables. One colateral benefit of
this procedure is that it can also be used when limits are not being enforced, in order to increase
the achievable numerical precision in highly stressed cases.
