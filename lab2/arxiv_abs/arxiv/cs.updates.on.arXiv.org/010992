Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images has been successfully addressed with deep
learning methods for a range of applications. However, this success is heavily dependent on the
quality of the image that is being segmented. A commonly neglected point in the medical image analysis
community is the vast amount of clinical images that have severe image artefacts due to organ motion,
movement of the patient and/or image acquisition related issues. In this paper, we discuss the implications
of image motion artefacts on cardiac MR segmentation and compare a variety of approaches for jointly
correcting for artefacts and segmenting the cardiac cavity. We propose to use a segmentation network
coupled with this in an end-to-end framework. Our training optimises three different tasks: 1)
image artefact detection, 2) artefact correction and 3) image segmentation. We train the reconstruction
network to automatically correct for motion-related artefacts using synthetically corrupted
cardiac MR k-space data and uncorrected reconstructed images. Using a test set of 500 2D+time cine
MR acquisitions from the UK Biobank data set, we achieve demonstrably good image quality and high
segmentation accuracy in the presence of synthetic motion artefacts. We quantitatively compare
our method with a variety of techniques for jointly recovering image quality and performing image
segmentation. We showcase better performance compared to state-of-the-art image correction
techniques. Moreover, our method preserves the quality of uncorrupted images and therefore can
be utilised as a global image reconstruction algorithm.
