Email triage involves going through unhandled emails and deciding what to do with them. This familiar
process can become increasingly challenging as the number of unhandled email grows. During a triage
session, users commonly defer handling emails that they cannot immediately deal with to later.
These deferred emails, are often related to tasks that are postponed until the user has more time
or the right information to deal with them. In this paper, through qualitative interviews and a large-scale
log analysis, we study when and what enterprise email users tend to defer. We found that users are
more likely to defer emails when handling them involves replying, reading carefully, or clicking
on links and attachments. We also learned that the decision to defer emails depends on many factors
such as user's workload and the importance of the sender. Our qualitative results suggested that
deferring is very common, and our quantitative log analysis confirms that 12% of triage sessions
and 16% of daily active users had at least one deferred email on weekdays. We also discuss several
deferral strategies such as marking emails as unread and flagging that are reported by our interviewees,
and illustrate how such patterns can be also observed in user logs. Inspired by the characteristics
of deferred emails and contextual factors involved in deciding if an email should be deferred, we
train a classifier for predicting whether a recently triaged email is actually deferred. Our experimental
results suggests that deferral can be classified with modest effectiveness. Overall, our work
provides novel insights about how users handle their emails and how deferral can be modeled.
