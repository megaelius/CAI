In this article, we consider distributed detection and estimation in wireless sensor networks.
First, we provide a general framework aimed to show how an efficient design of a sensor network requires
a joint organization of in-network processing and communication. Then, we illustrate the consensus
algorithm as a basic tool to reach globally optimal decisions through a decentralized approach.
We address the distributed estimation problem. We show first an entirely decentralized approach,
where observations and estimations are performed without the intervention of a fusion center.
Then, we consider the case where the estimation is performed at a decision center, showing how to
allocate quantization bits and transmit powers in the links between the sensing nodes and the fusion
center, in order to accommodate the requirement on the maximum estimation variance, under a constraint
on the global transmit power. We extend the approach to the detection problem. Also in this case,
we consider the distributed approach, where every node is enabled to achieve a globally optimal
decision, and the case where the decision is taken at a central control node. In such a case, we show
how to allocate coding bits and transmit power in order to maximize the detection probability, under
constraints on the false alarm rate and the global transmit power. Then, we generalize consensus
algorithms illustrating a distributed procedure that converges to the projection of the overall
observation vector onto a signal subspace. We then address the issue of energy consumption, thus
showing how to optimize the network topology in order to minimize the energy necessary to achieve
a global consensus. Finally, we address the problem of matching the topology of the network to the
graph describing the statistical dependencies among the observed variables.
