During the last decade, a considerable amount of effort has been made to classify variable stars
using different machine learning techniques. Typically, light curves are represented as vectors
of statistical descriptors or features that are used to train various algorithms. These features
demand big computational powers that can last from hours to days, making impossible to create scalable
and efficient ways of automatically classifying variable stars. Also, light curves from different
surveys cannot be integrated and analyzed together when using features, because of observational
differences. For example, having variations in cadence and filters, feature distributions become
biased and require expensive data-calibration models. The vast amount of data that will be generated
soon make necessary to develop scalable machine learning architectures without expensive integration
techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks have shown impressing results in raw image classification
and representation within the machine learning literature. In this work, we present a novel Deep
Learning model for light curve classification, mainly based on convolutional units. Our architecture
receives as input the differences between time and magnitude of light curves. It captures the essential
classification patterns regardless of cadence and filter. In addition, we introduce a novel data
augmentation schema for unevenly sampled time series. We test our method using three different
surveys: OGLE-III; Corot; and VVV, which differ in filters, cadence, and area of the sky. We show
that besides the benefit of scalability, our model obtains state of the art levels accuracy in light
curve classification benchmarks.
