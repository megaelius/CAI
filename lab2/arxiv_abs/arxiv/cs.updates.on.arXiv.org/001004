Community detection, which aims to cluster N nodes in a given graph into r distinct groups based on
the observed undirected edges, is an important problem in network data analysis. In this paper,
the popular stochastic block model (SBM) is extended to the generalized stochastic block model
(GSBM) that allows for adversarial outlier nodes, which are connected with other nodes in the graph
in an arbitrary way. Under this model, we introduce a procedure using convex optimization followed
by k-means algorithm with k = r. Both theoretical and numerical properties of the method are analyzed.
A theoretical guarantee is given for our methodology to accurately detect the communities with
small misclassification rate under the setting where the number of clusters can grow with N. This
theoretical result admits to the best known result in the literature of computationally feasible
community detection. Numerical results show that our method is both computationally fast and robust
to different kinds of outliers, while some popular computationally fast community detection algorithms,
such as spectral clustering applied to adjacency matrices or graph Laplacians, may fail due to a
very small portion of outliers. We apply a slight modification of our method to a political blogs
data set, showing that our method is competent in practice, and comparable to existing computationally
feasible methods in the literature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, our result is the first
in the literature in terms of clustering communities with fast growing numbers under the generalized
stochastic block model where a portion of arbitrary outlier nodes exist.
