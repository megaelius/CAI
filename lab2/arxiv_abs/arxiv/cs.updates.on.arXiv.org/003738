In this paper, we consider the Hospital Residents problem (HR) and the Hospital Residents problem
with Lower Quotas (HRLQ). In this model with two sided preferences, stability is a well accepted
notion of optimality. However, in the presence of lower quotas, a stable and feasible matching need
not exist. For the HRLQ problem, our goal therefore is to output a good feasible matching assuming
that a feasible matching exists. Computing matchings with minimum number of blocking pairs (MinBP)
and minimum number of blocking residents (MinBR) are known to be NP-Complete. The only approximation
algorithms for these problems work under severe restrictions on the preference lists. We present
an algorithm which circumvents this restriction and computes a popular matching in the HRLQ instance.
We show that on data-sets generated using various generators, our algorithm performs very well
in terms of blocking pairs and blocking residents. Yokoi (ISAAC 2017) recently studied envy-free
matchings for the HRLQ problem. We propose a simple modification to Yokoi's algorithm to output
a maximal envy-free matching. We observe that popular matchings outperform envy-free matchings
on several parameters of practical importance, like size, number of blocking pairs, number of blocking
residents. In the absence of lower quotas, that is, in the Hospital Residents (HR) problem, stable
matchings are guaranteed to exist. Even in this case, we show that popularity is a practical alternative
to stability. For instance, on synthetic data-sets generated using a particular model, as well
as on real world data-sets, a popular matching is on an average 8-10% larger in size, matches more
number of residents to their top-choice, and more residents prefer the popular matching as compared
to a stable matching. Our comprehensive study reveals the practical appeal of popular matchings
for the HR and HRLQ problems.
