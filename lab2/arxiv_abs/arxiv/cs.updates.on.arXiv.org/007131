The problem of two-sender unicast index coding consists of two senders and a set of receivers. Each
receiver demands a unique message and possesses some of the messages demanded by other receivers
as its side-information. Every demanded message is present with at least one of the senders. Senders
avail the knowledge of the side-information at the receivers to reduce the number of broadcast transmissions.
Solution to this problem consists of finding the optimal number of coded transmissions from the
two senders. One important class of the two-sender problem consists of the messages at the senders
and the side-information at the receivers satisfying \emph{fully-participated interactions}.
This paper provides the optimal broadcast rates, for all the unsolved cases of the two-sender problem
with fully-participated interactions when the associated \emph{interaction digraphs} contain
cycles. The optimal broadcast rates are provided in terms of those of the three independent single-sender
problems associated with the two-sender problem. This paper also provides an achievable broadcast
rate with $t$-bit messages for any finite $t$ and any two-sender problem with fully-participated
interactions belonging to $(i)$ any one of the six instances (classes) of the two-sender problem
when the associated interaction digraph does not contain any cycle, and $(ii)$ one of the classes
of the two-sender problem when the associated interaction digraph contains cycles. The achievable
broadcast rates are obtained by exploiting the symmetries of the confusion graph to color the same
according to the two-sender graph coloring.
