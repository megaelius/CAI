Across the globe, remote image data is rapidly being collected for the assessment of benthic communities
from shallow to extremely deep waters on continental slopes to the abyssal seas. Exploiting this
data is presently limited by the time it takes for experts to identify organisms found in these images.
With this limitation in mind, a large effort has been made globally to introduce automation and machine
learning algorithms to accelerate both classification and assessment of marine benthic biota.
One major issue lies with organisms that move with swell and currents, like kelps. This paper presents
an automatic hierarchical classification method (local binary classification as opposed to the
conventional flat classification) to classify kelps in images collected by autonomous underwater
vehicles. The proposed kelp classification approach exploits learned feature representations
extracted from deep residual networks. We show that these generic features outperform the traditional
off-the-shelf CNN features and the conventional hand-crafted features. Experiments also demonstrate
that the hierarchical classification method outperforms the traditional parallel multi-class
classifications by a significant margin (90.0% vs 57.6% and 77.2% vs 59.0%) on Benthoz15 and Rottnest
datasets respectively. Furthermore, we compare different hierarchical classification approaches
and experimentally show that the sibling hierarchical training approach outperforms the inclusive
hierarchical approach by a significant margin. We also report an application of our proposed method
to study the change in kelp cover over time for annually repeated AUV surveys.
