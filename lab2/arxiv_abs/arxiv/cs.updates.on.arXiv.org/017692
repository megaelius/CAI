The increase in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems has been consistent over the years. Several
studies have reported the impacts of this increase on the distribution networks such as reverse
power flow, voltage fluctuations, possible increase in system losses amongst others. With this
rise in PV penetration level, it becomes necessary for grid tied smart inverters (SI) to be allowed
to participate in feeder voltage regulation. Till date, no comprehensive technical review and
analysis has been done on the impact and interaction of existing and proposed SI settings on the existing
legacy voltage control devices. This paper presents a novel technical review and analysis of some
voltage regulation settings of SIs and their impacts on distribution feeders including their interaction
with legacy devices such as capacitors, on/off Load Tap Changers, their impact on the feeder losses,
harmonic effects and economic impacts (expressed as the device cost factor) and circuit impact
index (CII). The analysis of these functionalities is done using the standard IEEE 8500 distribution
feeder, integrated with six PVs (based on real PV parameters and data), and strategically located
with actual irradiance and temperature profile from a 1.4MW PV plant located at FIU. These PV locations
were carefully selected to allow for detailed impacts studies. The results show how the various
SI functions impact the reactive power injection and switching of the capacitor banks, the voltage
regulator switching, the losses in the feeder, the harmonic and the CII. The Volt-Watt with rise/fall
rate-ofchange limiting setting showed the least impact in terms of the CII, voltage regulator tapping
and capacitor switching but with high amount of losses compared to other SI functions.
