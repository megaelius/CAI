We study the complexity of graph modification problems for homomorphism-based properties of edge-coloured
graphs. A homomorphism from an edge-coloured graph $G$ to an edge-coloured graph $H$ is a vertex-mapping
from $G$ to $H$ that preserves adjacencies and edge-colours. We consider the property of having
a homomorphism to a fixed edge-coloured graph $H$. Given an edge-coloured graph $G$, can we perform
$k$ graph operations so that the resulting graph has a homomorphism to $H$? The operations we consider
are vertex-deletion, edge-deletion and switching (an operation that permutes the colours of the
edges incident to a given vertex). Switching plays an important role in the theory of signed graphs,
that are $2$-edge-coloured graphs whose colours are $+$ and $-$. We denote the corresponding problems
(parameterized by $k$) by VERTEX DELETION $H$-COLOURING, EDGE DELETION $H$-COLOURING and SWITCHING
$H$-COLOURING. These generalise $H$-COLOURING (where one has to decide if an input graph admits
a homomorphism to $H$). Our main focus is when $H$ has order at most $2$, a case that includes standard
problems such as VERTEX COVER, ODD CYCLE TRANSVERSAL and EDGE BIPARTIZATION. For such a graph $H$,
we give a P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for all three studied problems. Then, we address their
parameterized complexity. We show that all VERTEX DELETION $H$-COLOURING and EDGE DELETION $H$-COLOURING
problems for such $H$ are FPT. This is in contrast with the fact that already for some $H$ of order~$3$,
unless P=NP, none of the three considered problems is in XP. We show that the situation is different
for SWITCHING $H$-COLOURING: there are three $2$-edge-coloured graphs $H$ of order $2$ for which
this is W-hard, and assuming the ETH, admits no algorithm in time $f(k)n^{o(k)}$ for inputs of size
$n$. For the other cases, SWITCHING $H$-COLOURING is FPT.
