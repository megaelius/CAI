Consensus formation is investigated for multi-agent systems in which agents' beliefs are both
vague and uncertain. Vagueness is represented by a third truth state meaning \emph{borderline}.
This is combined with a probabilistic model of uncertainty. A belief combination operator is then
proposed which exploits borderline truth values to enable agents with conflicting beliefs to reach
a compromise. A number of simulation experiments are carried out in which agents apply this operator
in pairwise interactions, under the bounded confidence restriction that the two agents' beliefs
must be sufficiently consistent with each other before agreement can be reached. As well as studying
the consensus operator in isolation we also investigate scenarios in which agents are influenced
either directly or indirectly by the state of the world. For the former we conduct simulations which
combine consensus formation with belief updating based on evidence. For the latter we investigate
the effect of assuming that the closer an agent's beliefs are to the truth the more visible they are
in the consensus building process. In all cases applying the consensus operators results in the
population converging to a single shared belief which is both crisp and certain. Furthermore, simulations
which combine consensus formation with evidential updating converge faster to a shared opinion
which is closer to the actual state of the world than those in which beliefs are only changed as a result
of directly receiving new evidence. Finally, if agent interactions are guided by belief quality
measured as similarity to the true state of the world, then applying the consensus operator alone
results in the population converging to a high quality shared belief.
