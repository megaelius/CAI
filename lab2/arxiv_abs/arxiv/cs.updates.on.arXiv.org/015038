This paper studies novel attack and defense strategies, based on a class of stealthy attacks, namely
the zero-dynamics attack (ZDA), for multi-agent control systems. ZDA poses a formidable security
challenge since its attack signal is hidden in the null-space of the state-space representation
of the control system and hence it can evade conventional detection methods. An intuitive defense
strategy builds on changing the aforementioned representation via switching through a set of carefully
crafted topologies. In this paper, we propose realistic ZDA variations where the attacker is aware
of this topology-switching strategy, and hence employs the following policies to avoid detection:
(i) pause, update and resume ZDA according to the knowledge of switching topologies; (ii) cooperate
with a concurrent stealthy topology attack that alters network topology at switching times, such
that the original ZDA is feasible under the corrupted topology. We first systematically study the
proposed ZDA variations, and then develop defense strategies against them under the realistic
assumption that the defender has no knowledge of attack starting, pausing, and resuming times and
the number of misbehaving agents. Particularly, we characterize conditions for detectability
of the proposed ZDA variations, in terms of the network topologies to be maintained, the set of agents
to be monitored, and the measurements of the monitored agents that should be extracted, while simultaneously
preserving the privacy of the states of the non-monitored agents. We then propose an attack detection
algorithm based on the Luenberger observer, using the characterized detectability conditions.
We provide numerical simulation results to demonstrate our theoretical findings.
