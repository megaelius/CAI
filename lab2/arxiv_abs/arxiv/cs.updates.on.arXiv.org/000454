We study user behavior in the courses offered by a major Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) provider
during the summer of 2013. Since social learning is a key element of scalable education in MOOCs and
is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is in understanding forum activities. Two salient
features of MOOC forum activities drive our research: 1. High decline rate: for all courses studied,
the volume of discussions in the forum declines continuously throughout the duration of the course.
2. High-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30% of the courses produce new discussion threads at
rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Furthermore, a substantial
portion of the discussions are not directly course-related. We investigate factors that correlate
with the decline of activity in the online discussion forums and find effective strategies to classify
threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we use linear regression models to analyze the
time series of the count data for the forum activities and make a number of observations, e.g., the
teaching staff's active participation in the discussion increases the discussion volume but does
not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads,
which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and design an effective algorithm for
ranking thread relevance. Our ranking algorithm is further compared against two baseline algorithms,
using human evaluation from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The authors on this paper are listed in alphabetical
