Sea-land segmentation is an important process for many key applications in remote sensing. Proper
operative sea-land segmentation for remote sensing images remains a challenging issue due to complex
and diverse transition between sea and lands. Although several Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have been developed for sea-land segmentation, the performance of these CNNs is far from
the expected target. This paper presents a novel deep neural network structure for pixel-wise sea-land
segmentation, a Residual Dense U-Net (RDU-Net), in complex and high-density remote sensing images.
RDU-Net is a combination of both down-sampling and up-sampling paths to achieve satisfactory results.
In each down- and up-sampling path, in addition to the convolution layers, several densely connected
residual network blocks are proposed to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information.
Each dense network block contains multilevel convolution layers, short-range connections and
an identity mapping connection which facilitates features re-use in the network and makes full
use of the hierarchical features from the original images. These proposed blocks have a certain
number of connections that are designed with shorter distance backpropagation between the layers
and can significantly improve segmentation results whilst minimizing computational costs. We
have performed extensive experiments on two real datasets Google Earth and ISPRS and compare the
proposed RDUNet against several variations of Dense Networks. The experimental results show that
RDUNet outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches on the sea-land segmentation tasks.
