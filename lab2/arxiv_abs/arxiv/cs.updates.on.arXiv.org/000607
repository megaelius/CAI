We consider some computationally efficient and provably correct algorithms with near-optimal
sample-complexity for the problem of noisy non-adaptive group testing. Group testing involves
grouping arbitrary subsets of items into pools. Each pool is then tested to identify the defective
items, which are usually assumed to be "sparse". We consider non-adaptive randomly pooling measurements,
where pools are selected randomly and independently of the test outcomes. We also consider a model
where noisy measurements allow for both some false negative and some false positive test outcomes
(and also allow for asymmetric noise, and activation noise). We consider three classes of algorithms
for the group testing problem (we call them specifically the "Coupon Collector Algorithm", the
"Column Matching Algorithms", and the "LP Decoding Algorithms" -- the last two classes of algorithms
(versions of some of which had been considered before in the literature) were inspired by corresponding
algorithms in the Compressive Sensing literature. The second and third of these algorithms have
several flavours, dealing separately with the noiseless and noisy measurement scenarios. Our
contribution is novel analysis to derive explicit sample-complexity bounds -- with all constants
expressly computed -- for these algorithms as a function of the desired error probability; the noise
parameters; the number of items; and the size of the defective set (or an upper bound on it). We also
compare the bounds to information-theoretic lower bounds for sample complexity based on Fano's
inequality and show that the upper and lower bounds are equal up to an explicitly computable universal
constant factor (independent of problem parameters).
