We study the vector Gaussian Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic loss distortion
measure. Specifically, $K \geq 2$ agents observe independently corrupted Gaussian noisy versions
of a remote vector Gaussian source, and communicate independently with a decoder or CEO over rate-constrained
noise-free links. The CEO also has its own Gaussian noisy observation of the source and wants to reconstruct
the remote source to within some prescribed distortion level where the incurred distortion is measured
under the logarithmic loss penalty criterion. We find an explicit characterization of the rate-distortion
region of this model. The result can be seen as the counterpart to the vector Gaussian setting of that
by Courtade-Weissman which provides the rate-distortion region of the model in the discrete memoryless
setting. For the proof of this result, we obtain an outer bound by means of a technique that relies
on the de Bruijn identity and the properties of Fisher information. The approach is similar to Ekrem-Ulukus
outer bounding technique for the vector Gaussian CEO problem under quadratic distortion measure,
for which it was there found generally non-tight; but it is shown here to yield a complete characterization
of the region for the case of logarithmic loss measure. Also, we show that Gaussian test channels
with time-sharing exhaust the Berger-Tung inner bound, which is optimal. Furthermore, application
of our results allows us to find the complete solutions of two related problems: a quadratic vector
Gaussian CEO problem with determinant constraint and the vector Gaussian distributed Information
Bottleneck problem. Finally, we develop Blahut-Arimoto type algorithms that allow to compute
numerically the regions provided in this paper, for both discrete and Gaussian models. We illustrate
the efficiency of our algorithms through some numerical examples.
