Memristive devices represent a promising technology for building neuromorphic electronic systems.
In addition to their compactness and non-volatility features, they are characterized by computationally
relevant physical properties, such as state-dependence, non-linear conductance changes, and
intrinsic variability in both their switching threshold and conductance values, that make them
ideal devices for emulating the bio-physics of real synapses. In this paper we present a spiking
neural network architecture that supports the use of memristive devices as synaptic elements,
and propose mixed-signal analog-digital interfacing circuits which mitigate the effect of variability
in their conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching threshold, for implementing
stochastic learning. The effect of device variability is mitigated by using pairs of memristive
devices configured in a complementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer
circuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired change in synaptic
weight into a corresponding switching probability that is derived from the intrinsic stochastic
behavior of memristive devices. We demonstrate the features of the CMOS circuits and apply the architecture
proposed to a standard neural network hand-written digit classification benchmark based on the
MNIST data-set. We evaluate the performance of the approach proposed on this benchmark using behavioral-level
spiking neural network simulation, showing both the effect of the reduction in conductance variability
produced by the current-mode normalizer circuit, and the increase in performance as a function
of the number of memristive devices used in each synapse.
