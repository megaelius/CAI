This paper proposes the use of a non-immersive virtual reality rehabilitation system ReHabgame
developed using Microsoft Kinect and the Thalmic Labs Myo gesture control armband. The ReHabgame
was developed based on two third-person video games that provide a feasible possibility of assessing
postural control and functional reach tests. It accurately quantifies specific postural control
mechanisms including timed standing balance, functional reach tests using real-time anatomical
landmark orientation, joint velocity, and acceleration while end trajectories were calculated
using an inverse kinematics algorithm. The game was designed to help patients with neurological
impairment to be subjected to physiotherapy activity and practice postures of daily activities.
The subjective experience of the ReHabgame was studied through the development of an Engagement
Questionnaire (EQ) for qualitative, quantitative and Rasch model. The Monte-Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) and Random object (ROG) generator algorithms were used to adapt the physical and gameplay
intensity in the ReHabgame based on the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) and Hierarchical Scoring System
(HSS). Rasch analysis was conducted to assess the psychometric characteristics of the ReHabgame
and to identify if these are any misfitting items in the game. Rasch rating scale model (RSM) was used
to assess the engagement of players in the ReHabgame and evaluate the effectiveness and attractiveness
of the game. The results showed that the scales assessing the rehabilitation process met Rasch expectations
of reliability, and unidimensionality. Infit and outfit mean squares values are in the range of
(0.68 1.52) for all considered 16 items. The Root Mean Square Residual (RMSR) and the person separation
reliability were acceptable. The item/person map showed that the persons and items were clustered
symmetrically.
