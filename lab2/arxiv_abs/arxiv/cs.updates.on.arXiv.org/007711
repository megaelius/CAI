Leather is a natural and durable material created through a process of tanning of hides and skins
of animals. The price of the leather is subjective as it is highly sensitive to its quality and surface
defects condition. In the literature, there are very few works investigating on the defects detection
for leather using automatic image processing techniques. The manual defect inspection process
is essential in an leather production industry to control the quality of the finished products.
However, it is tedious, as it is labour intensive, time consuming, causes eye fatigue and often prone
to human error. In this paper, a fully automatic defect detection and marking system on a calf leather
is proposed. The proposed system consists of a piece of leather, LED light, high resolution camera
and a robot arm. Succinctly, a machine vision method is presented to identify the position of the
defects on the leather using a deep learning architecture. Then, a series of processes are conducted
to predict the defect instances, including elicitation of the leather images with a robot arm, train
and test the images using a deep learning architecture and determination of the boundary of the defects
using mathematical derivation of the geometry. Note that, all the processes do not involve human
intervention, except for the defect ground truths construction stage. The proposed algorithm
is capable to exhibit 91.5% segmentation accuracy on the train data and 70.35% on the test data. We
also report confusion matrix, F1-score, precision and specificity, sensitivity performance
metrics to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
