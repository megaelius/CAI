The various applications using Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) or blockchains, have led
to the introduction of a new `marketplace' where multiple types of digital assets may be exchanged.
As each blockchain is designed to support specific types of assets and transactions, and no blockchain
will prevail, the need to perform interblockchain transactions is already pressing. In this work
we examine the fundamental problem of interoperable and interconnected blockchains. In particular,
we begin by introducing the Multi-Distributed Ledger Objects (MDLO), which is the result of aggregating
multiple Distributed Ledger Objects -- DLO (a DLO is a formalization of the blockchain) and that
supports append and get operations of records (e.g., transactions) in them from multiple clients
concurrently. Next, we define the AtomicAppends problem, which emerges when the exchange of digital
assets between multiple clients may involve appending records in more than one DLO. Specifically,
AtomicAppend requires that either all records will be appended on the involved DLOs or none. We examine
the solvability of this problem assuming rational and risk-averse clients that may fail by crashing,
and under different client utility and append models, timing models, and client failure scenarios.
We show that for some cases the existence of an intermediary is necessary for the problem solution.
We propose the implementation of such intermediary over a specialized blockchain, we term Smart
DLO (SDLO), and we show how this can be used to solve the AtomicAppends problem even in an asynchronous,
client competitive environment, where all the clients may crash.
