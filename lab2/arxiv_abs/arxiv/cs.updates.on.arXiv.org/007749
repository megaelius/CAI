Future Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will be equipped with a large set of sensors. The
large amount of generated sensor data is expected to be exchanged with other CAVs and the road-side
infrastructure. Both in Europe and the US, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems,
based on the IEEE 802.11p Physical Layer, are key enabler for the communication among vehicles.
Given the expected market penetration of connected vehicles, the licensed band of $\mathrm{75
MHz}$, dedicated to DSRC communications, is expected to become increasingly congested. In this
paper, we investigate the performance of a vehicular communication system, operated over the unlicensed
bands $\mathrm{2.4 GHz}$-$\mathrm{2.5 GHz}$ and $\mathrm{5.725 GHz}$-$\mathrm{5.875 GHz}$.
Our experimental evaluation was carried out in a testing track in the centre of Bristol, UK and our
system is a full-stack ETSI ITS-G5 implementation. Our performance investigation compares key
communication metrics (e.g., packet delivery rate, received signal strength indicator) measured
by operating our system over the licensed DSRC and the considered unlicensed bands. In particular,
when operated over the $\mathrm{2.4 GHz}$-$\mathrm{2.5 GHz}$ band, our system achieves comparable
performance to the case when the DSRC band is used. On the other hand, as soon as the system, is operated
over the $\mathrm{5.725 GHz}$-$\mathrm{5.875 GHz}$ band, the packet delivery rate is $30\%$ smaller
compared to the case when the DSRC band is employed. These findings prove that operating our system
over unlicensed ISM bands is a viable option. During our experimental evaluation, we recorded all
the generated network interactions and the complete data set has been publicly available.
