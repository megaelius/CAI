While the P vs NP problem is mainly approached form the point of view of discrete mathematics, this
paper proposes reformulations into the field of abstract algebra, geometry, fourier analysis
and of continuous global optimization - which advanced tools might bring new perspectives and approaches
for this question. The first one is equivalence of satisfaction of 3-SAT problem with the question
of reaching zero of a nonnegative degree 4 multivariate polynomial (sum of squares), what could
be tested from the perspective of algebra by using discriminant. It could be also approached as a
continuous global optimization problem inside $[0,1]^n$, for example in physical realizations
like adiabatic quantum computers. However, the number of local minima usually grows exponentially.
Reducing to degree 2 polynomial plus constraints of being in $\{0,1\}^n$, we get geometric formulations
as the question if plane or sphere intersects with $\{0,1\}^n$. There will be also presented some
non-standard perspectives for the Subset-Sum, like through convergence of a series, or zeroing
of $\int_0^{2\pi} \prod_i \cos(\varphi k_i) d\varphi $ fourier-type integral for some natural
$k_i$. The last discussed approach is using anti-commuting Grassmann numbers $\theta_i$, making
$(A \cdot \textrm{diag}(\theta_i))^n$ nonzero only if $A$ has a Hamilton cycle. Hence, the P$\ne$NP
assumption implies exponential growth of matrix representation of Grassmann numbers. There will
be also discussed a looking promising algebraic/geometric approach to the graph isomorphism problem
- tested to successfully distinguish strongly regular graphs with up to 29 vertices.
