There have been extensive efforts in government, academia, and industry to anticipate, forecast,
and mitigate cyber attacks. A common approach is time-series forecasting of cyber attacks based
on data from network telescopes, honeypots, and automated intrusion detection/prevention systems.
This research has uncovered key insights such as systematicity in cyber attacks. Here, we propose
an alternate perspective of this problem by performing forecasting of attacks that are analyst-detected
and -verified occurrences of malware. We call these instances of malware cyber event data. Specifically,
our dataset was analyst-detected incidents from a large operational Computer Security Service
Provider (CSSP) for the U.S. Department of Defense, which rarely relies only on automated systems.
Our data set consists of weekly counts of cyber events over approximately seven years. Since all
cyber events were validated by analysts, our dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are
often endemic in other sources of data. Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a number
for resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the development of effective risk-management
strategies. We used a Bayesian State Space Model for forecasting and found that events one week ahead
could be predicted. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model. Our findings of systematicity in
analyst-detected cyber attacks are consistent with previous work using other sources. The advanced
information provided by a forecast may help with threat awareness by providing a probable value
and range for future cyber events one week ahead. Other potential applications for cyber event forecasting
include proactive allocation of resources and capabilities for cyber defense (e.g., analyst staffing
and sensor configuration) in CSSPs. Enhanced threat awareness may improve cybersecurity.
