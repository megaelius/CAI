Parking infrastructure is pervasive and occupies large swaths of land in cities. However, on-demand
(OD) mobility -- such as commercial services Uber, Grab or Didi -- has started reducing parking needs
in urban areas around the world. This trend is expected to grow significantly with the advent of autonomous
driving, which might render on-demand mobility predominant. Recent studies have started looking
at expected parking reductions with on-demand mobility, but a systematic framework is still lacking.
In this paper, we apply a data-driven methodology based on shareability networks to address what
we call the "minimum parking" problem: what is the minimum parking infrastructure needed in a city
for given on-demand mobility needs? While solving the problem, we also identify a critical tradeoff
between two public policy goals: less parking means increased vehicle travel from deadheading
between trips. By applying our methodology to the city of Singapore we discover that parking infrastructure
reduction of up to 86% is possible, but at the expense of a 24% increase in traffic measured as vehicle
kilometers travelled (VKT). However, a more modest 57% reduction in parking is achievable with
only a 1.3% increase in VKT. We find that the tradeoff between parking and traffic obeys an inverse
exponential law which is invariant with the size of the vehicle fleet, leading to a simple methodology
to estimate aggregate parking demand in a city. Finally, we analyze parking requirements due to
passenger pick-ups and show that increasing convenience produces a substantial increase in parking
for passenger pickup/dropoff. The above mathematical findings can inform policy-makers, mobility
operators, and society at large on the tradeoffs required in the transition towards pervasive on-demand
mobility.
