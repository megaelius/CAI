Recently, the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) was proposed within the class of unfitted (or immersed,
or embedded) finite element methods. By reformulating the original boundary value problem over
a surrogate (approximate) computational domain, the SBM avoids integration over cut cells and
the associated problematic issues regarding numerical stability and matrix conditioning. Accuracy
is maintained by modifying the original boundary conditions using Taylor expansions. Hence the
name of the method, that {\it shifts} the location and values of the boundary conditions. In this
article, we present enhanced variational SBM formulations for the Poisson and Stokes problems
with improved flexibility and robustness. These simplified variational forms allow to relax some
of the assumptions required by the mathematical proofs of stability and convergence of earlier
implementations. First, we show that these new SBM implementations can be proved asymptotically
stable and convergent even without the rather restrictive assumption that the inner product between
the normals to the true and surrogate boundaries is positive. Second, we show that it is not necessary
to introduce a stabilization term involving the tangential derivatives of the solution at Dirichlet
boundaries, therefore avoiding the calibration of an additional stabilization parameter. Finally,
we prove enhanced $L^{2}$-estimates without the cumbersome assumption - of earlier proofs - that
the surrogate domain is convex. Instead we rely on a conventional assumption that the boundary of
the true domain is smooth, which can also be replaced by requiring convexity of the true domain. The
aforementioned improvements open the way to a more general and efficient implementation of the
Shifted Boundary Method, particularly in complex three-dimensional geometries. We present numerical
experiments in two and three dimensions.
