Background. Real-world data show that approximately 50% of psoriasis patients treated with a biologic
agent will discontinue the drug because of loss of efficacy. History of previous therapy with another
biologic, female sex and obesity were identified as predictors of drug discontinuations, but their
individual predictive value is low. Objectives. To determine whether machine learning algorithms
can produce models that can accurately predict outcomes of biologic therapy in psoriasis on individual
patient level. Results. All tested machine learning algorithms could accurately predict the risk
of drug discontinuation and its cause (e.g. lack of efficacy vs adverse event). The learned generalized
linear model achieved diagnostic accuracy of 82%, requiring under 2 seconds per patient using the
psoriasis patients dataset. Input optimization analysis established a profile of a patient who
has best chances of long-term treatment success: biologic-naive patient under 49 years, early-onset
plaque psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis, weight < 100 kg, and moderate-to-severe psoriasis
activity (DLQI $\geq$ 16; PASI $\geq$ 10). Moreover, a different generalized linear model is used
to predict the length of treatment for each patient with mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.5 months.
However Pearson Correlation Coefficient indicates 0.935 linear dependencies between the actual
treatment lengths and predicted ones. Conclusions. Machine learning algorithms predict the risk
of drug discontinuation and treatment duration with accuracy exceeding 80%, based on a small set
of predictive variables. This approach can be used as a decision-making tool, communicating expected
outcomes to the patient, and development of evidence-based guidelines.
