The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health problem once according to the World
Health Organization up to June 10th, 2020, more than 7.1 million people were infected, and more than
400 thousand have died worldwide. In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America
present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. It is important to forecast the number of new
cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic
planning to deals with the COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist
regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are
used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition
(VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All Artificial
Intelligence techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three,
and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states up to April
28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and
precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The hybridization of VMD outperformed
single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead,
achieving better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance
ranking as predictor variables is past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Due to the efficiency
of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted
models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development
of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.
