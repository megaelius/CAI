Significance: Late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) is the gold standard
technique for myocardial viability assessment. Although the technique accurately reflects the
damaged tissue, there is no clinical standard for quantifying myocardial infarction (MI), demanding
most algorithms to be expert dependent. Objectives and Methods: In this work a new automatic method
for MI quantification from LGE-MRI is proposed. Our novel segmentation approach is devised for
accurately detecting not only hyper-enhanced lesions, but also microvascular-obstructed areas.
Moreover, it includes a myocardial disease detection step which extends the algorithm for working
under healthy scans. The method is based on a cascade approach where firstly, diseased slices are
identified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondly, by means of morphological operations
a fast coarse scar segmentation is obtained. Thirdly, the segmentation is refined by a boundary-voxel
reclassification strategy using an ensemble of CNNs. For its validation, reproducibility and
further comparison against other methods, we tested the method on a big multi-field expert annotated
LGE-MRI database including healthy and diseased cases. Results and Conclusion: In an exhaustive
comparison against nine reference algorithms, the proposal achieved state-of-the-art segmentation
performances and showed to be the only method agreeing in volumetric scar quantification with the
expert delineations. Moreover, the method was able to reproduce the intra- and inter-observer
variability ranges. It is concluded that the method could suitably be transferred to clinical scenarios.
