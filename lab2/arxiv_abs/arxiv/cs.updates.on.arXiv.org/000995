Hyperspectral remote sensing images (HSIs) usually have high spectral resolution and low spatial
resolution. Conversely, multispectral images (MSIs) usually have low spectral and high spatial
resolutions. The problem of inferring images which combine the high spectral and high spatial resolutions
of HSIs and MSIs, respectively, is a data fusion problem that has been the focus of recent active research
due to the increasing availability of HSIs and MSIs retrieved from the same geographical area. We
formulate this problem as the minimization of a convex objective function containing two quadratic
data-fitting terms and an edge-preserving regularizer. The data-fitting terms account for blur,
different resolutions, and additive noise. The regularizer, a form of vector Total Variation,
promotes piecewise-smooth solutions with discontinuities aligned across the hyperspectral
bands. The downsampling operator accounting for the different spatial resolutions, the non-quadratic
and non-smooth nature of the regularizer, and the very large size of the HSI to be estimated lead to
a hard optimization problem. We deal with these difficulties by exploiting the fact that HSIs generally
"live" in a low-dimensional subspace and by tailoring the Split Augmented Lagrangian Shrinkage
Algorithm (SALSA), which is an instance of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM),
to this optimization problem, by means of a convenient variable splitting. The spatial blur and
the spectral linear operators linked, respectively, with the HSI and MSI acquisition processes
are also estimated, and we obtain an effective algorithm that outperforms the state-of-the-art,
as illustrated in a series of experiments with simulated and real-life data.
