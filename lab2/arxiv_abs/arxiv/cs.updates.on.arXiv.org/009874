To what extent user's stance towards a given topic could be inferred? Most of the studies on stance
detection have focused on analysing user's posts on a given topic to predict the stance. However,
the stance in social media can be inferred from a mixture of signals that might reflect user's beliefs
including posts and online interactions. This paper examines various online features of users
to detect their stance towards different topics. We compare multiple set of features, including
on-topic content, network interactions, user's preferences, and online network connections.
Our objective is to understand the online signals that can reveal the users' stance. Experimentation
is applied on tweets dataset from the SemEval stance detection task, which covers five topics. Results
show that stance of a user can be detected with multiple signals of user's online activity, including
their posts on the topic, the network they interact with or follow, the websites they visit, and the
content they like. The performance of the stance modelling using different network features are
comparable with the state-of-the-art reported model that used textual content only. In addition,
combining network and content features leads to the highest reported performance to date on the
SemEval dataset with F-measure of 72.49%. We further present an extensive analysis to show how these
different set of features can reveal stance. Our findings have distinct privacy implications,
where they highlight that stance is strongly embedded in user's online social network that, in principle,
individuals can be profiled from their interactions and connections even when they do not post about
the topic.
