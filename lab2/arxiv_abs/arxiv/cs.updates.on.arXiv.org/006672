The growing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for various applications requires ubiquitous
and reliable connectivity for safe control and data exchange between these devices and ground terminals.
Depending on the application, UAV-mounted wireless equipment can either be an aerial user equipment
(AUE) that co-exists with the terrestrial users, or it can be a part of wireless infrastructure providing
a range of services to the ground users. For instance, AUE can be used for real-time search and rescue
and Aerial Base Station (ABS) can enhance coverage, capacity and energy efficiency of wireless
networks. In both cases, UAV-based solutions are scalable, mobile, fast to deploy. However, several
technical challenges have to be addressed. In this work, we present a tutorial on wireless communication
with UAVs, taking into account a wide range of potential applications. The main goal of this work
is to provide a complete overview of the main scenarios (AUE and ABS), channel and performance models,
compare them, and discuss open research points. This work gives a comprehensive overview of the
research done until now and depicts a comprehensive picture to foster new ideas and solutions while
avoiding duplication of past work. We start by discussing the open challenges of wireless communication
with UAVs. To give answers to the posed questions, we focus on the UAV communication basics, mainly
providing the necessary channel modeling background and giving guidelines on how various channel
models should be used. Next, theoretical, simulation- and measurement-based approaches, to address
the key challenges for AUE usage, are presented. Moreover, in this work, we aim to provide a comprehensive
overview on how UAV-mounted equipment can be used as a part of a communication network. Based on the
theoretical analysis, we show how various network parameters can be optimized.
