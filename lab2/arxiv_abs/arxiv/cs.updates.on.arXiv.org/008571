Topology optimization is one of the most-used method to inversely determine the geometrical configurations
of structures. In the current density method-based topology optimization, the design variable
used to represent the structure was usually defined on three-dimensional domains or reduced two-dimensional
planes, with the deficiency on the general two-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, this article
focuses on developing a density method-based topology optimization approach implemented on two-dimensional
manifolds. In this approach, material interpolation is implemented on a material parameter in
the partial differential equation used to describe a physical field, when this physical field is
defined on a two-dimensional manifold; the density variable is used to formulate a mixed boundary
condition of a physical field and implement the penalization between two different types of boundary
conditions, when this physical field is defined on a three-dimensional domain and its boundary
conditions are defined on a two-dimensional manifold, an interface imbedded in the three-dimensional
space. Because of the homeomorphic property of two-dimensional manifolds, several typical two-dimensional
manifolds, e.g., sphere, torus, M\"{o}bius strip and Klein bottle, are included in the numerical
tests. This approach has been tested and demonstrated by the problems in the areas of soft matter,
heat transfer and electromagnetics. Because the derived structural pattern on a two-dimensional
manifold is a fiber bundle with a corresponding base manifold and topology optimization is a typical
inverse design method, this developed topology optimization approach is an inverse design method
of fiber bundles.
