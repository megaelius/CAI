How to compare whole genome sequences at large scale has not been achieved via conventional methods
based on pair-wisely base-to-base comparison; nevertheless, no attention was paid to handle in-one-sitting
a number of genomes crossing genetic category (chromosome, plasmid, and phage) with farther divergences
(much less or no homologous) over large size ranges (from Kbp to Mbp). We created a new method, GenomeFingerprinter,
to unambiguously produce three-dimensional coordinates from a sequence, followed by one three-dimensional
plot and six two-dimensional trajectory projections to illustrate whole genome fingerprints.
We further developed a set of concepts and tools and thereby established a new method, universal
genome fingerprint analysis. We demonstrated their applications through case studies on over
a hundred of genome sequences. Particularly, we defined the total genetic component configuration
(TGCC) (i.e., chromosome, plasmid, and phage) for describing a strain as a system, and the universal
genome fingerprint map (UGFM) of TGCC for differentiating a strain as a universal system, as well
as the systematic comparative genomics (SCG) for comparing in-one-sitting a number of genomes
crossing genetic category in diverse strains. By using UGFM, UGFM-TGCC, and UGFM-TGCC-SCG, we
compared a number of genome sequences with farther divergences (chromosome, plasmid, and phage;
bacterium, archaeal bacterium, and virus) over large size ranges (6Kbp~5Mbp), giving new insights
into critical problematic issues in microbial genomics in the post-genomic era. This paper provided
a new method for rapidly computing, geometrically visualizing, and intuitively comparing genome
sequences at fingerprint level, and hence established a new method of universal genome fingerprint
analysis for systematic comparative genomics.
