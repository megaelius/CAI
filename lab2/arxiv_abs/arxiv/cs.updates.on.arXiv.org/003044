This two-part paper develops novel methodologies for using fractional programming (FP) techniques
to design and optimize communication systems. Part I of this paper proposes a new quadratic transform
for FP and treats its application for continuous optimization problems. In this Part II of the paper,
we study discrete problems, such as those involving user scheduling, which are considerably more
difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete or mixed discrete-continuous problems
normally cannot be recast as convex problems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the
discrete variables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable to distributed
combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this methodology by tackling the important
and challenging problem of uplink coordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular
systems. Uplink scheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user
scheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby cells. Further,
the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly with continuous variables such
as transmit power levels and beamformers. The main idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple
the interaction among the interfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization
of the discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper shows that the well-known
weighted minimum mean-square-error (WMMSE) algorithm can also be derived from a particular use
of FP; but our proposed FP-based method significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling
variables are involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.
