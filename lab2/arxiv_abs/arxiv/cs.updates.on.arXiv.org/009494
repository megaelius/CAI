In this paper we give provable sieving algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Closest
Vector Problem (CVP) on lattices in $\ell_p$ norm for $1\leq p\leq\infty$. The running time we get
is better than existing provable sieving algorithms, except the Discrete Gaussian based algorithm
by Aggarwal et al.[2015], but this algorithm works only for the Euclidean norm. We build on the randomized
sieving framework of Ajtai, Kumar and Sivakumar [2001,2002], where they used a sieving sub-routine
that runs in time quadratic in the number of sampled vectors. We give a new sieving procedure that
works for all $\ell_p$ norm and runs in time linear in the number of sampled vectors. The main idea
is to divide the space (hypersphere) into regions (hypercubes) such that each vector can be mapped
efficiently to a region. This is an extension of the sieving technique in Aggarwal and Mukhopadhyay[2018],
where it has been used only for the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. This improves the time complexity of the
overall algorithm as compared to previous analyses of AKS algorithm in $\ell_p$ norm [Blomer and
Naewe(2009),Arvind and Joglekar(2008)]. In the $\ell_2$ norm, using the birthday paradox we achieve
a time complexity of $2^{2.49n+o(n)}$, as compared to the time complexity of $2^{2.571n+o(n)}$
of AKS (using birthday paradox) [Hanrot et al.(2011)]. We further modify our linear sieving technique
and introduce a mixed sieving procedure. At first a point is mapped to a hypercube within a sphere
(as done in linear sieve) and then within each hypercube we perform a quadratic sieve like AKS. This
helps us achieve a time complexity of $2^{2.25n+o(n)}$ in $\ell_2$ norm, which is better than the
time complexity of List Sieve Birthday ($2^{2.465n+o(n)}$) [Pujol and Stehle(2009),Hanrot et
al.(2011)]. We also adopt our techniques for approximation algorithms of the above problems.
