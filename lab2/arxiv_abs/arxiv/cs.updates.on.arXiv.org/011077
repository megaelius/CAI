Proof-of-stake blockchain protocols are becoming one of the most promising alternatives to the
energy-consuming proof-of-work protocols. However, one particularly critical threat in the
PoS setting is the well-known long-range attacks caused by secret key leakage (LRSL attack). Specifically,
an adversary can attempt to control/compromise accounts possessing substantial stake at some
past moment such that double-spend or erase past transactions, violating the fundamental persistence
property of blockchain. Puncturable signatures provide a satisfying solution to construct practical
proof-of-stake blockchain resilient to LRSL attack, despite of the fact that existent constructions
are not efficient enough for practical deployments. In this paper, we provide an in-depth study
of puncturable signatures and explore its applications in the proof-of-stake blockchain. We formalize
a security model that allows the adversary for adaptive signing and puncturing queries, and show
a construction with efficient puncturing operations based on the Bloom filter data structure and
strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. The puncturing functionality we desire is for a particular
part of message, like prefix, instead of the whole message. Furthermore, we use puncturable signatures
to construct practical proof-of-stake blockchain protocols that are resilient to LRSL attack,
while previously the forward-secure signature is used to immunize this attack. We implement our
scheme and provide experimental results showing that in comparison with the forward-secure signature,
our construction performs substantially better on signature size, signing and verification efficiency,
significantly on key update efficiency.
