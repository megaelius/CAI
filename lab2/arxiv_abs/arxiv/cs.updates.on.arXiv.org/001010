In computer vision, many problems such as image segmentation, pixel labelling, and scene parsing
can be formulated as binary quadratic programs (BQPs). For submodular problems, cuts based methods
can be employed to efficiently solve large-scale problems. However, general nonsubmodular problems
are significantly more challenging to solve. Finding a solution when the problem is of large size
to be of practical interest, however, typically requires relaxation. Two standard relaxation
methods are widely used for solving general BQPs--spectral methods and semidefinite programming
(SDP), each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and easy
to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a tighter bound, but its computational
complexity is high, especially for large scale problems. In this work, we present a new SDP formulation
for BQPs, with two desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to conventional
SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods, the new SDP formulation leads
to a significantly more efficient and scalable dual optimization approach, which has the same degree
of complexity as spectral methods. We then propose two solvers, namely, quasi-Newton and smoothing
Newton methods, for the dual problem. Both of them are significantly more efficiently than standard
interior-point methods. In practice, the smoothing Newton solver is faster than the quasi-Newton
solver for dense or medium-sized problems, while the quasi-Newton solver is preferable for large
sparse/structured problems. Our experiments on a few computer vision applications including
clustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and registration show the potential of our SDP
formulation for solving large-scale BQPs.
