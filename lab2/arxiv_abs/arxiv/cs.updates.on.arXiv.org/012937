Homograph attack is a way that attackers deceive victims about which website domain name they are
communicating with by exploiting the fact that many characters look alike. The attack becomes serious
and is raising broad attention when recently many brand domains have been attacked such as Apple
Inc., Adobe Inc., Lloyds Bank, etc. We first design a survey of human demographics, brand familiarity,
and security backgrounds and apply it to 2,067 participants. We build a regression model to study
which factors affect participants' ability in recognizing homograph domains. We find that for
different levels of visual similarity, the participants exhibit different abilities. 13.95%
of participants can recognize non-homographs while 16.60% of participants can recognize homographs
whose the visual similarity with the target brand domains is under 99.9%; but when the similarity
increases to 99.9%, the number of participants who can recognize homographs significantly drops
down to only 0.19%; and for the homographs with 100% of visual similarity, there is no way for the participants
to recognize. We also find that female participants tend to recognize homographs better the male
but male participants tend to able to recognize non-homographs better than females. Security knowledge
is a significant factor affecting both homographs and non-homographs; surprisingly, people who
have strong security knowledge tend to be able to recognize homographs but not non-homographs.
Furthermore, people who work or are educated in computer science or computer engineering do not
appear as a factor affecting the ability in recognizing homographs; however, interestingly, right
after they are explained about the homograph attack, people who work or are educated in computer
science or computer engineering are the ones who can capture the situation the most quickly.
