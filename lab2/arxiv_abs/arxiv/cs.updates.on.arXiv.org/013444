The ever-increasing penetration of Distributed Generators (DGs) in distribution networks suggests
to enable their potentials in better fulfilling the restoration objective. The objective of the
restoration problem is to resupply the maximum energy of loads considering their priorities using
minimum switching operations. Basically, it is desired to provide a unique configuration that
is valid regarding the load and generation profiles along the entire restorative period. However,
this unique configuration may not satisfy at the same time: I) the DG start-up requirements at the
beginning of the restoration plan and II) the topological conditions that would allow the DG to provide
later on the most efficient support for the supply of loads. Therefore, it is proposed in this paper
to allow a limited number of reconfiguration steps according to the DG start-up requirements. In
addition, this paper presents a novel formulation for the reconfiguration problem that accounts
for partial restoration scenarios where the whole unsupplied area cannot be restored. The decision
variables of the proposed multi-step restoration problem are: I) the line switching actions at
each step of the reconfiguration process, II) the load switching actions during the whole restorative
period and, III) the active/reactive power dispatch of DGs during the whole restorative period.
A relaxed AC power flow formulation is integrated to the optimization problem in order to ensure
the feasibility of the solution concerning the operational safety constraints. The overall model
is formulated in terms of a mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Two simulation scenarios
are studied in order to illustrate different features of the proposed strategy and to demonstrate
its effectiveness particularly in the case of large-scale outages in distribution networks.
