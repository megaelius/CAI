In this paper, we first analyze the adverse effects of cyber-physical attacks on the event-triggered
distributed Kalman filter (DKF). More specifically, we show that attacks can adversely and significantly
affect the state estimation error covariance of the sensors, and, consequently, the performance
of the DKF. We also show that the event-triggered mechanism in the DKF can be leveraged by the attacker
to cause a non-triggering misbehavior that significantly harms the network connectivity and its
collective observability. Moreover, an attacker can also mislead the event-triggered mechanism
and achieves a continuous-triggering misbehavior to drain the communication resources. An information-theoretic
approach is then presented to detect attacks on both sensors and communication channels. To mitigate
attacks, a meta-Bayesian approach is presented that incorporates the outcome of the attack detection
mechanism to perform second-order inference and consequently form trust over estimates. That
is, the second-order inference for each sensor forms internal and external beliefs about the truthfulness
or legitimacy of the outcome of its own first-order inference (i.e., the posterior belief about
the state estimate) and those of its neighbors, respectively. Each sensor communicates its internal
belief to its neighbors. Sensors then incorporate the internal beliefs of their neighbors and their
own external beliefs about their neighbors into their posterior update laws to successfully discard
corrupted information. Finally, the simulation result validates the effectiveness of the presented
resilient event-triggered DKF.
