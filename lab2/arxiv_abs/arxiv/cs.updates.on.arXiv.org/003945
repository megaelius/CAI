Since real-time contents can be captured and downloaded very easily, copyright infringement has
become a serious problem. In order to reduce the loss caused by copyright infringement, copyright
owners insert a watermark in the content to protect the copyright using illegal distribution route
tracking and copyright authentication. However, whereas many existing watermarking techniques
are robust to signal distortion such as compression, they are vulnerable to geometric distortion
that causes synchronization errors. In particular, capturing real-time content in Internet browsers
and smartphone applications is problematic because geometric distortion such as scaling and translation
frequently occurs. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network-based template architecture
that compensates for the disadvantages of existing watermarking techniques that are vulnerable
to geometric distortion. The proposed template consists of a template generation network, a template
extraction network, and a template matching network. The template generation network generates
a template in the form of noise and the template is inserted into certain pre-defined spatial locations
of the image. The extraction network detects spatial locations where the template is inserted in
the image. Finally, the template matching network estimates the parameters of the geometric distortion
by comparing the shape of spatial locations where the template was inserted with the locations where
the template was detected. It is possible to recover an image in its original geometrical form using
the estimated parameters, and as a result, watermarks applied using existing watermarking techniques
that are vulnerable to geometric distortion can be decoded normally.
