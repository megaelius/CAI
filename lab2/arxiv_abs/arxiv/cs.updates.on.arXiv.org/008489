Autonomous driving (auto-driving) has been becoming a killer technology for next generation vehicles,
whereas some fatal accidents grow concerns about its safety. A fundamental function for safer auto-driving
is to recognize the vehicles' locations, termed vehicular positioning. The state-of-the-art
vehicular positioning is to rely on anchors that are stationary objects whose locations are known,
i.e. satellites for GPS and base stations for cellular positioning. It is important for reliable
positioning to install anchors densely, helping find enough anchors nearby. For the deployment
to be cost-effective, there are some trials to use backscatter tags as alternative anchors by deploying
them on a road surface, but its gain is limited by several reasons such as short contact time and difficulties
in maintenance. Instead, we propose a new backscatter-tag assisted vehicular positioning system
where tags are deployed along a roadside, which enables the extension of contact duration and facilitates
the maintenance. On the other hand, there is a location mismatch between the vehicle and the tag,
calling for developing a new backscatter transmission to estimate their relative position. To
this end, we design a novel waveform called joint frequency-and-phase modulation (JFPM) for backscatter-tag
assisted vehicular positioning where a transmit frequency is modulated for the distance estimation
assuming that the relevant signal is clearly differentiable from the others while the phase modulation
helps the differentiation. The JFPM waveform leads to exploiting the maximum Degree-of-Freedoms
(DoFs) of backscatter channel in which multiple-access and broadcasting channels coexist, leading
to more accurate positioning verified by extensive simulations.
