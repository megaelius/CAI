Variational inference (VI) methods and especially variational autoencoders (VAEs) specify scalable
generative models that enjoy an intuitive connection to manifold learning --- with many default
priors the posterior/likelihood pair $q(z|x)$/$p(x|z)$ can be viewed as an approximate homeomorphism
(and its inverse) between the data manifold and a latent Euclidean space. However, these approximations
are well-documented to become degenerate in training. Unless the subjective prior is carefully
chosen, the topologies of the prior and data distributions often will not match. Conversely, diffusion
maps (DM) automatically $\textit{infer}$ the data topology and enjoy a rigorous connection to
manifold learning, but do not scale easily or provide the inverse homeomorphism. In this paper,
we propose $\textbf{a)}$ a principled measure for recognizing the mismatch between data and latent
distributions and $\textbf{b)}$ a method that combines the advantages of variational inference
and diffusion maps to learn a homeomorphic generative model. The measure, the$ \textit{locally
bi-Lipschitz property}$, is a sufficient condition for a homeomorphism and easy to compute and
interpret. The method, the $\textit{variational diffusion autoencoder}$ (VDAE), is a novel generative
algorithm that first infers the topology of the data distribution, then models a diffusion random
walk over the data. To achieve efficient computation in VDAEs, we use stochastic versions of both
variational inference and manifold learning optimization. We prove approximation theoretic
results for the dimension dependence of VDAEs, and that locally isotropic sampling in the latent
space results in a random walk over the reconstructed manifold. Finally, we demonstrate our method
on various real and synthetic datasets, and show that it exhibits performance superior to other
generative models.
