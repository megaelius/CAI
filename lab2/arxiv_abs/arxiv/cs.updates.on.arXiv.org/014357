Most neurological diseases are characterized by gradual deterioration of brain structure and
function. To identify the impact of such diseases, studies have been acquiring large longitudinal
MRI datasets and applied deep-learning to predict diagnosis label(s). These learning models apply
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract informative features from each time point of the
longitudinal MRI and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to classify each time point based on those
features. However, they neglect the progressive nature of the disease, which may result in clinically
implausible predictions across visits. In this paper, we propose a framework that injects the extracted
features from CNNs at each time point to the RNN cells considering the dependencies across different
time points in the longitudinal data. On the feature level, we propose a novel longitudinal pooling
layer to couple features of a visit with those of proceeding ones. On the prediction level, we add
a consistency regularization to the classification objective in line with the nature of the disease
progression across visits. We evaluate the proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs
from three neuroimaging datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=404),
a dataset composed of 274 healthy controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and
255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA).
All three experiments show that our method is superior to the widely used methods. The code is available
