Digitalization is penetrating every aspect of everyday life including a human's heart beating,
which can easily be sensed by wearable sensors and displayed for others to see, feel, and potentially
"bodily resonate" with. Previous work in studying human interactions and interaction designs
with physiological data, such as a heart's pulse rate, have argued that feeding it back to the users
may, for example support users' mindfulness and self-awareness during various everyday activities
and ultimately support their wellbeing. Inspired by Somaesthetics as a discipline, which focuses
on an appreciation of the living body's role in all our experiences, we designed and explored mobile
tangible heart beat displays, which enable rich forms of bodily experiencing oneself and others
in social proximity. In this paper, we first report on the design process of tangible heart displays
and then present results of a field study with 30 pairs of participants. Participants were asked
to use the tangible heart displays during watching movies together and report their experience
in three different heart display conditions (i.e., displaying their own heart beat, their partner's
heart beat, and watching a movie without a heart display). We found, for example that participants
reported significant effects in experiencing sensory immersion when they felt their own heart
beats compared to the condition without any heart beat display, and that feeling their partner's
heart beats resulted in significant effects on social experience. We refer to resonance theory
to discuss the results, highlighting the potential of how ubiquitous technology could utilize
physiological data to provide resonance in a modern society facing social acceleration.
