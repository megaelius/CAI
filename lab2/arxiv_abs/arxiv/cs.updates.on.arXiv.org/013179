Diversity maximization is a fundamental problem in web search and data mining. For a given dataset
$S$ of $n$ elements, the problem requires to determine a subset of $S$ containing $k\ll n$ "representatives"
which minimize some diversity function expressed in terms of pairwise distances, where distance
models dissimilarity. An important variant of the problem prescribes that the solution satisfy
an additional orthogonal requirement, which can be specified as a matroid constraint (i.e., a feasible
solution must be an independent set of size $k$ of a given matroid). While unconstrained diversity
maximization admits efficient coreset-based strategies for several diversity functions, known
approaches dealing with the additional matroid constraint apply only to one diversity function
(sum of distances), and are based on an expensive, inherently sequential, local search over the
entire input dataset. We devise the first coreset-based algorithms for diversity maximization
under matroid constraints for various diversity functions, together with efficient sequential,
MapReduce and Streaming implementations. Technically, our algorithms rely on the construction
of a small coreset, that is, a subset of $S$ containing a feasible solution which is no more than a factor
$1-\epsilon$ away from the optimal solution for $S$. While our algorithms are fully general, for
the partition and transversal matroids, if $\epsilon$ is a constant in $(0,1)$ and $S$ has bounded
doubling dimension, the coreset size is independent of $n$ and it is small enough to afford the execution
of a slow sequential algorithm to extract a final, accurate, solution in reasonable time. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithms are accurate, fast and scalable, and therefore they are capable
of dealing with the large input instances typical of the big data scenario.
