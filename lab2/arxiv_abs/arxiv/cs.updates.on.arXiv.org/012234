Social network alignment has been an important research problem for social network analysis in
recent years. With the identified shared users across networks, it will provide researchers with
the opportunity to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of users' social activities both
within and across networks. Social network alignment is a very difficult problem. Besides the challenges
introduced by the network heterogeneity, the network alignment problem can be reduced to a combinatorial
optimization problem with an extremely large search space. The learning effectiveness and efficiency
of existing alignment models will be degraded significantly as the network size increases. In this
paper, we will focus on studying the scalable heterogeneous social network alignment problem,
and propose to address it with a novel two-stage network alignment model, namely \textbf{S}calable
\textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{A}lignment (SHNA). Based on a group of intra-
and inter-network meta diagrams, SHNA first partitions the social networks into a group of sub-networks
synergistically. Via the partially known anchor links, SHNA will extract the partitioned sub-network
correspondence relationships. Instead of aligning the complete input network, SHNA proposes
to identify the anchor links between the matched sub-network pairs, while those between the unmatched
sub-networks will be pruned to effectively shrink the search space. Extensive experiments have
been done to compare SHNA with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on a real-world aligned social
networks dataset. The experimental results have demonstrated both the effectiveness and efficiency
of the {\our} model in addressing the problem.
