This work studies the hardness of finding independent sets in hypergraphs which are either 2-colorable
or are almost 2-colorable, i.e. can be 2-colored after removing a small fraction of vertices and
the incident hyperedges. To be precise, say that a hypergraph is (1-eps)-almost 2-colorable if
removing an eps fraction of its vertices and all hyperedges incident on them makes the remaining
hypergraph 2-colorable. In particular we prove the following results. For an arbitrarily small
constant gamma > 0, there is a constant xi > 0, such that, given a 4-uniform hypergraph on n vertices
which is (1 - eps)-almost 2-colorable for eps = 2^{-(log n)^xi}, it is quasi-NP-hard to find an independent
set of n/(2^{(log n)^{1-gamma}}) vertices. For any constants eps, delta > 0, given as input a
3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices which is (1-eps)-almost 2-colorable, it is NP-hard to find
an independent set of delta n vertices. Assuming the d-to-1 Games Conjecture the following holds.
For any constant delta > 0, given a 2-colorable 3-uniform hypergraph on n vertices, it is NP-hard
to find an independent set of delta n vertices. The hardness result on independent set in almost 2-colorable
3-uniform hypergraphs was earlier known only assuming the Unique Games Conjecture. In this work
we prove the result unconditionally. For independent sets in 2-colorable 3-uniform hypergaphs
we prove the first strong hardness result, albeit assuming the d-to-1 Games Conjecture. Our result
on almost 2-colorable 4-uniform hypergraphs gives the first nearly polynomial hardness factor
for independent set in hypergraphs which are (almost) colorable with constantly many colors. It
partially bridges the gap between the previous best lower bound of poly(log n) and the algorithmic
upper bounds of n^{Omega(1)}.
