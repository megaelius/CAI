Smart home environments equipped with distributed sensor networks are capable of helping people
by providing services related to health, emergency detection or daily routine management. A backbone
to these systems relies often on the system's ability to track and detect activities performed by
the users in their home. Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition in smart
homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the number of occupants in the home
at any given moment of time is always known. Estimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each
time step remains a challenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which are
based on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home are often very simple
and do not offer individually a good overview of the situation. The data gathered needs therefore
to be fused in order to infer useful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and
presents a probabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in the environment at each
time step. This approach works in two steps: first, an estimate of the number of persons present in
the environment is done using a Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of
the sensor network and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a Hidden Markov Model
refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related to the sensors. Using both simulated
and real data, our method has been tested and validated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration
and demonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.
