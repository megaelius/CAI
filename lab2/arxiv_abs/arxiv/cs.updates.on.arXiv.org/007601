The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas such as smart-contracts,
Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, supply chain management, storing medical data, and identity
management. Although the Github currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software
(BCS) projects, few software engineering research has investigated these projects and its' contributors.
Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs
of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand
the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS
and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified
via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses
that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are
experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized
financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature,
more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development
as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects.
Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological
complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. Software development tools
that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of
new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts,
testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.
