During the last two decades, Genetic Programming (GP) has been largely used to tackle optimization,
classification, and automatic features selection related tasks. The widespread use of GP is mainly
due to its flexible and comprehensible tree-type structure. Similarly, research is also gaining
momentum in the field of Image Processing (IP) because of its promising results over wide areas of
applications ranging from medical IP to multispectral imaging. IP is mainly involved in applications
such as computer vision, pattern recognition, image compression, storage and transmission, and
medical diagnostics. This prevailing nature of images and their associated algorithm i.e complexities
gave an impetus to the exploration of GP. GP has thus been used in different ways for IP since its inception.
Many interesting GP techniques have been developed and employed in the field of IP. To give the research
community an extensive view of these techniques, this paper presents the diverse applications
of GP in IP and provides useful resources for further research. Also, comparison of different parameters
used in ten different applications of IP are summarized in tabular form. Moreover, analysis of different
parameters used in IP related tasks is carried-out to save the time needed in future for evaluating
the parameters of GP. As more advancement is made in GP methodologies, its success in solving complex
tasks not only related to IP but also in other fields will increase. Additionally, guidelines are
provided for applying GP in IP related tasks, pros and cons of GP techniques are discussed, and some
future directions are also set.
