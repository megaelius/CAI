Finding locally optimal solutions for max-cut and max-$k$-cut are well-known PLS-complete problems.
An instinctive approach to finding such a locally optimum solution is the FLIP method. Even though
FLIP requires exponential time in worst-case instances, it tends to terminate quickly in practical
instances. To explain this discrepancy, the run-time of FLIP has been studied in the smoothed complexity
framework. Etscheid and R\"{o}glin showed that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-cut in arbitrary
graphs is quasi-polynomial. Angel, Bubeck, Peres, and Wei showed that the smoothed complexity
of FLIP for max-cut in complete graphs is $O(\phi^5n^{15.1})$, where $\phi$ is an upper bound on
the random edge-weight density and $n$ is the number of vertices in the input graph. While Angel et
al.'s result showed the first polynomial smoothed complexity, they also conjectured that their
run-time bound is far from optimal. In this work, we make substantial progress towards improving
the run-time bound. We prove that the smoothed complexity of FLIP in complete graphs is $O(\phi n^{7.83})$.
Our results are based on a carefully chosen matrix whose rank captures the run-time of the method
along with improved rank bounds for this matrix and an improved union bound based on this matrix.
In addition, our techniques provide a general framework for analyzing FLIP in the smoothed framework.
We illustrate this general framework by showing that the smoothed complexity of FLIP for max-$3$-cut
in complete graphs is polynomial and for max-$k$-cut in arbitrary graphs is quasi-polynomial.
We believe that our techniques should also be of interest towards addressing the smoothed complexity
of FLIP for max-$k$-cut in complete graphs for larger constants $k$.
