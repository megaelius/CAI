Emerging wireless services such as augmented reality require next-generation wireless networks
to support ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), while also guaranteeing high
data rates. Existing wireless networks that solely rely on the scarce sub-6 GHz, microwave ($\mu$W)
frequency bands will be unable to meet the low-latency, high capacity requirements of future wireless
services. Meanwhile, operating at high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) bands is seen as an
attractive solution, primarily due to the bandwidth availability and possibility of large-scale
multi-antenna communication. However, even though leveraging the large bandwidth at mmWave frequencies
can potentially boost the wireless capacity and reduce the transmission delay for low-latency
applications, mmWave communication is inherently unreliable due to its susceptibility to blockage,
high path loss, and channel uncertainty. Hence, to provide URLLC and high-speed wireless access,
it is desirable to seamlessly integrate the reliability of $\mu$W networks with the high capacity
of mmWave networks. To this end, in this paper, the first comprehensive tutorial for integrated
mmWave-$\mu$W communications is introduced. This envisioned integrated design will enable wireless
networks to achieve URLLC along with high data rates by leveraging the best of two worlds: reliable,
long-range communications at the $\mu$W bands and directional high-speed communications at the
mmWave frequencies. To achieve this goal, key solution concepts are developed that include new
architectures for the radio interface, URLLC-aware frame structure and resource allocation methods
along with learning techniques, as well as mobility management, to realize the potential of integrated
mmWave-$\mu$W communications. The opportunities and challenges of each proposed scheme are discussed
and key results are presented.
