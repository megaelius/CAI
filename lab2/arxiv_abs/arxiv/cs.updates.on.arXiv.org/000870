Fundamental local symmetry breaking problems such as Maximal Independent Set (MIS) and coloring
have been recognized as important by the community, and studied extensively in (standard) graphs.
In particular, fast (i.e., logarithmic run time) randomized algorithms are well-established
for MIS and $\Delta +1$-coloring in both the LOCAL and CONGEST distributed computing models. On
the other hand, comparatively much less is known on the complexity of distributed symmetry breaking
in {\em hypergraphs}. In particular, a key question is whether a fast (randomized) algorithm for
MIS exists for hypergraphs. In this paper, we study the distributed complexity of symmetry breaking
in hypergraphs by presenting distributed randomized algorithms for a variety of fundamental problems
under a natural distributed computing model for hypergraphs. We first show that MIS in hypergraphs
(of arbitrary dimension) can be solved in $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds ($n$ is the number of nodes of the hypergraph)
in the LOCAL model. We then present a key result of this paper --- an $O(\Delta^{\epsilon}\text{polylog}(n))$-round
hypergraph MIS algorithm in the CONGEST model where $\Delta$ is the maximum node degree of the hypergraph
and $\epsilon > 0$ is any arbitrarily small constant. To demonstrate the usefulness of hypergraph
MIS, we present applications of our hypergraph algorithm to solving problems in (standard) graphs.
In particular, the hypergraph MIS yields fast distributed algorithms for the {\em balanced minimal
dominating set} problem (left open in Harris et al. [ICALP 2013]) and the {\em minimal connected
dominating set problem}. We also present distributed algorithms for coloring, maximal matching,
and maximal clique in hypergraphs.
