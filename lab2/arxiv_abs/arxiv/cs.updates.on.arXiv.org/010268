Computed Tomography (CT) is a non-invasive imaging modality with applications ranging from healthcare
to security. It reconstructs cross-sectional images of an object using a collection of projection
data collected at different angles. Conventional methods, such as FBP, require that the projection
data be uniformly acquired over the complete angular range. In some applications, it is not possible
to acquire such data. Security is one such domain where non-rotational scanning configurations
are being developed which violate the complete data assumption. Conventional methods produce
images from such data that are filled with artifacts. The recent success of deep learning (DL) methods
has inspired researchers to post-process these artifact laden images using deep neural networks
(DNNs). This approach has seen limited success on real CT problems. Another approach has been to
pre-process the incomplete data using DNNs aiming to avoid the creation of artifacts altogether.
Due to imperfections in the learning process, this approach can still leave perceptible residual
artifacts. In this work, we aim to combine the power of deep learning in both the data and image domains
through a two-step process based on the consensus equilibrium (CE) framework. Specifically, we
use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) in both the data and the image domain for
enhanced performance and efficient computation and combine them through a consensus process.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real security CT dataset for a challenging
90 degree limited-angle problem. The same framework can be applied to other limited data problems
arising in applications such as electron microscopy, non-destructive evaluation, and medical
imaging.
