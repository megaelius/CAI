In Part I of this paper series, several macroscopic traffic model elements for mathematically describing
freeway networks equipped with managed lane facilities were proposed. These modeling techniques
seek to capture at the macroscopic the complex phenomena that occur on managed lane-freeway networks,
where two parallel traffic flows interact with each other both in the physical sense (how and where
cars flow between the two lane groups) and the physiological sense (how driving behaviors are changed
by being adjacent to a quantitatively and qualitatively different traffic flow). The local descriptions
we developed in Part I are not the only modeling complexity introduced in managed lane-freeway networks.
The complex topologies mean that network-scale modeling of a freeway corridor is increased in complexity
as well. The already-difficult model calibration problem for a dynamic model of a freeway becomes
more complex when the freeway becomes, in effect, two interrelating flow streams. In the present
paper, we present an iterative-learning-based approach to calibrating our model's physical and
driver-behavioral parameters. We consider the common situation where a complex traffic model
needs to be calibrated to recreate real-world baseline traffic behavior, such that counterfactuals
can be generated by training purposes. Our method is used to identify traditional freeway parameters
as well as the proposed parameters that describe managed lane-freeway-network-specific behaviors.
We validate our model and calibration methodology with case studies of simulations of two managed
lane-equipped California freeways.
