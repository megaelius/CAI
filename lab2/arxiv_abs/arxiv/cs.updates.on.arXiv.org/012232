Geo-social group search aims to find a group of people proximate to a location while socially related.
One of the driven applications for geo-social group search is organizing an impromptu activity.
This is because the social cohesiveness of a found geo-social group ensures a good communication
atmosphere and the spatial closeness of the geo-social group reduces the preparation time for the
activity. Most existing works treat geo-social group search as a problem that finds a group satisfying
a single social constraint while optimizing the spatial proximity. However, when an impromptu
activity has additional demands on attendees, e.g., the activity requires that the attendees have
certain set of skills, the existing works cannot find an effective geo-social group efficiently.
In this paper, we study how to find a group that is most proximate to a query location while satisfying
multiple constraints. Specifically, the multiple constraints on which we focus include social
constraint, size constraint and keyword constraint. We propose a novel search framework which
first effectively narrows down the search space with theoretical guarantees and then efficiently
finds the optimum result. Although our model considers multiple constraints, novel techniques
devised in this paper ensure that search cost is equivalent to parameterized constant times of one
time social constraint checking on a vastly restricted search space. We conduct extensive experiments
on both real and semi-synthetic datasets for demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed search
algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness, we conduct two case studies on real datasets, demonstrating
the superiority of our proposed model.
