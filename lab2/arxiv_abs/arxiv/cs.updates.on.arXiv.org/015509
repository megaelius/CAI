Hardware security has risen in prominence in recent years with concerns stemming from a globalizing
semiconductor supply chain and increased third-party IP (intellectual property) usage. Trojan
detection is of paramount importance for ensuring systems with confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. Existing methods for hardware Trojan detection in FPGA (field programmable gate
array) devices include test-time methods, pre-implementation methods, and run-time methods.
The first two methods provide effective ways of detecting some Trojans; however, Trojans may be
specifically designed to avoid detection at test-time or before implementation making run-time
detection a more attractive option. Run-time detection and removal of Trojans is highly desirable
due to the wide range of critical systems which are deployed on FPGAs and may be difficult or costly
to remove from operation. Many parallels can be drawn between hardware and natural systems, and
one example creates an analogy between hardware attacks and biological attacks. We propose a CRISPR-Cas-inspired
(clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) method for detecting hardware Trojans
in FPGAs. The fundamental concepts of the Type 1-E CRISPR-Cas mechanism are discussed and simulated
to predict the flow of genetic information through this biological system. The basic structure
of this system is utilized to propose a novel run-time Trojan detection method titled CADEFT (CRISPR-Cas-based
Algorithm for DEtection of FPGA Trojans). Different levels of FPGA application design flow are
explored, and CADEFT is proposed for realization at the bitstream level to monitor the configuration
bitstream and the run-time properties of the FPGA. The flexibility of CADEFT originates in the CRISPR-Cas
mechanism's ability to recognize similar albeit previously unseen patterns which may pose a threat
to the system.
