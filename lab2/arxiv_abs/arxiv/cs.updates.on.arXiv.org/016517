In this work, we study constrained submodular maximization problems and design algorithms that
improve the state-of-the-art performance guarantees. We first present a linear query complexity
algorithm that achieves the approximation ratio of $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ for cardinality constraint
and monotone objective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deterministic algorithm
that achieves the almost optimal approximation using linear number of function evaluations. We
next study the single knapsack constraint and achieve an approximation of $(7/16-\varepsilon)$
by $O(n\cdot \max\{\varepsilon^{-1},\log\log n\})$ queries. We note that in streaming setting
our algorithm only requires two passes over the stream. The double logarithmic factor comes from
our \emph{adaptive decreasing threshold} algorithm that is used to obtain a constant approximation
of the optimal objective value. Furthermore, we show that there is an $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-approximate
deterministic algorithm for constant number of binary packing constraints, which only makes $O_{\varepsilon}(\log
\log n)$ queries per element. Lastly we present an improved algorithm for the intersection of $p$-system
and $d$ knapsack constraint, which achieves an approximation ratio of $1/(p+\frac{7}{4}d+1)-\varepsilon$.
In addition, a similar result can be obtained for non-monotone objective function. Query complexity
lower bound of submodular maximization problems is also studied in this paper. We show that there
exists no (randomized) $(1/4+\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm using $o(n/\log n)$ queries
for unconstrained submodular maximization. Combining with existing results, we present a complete
characterization of the query complexity of unconstrained submodular maximization.
