Operating a modern power grid reliably in case of SCADA/EMS failure or amid difficult times like
COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging task for grid operators. In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation
dispatch scheme has been proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing;
however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for computing and
communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises server and dispatch communication
system, proposes and implements a cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation
continuity regardless of local infrastructure's availability and accessibility. Through its
prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution has demonstrated two
major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is independent and fault-tolerant, providing
grid monitoring and control capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or
when operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the overall design
is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks
to "serverless", the burden of the server provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user
side. The cost of using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is architected
and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model. This work also
develops a comprehensive cyber security mechanism to comply with critical infrastructure requirements
for the power grid, which can serve as an exemplary framework for other grid operators to secure their
cloud services.
