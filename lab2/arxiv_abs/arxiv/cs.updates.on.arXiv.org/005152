Sampling of bandlimited graph signals has well-documented merits for dimensionality reduction,
affordable storage, and online processing of streaming network data. Most existing sampling methods
are designed to minimize the error incurred when reconstructing the original signal from its samples.
Oftentimes these parsimonious signals serve as inputs to computationally-intensive linear operators
(e.g., graph filters and transforms). Hence, interest shifts from reconstructing the signal itself
towards approximating the output of the prescribed linear operator efficiently. In this context,
we propose a novel sampling scheme that leverages the bandlimitedness of the input as well as the
transformation whose output we wish to approximate. We formulate problems to jointly optimize
sample selection and a sketch of the target linear transformation, so when the latter is affordably
applied to the sampled input signal the result is close to the desired output. These designs are carried
out off line, and several heuristic solvers are proposed to accommodate high-dimensional problems,
especially when computational resources are at a premium. Similar sketching as sampling ideas
are also shown effective in the context of linear inverse problems. The developed sampling plus
reduced-complexity processing pipeline is particularly useful for data that reside on a low-dimensional
subspace and is acquired in a streaming fashion, where the linear transform has to be applied fast
and repeatedly to successive inputs or response signals. Numerical tests showing the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithms include classification of handwritten digits from as few as 20 out of
784 pixels in the input images and selection of sensors from a network deployed to carry out a distributed
parameter estimation task.
