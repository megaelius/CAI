Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have plagued the Internet for decades, but defenses
have not fundamentally outpaced attackers. Instead, the size and rate of growth in attacks have
actually outpaced carriers' and DDoS mitigation services' growth. In this paper, we comprehensively
examine ways in which Named Data Networking (NDN), a proposed data-centric Internet architecture,
fundamentally addresses some of the principle weaknesses in today's DDoS defenses in IP networking.
We argue that NDN's architectural changes (even when incrementally deployed) can make DDoS attacks
fundamentally more difficult to launch and less effective. We present a new DDoS mitigation solution
-- Fine-grained Interest Traffic Throttling FITT, to leverage NDN's features to combat DDoS in
the Internet of Things (IoT) age. FITT enables the network to detect DDoS directly from feedback
from victims, throttle DDoS traffic along its exact path in the network, and perform reinforcement
control over the misbehaving entities at their sources. In cases like the Mirai attacks, where smart
IoT devices (smart cameras, refrigerators, etc.) were able to cripple high-capacity service providers
using diverse DDoS Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), FITT would be able to precisely squelch
the attack traffic at its distributed sources, without disrupting other legitimate application
traffic running on the same devices. FITT offers an incrementally deployable solution for service
providers to effectuate the application-level remediation at the sources, which remains unattainable
in today's DDoS market. Our extensive simulations results show that FITT can effectively throttle
attack traffic in a short time and achieve over 99% legitimate traffic.
