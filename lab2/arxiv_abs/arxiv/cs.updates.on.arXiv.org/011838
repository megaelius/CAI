As the ongoing rapid urbanization takes place with an ever-increasing speed, fully modeling urban
dynamics becomes more and more challenging, but also a necessity for socioeconomic development.
It is challenging because human activities and constructions are ubiquitous; urban landscape
and life content change anywhere and anytime. It's crucial due to the fact that only up-to-date urban
dynamics can enable governors to optimize their city planning strategy and help individuals organize
their daily lives in a more efficient way. Previous geographic topic model based methods attempt
to solve this problem but suffer from high computational cost and memory consumption, limiting
their scalability to city level applications. Also, strong prior assumptions make such models
fail to capture certain patterns by nature. To bridge the gap, we propose Macross, a metapath guided
embedding approach to jointly model location, time and text information. Given a dataset of geo-tagged
social media posts, we extract and aggregate location and time and construct a heterogeneous information
network using the aggregated space and time. Metapath2vec based approach is used to construct vector
representations for times, locations and frequent words such that co-occurrence pairs of nodes
are closer in latent space. The vector representations will be used to infer related time, locations
or keywords for a user query. Experiments done on enormous datasets show our model can generate comparable
if not better quality query results compared to state of the art models and outperform some cutting-edge
models for activity recovery and classification.
