Machine learning has become a critical component of modern data-driven online services. Typically,
the training phase of machine learning techniques requires to process large-scale datasets which
may contain private and sensitive information of customers. This imposes significant security
risks since modern online services rely on cloud computing to store and process the sensitive data.
In the untrusted computing infrastructure, security is becoming a paramount concern since the
customers need to trust the thirdparty cloud provider. Unfortunately, this trust has been violated
multiple times in the past. To overcome the potential security risks in the cloud, we answer the following
research question: how to enable secure executions of machine learning computations in the untrusted
infrastructure? To achieve this goal, we propose a hardware-assisted approach based on Trusted
Execution Environments (TEEs), specifically Intel SGX, to enable secure execution of the machine
learning computations over the private and sensitive datasets. More specifically, we propose
a generic and secure machine learning framework based on Tensorflow, which enables secure execution
of existing applications on the commodity untrusted infrastructure. In particular, we have built
our system called TensorSCONE from ground-up by integrating TensorFlow with SCONE, a shielded
execution framework based on Intel SGX. The main challenge of this work is to overcome the architectural
limitations of Intel SGX in the context of building a secure TensorFlow system. Our evaluation shows
that we achieve reasonable performance overheads while providing strong security properties
with low TCB.
