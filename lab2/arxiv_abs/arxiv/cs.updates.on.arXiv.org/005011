This paper presents a robust and efficient method for tracking topological features in time-varying
scalar data. Structures are tracked based on the optimal matching between persistence diagrams
with respect to the Wasserstein metric. This fundamentally relies on solving the assignment problem,
a special case of optimal transport, for all consecutive timesteps. Our approach relies on two main
contributions. First, we revisit the seminal assignment algorithm by Kuhn and Munkres which we
specifically adapt to the problem of matching persistence diagrams in an efficient way. Second,
we propose an extension of the Wasserstein metric that significantly improves the geometrical
stability of the matching of domain-embedded persistence pairs. We show that this geometrical
lifting has the additional positive side-effect of improving the assignment matrix sparsity and
therefore computing time. The global framework implements a coarse-grained parallelism by computing
persistence diagrams and finding optimal matchings in parallel for every couple of consecutive
timesteps. Critical trajectories are constructed by associating successively matched persistence
pairs over time. Merging and splitting events are detected with a geometrical threshold in a post-processing
stage. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets show that our matching approach is an order
of magnitude faster than the seminal Munkres algorithm. Moreover, compared to a modern approximation
method, our method provides competitive runtimes while yielding exact results. We demonstrate
the utility of our global framework by extracting critical point trajectories from various simulated
time-varying datasets and compare it to the existing methods based on associated overlaps of volumes.
Robustness to noise and temporal resolution downsampling is empirically demonstrated.
