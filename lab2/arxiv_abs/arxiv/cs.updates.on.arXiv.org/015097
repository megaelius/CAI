The society as a whole, and many vertical sectors in particular, is becoming increasingly digitalized.
Machine Type Communication (MTC), encompassing its massive and critical aspects, and ubiquitous
wireless connectivity are among the main enablers of such digitization at large. The recently introduced
5G New Radio is natively designed to support both aspects of MTC to promote the digital transformation
of the society. However, it is evident that some of the more demanding requirements cannot be fully
supported by 5G networks. Alongside, further development of the society towards 2030 will give
rise to new and more stringent requirements on wireless connectivity in general, and MTC in particular.
Driven by the societal trends towards 2030, the next generation (6G) will be an agile and efficient
convergent network serving a set of diverse service classes and a wide range of key performance indicators
(KPI). This white paper explores the main drivers and requirements of an MTC-optimized 6G network,
and discusses the following six key research questions: - Will the main KPIs of 5G continue to be the
dominant KPIs in 6G; or will there emerge new key metrics? - How to deliver different E2E service mandates
with different KPI requirements considering joint-optimization at the physical up to the application
layer? - What are the key enablers towards designing ultra-low power receivers and highly efficient
sleep modes? - How to tackle a disruptive rather than incremental joint design of a massively scalable
waveform and medium access policy for global MTC connectivity? - How to support new service classes
characterizing mission-critical and dependable MTC in 6G? - What are the potential enablers of
long term, lightweight and flexible privacy and security schemes considering MTC device requirements?
