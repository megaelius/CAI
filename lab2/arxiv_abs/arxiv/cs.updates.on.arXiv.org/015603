The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, a most critical system the Internet depends on, has
recently been the target for different DDoS and other cyber-attacks, e.g., the notorious Mirai
botnet. While these attacks can be destructive to both recursive and authoritative DNS servers,
little is known about how recursive resolvers operate under such attacks (e.g., NXDomain, water-torture).
In this paper, we point out a new vulnerability and show an attack, the NXNSAttack, that exploits
the way DNS recursive resolvers operate when receiving NS referral response that contains name-servers
but without their corresponding IP addresses (i.e., missing glue-records). We show that the number
of DNS messages exchanged in a typical resolution process might be much higher in practice than what
is expected in theory, mainly due to a proactive resolution of name-servers' IP addresses. We show
how this inefficiency becomes a bottleneck and might be used to mount a devastating attack against
either or both, recursive resolvers and authoritative servers. The NXNSAttack is more effective
than the NXDomain attack: i) It reaches an amplification factor of more than 1620x on the number of
packets exchanged by the recursive resolver. ii) Besides the negative cache, the attack also saturates
the `NS' resolver caches. In an attempt to mitigate the attack impact, we propose enhancements to
the recursive resolvers algorithm to prevent unnecessary proactive fetches. Finally, we implement
our Max1Fetch enhancement on the BIND resolver and show that Max1Fetch does not degrade the recursive
resolvers performance, throughput and latency, by testing it on real-world traffic data-sets.
