In today's blockchain system, designing a secure and high throughput on par with centralized payment
system is a difficulty task. Sharding is one of the most worth expecting technologies to improve
the system throughput when maintain high security level. However, the previous works have two main
limitations: Firstly, the throughput of their random-based sharding system is not high enough
due to not leveraging the heterogeneity among validators. Secondly, the incentive mechanism can
be a huge overhead on their system without an appropriate scheme. We propose RepChain, a reputation-based
secure, high incentive and fast blockchain system via sharding. RepChain utilizes reputation
to explicitly characterize the heterogeneity among the validators and lay the foundation for the
incentive mechanism. We novelly propose the double-chain architecture that including transaction
chain and reputation chain. For transaction chain, a Raft-based Byzantine fault tolerant synchronous
consensus with high resiliency and high throughput has been presented. For reputation chain, the
collective signing has been utilized to achieve consensus on the reputation score and support the
high throughput transaction chain with moderate generation speed. Moreover, we propose a reputation
based sharding and leader selection scheme. To analyze the security of RepChain, we propose a recursive
formula to calculate the epoch security within only O(km^2) time. Further more, we implement and
evaluate RepChain on Amazon Web Service platform. The results show our solution can enhance both
throughout and security level of the existing sharding-based blockchain system.
