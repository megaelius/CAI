A novel head-mounted virtual immersive/interactive reality environment (VIRE) is utilized to
evaluate the behaviour of participants in three pedestrian road crossing conditions while 1) not
distracted, 2) distracted with a smartphone, and 3) distracted with a smartphone with a virtually
implemented safety measure on the road. Forty-two volunteers participated in our research who
completed thirty successful (complete crossing) trials in blocks of ten trials for each crossing
condition. For the two distracted conditions, pedestrians are engaged in a maze-solving game on
a virtual smartphone, while at the same time checking the traffic for a safe crossing gap. For the
proposed safety measure, smart flashing and color changing LED lights are simulated on the crosswalk
to warn the distracted pedestrian who initiates crossing. Surrogate safety measures as well as
speed information and distraction attributes such as direction and orientation of participant's
head were collected and evaluated by employing a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. Results from the
model indicate that females have more dangerous crossing behaviour especially in distracted conditions;
however, the smart LED treatment reduces this negative impact. Moreover, the number of times and
the percentage of duration the head was facing the smartphone during a trial and a waiting time respectively
increase the possibility of unsafe crossings; though, the proposed treatment reduces the safety
crossing rate. Hence, our study shows that the smart LED light safety treatment indeed improves
the safety of distracted pedestrians and enhances the successful crossing rate.
