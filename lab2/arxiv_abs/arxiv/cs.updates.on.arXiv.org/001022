\textit{Drosophila melanogaster} has been established as a model organism for investigating
the fundamental principles of developmental gene interactions. The gene expression patterns
of \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} can be documented as digital images, which are annotated
with anatomical ontology terms to facilitate pattern discovery and comparison. The automated
annotation of gene expression pattern images has received increasing attention due to the recent
expansion of the image database. The effectiveness of gene expression pattern annotation relies
on the quality of feature representation. Previous studies have demonstrated that sparse coding
is effective for extracting features from gene expression images. However, solving sparse coding
remains a computationally challenging problem, especially when dealing with large-scale data
sets and learning large size dictionaries. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the
sparse coding problem, called Stochastic Coordinate Coding (SCC). The proposed algorithm alternatively
updates the sparse codes via just a few steps of coordinate descent and updates the dictionary via
second order stochastic gradient descent. The computational cost is further reduced by focusing
on the non-zero components of the sparse codes and the corresponding columns of the dictionary only
in the updating procedure. Thus, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency
and the scalability, making sparse coding applicable for large-scale data sets and large dictionary
sizes. Our experiments on Drosophila gene expression data sets demonstrate the efficiency and
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
