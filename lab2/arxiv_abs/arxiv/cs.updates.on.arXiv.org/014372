The rapid growth in biological sequence data is revolutionizing our understanding of genotypic
diversity and challenging conventional approaches to informatics. With the increasing availability
of genomic data, traditional bioinformatic tools require substantial computational time and
the creation of ever-larger indices each time a researcher seeks to gain insight from the data. To
address these challenges, we pre-computed important relationships between biological entities
spanning the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and captured this information in a relational database.
The database can be queried across hundreds of millions of entities and returns results in a fraction
of the time required by traditional methods. In this paper, we describe \textit{IBM Functional
Genomics Platform} (formerly known as OMXWare), a comprehensive database relating genotype to
phenotype for bacterial life. Continually updated, IBM Functional Genomics Platform today contains
data derived from 200,000 curated, self-consistently assembled genomes. The database stores
functional data for over 68 million genes, 52 million proteins, and 239 million domains with associated
biological activity annotations from Gene Ontology, KEGG, MetaCyc, and Reactome. IBM Functional
Genomics Platform maps all of the many-to-many connections between each biological entity including
the originating genome, gene, protein, and protein domain. Various microbial studies, from infectious
disease to environmental health, can benefit from the rich data and connections. We describe the
data selection, the pipeline to create and update the IBM Functional Genomics Platform, and the
developer tools (Python SDK and REST APIs) which allow researchers to efficiently study microbial
life at scale.
