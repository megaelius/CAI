Given an undirected weighted graph $G(V,E)$, a subsetwise sparsifier over a terminal set $T\subset
V$ is a subgraph $G'$ having a certain structure which connects the terminals. Examples are Steiner
trees (minimal-weight trees spanning $T$) and subsetwise spanners (subgraphs $G'(V',E')$ such
that for given $\alpha,\beta\geq1$, $d_{G'}(u,v)\leq \alpha d_{G}(u,v)+\beta$ for $u,v\in
T$). Multi-level subsetwise sparsifiers are generalizations in which terminal vertices require
different levels or grades of service. This paper gives a flexible approximation algorithm for
several multi-level subsetwise sparsifier problems, including multi-level graph spanners,
Steiner trees, and $k$--connected subgraphs. The algorithm relies on computing an approximation
to the single level instance of the problem% and an efficient approach to obtain a multi-level solution.
For the subsetwise spanner problem, there are few existing approximation algorithms for even a
single level; consequently we give a new polynomial time algorithm for computing a subsetwise spanner
for a single level. Specifically, we show that for $k\in\N$, $\eps>0$, and $T\subset V$, there is
a subsetwise $(2k-1)(1+\eps)$--spanner with total weight $O(|T|^\frac1kW(\ST(G,T)))$, where
$W(\ST(G,T))$ is the weight of the Steiner tree of $G$ over the subset $T$. This is the first algorithm
and corresponding weight guarantee for a multiplicative subsetwise spanner for nonplanar graphs.
We also generalize a result of Klein to give a constant approximation to the multi-level subsetwise
spanner problem for planar graphs. Additionally, we give a polynomial-size ILP for optimally computing
pairwise spanners of arbitrary distortion (beyond linear distortion functions), and provide
experiments to illustrate the performance of our algorithms.
