Despite significant research efforts, the state-of-the-art algorithm for maintaining an approximate
matching in fully dynamic graphs has a polynomial {worst-case} update time, even for very poor approximation
guarantees. In a recent breakthrough, Bhattacharya, Henzinger and Nanongkai showed how to maintain
a constant approximation to the minimum vertex cover, and thus also a constant-factor estimate
of the maximum matching size, with polylogarithmic worst-case update time. Later (in SODA'17 Proc.)
they improved the approximation factor all the way to $2+\epsilon$. Nevertheless, the longstanding
fundamental problem of {maintaining} an approximate matching with sub-polynomial worst-case
time bounds remained open. We present a randomized algorithm for maintaining an {almost-maximal}
matching in fully dynamic graphs with polylogarithmic worst-case update time. Such a matching
provides $(2+\epsilon)$-approximations for both the maximum matching and the minimum vertex
cover, for any $\epsilon > 0$. Our result was done independently of the $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation
result of Bhattacharya et al., so it provides the first $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for minimum
vertex cover (together with Bhattacharya et al.'s result) and the first $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation
for maximum (integral) matching. The polylogarithmic worst-case update time of our algorithm
holds deterministically, while the almost-maximality guarantee holds with high probability.
This result not only settles the aforementioned problem on dynamic matchings, but also provides
essentially the best possible approximation guarantee for dynamic vertex cover (assuming the
unique games conjecture).
