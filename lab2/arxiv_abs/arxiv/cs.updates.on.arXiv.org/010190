In recent years, the energy-water nexus literature has recognized that the electricity and water
infrastructure that enable the production, distribution, and consumption of these two commodities
is fundamentally intertwined. Electric power is used to produce, treat, distribute, and recycle
water while water is used to generate and consume electricity. In the meantime, significant attention
has been given to renewable energy integration within the context of global climate change. While
these two issues may seem unrelated, their resolution is potentially synergistic in that renewable
energy technologies not only present low CO2 emissions but also low water-intensities. Furthermore,
because water is readily stored, it has the potential to act as a flexible energy resource on both
the supply and the demand-side of the electricity grid. Despite these synergies, the renewable
energy integration and energy-water nexus literature have yet to methodologically converge to
systematically address potential synergies. This paper advances an enterprise control methodology
as a means of assessing the techno-economic performance of the energy water nexus. The enterprise
control methodology has been developed in recent years to advance the methodological state of the
art of renewable energy integration studies and used recently to carry out a full-scale study for
the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England system. The methodology quantifies day-ahead
and real-time energy market production costs, dispatched energy mixes, required operating reserves,
levels of curtailment, and grid imbalances. This energy-water nexus methodological extension
now includes flexible water-energy resources within the grid's energy resource portfolio and
quantifies the amounts of water withdrawn and consumed. The simulation methodology is demonstrated
on a modified version of the RTS-96 (RTS-GMLC) test case.
