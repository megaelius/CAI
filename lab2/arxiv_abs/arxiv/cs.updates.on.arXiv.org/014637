Information granules have been considered to be the fundamental constructs of Granular Computing
(GrC). As a useful unsupervised learning technique, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is one of the most frequently
used methods to construct information granules. The FCM-based granulation-degranulation mechanism
plays a pivotal role in GrC. In this paper, to enhance the quality of the degranulation (reconstruction)
process, we augment the FCM-based degranulation mechanism by introducing a vector of fuzzification
factors (fuzzification factor vector) and setting up an adjustment mechanism to modify the prototypes
and the partition matrix. The design is regarded as an optimization problem, which is guided by a
reconstruction criterion. In the proposed scheme, the initial partition matrix and prototypes
are generated by the FCM. Then a fuzzification factor vector is introduced to form an appropriate
fuzzification factor for each cluster to build up an adjustment scheme of modifying the prototypes
and the partition matrix. With the supervised learning mode of the granulation-degranulation
process, we construct a composite objective function of the fuzzification factor vector, the prototypes
and the partition matrix. Subsequently, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to optimize
the fuzzification factor vector to refine the prototypes and develop the optimal partition matrix.
Finally, the reconstruction performance of the FCM algorithm is enhanced. We offer a thorough analysis
of the developed scheme. In particular, we show that the classical FCM algorithm forms a special
case of the proposed scheme. Experiments completed for both synthetic and publicly available datasets
show that the proposed approach outperforms the generic data reconstruction approach.
