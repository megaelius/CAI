Context: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published
(formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers
and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and -practice in a given
area. Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, given the facts
that several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the
search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful
for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies
in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from three inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines
in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our
own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context
of three examples MLRs as running examples (two from SE and one MLR from the medical sciences). Results:
The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning
phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe
that incorporating and adopting a vast set of recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience
papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion:
Having been developed on the basis of three types of solid experience and evidence, the provided
MLR guidelines support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area
of SE.
