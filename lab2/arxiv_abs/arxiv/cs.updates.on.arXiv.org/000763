We study randomized and quantum efficiency lower bounds in communication complexity. These arise
from the study of zero-communication protocols in which players are allowed to abort. Our scenario
is inspired by the physics setup of Bell experiments, where two players share a predefined entangled
state but are not allowed to communicate. Each is given a measurement as input, which they perform
on their share of the system. The outcomes of the measurements should follow a distribution predicted
by quantum mechanics; however, in practice, the detectors may fail to produce an output in some of
the runs. The efficiency of the experiment is the probability that the experiment succeeds (neither
of the detectors fails). When the players share a quantum state, this gives rise to a new bound on quantum
communication complexity (eff*) that subsumes the factorization norm. When players share randomness
instead of a quantum state, the efficiency bound (eff), coincides with the partition bound of Jain
and Klauck. This is one of the strongest lower bounds known for randomized communication complexity,
which subsumes all the known combinatorial and algebraic methods including the rectangle (corruption)
bound, the factorization norm, and discrepancy. The lower bound is formulated as a convex optimization
problem. In practice, the dual form is more feasible to use, and we show that it amounts to constructing
an explicit Bell inequality (for eff) or Tsirelson inequality (for eff*). We give an example of a
quantum distribution where the violation can be exponentially bigger than the previously studied
class of normalized Bell inequalities. For one-way communication, we show that the quantum one-way
partition bound is tight for classical communication with shared entanglement up to arbitrarily
small error.
