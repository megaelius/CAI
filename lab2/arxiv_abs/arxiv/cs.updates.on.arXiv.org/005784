Camera pose estimation is an important problem in computer vision. Common techniques either match
the current image against keyframes with known poses, directly regress the pose, or establish correspondences
between keypoints in the image and points in the scene to estimate the pose. In recent years, regression
forests have become a popular alternative to establish such correspondences. They achieve accurate
results, but have traditionally needed to be trained offline on the target scene, preventing relocalisation
in new environments. Recently, we showed how to circumvent this limitation by adapting a pre-trained
forest to a new scene on the fly. The adapted forests achieved relocalisation performance that was
on par with that of offline forests, and our approach was able to estimate the camera pose in close
to real time. In this paper, we present an extension of this work that achieves significantly better
relocalisation performance whilst running fully in real time. To achieve this, we make several
changes to the original approach: (i) instead of accepting the camera pose hypothesis without question,
we make it possible to score the final few hypotheses using a geometric approach and select the most
promising; (ii) we chain several instantiations of our relocaliser together in a cascade, allowing
us to try faster but less accurate relocalisation first, only falling back to slower, more accurate
relocalisation as necessary; and (iii) we tune the parameters of our cascade to achieve effective
overall performance. These changes allow us to significantly improve upon the performance our
original state-of-the-art method was able to achieve on the well-known 7-Scenes and Stanford 4
Scenes benchmarks. As additional contributions, we present a way of visualising the internal behaviour
of our forests and show how to entirely circumvent the need to pre-train a forest on a generic scene.
