Networks are commonly used to define underlying interaction structures where infections, information,
or other quantities may spread. Although the standard approach has been to aggregate all links into
a static structure, some studies suggest that the time order in which the links are established may
alter the dynamics of spreading. In this paper, we study the impact of the time ordering in the limits
of flow on various empirical temporal networks. By using a random walk dynamics, we estimate the
flow on links and convert the original undirected network (temporal and static) into a directed
flow network. We then introduce the concept of flow motifs and quantify the divergence in the representativity
of motifs when using the temporal and static frameworks. We find that the regularity of contacts
and persistence of vertices (common in email communication and face-to-face interactions) result
on little differences in the limits of flow for both frameworks. On the other hand, in the case of communication
within a dating site (and of a sexual network), the flow between vertices changes significantly
in the temporal framework such that the static approximation poorly represents the structure of
contacts. We have also observed that cliques with 3 and 4 vertices con- taining only low-flow links
are more represented than the same cliques with all high-flow links. The representativity of these
low-flow cliques is higher in the temporal framework. Our results suggest that the flow between
vertices connected in cliques depend on the topological context in which they are placed and in the
time sequence in which the links are established. The structure of the clique alone does not completely
characterize the potential of flow between the vertices.
