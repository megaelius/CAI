I extend the traditional SAR, which has achieved status of ecological law and plays a critical role
in global biodiversity assessment, to the general (alpha- or beta-diversity in Hill numbers) diversity
area relationship (DAR). The extension was motivated to remedy the limitation of traditional SAR
that only address one aspect of biodiversity scaling, i.e., species richness scaling over space.
The extension was made possible by the fact that all Hill numbers are in units of species (referred
to as the effective number of species or as species equivalents), and I postulated that Hill numbers
should follow the same or similar pattern of SAR. I selected three DAR models, the traditional power
law (PL), PLEC (PL with exponential cutoff) and PLIEC (PL with inverse exponential cutoff). I defined
three new concepts and derived their quantifications: (i)DAR profile: z-q series where z is the
PL scaling parameter at different diversity order (q); (ii)PDO (pair-wise diversity overlap)
profile: g-q series where g is the PDO corresponding to q; (iii) MAD (maximal accrual diversity)
profile: Dmax-q series where Dmax is the MAD corresponding to q. Furthermore, the PDO-g is quantified
based on the self-similarity property of the PL model, and Dmax can be estimated from the PLEC parameters.
The three profiles constitute a novel DAR approach to biodiversity scaling. I verified the postulation
with the American gut microbiome project (AGP) dataset of 1473 healthy North American individuals
(the largest human dataset from a single project to date). The PL model was preferred due to its simplicity
and established ecological properties such as self-similarity (necessary for establishing PDO
profile), and PLEC has an advantage in establishing the MAD profile. All three profiles for the AGP
dataset were successfully quantified and compared with existing SAR parameters in the literature
whenever possible.
