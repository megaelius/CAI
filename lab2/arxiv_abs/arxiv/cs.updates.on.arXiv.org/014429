The ability of Minkowski Functionals to characterize local structure in different biological
tissue types has been demonstrated in a variety of medical image processing tasks. We introduce
anisotropic Minkowski Functionals (AMFs) as a novel variant that captures the inherent anisotropy
of the underlying gray-level structures. To quantify the anisotropy characterized by our approach,
we further introduce a method to compute a quantitative measure motivated by a technique utilized
in MR diffusion tensor imaging, namely fractional anisotropy. We showcase the applicability of
our method in the research context of characterizing the local structure properties of trabecular
bone micro-architecture in the proximal femur as visualized on multi-detector CT. To this end,
AMFs were computed locally for each pixel of ROIs extracted from the head, neck and trochanter regions.
Fractional anisotropy was then used to quantify the local anisotropy of the trabecular structures
found in these ROIs and to compare its distribution in different anatomical regions. Our results
suggest a significantly greater concentration of anisotropic trabecular structures in the head
and neck regions when compared to the trochanter region (p < 10-4). We also evaluated the ability
of such AMFs to predict bone strength in the femoral head of proximal femur specimens obtained from
50 donors. Our results suggest that such AMFs, when used in conjunction with multi-regression models,
can outperform more conventional features such as BMD in predicting failure load. We conclude that
such anisotropic Minkowski Functionals can capture valuable information regarding directional
attributes of local structure, which may be useful in a wide scope of biomedical imaging applications.
