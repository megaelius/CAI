Short-term forecasting is an important tool in understanding environmental processes. In this
paper, we incorporate machine learning algorithms into a conditional distribution estimator
for the purposes of forecasting tropical cyclone intensity. Many machine learning techniques
give a single-point prediction of the conditional distribution of the target variable, which does
not give a full accounting of the prediction variability. Conditional distribution estimation
can provide extra insight on predicted response behavior, which could influence decision-making
and policy. We propose a technique that simultaneously estimates the entire conditional distribution
and flexibly allows for machine learning techniques to be incorporated. A smooth model is fit over
both the target variable and covariates, and a logistic transformation is applied on the model output
layer to produce an expression of the conditional density function. We provide two examples of machine
learning models that can be used, polynomial regression and deep learning models. To achieve computational
efficiency we propose a case-control sampling approximation to the conditional distribution.
A simulation study for four different data distributions highlights the effectiveness of our method
compared to other machine learning-based conditional distribution estimation techniques. We
then demonstrate the utility of our approach for forecasting purposes using tropical cyclone data
from the Atlantic Seaboard. This paper gives a proof of concept for the promise of our method, further
computational developments can fully unlock its insights in more complex forecasting and other
applications.
