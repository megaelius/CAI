In order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries enforced extended social distancing
measures for several weeks, effectively pausing the majority of economic activities. In an effort
to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols
have been introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing
chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing
the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism,
where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising
DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns,
lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that
there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport
as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the
international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain
and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a distributed
infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health systems and their verification
by relevant stakeholders, such as airline companies and border control authorities. We discuss
the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy. Finally,
we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal security and privacy properties
that need to be rigorously guaranteed via appropriate security protocols.
