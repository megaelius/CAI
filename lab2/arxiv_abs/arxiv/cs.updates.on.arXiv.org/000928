Increased coupling between critical infrastructure networks, such as power and communications,
has important implications for the reliability and security of these networks. To understand the
implications of power-communications coupling, researchers have studied interdependent network
models and reported that increased coupling can increase system vulnerability [1, 2]. However,
these results come from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading, relative
to those found in actual power and communications networks. This paper reports on two sets of experiments
that compare the network vulnerability implications resulting from simple topological models
and models that more accurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. In the first
set of experiments, we compare a simple model of intra-network cascading to a power grid model and
find that the power grid model reveals that power grids have a higher level of vulnerability, relative
to what would be inferred from a topological contagion model. In a second set of experiments, we compare
the coupled topological model from [1] to three different physics-based models of power grids coupled
to communication networks. Again, the results show that more accurate models lead to very different
conclusions. In all but the most extreme case, the physics-based power grid models suggest that
increased power-communications coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from what
one would conclude from the model in [1], in which zero coupling is optimal. Finally, an extreme case,
in which communications failures immediately cause grid failures, suggests that if systems are
poorly designed, increased coupling can be harmful.
