Kymographs are widely used to represent and anal- yse spatio-temporal dynamics of fluorescence
markers along curvilinear biological compartments. These objects have a sin- gular geometry,
thus kymograph reconstruction is inherently an analog image processing task. However, the existing
approaches are essentially digital: the kymograph photometry is sampled directly from the time-lapse
images. As a result, such kymographs rely on raw image data that suffer from the degradations entailed
by the image formation process and the spatio-temporal resolution of the imaging setup. In this
work, we address these limitations and introduce a well-grounded Bayesian framework for the analog
reconstruction of kymographs. To handle the movement of the object, we introduce an intrinsic description
of kymographs using differential geometry: a kymograph is a photometry defined on a parameter space
that is embedded in physical space by a time-varying map that follows the object geometry. We model
the kymograph photometry as a L\'evy innovation process, a flexible class of non-parametric signal
priors. We account for the image formation process using the virtual microscope framework. We formulate
a computationally tractable representation of the associated maximum a posteriori problem and
solve it using a class of efficient and modular algorithms based on the alternating split Bregman.
We assess the performance of our Bayesian framework on synthetic data and apply it to reconstruct
the fluorescence dynamics along microtubules in vivo in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. We demonstrate
that our framework allows revealing patterns from single time-lapse data that are invisible on
standard digital kymographs.
