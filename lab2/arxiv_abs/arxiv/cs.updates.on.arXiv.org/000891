Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change the state of
affairs of current networks, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control
logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network
control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns introduced
between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the
forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem
into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking,
simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. Today, SDN is both a hot research
topic and a concept gaining wide acceptance in industry, which justifies the comprehensive survey
presented in this paper. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts
and how it differs from traditional networking. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN
infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware
infrastructure, southbound and northbounds APIs, network virtualization layers, network operating
systems, network programming languages, and management applications. We also look at cross-layer
problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution
of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular,
we address the design of switches and control platforms -- with a focus on aspects such as resiliency,
scalability, performance, security and dependability -- as well as new opportunities for carrier
transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key
enabler of a software-defined environment.
