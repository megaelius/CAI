Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform released
to open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation. The platform's design exhibits principles required
by enterprise grade business applications like supply-chains, financial transactions, asset
management, food safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of
which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (\emph{chaincode} in HLF), and flexible
endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid. Typical blockchain
applications are comprised of two tiers: the first tier focuses on the modelling of the data schema
and embedding of business rules into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (\emph{chaincode})
and endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by
HLF to implement client side application logic. However there is a gap between the two tiers that
hinders the rapid adoption of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client
SDK. Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically configured into
the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of the client in the event of changes
in the platform, and makes the platform more difficult to use. In this work we address and bridge the
gap by describing the design and implementation of \emph{Service Discovery}. \emph{Service Discovery}
provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the configuration required for the client SDK to
interact with the platform, alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables
the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus significantly improving the reliability
of the application layer. It also makes the HLF platform more consumable, simplifying the job of
creating blockchain applications.
