In 2015, the CCC co-sponsored an industry round table that produced the document "The Future of Computing
Research: Industry-Academic Collaborations". Since then, several important trends in computing
research have emerged, and this document considers how those trends impact the interaction between
academia and industry in computing fields. We reach the following conclusions: - In certain computing
disciplines, such as currently artificial intelligence, we observe significant increases in
the level of interaction between professors and companies, which take the form of extended joint
appointments. - Increasingly, companies are highly motivated to engage both professors and graduate
students working in specific technical areas because companies view computing research and technical
talent as a core aspect of their business success. - There is also the further potential for principles
and values from the academy (e.g., ethics, human-centered approaches, etc.) informing products
and R&D roadmaps in new ways through these unique joint arrangements. - This increasing connection
between faculty, students, and companies has the potential to change (either positively or negatively)
numerous things, including: the academic culture in computing research universities, the research
topics that faculty and students pursue, the ability of universities to train undergraduate and
graduate students, etc. This report is the first step in engaging the broader computing research
community, raising awareness of the opportunities, complexities and challenges of this trend
but further work is required. We recommend follow-up to measure the degree and impact of this trend
and to establish best practices that are shared widely among computing research institutions.
