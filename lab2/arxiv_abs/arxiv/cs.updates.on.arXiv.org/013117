We present a novel algorithm named 3DPIFCM, for automatic segmentation of noisy MRI Brain images.
The algorithm is an extension of a well-known IFCM (Improved Fuzzy Mean Clustering) algorithm.
It performs fuzzy segmentation and introduces a fitness function that is affected by proximity
of the voxels and by the color intensity in 3D images. The 3DPIFCM algorithm uses PSO (Particle Swarm
Optimization) in order to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the 3DPIFCM uses 3D features
of near voxels to better adjust the noisy artifacts. In our experiments, we evaluate 3DPIFCM on T1
Brainweb dataset with noise levels ranging from 1% to 20% and on a synthetic dataset with ground truth
both in 3D. The analysis of the segmentation results shows a significant improvement in the segmentation
quality of up to 28% compared to two generic variants in noisy images and up to 60% when compared to
the original FCM (Fuzzy Mean Clustering). We conducted experiments with the parallel version of
the algorithm to itself in CPU version and also to IFCMPSO (Improved Fuzzy Mean Clustering using
Particle Swarm Optimization), GAIFCM (Genetic Algorithm Fuzzy Mean Clustering) which are genetic
algorithm counterparts of the 3DPIFCM algorithm. Our purpose was to test for raw execution speed
in seconds of each algorithm given the same hyper parameters and same server. Our speedup results
show that the parallel version of the algorithm performs up to 27x faster than the original sequential
version and 68x faster than GAIFCM algorithm. We show that the speedup of the parallel version increases
as we increase the size of the image due to better utilization of cores in the GPU. Also, we show a speedup
of up to 5x in our Brainweb experiment compared to other generic variants such as IFCMPSO and GAIFCM.
