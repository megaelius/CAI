In the simplest form of event structure, a prime event structure, an event is associated with a unique
causal history, its prime cause. However, it is quite common for an event to have disjunctive causes
in that it can be enabled by any one of multiple sets of causes. Sometimes the sets of causes may be mutually
exclusive, inconsistent one with another, and sometimes not, in which case they coexist consistently
and constitute parallel causes of the event. The established model of general event structures
can model parallel causes. On occasion however such a model abstracts too far away from the precise
causal histories of events to be directly useful. For example, sometimes one needs to associate
probabilities with different, possibly coexisting, causal histories of a common event. Ideally,
the causal histories of a general event structure would correspond to the configurations of its
causal unfolding to a prime event structure; and the causal unfolding would arise as a right adjoint
to the embedding of prime in general event structures. But there is no such adjunction. However,
a slight extension of prime event structures remedies this defect and provides a causal unfolding
as a universal construction. Prime event structures are extended with an equivalence relation
in order to dissociate the two roles, that of an event and its enabling; in effect, prime causes are
labelled by a disjunctive event, an equivalence class of its prime causes. With this enrichment
a suitable causal unfolding appears as a pseudo right adjoint. The adjunction relies critically
on the central and subtle notion of extremal causal realisation as an embodiment of causal history.
Finally, we explore subcategories which support parallel causes as well the key operations needed
in developing probabilistic distributed strategies with parallel causes.
