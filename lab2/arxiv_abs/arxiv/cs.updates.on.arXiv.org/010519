In population synthesis applications, when considering populations with many attributes, a fundamental
problem is the estimation of rare combinations of feature attributes. Unsurprisingly, it is notably
more difficult to reliably representthe sparser regions of such multivariate distributions and
in particular combinations of attributes which are absent from the original sample. In the literature
this is commonly known as sampling zeros for which no systematic solution has been proposed so far.
In this paper, two machine learning algorithms, from the family of deep generative models,are proposed
for the problem of population synthesis and with particular attention to the problem of sampling
zeros. Specifically, we introduce the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) and
the Variational Autoencoder(VAE), and adapt these algorithms for a large-scale population synthesis
application. The models are implemented on a Danish travel survey with a feature-space of more than
60 variables. The models are validated in a cross-validation scheme and a set of new metrics for the
evaluation of the sampling-zero problem is proposed. Results show how these models are able to recover
sampling zeros while keeping the estimation of truly impossible combinations, the structural
zeros, at a comparatively low level. Particularly, for a low dimensional experiment, the VAE, the
marginal sampler and the fully random sampler generate 5%, 21% and 26%, respectively, more structural
zeros per sampling zero generated by the WGAN, while for a high dimensional case, these figures escalate
to 44%, 2217% and 170440%, respectively. This research directly supports the development of agent-based
systems and in particular cases where detailed socio-economic or geographical representations
are required.
