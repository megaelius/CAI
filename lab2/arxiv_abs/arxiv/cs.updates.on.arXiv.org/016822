We propose an approach to reconstruct dense three-dimensional (3D) model of tissue surface from
stereo optical videos in real-time, the basic idea of which is to first extract 3D information from
video frames by using stereo matching, and then to mosaic the reconstructed 3D models. To handle
the common low texture regions on tissue surfaces, we propose effective post-processing steps
for the local stereo matching method to enlarge the radius of constraint, which include outliers
removal, hole filling and smoothing. Since the tissue models obtained by stereo matching are limited
to the field of view of the imaging modality, we propose a model mosaicking method by using a novel
feature-based simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) method to align the models. Low
texture regions and the varying illumination condition may lead to a large percentage of feature
matching outliers. To solve this problem, we propose several algorithms to improve the robustness
of SLAM, which mainly include (1) a histogram voting-based method to roughly select possible inliers
from the feature matching results, (2) a novel 1-point RANSAC-based P$n$P algorithm called as DynamicR1PP$n$P
to track the camera motion and (3) a GPU-based iterative closest points (ICP) and bundle adjustment
(BA) method to refine the camera motion estimation results. Experimental results on ex- and in vivo
data showed that the reconstructed 3D models have high resolution texture with an accuracy error
of less than 2 mm. Most algorithms are highly parallelized for GPU computation, and the average runtime
for processing one key frame is 76.3 ms on stereo images with 960x540 resolution.
