Several systematic studies have suggested that a large fraction of published research is not reproducible.
One probable reason for low reproducibility is insufficient sample size, resulting in low power
and low positive predictive value. It has been suggested that insufficient sample-size choice
is driven by a combination of scientific competition and 'positive publication bias'. Here we formalize
this intuition in a simple model, in which scientists choose economically rational sample sizes,
balancing the cost of experimentation with income from publication. Specifically, assuming that
a scientist's income derives only from 'positive' findings (positive publication bias) and that
individual samples cost a fixed amount, allows to leverage basic statistical formulas into an economic
optimality prediction. We find that if effects have i) low base probability, ii) small effect size
or iii) low grant income per publication, then the rational (economically optimal) sample size
is small. Furthermore, for plausible distributions of these parameters we find a robust emergence
of a bimodal distribution of obtained statistical power and low overall reproducibility rates,
both matching empirical findings. Finally, we explore conditional equivalence testing as a means
to align economic incentives with adequate sample sizes. Overall, the model describes a simple
mechanism explaining both the prevalence and the persistence of small sample sizes, and is well
suited for empirical validation. It proposes economic rationality, or economic pressures, as
a principal driver of irreproducibility and suggests strategies to change this.
