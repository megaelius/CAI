Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in
a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be particularly likely if the proportions
of a bee's tongue match flower shape in a beneficial way. Empirical evidence for trait matching,
however, varies significantly in strength among different types of ecological networks. Here,
we show that ambiguity among empirical trait matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from
using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional
regression models with Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees,
Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes, and
k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits,
and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We find that the best
ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant-pollinator networks (up to 0.93
AUC) and outperform conventional regression models. Our results also demonstrate that ML models
can better identify the causally responsible trait matching combinations than GLMs. In two case
studies, the best ML models could successfully predict species interactions in a global plant-pollinator
database and infer ecologically plausible trait matching rules for a plant-hummingbird network
from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models
offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks.
We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other network types, such as trophic or competitive
networks. More generally, our results highlight the potential of ML and artificial intelligence
for inference beyond standard tasks such as pattern recognition.
