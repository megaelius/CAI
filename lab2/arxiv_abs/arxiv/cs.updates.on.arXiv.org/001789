The timely provision of traffic sign information to drivers is essential for the drivers to respond,
to ensure safe driving, and to avoid traffic accidents in a timely manner. We proposed a timely visual
recognizability quantitative evaluation method for traffic signs in large-scale transportation
environments. To achieve this goal, we first address the concept of a visibility field to reflect
the visible distribution of three-dimensional (3D) space and construct a traffic sign Visibility
Evaluation Model (VEM) to measure the traffic sign visibility for a given viewpoint. Then, based
on the VEM, we proposed the concept of the Visual Recognizability Field (VRF) to reflect the visual
recognizability distribution in 3D space and established a Visual Recognizability Evaluation
Model (VREM) to measure a traffic sign visual recognizability for a given viewpoint. Next, we proposed
a Traffic Sign Timely Visual Recognizability Evaluation Model (TSTVREM) by combining VREM, the
actual maximum continuous visual recognizable distance, and traffic big data to measure a traffic
sign visual recognizability in different lanes. Finally, we presented an automatic algorithm
to implement the TSTVREM model through traffic sign and road marking detection and classification,
traffic sign environment point cloud segmentation, viewpoints calculation, and TSTVREM model
realization. The performance of our method for traffic sign timely visual recognizability evaluation
is tested on three road point clouds acquired by a mobile laser scanning system (RIEGL VMX-450) according
to Road Traffic Signs and Markings (GB 5768-1999 in China), showing that our method is feasible and
efficient.
