Over the course of the last decade, infrared (IR) and particularly thermal IR imaging based face
recognition has emerged as a promising complement to conventional, visible spectrum based approaches
which continue to struggle when applied in practice. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum
illumination changes, IR data introduces specific challenges of its own, most notably sensitivity
to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature,
and alcohol intake. In addition, facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct
in IR images because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for fitting
any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which addresses these major challenges.
Specifically, when comparing two thermal IR images of faces, we mutually normalize their poses
and facial expressions by using an active appearance model (AAM) to generate synthetic images of
the two faces with a neutral facial expression and in the same view (the average of the two input views).
This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows AAM fitting. A major contribution of
our work is the use of an AAM ensemble in which each AAM is specialized to a particular range of poses
and a particular region of the thermal IR face space. Combined with the contributions from our previous
work which addressed the problem of reliable AAM fitting in the thermal IR spectrum, and the development
of a person-specific representation robust to transient changes in the pattern of facial temperature
emissions, the proposed ensemble framework accurately matches faces across the full range of yaw
from frontal to profile, even in the presence of scale variation (e.g. due to the varying distance
of a subject from the camera).
