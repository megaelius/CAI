Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) dynamics estimation and its automated regulation could benefit
the clinical and emergency resuscitation of critical patients. In order to address the variability
and complexity of the MAP response of a patient to vasoactive drug infusion, a parameter-varying
model with a varying time delay is considered to describe the MAP dynamics in response to drugs. The
estimation of the varying parameters and the delay is performed via a Bayesian-based multiple-model
square root cubature Kalman filtering approach. The estimation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed random-walk dynamics identification method using collected animal experiment
data. Following the estimation algorithm, an automated drug delivery scheme to regulate the MAP
response of the patient is carried out via time-delay linear parameter-varying (LPV) control techniques.
In this regard, an LPV gain-scheduled output-feedback controller is designed to meet the MAP response
requirements of tracking a desired reference MAP target and guarantee robustness against norm-bounded
uncertainties and disturbances. In this context, parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii
functionals are used to derive sufficient conditions for the robust stabilization of a general
LPV system with an arbitrarily varying time delay and the results are provided in a convex linear
matrix inequality (LMI) constraint framework. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed
MAP regulation approach, closed-loop simulations are conducted and the results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed control method against various simulated clinical scenarios.
