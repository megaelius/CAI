The objectives of this qualitative research were to study the model of 360-degree virtual reality
travel media, to compare appropriateness of moving 360-degree virtual reality travel media for
elderly with both still and moving cameras, and to study satisfaction of elderly in 360-degree virtual
reality travel media. The informants are 10 elders with age above and equal to 60 years old who live
in Bangkok regardless of genders. Data were collected through documents, detailed interview,
and non-participant observation of elders to 360-degree virtual reality travel media with data
triangulation. 1. From the literature review 1. The creation must primarily consider the target
consumers on their physics 2. must have fluidity on changing the view of the camera by calibrating
with the target consumers 3. The image displayed must not move too fast to prevent dizziness and improve
the comfort of the target consumers. It is also highly recommended to implement a function to customize
the movement rate for the customer. 2. From the in-depth interview with the target consumers, the
results found that 1. They are worried and not used to the equipment 2. They have no idea where to look
3. They feel excited 5. They are interested in what is more to see 6. They feel like they did actually
travel there 7. They can hear the sound clearly 8. They do not like when the camera is moving and find
still camera more comfortable. 3. From the non-participant observation and found that they are
always excited, laughed, and smiled when watching the media. They always asked where this is and
why they cannot see anything when turning around.
