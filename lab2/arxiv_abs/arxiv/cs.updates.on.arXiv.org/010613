With the improvements in the object detection networks, several variations of object detection
networks have been achieved impressive performance. However, the performance evaluation of most
models has focused on detection accuracy, and the performance verification is mostly based on high-end
GPU hardwares. In this paper, we propose real-time object detectors that guarantees balanced performance
for real-time system on embedded platforms. The proposed model utilizes the basic head structure
of the RefineDet model, which is a variant of the single shot object detector (SSD). In order to ensure
real-time performance, CNN models with relatively shallow layers or fewer parameters have been
used as the backbone structure. In addition to the basic VGGNet and ResNet structures, various backbone
structures such as MobileNet, Xception, ResNeXt, Inception-SENet, and SE-ResNeXt have been used
for this purpose. Successful training of object detection networks was achieved through an appropriate
combination of intermediate layers. The accuracy of the proposed detector was estimated by the
evaluation of MS-COCO 2017 object detection dataset and the inference speed on the NVIDIA Drive
PX2 and Jetson Xaviers boards were tested to verify real-time performance in the embedded systems.
The experiments show that the proposed models ensure balanced performance in terms of accuracy
and inference speed in the embedded system environments. In addition, unlike the high-end GPUs,
the use of embedded GPUs involves several additional concerns for efficient inference, which have
been identified in this work. The codes and models are publicly available on the web (link).
