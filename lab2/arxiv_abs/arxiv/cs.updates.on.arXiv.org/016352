With the rapid popularity of blockchain, decentralized human intelligence tasks (HITs) are proposed
to crowdsource human knowledge without relying on vulnerable third-party platforms. However,
the inherent limits of blockchain cause decentralized HITs to face a few "new" challenges. For example,
the confidentiality of solicited data turns out to be the sine qua non, though it was an arguably dispensable
property in the centralized setting. To ensure the "new" requirement of data privacy, existing
decentralized HITs use generic zero-knowledge proof frameworks (e.g. SNARK), but scarcely perform
well in practice, due to the inherently expensive cost of generality. We present a practical decentralized
protocol for HITs, which also achieves the fairness between requesters and workers. At the core
of our contributions, we avoid the powerful yet highly-costly generic zk-proof tools and propose
a special-purpose scheme to prove the quality of encrypted data. By various non-trivial statement
reformations, proving the quality of encrypted data is reduced to efficient verifiable decryption,
thus making decentralized HITs practical. Along the way, we rigorously define the ideal functionality
of decentralized HITs and then prove the security due to the ideal-real paradigm. We further instantiate
our protocol to implement a system called Dragoon, an instance of which is deployed atop Ethereum
to facilitate an image annotation task used by ImageNet. Our evaluations demonstrate its practicality:
the on-chain handling cost of Dragoon is even less than the handling fee of Amazon's Mechanical Turk
for the same ImageNet HIT.
