This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless powered communication network
(WPCN), in which a UAV is dispatched as a mobile access point (AP) to serve a set of ground users periodically.
The UAV employs the radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the
downlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent information to the UAV in
the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed APs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility
of the UAV via trajectory design, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization,
to maximize the system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common (minimum)
throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period, subject to its maximum speed
constraint and the users' energy neutrality constraints. The resulted problem is non-convex and
thus difficult to be solved optimally. To tackle this challenge, we first consider an ideal case
without the UAV's maximum speed constraint, and obtain the optimal solution to the relaxed problem.
The optimal solution shows that the UAV should successively hover above a finite number of ground
locations for downlink WPT, as well as above each of the ground users for uplink communication. Next,
we consider the general problem with the UAV's maximum speed constraint. Based on the above multi-location-hovering
solution, we first propose an efficient successive hover-and-fly trajectory design, jointly
with the downlink and uplink wireless resource allocation, and then propose a locally optimal solution
by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex programming (SCP).
Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled WPCN achieves significant throughput gains
over the conventional WPCN with fixed-location AP.
