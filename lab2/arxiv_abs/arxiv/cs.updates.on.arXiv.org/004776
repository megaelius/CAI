Many modern data analysis algorithms either assume that or are considerably more efficient if the
distances between the data points satisfy a metric. These algorithms include metric learning,
clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Because real data sets are noisy, the similarity measures
often fail to satisfy a metric. For this reason, Gilbert and Jain [11] and Fan, et al. [8] introduce
the closely related problems of $\textit{sparse metric repair}$ and $\textit{metric violation
distance}$. The goal of each problem is to repair as few distances as possible to ensure that the distances
between the data points satisfy a metric. We generalize these problems so as to no longer require
all the distances between the data points. That is, we consider a weighted graph $G$ with corrupted
weights w and our goal is to find the smallest number of modifications to the weights so that the resulting
weighted graph distances satisfy a metric. This problem is a natural generalization of the sparse
metric repair problem and is more flexible as it takes into account different relationships amongst
the input data points. As in previous work, we distinguish amongst the types of repairs permitted
(decrease, increase, and general repairs). We focus on the increase and general versions and establish
hardness results and show the inherent combinatorial structure of the problem. We then show that
if we restrict to the case when $G$ is a chordal graph, then the problem is fixed parameter tractable.
We also present several classes of approximation algorithms. These include and improve upon previous
metric repair algorithms for the special case when $G = K_n$
