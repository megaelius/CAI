Most of the existing tracking methods based on CNN(convolutional neural networks) are too slow
for real-time application despite the excellent tracking precision compared with the traditional
ones. In this paper, a fast dynamic visual tracking algorithm combining CNN based MDNet(Multi-Domain
Network) and RoIAlign was developed. The major problem of MDNet also lies in the time efficiency.
Considering the computational complexity of MDNet is mainly caused by the large amount of convolution
operations and fine-tuning of the network during tracking, a RoIPool layer which could conduct
the convolution over the whole image instead of each RoI is added to accelerate the convolution and
a new strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected layers is used to accelerate the update. With
RoIPool employed, the computation speed has been increased but the tracking precision has dropped
simultaneously. RoIPool could lose some positioning precision because it can not handle locations
represented by floating numbers. So RoIAlign, instead of RoIPool, which can process floating numbers
of locations by bilinear interpolation has been added to the network. The results show the target
localization precision has been improved and it hardly increases the computational cost. These
strategies can accelerate the processing and make it 7x faster than MDNet with very low impact on
precision and it can run at around 7 fps. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on two benchmarks:
OTB100 and VOT2016, on which high precision and speed have been obtained. The influence of the network
structure and training data are also discussed with experiments.
