With the proliferation of computation-extensive and latency-critical applications in the 5G
and beyond networks, mobile-edge computing (MEC) or fog computing, which provides cloud-like
computation and/or storage capabilities at the network edge, is envisioned to reduce computation
latency as well as to conserve energy for wireless devices (WDs). This paper studies a novel device-to-device
(D2D)-enabled multi-helper MEC system, in which a local user solicits its nearby WDs serving as
helpers for cooperative computation. We assume a time division multiple access (TDMA) transmission
protocol, under which the local user offloads the tasks to multiple helpers and downloads the results
from them over orthogonal pre-scheduled time slots. Under this setup, we minimize the computation
latency by optimizing the local user's task assignment jointly with the time and rate for task offloading
and results downloading, as well as the computation frequency for task execution, subject to individual
energy and computation capacity constraints at the local user and the helpers. However, the formulated
problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) that is difficult to solve. To tackle this
challenge, we propose an efficient algorithm by first relaxing the original problem into a convex
one, and then constructing a suboptimal task assignment solution based on the obtained optimal
one. Next, we consider a benchmark scheme that endows the WDs with their maximum computation capacities.
To further reduce the implementation complexity, we also develop a heuristic scheme based on the
greedy task assignment. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithm, as compared against the heuristic scheme and other benchmark ones without either joint
optimization of radio and computation resources or task assignment design.
