One of the main criticisms to game theory concerns the assumption of full rationality. Logit dynamics
is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of irrationality (a.k.a. "noise") is introduced in
players' behavior. In this context, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium,
as opposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy profiles that
possess several nice properties, including existence and uniqueness. However, there are games
in which their computation may take time exponential in the number of players. We therefore look
at an approximate version of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by
Auletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e., players do not go too
far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps (rather than forever, as for logit equilibria).
The hope is that these distributions exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics. We identify
a class of potential games, called asymptotically well-behaved, for which the behavior of the logit
dynamics is not chaotic as the number of players increases so to guarantee meaningful asymptotic
results. We prove that any such game admits distributions which are metastable no matter the level
of noise present in the system, and the starting profile of the dynamics. These distributions can
be quickly reached if the rationality level is not too big when compared to the inverse of the maximum
difference in potential. Our proofs build on results which may be of independent interest, including
some spectral characterizations of the transition matrix defined by logit dynamics for generic
games and the relationship of several convergence measures for Markov chains.
