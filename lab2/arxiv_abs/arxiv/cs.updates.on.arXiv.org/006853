The RGB-D camera maintains a limited range for working and is hard to accurately measure the depth
information in a far distance. Besides, the RGB-D camera will easily be influenced by strong lighting
and other external factors, which will lead to a poor accuracy on the acquired environmental depth
information. Recently, deep learning technologies have achieved great success in the visual SLAM
area, which can directly learn high-level features from the visual inputs and improve the estimation
accuracy of the depth information. Therefore, deep learning technologies maintain the potential
to extend the source of the depth information and improve the performance of the SLAM system. However,
the existing deep learning-based methods are mainly supervised and require a large amount of ground-truth
depth data, which is hard to acquire because of the realistic constraints. In this paper, we first
present an unsupervised learning framework, which not only uses image reconstruction for supervising
but also exploits the pose estimation method to enhance the supervised signal and add training constraints
for the task of monocular depth and camera motion estimation. Furthermore, we successfully exploit
our unsupervised learning framework to assist the traditional ORB-SLAM system when the initialization
module of ORB-SLAM method could not match enough features. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
have shown that our unsupervised learning framework performs the depth estimation task comparable
to the supervised methods and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach by $13.5\%$
on KITTI dataset. Besides, our unsupervised learning framework could significantly accelerate
the initialization process of ORB-SLAM system and effectively improve the accuracy on environmental
mapping in strong lighting and weak texture scenes.
