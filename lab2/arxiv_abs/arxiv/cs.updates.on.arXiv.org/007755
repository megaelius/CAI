We consider the dynamic graph coloring problem restricted to the class of interval graphs. At each
update step the algorithm is presented with an interval to be colored, or a previously colored interval
to delete. The goal of the algorithm is to efficiently maintain a proper coloring of the intervals
with as few colors as possible by an online algorithm. In the incremental model, each update step
presents the algorithm with an interval to be colored. The problem is closely connected to the online
vertex coloring problem of interval graphs for which the Kierstead-Trotter (KT) algorithm achieves
the best possible competitive ratio. We first show that a sub-quadratic time direct implementation
of the KT-algorithm is unlikely to exist conditioned on the correctness of the Online Boolean Matrix
Vector multiplication conjecture due to Henzinger et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/stoc/HenzingerKNS15}.
We then design an incremental algorithm that is subtly different from the KT-algorithm and uses
at most $3 \omega - 2$ colors, where $\omega$ is the maximum clique in the interval graph associated
with the set of intervals. Our incremental data structure maintains a proper coloring in amortized
$O(\log n + \Delta)$ update time where $n$ is the total number of intervals inserted and $\Delta$
is the maximum degree of a vertex in the interval graph. We then consider the fully dynamic framework
involving insertions and deletions. On each update, our aim is to maintain a $3 \omega - 2$ coloring
of the remaining set of intervals, where $\omega$ is the maximum clique in the interval graph associated
with the remaining set of intervals. Our fully dynamic algorithm supports insertion of an interval
in $O(\log n + \Delta \log \omega)$ worst case update time and deletion of an interval in $O(\Delta^2
\log n)$ worst case update time.
