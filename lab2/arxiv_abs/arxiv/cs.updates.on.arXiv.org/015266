Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising candidate for the next generation non-volatile
memory technology due to its simple read-write operation and high storage density. However, its
crossbar array structure causes a server interference effect known as the "sneak path." In this
paper, we address the sneak-path problem based on communication theory and coding theory, and design
error correction codes (ECCs) that can combat both the sneak-path interference and the channel
noise. The main challenge of the code design for an ReRAM channel is that the channel is highly data-dependent
and correlated, and hence the conventional error correction coding scheme will not be effective.
We propose a distributed data storage strategy, which assigns a codeword to multiple independent
arrays, and exploit a real-time channel estimation mechanism to investigate the instant channel
status of the ReRAM channel. Since the coded bits from different arrays experience independent
channels, a "diversity" gain can be obtained during decoding, and when the codeword is adequately
distributed, the code actually performs the same as that over an uncorrelated and data-independent
channel. By applying decoding based on the scheme of treating-interference-as-noise (TIN), the
ReRAM channel is equivalent to a block-varying channel, for which we propose both the capacity limit
and code design. The proposed code design is based on the state-of-the-art sparse-graph coding
and decoding theories, which enables the ReRAM system to achieve the maximum storage efficiency
with a gap of less than 0.1 bit/cell from the capacity limit of the ReRAM channel.
