The polynomial method from circuit complexity has been applied to several fundamental problems
and obtains the state-of-the-art running times. As observed in [Alman and Williams, STOC 2017],
almost all applications of the polynomial method in algorithm design ultimately rely on certain
low-rank decompositions of the computation matrices corresponding to key subroutines. They suggest
that making use of low-rank decompositions directly could lead to more powerful algorithms, as
the polynomial method is just one way to derive such a decomposition. Inspired by their observation,
in this paper, we study another way of systematically constructing low-rank decompositions of
matrices which could be used by algorithms. It is known that various types of communication protocols
lead to certain low-rank decompositions (e.g., $\mathsf{P}$ protocols/rank, $\mathsf{BQP}$
protocols/approximate rank). These are usually interpreted as approaches for proving communication
lower bounds, while in this work we explore the other direction. We have the two generic algorithmic
applications of communication protocols. The first connection is that a fast $\mathsf{BQP}$ communication
protocol for a function $f$ implies a fast deterministic additive approximate counting algorithm
for a related pair counting problem. The second connection is that a fast $\mathsf{AM}^{\mathsf{cc}}$
protocol for a function $f$ implies a faster-than-bruteforce algorithm for $f\textsf{-Satisfying-Pair}$.
We also apply our second connection to shed some light on long-standing open problems in communication
complexity. We show that if the Longest Common Subsequence problem admits an efficient $\mathsf{AM}^{\mathsf{cc}}$
protocol, then polynomial-size Formula-$\textsf{SAT}$ admits a $2^{n - n^{1-\delta}}$ time
algorithm for any constant $\delta > 0$.
