Land-use regression (LUR) models are important for the assessment of air pollution concentrations
in areas without measurement stations. While many such models exist, they often use manually constructed
features based on restricted, locally available data. Thus, they are typically hard to reproduce
and challenging to adapt to areas beyond those they have been developed for. In this paper, we advocate
a paradigm shift for LUR models: We propose the Data-driven, Open, Global (DOG) paradigm that entails
models based on purely data-driven approaches using only openly and globally available data. Progress
within this paradigm will alleviate the need for experts to adapt models to the local characteristics
of the available data sources and thus facilitate the generalizability of air pollution models
to new areas on a global scale. In order to illustrate the feasibility of the DOG paradigm for LUR,
we introduce a deep learning model called MapLUR. It is based on a convolutional neural network architecture
and is trained exclusively on globally and openly available map data without requiring manual feature
engineering. We compare our model to state-of-the-art baselines like linear regression, random
forests and multi-layer perceptrons using a large data set of modeled $\text{NO}_2$ concentrations
in Central London. Our results show that MapLUR significantly outperforms these approaches even
though they are provided with manually tailored features. Furthermore, we illustrate that the
automatic feature extraction inherent to models based on the DOG paradigm can learn features that
are readily interpretable and closely resemble those commonly used in traditional LUR approaches.
