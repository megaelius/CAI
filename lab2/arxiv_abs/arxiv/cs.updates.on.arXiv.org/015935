Community Question Answering platforms such as Stack Overflow help a wide range of users solve their
challenges online. As the popularity of these communities has grown over the years, both the number
of members and posts have escalated. Also, due to the diverse backgrounds, skills, expertise, and
viewpoints of users, each question may obtain more than one answers. Therefore, the focus has changed
toward producing posts that have a set of answers more valuable for the community as a whole, not just
one accepted-answer aimed at satisfying only the question-asker. Same as every universal community,
a large number of low-quality posts on Stack Overflow require improvement. We call these posts deficient
and define them as posts with questions that either have no answer yet or can be improved by other ones.
In this paper, we propose an approach to automate the identification process of such posts and boost
their set of answers, utilizing the help of related experts. With the help of 60 participants, we
trained a classification model to identify deficient posts by investigating the relationship
between characteristics of 3075 questions posted on Stack Overflow and their need for better answers
set. Then, we developed an Eclipse plugin named SOPI and integrated the prediction model in the plugin
to link these deficient posts to related developers and help them improve the answer set. We evaluated
both the functionality of our plugin and the impact of answers submitted to Stack Overflow with the
help of 10 and 15 expert industrial developers, respectively. Our results indicate that decision
trees, specifically J48, predicts a deficient question better than the other methods with 0.945
precision and 0.903 recall. We conclude that not only our plugin helps programmers contribute more
easily to Stack Overflow, but also it improves the quality of answers.
