Many real-world problems are categorized as large-scale problems, and metaheuristic algorithms
as an alternative method to solve large-scale problem; they need the evaluation of many candidate
solutions to tackle them prior to their convergence, which is not affordable for practical applications
since the most of them are computationally expensive. There is no efficient surrogate model to support
large-scale expensive global optimization (LSEGO) problems. As a result, the algorithms should
address LSEGO problems using a limited computational budget to be applicable in real-world applications.
Coordinate Descent (CD) algorithm is an optimization strategy based on the decomposition of a n-dimensional
problem into n one-dimensional problem. To the best our knowledge, there is no significant study
to assess benchmark functions with various dimensions and landscape properties to investigate
CD algorithm and compare with other metaheuristic algorithms. In this paper, we propose a modified
Coordinate Descent algorithm (MCD) to tackle LSEGO problems with a limited computational budget.
Our proposed algorithm benefits from two leading steps, namely, finding the region of interest
and then shrinkage of the search space by folding it into the half with exponential speed. One of the
main advantages of the proposed algorithm is being free of any control parameters, which makes it
far from the intricacies of the tuning process. The proposed algorithm is compared with cooperative
co-evolution with delta grouping on 20 benchmark functions with dimension 1000. Also, we conducted
some experiments on CEC-2017 to investigate the behavior of MCD algorithm in lower dimensions.
The results show that MCD is beneficial not only in large-scale problems, but also in low-scale optimization
problems.
