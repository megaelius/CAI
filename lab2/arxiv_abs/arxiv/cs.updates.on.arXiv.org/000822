Many diseases cause significant changes to the concentrations of small molecules (aka metabolites)
that appear in a person's biofluids, which means such diseases can often be readily detected from
a person's "metabolic profile". This information can be extracted from a person's NMR spectrum.
Today, this is often done manually by trained human experts, which means this process is relatively
slow, expensive and error-prone. This paper presents a tool, Bayesil, that can quickly, accurately
and autonomously produce a person's metabolic profile. Given a 1D1H NMR spectrum of a complex biofluid
(eg, serum or CSF), Bayesil can automatically determine this metabolic profile. This requires
first performing several spectral processing steps then matching the resulting spectrum against
a reference compound library, which contains the "signatures" of each relevant metabolite. Many
of these steps are novel algorithms and our matching step views spectral matching as an inference
problem within a probabilistic graphical model that rapidly approximates the most probable metabolic
profile. Our extensive studies on a diverse set of complex mixtures, show that Bayesil can autonomously
find the concentration of all NMR-detectable metabolites accurately (~90% correct identification
and ~10% quantification error), in <5minutes on a single CPU. These results demonstrate that
Bayesil is the first fully-automatic publicly-accessible system that provides quantitative
NMR spectral profiling effectively -- with an accuracy that meets or exceeds the performance of
trained experts. We anticipate this tool will usher in high-throughput metabolomics and enable
a wealth of new applications of NMR in clinical settings. Available at this http URL
