Scene text detection is an important step of scene text reading system. The main challenges lie on
significantly varied sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary orientations and shapes. Driven by recent
progress in deep learning, impressive performances have been achieved for multi-oriented text
detection. Yet, the performance drops dramatically in detecting curved texts due to the limited
text representation (e.g., horizontal bounding boxes, rotated rectangles, or quadrilaterals).
It is of great interest to detect curved texts, which are actually very common in natural scenes.
In this paper, we present a novel text detector named TextField for detecting irregular scene texts.
Specifically, we learn a direction field pointing away from the nearest text boundary to each text
point. This direction field is represented by an image of two-dimensional vectors and learned via
a fully convolutional neural network. It encodes both binary text mask and direction information
used to separate adjacent text instances, which is challenging for classical segmentation-based
approaches. Based on the learned direction field, we apply a simple yet effective morphological-based
post-processing to achieve the final detection. Experimental results show that the proposed TextField
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (28% and 8%) on two curved text datasets:
Total-Text and CTW1500, respectively, and also achieves very competitive performance on multi-oriented
datasets: ICDAR 2015 and MSRA-TD500. Furthermore, TextField is robust in generalizing to unseen
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/YukangWang/TextField.
