Urban imagery usually serves as forensic analysis and by design is available for incident mitigation.
As more imagery collected, it is harder to narrow down to certain frames among thousands of video
clips to a specific incident. A real-time, proactive surveillance system is desirable, which could
instantly detect dubious personnel, identify suspicious activities, or raise momentous alerts.
The recent proliferation of the edge computing paradigm allows more data-intensive tasks to be
accomplished by smart edge devices with lightweight but powerful algorithms. This paper presents
a forensic surveillance strategy by introducing an Instant Suspicious Activity identiFication
at the Edge (I-SAFE) using fuzzy decision making. A fuzzy control system is proposed to mimic the
decision-making process of a security officer. Decisions are made based on video features extracted
by a lightweight Deep Machine Learning (DML) model. Based on the requirements from the first-line
law enforcement officers, several features are selected and fuzzified to cope with the state of
uncertainty that exists in the officers' decision-making process. Using features in the edge hierarchy
minimizes the communication delay such that instant alerting is achieved. Additionally, leveraging
the Microservices architecture, the I-SAFE scheme possesses good scalability given the increasing
complexities at the network edge. Implemented as an edge-based application and tested using exemplary
and various labeled dataset surveillance videos, the I-SAFE scheme raises alerts by identifying
the suspicious activity in an average of 0.002 seconds. Compared to four other state-of-the-art
methods over two other data sets, the experimental study verified the superiority of the I-SAFE
decentralized method.
