Photometric transformations, such as brightness and contrast adjustment, can be applied to a face
image repeatedly creating a set of near-duplicate images. These near-duplicates may be visually
indiscernible. Identifying the original image from a set of near-duplicates, and deducing the
relationship between them, is important in the context of digital image forensics. This is commonly
done by generating an image phylogeny tree -- a hierarchical structure depicting the relationships
between a set of near-duplicate images. In this work, we utilize three different families of basis
functions to model pairwise relationships between near-duplicate images. The basis functions
used in this work are orthogonal polynomials, wavelet basis functions and radial basis functions.
We perform extensive experiments to assess the performance of the proposed method across three
different modalities, namely, face, fingerprint and iris images; across different image phylogeny
tree configurations; and across different types of photometric transformations. We also utilized
the same basis functions to model geometric transformations and deep-learning based transformations.
We also perform extensive analysis of each basis function with respect to their ability to model
arbitrary transformations and to distinguish between the original and the transformed images.
Finally, we utilize the concept of approximate von Neumann graph entropy to explain the success
and failure cases of the proposed IPT reconstruction algorithm. Experiments indicate that the
proposed algorithm generalizes well across different scenarios thereby suggesting the merits
of using basis functions to model the relationship between photometrically and geometrically
modified images.
