Tensor network operators, such as the matrix product operator (MPO) and the projected entangled-pair
operator (PEPO), can provide efficient representation of certain linear operators in high dimensional
spaces. This paper focuses on the efficient representation of tensor network operators with long-range
pairwise interactions such as the Coulomb interaction. For MPOs, we find that all existing efficient
methods exploit a peculiar "upper-triangular low-rank" (UTLR) property, i.e. the upper-triangular
part of the matrix can be well approximated by a low-rank matrix, while the matrix itself can be full-rank.
This allows us to convert the problem of finding the efficient MPO representation into a matrix completion
problem. We develop a modified incremental singular value decomposition method (ISVD) to solve
this ill-conditioned matrix completion problem. This algorithm yields equivalent MPO representation
to that developed in [Stoudenmire and White, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2017]. In order to efficiently treat
more general tensor network operators, we develop another strategy for compressing tensor network
operators based on hierarchical low-rank matrix formats, such as the hierarchical off-diagonal
low-rank (HODLR) format, and the $\mathcal{H}$-matrix format. Though the pre-constant in the
complexity is larger, the advantage of using the hierarchical low-rank matrix format is that it
is applicable to both MPOs and PEPOs. For the Coulomb interaction, the operator can be represented
by a linear combination of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)\log(N/\epsilon))$ MPOs/PEPOs, each with a constant
bond dimension, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is the accuracy of the low-rank truncation.
Neither the modified ISVD nor the hierarchical low-rank algorithm assumes that the long-range
interaction takes a translation-invariant form.
