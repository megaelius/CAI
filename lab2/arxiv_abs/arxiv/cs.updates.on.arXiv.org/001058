Seizure prediction has attracted a growing attention as one of the most challenging predictive
data analysis efforts in order to improve the life of patients living with drug-resistant epilepsy
and tonic seizures. Many outstanding works have been reporting great results in providing a sensible
indirect (warning systems) or direct (interactive neural-stimulation) control over refractory
seizures, some of which achieved high performance. However, many works put heavily handcraft feature
extraction and/or carefully tailored feature engineering to each patient to achieve very high
sensitivity and low false prediction rate for a particular dataset. This limits the benefit of their
approaches if a different dataset is used. In this paper we apply Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) on different intracranial and scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets and proposed
a generalized retrospective and patient-specific seizure prediction method. We use Short-Time
Fourier Transform (STFT) on 30-second EEG windows with 50% overlapping to extract information
in both frequency and time domains. A standardization step is then applied on STFT components across
the whole frequency range to prevent high frequencies features being influenced by those at lower
frequencies. A convolutional neural network model is used for both feature extraction and classification
to separate preictal segments from interictal ones. The proposed approach achieves sensitivity
of 89.8% and false prediction rate (FPR) of 0.17/h on Freiburg Hospital intracranial EEG (iEEG)
dataset, and sensitivity of 89.1% and FPR of 0.09/h on Children's Hospital of Boston-MIT scalp EEG
(sEEG) dataset.
