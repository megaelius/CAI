Traditional intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings work well only under a common assumption
that the labeled training data (source domain) and unlabeled testing data (target domain) are drawn
from the same distribution. When the distribution changes, most fault diagnosis models need to
be rebuilt from scratch using newly recollected labeled training data. However, it is expensive
or impossible to annotate huge amount of training data to rebuild such new model. Meanwhile, large
amounts of labeled training data have not been fully utilized yet, which is apparently a waste of
resources. As one of the important research directions of transfer learning, domain adaptation
(DA) typically aims at minimizing the differences between distributions of different domains
in order to minimize the cross-domain prediction error by taking full advantage of information
coming from both source and target domains. In this paper, we present one of the first studies on unsupervised
DA in the field of fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under varying working conditions and a novel
diagnosis strategy based on unsupervised DA using subspace alignment (SA) is proposed. After processed
by unsupervised DA with SA, the distributions of training data and testing data become close and
the classifier trained on training data can be used to classify the testing data. Experimental results
on the 60 domain adaptation diagnosis problems under varying working condition in Case Western
Reserve benchmark data and 12 domain adaptation diagnosis problems under varying working conditions
in our new data are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed methods
can effectively distinguish not only bearing faults categories but also fault severities.
