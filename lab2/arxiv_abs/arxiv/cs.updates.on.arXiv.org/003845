Private information retrieval (PIR) allows a user to retrieve a desired message from a set of databases
without revealing the identity of the desired message. The replicated databases scenario was considered
by Sun and Jafar, 2016, where $N$ databases can store the same $K$ messages completely. A PIR scheme
was developed to achieve the optimal download cost given by $\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \frac{1}{N^{2}}+
\cdots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. In this work, we consider the problem of PIR for uncoded storage
constrained databases. Each database has a storage capacity of $\mu KL$ bits, where $L$ is the size
of each message in bits, and $\mu \in [1/N, 1]$ is the normalized storage. On one extreme, $\mu=1$
is the replicated databases case previously settled. On the other hand, when $\mu= 1/N$, then in
order to retrieve a message privately, the user has to download all the messages from the databases
achieving a download cost of $1/K$. We aim to characterize the optimal download cost versus storage
trade-off for any storage capacity in the range $\mu \in [1/N, 1]$. In the storage constrained PIR
problem, there are two key challenges: a) construction of communication efficient schemes through
storage content design at each database that allow download efficient PIR; and b) characterizing
the optimal download cost via information-theoretic lower bounds. The novel aspect of this work
is to characterize the optimum download cost of PIR with storage constrained databases for any value
of storage. In particular, for any $(N,K)$, we show that the optimal trade-off between storage,
$\mu$, and the download cost, $D(\mu)$, is given by the lower convex hull of the $N$ pairs $\left(\frac{t}{N},
\left(1+ \frac{1}{t}+ \frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\right)\right)$ for $t=1,2,\ldots,
N$.
