On-street parking is convenient, but has many disadvantages: on-street spots come at the expense
of other road uses such as traffic lanes, transit lanes, bike lanes, or parklets; drivers looking
for parking contribute substantially to traffic congestion and hence to greenhouse gas emissions;
safety is reduced both due to the fact that drivers looking for spots are more distracted than other
road users and that people exiting parked cars pose a risk to cyclists. These social costs may not
be worth paying when off-street parking lots are nearby and have surplus capacity. To see where this
might be true in downtown Vancouver, we used artificial intelligence techniques to estimate the
amount of time it would take drivers to both park on and off street for destinations throughout the
city. For on-street parking, we developed (1) a deep-learning model of block-by-block parking
availability based on data from parking meters and audits and (2) a computational simulation of
drivers searching for an on-street spot. For off-street parking, we developed a computational
simulation of the time it would take drivers drive from their original destination to the nearest
city-owned off-street lot and then to queue for a spot based on traffic and lot occupancy data. Finally,
in both cases we also computed the time it would take the driver to walk from their parking spot to their
original destination. We compared these time estimates for destinations in each block of Vancouver's
downtown core and each hour of the day. We found many areas where off street would actually save drivers
time over searching the streets for a spot, and many more where the time cost for parking off street
was small. The identification of such areas provides an opportunity for the city to repurpose valuable
curbside space for community-friendly uses more in line with its transportation goals.
