In the world today computer networks have a very important position and most of the urban and national
infrastructure as well as organizations are managed by computer networks, therefore, the security
of these systems against the planned attacks is of great importance. Therefore, researchers have
been trying to find these vulnerabilities so that after identifying ways to penetrate the system,
they will provide system protection through preventive or countermeasures. SVM is one of the major
algorithms for intrusion detection. In this research, we studied a variety of malware and methods
of intrusion detection, provide an efficient method for detecting attacks and utilizing dimension
reduction.Thus, we will be able to detect attacks by carefully combining these two algorithms and
pre-processes that are performed before the two on the input data. The main question raised is how
we can identify attacks on computer networks with the above-mentioned method. In anomalies diagnostic
method, by identifying behavior as a normal behavior for the user, the host, or the whole system,
any deviation from this behavior is considered as an abnormal behavior, which can be a potential
occurrence of an attack. The network intrusion detection system is used by anomaly detection method
that uses the SVM algorithm for classification and SVD to reduce the size. Steps of the proposed method
include pre-processing of the data set, feature selection, support vector machine, and evaluation.The
NSL-KDD data set has been used to teach and test the proposed model. In this study, we inferred the
intrusion detection using the SVM algorithm for classification and SVD for diminishing dimensions
with no classification algorithm.Also the KNN algorithm has been compared in situations with and
without diminishing dimensions,the results have shown that the proposed method has a better performance
than comparable methods.
