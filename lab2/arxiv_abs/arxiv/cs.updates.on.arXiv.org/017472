This primer explores the exciting subject of intelligence. Intelligence is a fundamental component
of all living things, as well as Artificial Intelligence(AI). Artificial Intelligence has the
potential to affect all of our lives and a new era for modern humans. This paper is an attempt to explore
the ideas associated with intelligence, and by doing so understand the implications, constraints,
and potentially the capabilities of future Artificial Intelligence. As an exploration, we journey
into different parts of intelligence that appear essential. We hope that people find this useful
in determining where Artificial Intelligence may be headed. Also, during the exploration, we hope
to create new thought-provoking questions. Intelligence is not a single weighable quantity but
a subject that spans Biology, Physics, Philosophy, Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, Psychology,
and Computer Science. Historian Yuval Noah Harari pointed out that engineers and scientists in
the future will have to broaden their understandings to include disciplines such as Psychology,
Philosophy, and Ethics. Fiction writers have long portrayed engineers and scientists as deficient
in these areas. Today, modern society, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, and legal requirements
all act as forcing functions to push these broader subjects into the foreground. We start with an
introduction to intelligence and move quickly onto more profound thoughts and ideas. We call this
a Life, the Universe and Everything primer, after the famous science fiction book by Douglas Adams.
Forty-two may very well be the right answer, but what are the questions?
