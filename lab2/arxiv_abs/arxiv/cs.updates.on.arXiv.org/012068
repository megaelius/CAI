We study approximation algorithms for graph pricing with vertex capacities yet without the traditional
envy-free constraint. Specifically, we have a set of items $V$ and a set of customers $X$ where each
customer $i \in X$ has a budget $b_i$ and is interested in a bundle of items $S_i \subseteq V$ with $|S_i|
\leq 2$. However, there is a limited supply of each item: we only have $\mu_v$ copies of item $v$ to
sell for each $v \in V$. We should assign prices $p(v)$ to each $v \in V$ and chose a subset $Y \subseteq
X$ of customers so that each $i \in Y$ can afford their bundle ($p(S_i) \leq b_i$) and at most $\mu_v$
chosen customers have item $v$ in their bundle for each item $v \in V$. Each customer $i \in Y$ pays
$p(S_i)$ for the bundle they purchased: our goal is to do this in a way that maximizes revenue. Such
pricing problems have been studied from the perspective of envy-freeness where we also must ensure
that $p(S_i) \geq b_i$ for each $i \notin Y$. However, the version where we simply allocate items
to customers after setting prices and do not worry about the envy-free condition has received less
attention. Our main result is an 8-approximation for the capacitated case via local search and a
7.8096-approximation in simple graphs with uniform vertex capacities. The latter is obtained
by combing a more involved analysis of a multi-swap local search algorithm for constant capacities
and an LP-rounding algorithm for larger capacities. If all capacities are bounded by a constant
$C$, we further show a multi-swap local search algorithm yields an $\left(4 \cdot \frac{2C-1}{C}
+ \epsilon\right)$-approximation. We also give a $(4+\epsilon)$-approximation in simple graphs
through LP rounding when all capacities are very large as a function of $\epsilon$.
