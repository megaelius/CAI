The suffix array is a fundamental data structure for many applications that involve string searching
and data compression. Designing time/space-efficient suffix array construction algorithms
has attracted significant attentions and considerable advances have been made for the past 20 years.
We obtain the \emph{first} in-place suffix array construction algorithms that are optimal both
in time and space for (read-only) integer alphabets. Concretely, we make the following contributions:
1. For integer alphabets, we obtain the first suffix sorting algorithm which takes linear time and
uses only $O(1)$ workspace (the workspace is the space needed beyond the input string and the output
suffix array). The input string may be modified during the execution of the algorithm, but should
be restored upon termination of the algorithm. Our C implementation of the algorithm requires only
8 Bytes of the workspace. 2. We strengthen the first result by providing the first linear time in-place
algorithm for read-only integer alphabets with $|\Sigma|=O(n)$ (i.e., the input string cannot
be modified). This algorithm settles the open problem posed by Franceschini and Muthukrishnan
in ICALP 2007. The open problem asked to design in-place algorithms in $o(n\log n)$ time and ultimately,
in $O(n)$ time for (read-only) integer alphabets with $|\Sigma| \leq n$. Our result is in fact slightly
stronger since we allow $|\Sigma|=O(n)$. 3. Besides, for the read-only general alphabets (i.e.,
only comparisons are allowed), we present an optimal $O(n\log n)$ time in-place suffix sorting
algorithm, recovering the result obtained by Franceschini and Muthukrishnan which was an open
problem posed by Manzini and Ferragina in ESA 2002.
