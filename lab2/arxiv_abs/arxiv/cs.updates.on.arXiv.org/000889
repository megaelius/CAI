This paper analyzes the tweeting behavior of 37 astrophysicists on Twitter and compares their tweeting
behavior with their publication behavior and citation impact to show whether they tweet research-related
topics or not. Astrophysicists on Twitter are selected to compare their tweets with their publications
from Web of Science. Different user groups are identified based on tweeting and publication frequency.
A moderate negative correlation (p=-0.390*) is found between the number of publications and tweets
per day, while retweet and citation rates do not correlate. The similarity between tweets and abstracts
is very low (cos=0.081). User groups show different tweeting behavior such as retweeting and including
hashtags, usernames and URLs. The study is limited in terms of the small set of astrophysicists.
Results are not necessarily representative of the entire astrophysicist community on Twitter
and they most certainly do not apply to scientists in general. Future research should apply the methods
to a larger set of researchers and other scientific disciplines. To a certain extent, this study
helps to understand how researchers use Twitter. The results hint at the fact that impact on Twitter
can neither be equated with nor replace traditional research impact metrics. However, tweets and
other so-called altmetrics might be able to reflect other impact of scientists such as public outreach
and science communication. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study comparing
researchers' tweeting activity and behavior with scientific publication output in terms of quantity,
content and impact.
