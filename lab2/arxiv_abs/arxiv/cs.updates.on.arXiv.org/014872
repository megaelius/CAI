Robotic collectives are large groups (at least 50) of locally sensing and communicating robots
that encompass characteristics of swarms and colonies, whose emergent behaviors accomplish complex
tasks. Future human-collective teams will extend the ability of operators to monitor, respond,
and make decisions in disaster response, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring problems.
This manuscript evaluates two collective best-of-n decision models for enabling collectives
to identify and choose the highest valued target from a finite set of n targets. Two challenges impede
the future use of human-collective shared decisions: 1) environmental bias reduces collective
decision accuracy when poorer targets are easier to evaluate than higher quality targets, and 2)
little is understood about shared human-collective decision making interaction strategies.
The two evaluated collective best-of-n models include an existing insect colony decision model
and an extended bias-reducing model that attempts to reduce environmental bias in order to improve
accuracy. Collectives using these two strategies are compared independently and as members of
human-collective teams. Independently, the extended model is slower than the original model,
but the extended algorithm is 57% more accurate in decisions where the optimal option is more difficult
to evaluate. Human-collective teams using the bias-reducing model require less operator influence
and achieve 25% higher accuracy with difficult decisions, than the human-collective teams using
the original model. Further, a novel human-collective interaction strategy enables operators
to adjust collective autonomy while making multiple simultaneous decisions.
