As technology advances towards more connected and digital environments, medical devices are becoming
increasingly connected to hospital networks and to the Internet, which exposes them, and thus the
patients using them, to new cybersecurity threats. Currently, there is a lack of a methodology dedicated
to information security risk assessment for medical devices. In this study, we present the Threat
identification, ontology-based Likelihood, severity Decomposition, and Risk integration (TLDR)
methodology for information security risk assessment for medical devices. The TLDR methodology
uses the following steps: (1) identifying the potentially vulnerable components of medical devices,
in this case, four different medical imaging devices (MIDs); (2) identifying the potential attacks,
in this case, 23 potential attacks on MIDs; (3) mapping the discovered attacks into a known attack
ontology - in this case, the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classifications (CAPECs); (4)
estimating the likelihood of the mapped CAPECs in the medical domain with the assistance of a panel
of senior healthcare Information Security Experts (ISEs); (5) computing the CAPEC-based likelihood
estimates of each attack; (6) decomposing each attack into several severity aspects and assigning
them weights; (7) assessing the magnitude of the impact of each of the severity aspects for each attack
with the assistance of a panel of senior Medical Experts (MEs); (8) computing the composite severity
assessments for each attack; and finally, (9) integrating the likelihood and severity of each attack
into its risk, and thus prioritizing it. The details of steps six to eight are beyond the scope of the
current study; in the current study, we had replaced them by a single step that included asking the
panel of MEs [in this case, radiologists], to assess the overall severity for each attack and use
it as its severity...
