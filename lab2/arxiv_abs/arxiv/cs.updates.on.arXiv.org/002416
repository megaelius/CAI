3D printing enables the fabrication of complex architectures by automating long sequences of additive
steps. The increasing sophistication of printers, materials, and generative design promises
to make geometric complexity a non-issue in manufacturing; however, this complexity can only be
realized if a design can be translated into a physically executable sequence of printing operations.
We investigate this planning problem for freeform direct-write assembly, in which filaments of
material are deposited through a nozzle translating along a 3D path to create sparse, frame-like
structures. We enumerate the process constraints for different variants of the freeform assembly
process and show that, in the case where material stiffens via a glass transition, determining whether
a feasible sequence exists is NP-complete. Nonetheless, for topologies typically encountered
in real-world applications, finding a feasible or even optimal sequence is a tractable problem.
We develop a sequencing algorithm that maximizes the fidelity of the printed part and minimizes
the probability of print failure by modeling the assembly as a linear, elastic frame. We implement
the algorithm and validate our approach experimentally, printing objects composed of thousands
of sugar alcohol filaments with diameters of 100-200 microns. The assembly planner allows the freeform
process to be applied to arbitrarily complex parts, from tissue engineering and microfluidics
at the micrometer scale, to vascularized functional materials and soft robots at the millimeter
scale, to structural components at the meter scale, thus opening a variety of assembly possibilities.
