Consider the following asynchronous, opportunistic communication model over a graph $G$: in each
round, one edge is activated uniformly and independently at random and (only) its two endpoints
can exchange messages and perform local computations. Under this model, we study the following
random process: The first time a vertex is an endpoint of an active edge, it chooses a random number,
say $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$; then, in each round, the two endpoints of the currently active
edge update their values to their average. We show that, if $G$ exhibits a two-community structure
(for example, two expanders connected by a sparse cut), the values held by the nodes will collectively
reflect the underlying community structure over a suitable phase of the above process, allowing
efficient and effective recovery in important cases. In more detail, we first provide a first-moment
analysis showing that, for a large class of almost-regular clustered graphs that includes the stochastic
block model, the expected values held by all but a negligible fraction of the nodes eventually reflect
the underlying cut signal. We prove this property emerges after a mixing period of length $\mathcal
O(n\log n)$. We further provide a second-moment analysis for a more restricted class of regular
clustered graphs that includes the regular stochastic block model. For this case, we are able to
show that most nodes can efficiently and locally identify their community of reference over a suitable
time window. This results in the first opportunistic protocols that approximately recover community
structure using only polylogarithmic work per node. Even for the above class of regular graphs,
our second moment analysis requires new concentration bounds on the product of certain random matrices
that are technically challenging and possibly of independent interest.
