This paper consider the numerical differentiation of first three order via corresponding Fredholm
integral equation of the first kind in $(0,2\pi)$: Computational schemes with analytic solution
formulas are designed using Galerkin method on trigonometric basis for $ p ( = 1,2,3 ) $ order numerical
differentiation. It is shown that for $ y \in \mathcal{H}^p_0 (0,2\pi) $, where $ \mathcal{H}^p_0
(0,2\pi):= \{ y \in H^p(0,2\pi): y(0) = \cdots = y^{(p-1)} (0) =0 \}, $ above schemes are natively
instable (Corollary 6.2). However, the efficiency of computational scheme could be recovered
by supplementing necessary initial value data and proper truncation strategy: A priori error estimate
is obtained uniformly for first three order numerical differentiations (Theorem 7.1, 8.1, 8.2).
Therefore, an optimal convergence rate $ O( \delta^{\frac{2\mu}{2\mu+1}} ) \ (\mu = \frac{1}{2}
\ \textrm{or} \ 1)$ is obtained provided with periodic Sobolev source condition of order $ 2\mu p
$. Besides, we specify a special type of behaviour for regularization parameter. When RHS $ y $ possesses
the form of \begin{equation*} \sum^p_{k=0} a_k x^k + \sum^{N_1}_{k=1} b_k \cos k t + \sum^{N_2}_{k=1}
c_k \sin k t, \ b_{N_1}, c_{N_2} \neq 0, \end{equation*} the regularization parameter would directly
be determined as \begin{equation*} n^{(p)} = \max(N_1,N_2), \end{equation*} which only depends
on the highest frequency of trigonometric polynomial part of $ y $, not concerned with noise level
$ \delta $. In particular, corresponding to this setting in numerical tests, complete filtering
effect (total error equals to 0) is displayed (Section 9.1). Several numerical examples are given
to show that even derivatives with discontinuity could be recovered well.
