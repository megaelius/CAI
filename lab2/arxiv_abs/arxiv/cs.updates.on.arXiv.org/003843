Energy efficiency is a critical issue for wireless devices operated under stringent power constraint.
Following prior works, we measure the energy cost of a device by its transceiver usage, and the energy
complexity of an algorithm is defined as the maximum number of time slots a device transmits or listens,
over all devices. In a recent paper of Chang et al. (PODC 2018), it was shown that broadcasting in a
multi-hop network of unknown topology can be done in $\text{poly} \log n$ energy. In this paper,
we continue this line of research, and investigate the energy complexity of other fundamental graph
problems in multi-hop networks. Our results are summarized as follows. 1. To avoid spending $\Omega(D)$
energy, the broadcasting protocols of Chang et al. (PODC 2018) do not send the message along a BFS
tree, and it is open whether BFS could be computed in $o(D)$ energy, for sufficiently large $D$. In
this paper we devise an algorithm that attains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ energy cost. 2. We show that
the framework of the ${\Omega}(n /\log^2 n)$ round lower bound proof for computing diameter in CONGEST
of Abboud et al.~(DISC 2017) can be adapted to give an $\tilde{\Omega}(n / \log^3 n)$ energy lower
bound in the wireless network model (with no message size constraint), and this lower bound applies
to $O(\log n)$-arboricity graphs. From the upper bound side, we show that the energy complexity
of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ can be attained for bounded-genus graphs (which includes planar graphs).
3. Our upper bounds for computing diameter can be extended to other graph problems. We show that exact
global minimum cut or approximate $s$--$t$ minimum cut can be computed in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
energy for bounded-genus graphs.
