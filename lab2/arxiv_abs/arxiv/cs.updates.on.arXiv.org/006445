A great number of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) based applications require
energy efficient, long range and low data rate wireless communication links. In order to offer a
competitive solution in these areas, IEEE 802.11 standardization group has defined the "ah" amendment,
the first sub-1GHz WLAN standard, with flexible channel bandwidths, starting from 1MHz, up to 16MHz,
and many other physical and link layer improvements, enabling long-range and energy efficient
communications. However, for some regions, like Europe, the maximum transmitted power in dedicated
frequency band is limited to only 10mW, thus disabling the achievement of ranges which would be close
to targeted of up to 1km. In this paper we examine possibilities for range extension through implementation
of half-duplex decode-and forward (DF) relay station (RS) in communication between an access point
(AP) and an end-station (ST). Assuming a Rician fading channel between AP and RS, and a Rayleigh fading
channel on the RS-ST link, we analytically derive results on achievable ranges for the most robust
modulation and coding schemes (MCSs). Analyses are performed for two different standard adopted
deployment scenarios on the RS-ST link. Moreover, we have analyzed whether the considered most
robust MCSs, known for supporting the longest range, but the lowest data rates, can meet the defined
requirement of at least 100kb/s for the greatest attainable AP-RS-ST distances. We examine data
rate enhancements, brought by coding and using of short packets, for both downlink (DL) and uplink
(UL). Finally, we present bit error rate (BER) results, obtained through simulations of a dual-hop
DF IEEE 802.11ah relay system for the considered MCs. All presented results confirm that IEEE 802.11ah
systems, through deployment of relay stations, become an interesting solution for M2M and IoT based
applications.
