Spanners for low dimensional spaces (e.g. Euclidean space of constant dimension, or doubling metrics)
are well understood. This lies in contrast to the situation in high dimensional spaces, where except
for the work of Har-Peled, Indyk and Sidiropoulos (SODA 2013), who showed that any $n$-point Euclidean
metric has an $O(t)$-spanner with $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/t^2})$ edges, little is known. In this paper
we study several aspects of spanners in high dimensional normed spaces. First, we build spanners
for finite subsets of $\ell_p$ with $1<p\le 2$. Second, our construction yields a spanner which
is both sparse and also {\em light}, i.e., its total weight is not much larger than that of the minimum
spanning tree. In particular, we show that any $n$-point subset of $\ell_p$ for $1<p\le 2$ has an
$O(t)$-spanner with $n^{1+\tilde{O}(1/t^p)}$ edges and lightness $n^{\tilde{O}(1/t^p)}$.
In fact, our results are more general, and they apply to any metric space admitting a certain low diameter
stochastic decomposition. It is known that arbitrary metric spaces have an $O(t)$-spanner with
lightness $O(n^{1/t})$. We exhibit the following tradeoff: metrics with decomposability parameter
$\nu=\nu(t)$ admit an $O(t)$-spanner with lightness $\tilde{O}(\nu^{1/t})$. For example, $n$-point
Euclidean metrics have $\nu\le n^{1/t}$, metrics with doubling constant $\lambda$ have $\nu\le\lambda$,
and graphs of genus $g$ have $\nu\le g$. While these families do admit a ($1+\epsilon$)-spanner,
its lightness depend exponentially on the dimension (resp. $\log g$). Our construction alleviates
this exponential dependency, at the cost of incurring larger stretch.
