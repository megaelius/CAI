Solving a set of simultaneous linear equations is probably the most important topic in numerical
methods. For solving linear equations, iterative methods are preferred over the direct methods
especially when the coefficient matrix is sparse. The rate of convergence of iteration method is
increased by using Successive Relaxation (SR) technique. But SR technique is very much sensitive
to relaxation factor, {\omega}. Recently, hybridization of classical Gauss-Seidel based successive
relaxation technique with evolutionary computation techniques have successfully been used to
solve large set of linear equations in which relaxation factors are self-adapted. In this paper,
a new hybrid algorithm is proposed in which uniform adaptive evolutionary computation techniques
and classical Jacobi based SR technique are used instead of classical Gauss-Seidel based SR technique.
The proposed Jacobi-SR based uniform adaptive hybrid algorithm, inherently, can be implemented
in parallel processing environment efficiently. Whereas Gauss-Seidel-SR based hybrid algorithms
cannot be implemented in parallel computing environment efficiently. The convergence theorem
and adaptation theorem of the proposed algorithm are proved theoretically. And the performance
of the proposed Jacobi-SR based uniform adaptive hybrid evolutionary algorithm is compared with
Gauss-Seidel-SR based uniform adaptive hybrid evolutionary algorithm as well as with both classical
Jacobi-SR method and Gauss-Seidel-SR method in the experimental domain. The proposed Jacobi-SR
based hybrid algorithm outperforms the Gauss-Seidel-SR based hybrid algorithm as well as both
classical Jacobi-SR method and Gauss-Seidel-SR method in terms of convergence speed and effectiveness.
