This work deals with the use of emerging deep learning techniques in future wireless communication
networks. It will be shown that data-driven approaches should not replace, but rather complement
traditional design techniques based on mathematical models. Extensive motivation is given for
why deep learning based on artificial neural networks will be an indispensable tool for the design
and operation of future wireless communications networks, and our vision of how artificial neural
networks should be integrated into the architecture of future wireless communication networks
is presented. A thorough description of deep learning methodologies is provided, starting with
the general machine learning paradigm, followed by a more in-depth discussion about deep learning
and artificial neural networks, covering the most widely-used artificial neural network architectures
and their training methods. Deep learning will also be connected to other major learning frameworks
such as reinforcement learning and transfer learning. A thorough survey of the literature on deep
learning for wireless communication networks is provided, followed by a detailed description
of several novel case-studies wherein the use of deep learning proves extremely useful for network
design. For each case-study, it will be shown how the use of (even approximate) mathematical models
can significantly reduce the amount of live data that needs to be acquired/measured to implement
data-driven approaches. For each application, the merits of the proposed approaches will be demonstrated
by a numerical analysis in which the implementation and training of the artificial neural network
used to solve the problem is discussed. Finally, concluding remarks describe those that in our opinion
are the major directions for future research in this field.
