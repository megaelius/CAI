We consider integer programming problems $\max \{ c^T x : \mathcal{A} x = b, l \leq x \leq u, x \in \mathbb{Z}^{nt}\}$
where $\mathcal{A}$ has a (recursive) block-structure generalizing "$n$-fold integer programs"
which recently received considerable attention in the literature. An $n$-fold IP is an integer
program where $\mathcal{A}$ consists of $n$ repetitions of submatrices $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{r \times
t}$ on the top horizontal part and $n$ repetitions of a matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{s \times t}$ on the
diagonal below the top part. Instead of allowing only two types of block matrices, one for the horizontal
line and one for the diagonal, we generalize the $n$-fold setting to allow for arbitrary matrices
in every block. We show that such an integer program can be solved in time $n^2 t^2 {\phi} \cdot (rs{\Delta})^{\mathcal{O}(rs^2+
sr^2)}$ (ignoring logarithmic factors). Here ${\Delta}$ is an upper bound on the largest absolute
value of an entry of $\mathcal{A}$ and ${\phi}$ is the largest binary encoding length of a coefficient
of $c$. This improves upon the previously best algorithm of Hemmecke, Onn and Romanchuk that runs
in time $n^3t^3 {\phi} \cdot {\Delta}^{\mathcal{O}(t^2s)}$. In particular, our algorithm is
not exponential in the number $t$ of columns of $A$ and $B$. Our algorithm is based on a new upper bound
on the $l_1$-norm of an element of the "Graver basis" of an integer matrix and on a proximity bound
between the LP and IP optimal solutions tailored for IPs with block structure. These new bounds rely
on the "Steinitz Lemma". Furthermore, we extend our techniques to the recently introduced "tree-fold
IPs", where we again present a more efficient algorithm in a generalized setting.
