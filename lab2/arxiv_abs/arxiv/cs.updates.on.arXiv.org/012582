Treasure hunt is the task of finding an inert target by a mobile agent in an unknown environment. We
consider treasure hunt in geometric terrains with obstacles. Both the terrain and the obstacles
are modeled as polygons and both the agent and the treasure are modeled as points. The agent navigates
in the terrain, avoiding obstacles, and finds the treasure when there is a segment of length at most
1 between them, unobstructed by the boundary of the terrain or by the obstacles. The cost of finding
the treasure is the length of the trajectory of the agent. We investigate the amount of information
that the agent needs a priori in order to find the treasure at cost $O(L)$, where $L$ is the length of
the shortest path in the terrain from the initial position of the agent to the treasure, avoiding
obstacles. Following the paradigm of algorithms with advice, this information is given to the agent
in advance as a binary string, by an oracle cooperating with the agent and knowing the whole environment:
the terrain, the position of the treasure and the initial position of the agent. Advice complexity
of treasure hunt is the minimum length of the advice string (up to multiplicative constants) that
enables the agent to find the treasure at cost $O(L)$. We first consider treasure hunt in regular
terrains which are defined as convex polygons with convex $c$-fat obstacles, for some constant
$c>1$. A polygon is $c$-fat if the ratio of the radius of the smallest disc containing it to the radius
of the largest disc contained in it is at most $c$. For the class of regular terrains, we establish
the exact advice complexity of treasure hunt. We then show that advice complexity of treasure hunt
for the class of arbitrary terrains (even for non-convex polygons without obstacles, and even for
those with only horizontal or vertical sides) is exponentially larger than for regular terrains.
