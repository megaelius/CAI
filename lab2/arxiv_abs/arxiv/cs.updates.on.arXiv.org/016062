Robust traffic sign detection and recognition (TSDR) is of paramount importance for the successful
realization of autonomous vehicle technology. The importance of this task has led to a vast amount
of research efforts and many promising methods have been proposed in the existing literature. However,
the SOTA (SOTA) methods have been evaluated on clean and challenge-free datasets and overlooked
the performance deterioration associated with different challenging conditions (CCs) that obscure
the traffic images captured in the wild. In this paper, we look at the TSDR problem under CCs and focus
on the performance degradation associated with them. To overcome this, we propose a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) based TSDR framework with prior enhancement. Our modular approach consists
of a CNN-based challenge classifier, Enhance-Net, an encoder-decoder CNN architecture for image
enhancement, and two separate CNN architectures for sign-detection and classification. We propose
a novel training pipeline for Enhance-Net that focuses on the enhancement of the traffic sign regions
(instead of the whole image) in the challenging images subject to their accurate detection. We used
CURE-TSD dataset consisting of traffic videos captured under different CCs to evaluate the efficacy
of our approach. We experimentally show that our method obtains an overall precision and recall
of 91.1% and 70.71% that is 7.58% and 35.90% improvement in precision and recall, respectively,
compared to the current benchmark. Furthermore, we compare our approach with SOTA object detection
networks, Faster-RCNN and R-FCN, and show that our approach outperforms them by a large margin.
