The generalized version of modularity for multilayer networks, a.k.a. multislice modularity,
is characterized by two model parameters, namely resolution factor and inter-layer coupling factor.
The former corresponds to a notion of layer-specific relevance, whereas the inter-layer coupling
factor represents the strength of node connections across the network layers. Despite the potential
of this approach, the setting of both parameters can be arbitrarily selected, without considering
specific characteristics from the topology of the multilayer network as well as from an available
community structure. Also, the multislice modularity is not designed to explicitly model order
relations over the layers, which is of prior importance for dynamic networks. This paper aims to
overcome the main limitations of the multislice modularity by introducing a new formulation of
modularity for multilayer networks. We revise the role and semantics of both the resolution and
inter-layer coupling factors based on information available from the within-layer and inter-layer
structures of the multilayer communities. Also, our proposed multilayer modularity is general
enough to consider orderings of network layers and their constraints on layer coupling. Experiments
were carried out on synthetic and real-world multilayer networks using state-of-the-art approaches
for multilayer community detection. The obtained results have shown the meaningfulness of the
proposed modularity, revealing the effects of different combinations of the resolution and inter-layer
coupling functions. This work also represents a starting point for the development of new optimization
methods for community detection in multilayer networks.
