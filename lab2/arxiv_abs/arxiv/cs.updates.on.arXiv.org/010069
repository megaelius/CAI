Air conditioning (AC) accounts for a critical portion of the global energy consumption. To improve
its energy performance, it is important to fairly benchmark its energy performance and provide
the evaluation feedback to users. However, this task has not been well tackled in the residential
sector. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to fairly benchmark the AC energy performance
of residential rooms. First, regression model is built for each benchmarked room so that its power
consumption can be predicted given different weather conditions and AC settings. Then, all the
rooms are clustered based on their areas and usual AC temperature set points. Lastly, within each
cluster, rooms are benchmarked based on their predicted power consumption under uniform weather
conditions and AC settings. A real-world case study was conducted with data collected from 44 residential
rooms. Results show that the constructed regression models have an average prediction accuracy
of 85.1% in cross-validation tests, and support vector regression with Gaussian kernel is the overall
most suitable model structure for building the regression model. In the clustering step, 44 rooms
are successfully clustered into seven clusters. By comparing the benchmarking scores generated
by the proposed approach with two sets of scores computed from historical power consumption data,
we demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to eliminate the influences of room areas, weather
conditions, and AC settings on the benchmarking results. Therefore, the proposed benchmarking
approach is valid and fair. As a by-product, the approach is also shown to be useful to investigate
how room areas, weather conditions, and AC settings affect the AC power consumption of rooms in real
life.
