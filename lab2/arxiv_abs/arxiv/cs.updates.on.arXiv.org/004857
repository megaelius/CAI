Motivated by the increasing need to understand the distributed algorithmic foundations of large-scale
graph computations, we study some fundamental graph problems in a message-passing model for distributed
computing where $k \geq 2$ machines jointly perform computations on graphs with $n$ nodes (typically,
$n \gg k$). The input graph is assumed to be initially randomly partitioned among the $k$ machines,
a common implementation in many real-world systems. Communication is point-to-point, and the
goal is to minimize the number of communication {\em rounds} of the computation. Our main contribution
is the {\em General Lower Bound Theorem}, a theorem that can be used to show non-trivial lower bounds
on the round complexity of distributed large-scale data computations. The General Lower Bound
Theorem is established via an information-theoretic approach that relates the round complexity
to the minimal amount of information required by machines to solve the problem. Our approach is generic
and this theorem can be used in a "cookbook" fashion to show distributed lower bounds in the context
of several problems, including non-graph problems. We present two applications by showing (almost)
tight lower bounds for the round complexity of two fundamental graph problems, namely {\em PageRank
computation} and {\em triangle enumeration}. Our approach, as demonstrated in the case of PageRank,
can yield tight lower bounds for problems (including, and especially, under a stochastic partition
of the input) where communication complexity techniques are not obvious. Our approach, as demonstrated
in the case of triangle enumeration, can yield stronger round lower bounds as well as message-round
tradeoffs compared to approaches that use communication complexity techniques.
