For people with chronic pain (CP), the assessment of protective behavior during physical functioning
is essential to understand their subjective pain-related experiences (e.g., fear and anxiety
toward pain and injury) and how they deal with such experiences (avoidance or reliance on specific
body joints), with the ultimate goal of guiding intervention. Advances in deep learning (DL) can
enable the development of such intervention. Using the EmoPain MoCap dataset, we investigate how
attention-based DL architectures can be used to improve the detection of protective behavior by
capturing the most informative biomechanical cues characterizing specific movements and the
strategies used to execute them to cope with pain-related experience. We propose an end-to-end
neural network architecture based on attention mechanism, named BodyAttentionNet (BANet). BANet
is designed to learn temporal and body-joint regions that are informative to the detection of protective
behavior. The approach can consider the variety of ways people execute one movement (including
healthy people) and it is independent of the type of movement analyzed. We also explore variants
of this architecture to understand the contribution of both temporal and bodily attention mechanisms.
Through extensive experiments with other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques used
with motion capture data, we show a statistically significant improvement achieved by combining
the two attention mechanisms. In addition, the BANet architecture requires a much lower number
of parameters than the state-of-the-art ones for comparable if not higher performances.
