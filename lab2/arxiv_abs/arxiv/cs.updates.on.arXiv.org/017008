Human movements are characterized by highly non-linear and multi-dimensional interactions within
the motor system. Recently, an increasing emphasis on machine-learning applications has led to
a significant contribution to the field of gait analysis, e.g., in increasing the classification
performance. In order to ensure the generalizability of the machine-learning models, different
data preprocessing steps are usually carried out to process the measured raw data before the classifications.
In the past, various methods have been used for each of these preprocessing steps. However, there
are hardly any standard procedures or rather systematic comparisons of these different methods
and their impact on the classification performance. Therefore, the aim of this analysis is to compare
different combinations of commonly applied data preprocessing steps and test their effects on
the classification performance of gait patterns. A publicly available dataset on intra-individual
changes of gait patterns was used for this analysis. Forty-two healthy participants performed
6 sessions of 15 gait trials for 1 day. For each trial, two force plates recorded the 3D ground reaction
forces (GRFs). The data was preprocessed with the following steps: GRF filtering, time derivative,
time normalization, data reduction, weight normalization and data scaling. Subsequently, combinations
of all methods from each preprocessing step were analyzed by comparing their prediction performance
in a six-session classification using Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifiers, Multi-Layer
Perceptrons, and Convolutional Neural Networks. In conclusion, the present results provide first
domain-specific recommendations for commonly applied data preprocessing methods and might help
to build more comparable and more robust classification models based on machine learning that are
suitable for a practical application.
