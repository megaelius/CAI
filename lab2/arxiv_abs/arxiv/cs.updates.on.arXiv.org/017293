Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) provides a unique concept for simultaneous and fast acquisition
of multiple quantitative MR parameters. Despite acquisition efficiency, adoption of MRF into
the clinics is hindered by its dictionary matching-based reconstruction, which is computationally
demanding and lacks scalability. Here, we propose a convolutional neural network-based reconstruction,
which enables both accurate and fast reconstruction of parametric maps, and is adaptable based
on the needs of spatial regularization and the capacity for the reconstruction. We evaluated the
method using MRF T1-FF, an MRF sequence for T1 relaxation time of water (T1H2O) and fat fraction (FF)
mapping. We demonstrate the method's performance on a highly heterogeneous dataset consisting
of 164 patients with various neuromuscular diseases imaged at thighs and legs. We empirically show
the benefit of incorporating spatial regularization during the reconstruction and demonstrate
that the method learns meaningful features from MR physics perspective. Further, we investigate
the ability of the method to handle highly heterogeneous morphometric variations and its generalization
to anatomical regions unseen during training. The obtained results outperform the state-of-the-art
in deep learning-based MRF reconstruction. The method achieved normalized root mean squared errors
of 0.048 $\pm$ 0.011 for T1H2O maps and 0.027 $\pm$ 0.004 for FF maps when compared to the dictionary
matching in a test set of 50 patients. Coupled with fast MRF sequences, the proposed method has the
potential of enabling multiparametric MR imaging in clinically feasible time.
