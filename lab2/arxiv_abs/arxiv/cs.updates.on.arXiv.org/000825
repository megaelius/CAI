We consider a model of adversarial wiretap channel where an adversary selects a fraction $\rho_r$
of a transmitted codeword to read, and selects a fraction $\rho_w$ of the codeword, to "add" adversarial
error to. This model captures jamming adversaries with partial access to the wireless channel,
as well as adversaries that partially control paths in networks. An $(\epsilon,\delta)$-$\mathsf{AWTP}$
protocol transmits messages from Alice to Bob, guaranteeing that the privacy loss of the transmitted
message is bounded by $\epsilon$, and the success chance of the adversary in causing the decoder
to output in error, is bounded by $\delta$. It was shown that secure and reliable communication (arbitrary
small $\epsilon$ and $\delta$) over this channel is possible when $\rho_r + \rho_w <1$. In this
paper we consider the case that $\rho_r + \rho_w >1$, and show that secure communication is possible
when the communicants have access to a public discussion channel, and not all codeword components
are read and/or written to, by the adversary. We, (i) formalize the model of $\mathsf{AWTP_{PD}}$
protocol and define secrecy, reliability, and efficiency in terms of the rate of information transmission
and round complexity, (ii) derive a tight upper bound on the rate, and a tight lower bound on the required
number of rounds for an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-$\mathsf{AWTP_{PD}}$, and (iii) give the construction
of optimal protocols with minimum number of rounds, and with the rate approaching the upper bound.
We show the implication of these results for Secure Message Transmission with Public Discussion,
and discuss our results, and direction for future research.
