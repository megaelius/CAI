The unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), during early December 2019 in
Wuhan, China, has quickly evolved into a global pandemic, became a matter of grave concern, and placed
government agencies worldwide in a precarious position. The scarcity of resources and lack of experiences
to endure the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the fear of future consequences has established
the need for adoption of emerging and future technologies to address the upcoming challenges. Since
the last five months, the amount of pandemic impact has reached its pinnacle that is altering everyone's
life; and humans are now bound to adopt safe ways to survive under the risk of being affected. Technological
advances are now accelerating faster than ever before to stay ahead of the consequences and acquire
new capabilities to build a safer world. Thus, there is a rising need to unfold the power of emerging,
future and disruptive technologies to explore all possible ways to fight against COVID-19. In this
review article, we attempt to study all emerging, future, and disruptive technologies that can
be utilized to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Building on background insights, detailed technological
specific use cases to fight against COVID-19 have been discussed in terms of their strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats (SWOT). As concluding remarks, we highlight prioritized research
areas and upcoming opportunities to blur the lines between the physical, digital, and biological
domain-specific challenges and also illuminate collaborative research directions for moving
towards a post-COVID-19 world.
