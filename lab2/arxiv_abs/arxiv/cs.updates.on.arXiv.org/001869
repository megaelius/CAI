A software project has "Hero Developers" when 80% of contributions are delivered by 20% of the developers.
Are such heroes a good idea? Are too many heroes bad for software quality? Is it better to have more/less
heroes for different kinds of projects? To answer these questions, we studied 661 open source projects
from Public open source software (OSS) Github and 171 projects from an Enterprise Github. We find
that hero projects are very common. In fact, as projects grow in size, nearly all project become hero
projects. These findings motivated us to look more closely at the effects of heroes on software development.
Analysis shows that the frequency to close issues and bugs are not significantly affected by the
presence of project type (Public or Enterprise). Similarly, the time needed to resolve an issue/bug/enhancement
is not affected by heroes or project type. This is a surprising result since, before looking at the
data, we expected that increasing heroes on a project will slow down howfast that project reacts
to change. However, we do find a statistically significant association between heroes, project
types, and enhancement resolution rates. Heroes do not affect enhancement resolution rates in
Public projects. However, in Enterprise projects, the more heroes increase the rate at which project
complete enhancements. In summary, our empirical results call for a revision of a long-held truism
in software engineering. Software heroes are far more common and valuable than suggested by the
literature, particularly for medium to large Enterprise developments. Organizations should
reflect on better ways to find and retain more of these heroes
