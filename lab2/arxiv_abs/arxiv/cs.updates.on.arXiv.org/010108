Collaborative filtering based recommender systems have proven to be extremely successful in settings
where user preference data on items is abundant. However, collaborative filtering algorithms
are hindered by their weakness against the item cold-start problem and general lack of interpretability.
Ontology-based recommender systems exploit hierarchical organizations of users and items to
enhance browsing, recommendation, and profile construction. While ontology-based approaches
address the shortcomings of their collaborative filtering counterparts, ontological organizations
of items can be difficult to obtain for items that mostly belong to the same category (e.g., television
series episodes). In this paper, we present an ontology-based recommender system that integrates
the knowledge represented in a large ontology of literary themes to produce fiction content recommendations.
The main novelty of this work is an ontology-based method for computing similarities between items
and its integration with the classical Item-KNN (K-nearest neighbors) algorithm. As a study case,
we evaluated the proposed method against other approaches by performing the classical rating prediction
task on a collection of Star Trek television series episodes in an item cold-start scenario. This
transverse evaluation provides insights into the utility of different information resources
and methods for the initial stages of recommender system development. We found our proposed method
to be a convenient alternative to collaborative filtering approaches for collections of mostly
similar items, particularly when other content-based approaches are not applicable or otherwise
unavailable. Aside from the new methods, this paper contributes a testbed for future research and
an online framework to collaboratively extend the ontology of literary themes to cover other narrative
content.
