Forensic science suffers from a lack of studies with high-quality design, such as randomized controlled
trials (RCT). Evidence in forensic science may be of insufficient quality, which is a major concern.
Results from RCT are criticized for providing artificial results that are not useful in real life
and unfit for individualized prescription. Various sources of collected data (e.g. data collected
in routine practice) could be exploited for distinct goals. Obstacles remain before such data can
be practically accessed and used, including technical issues. We present an easy-to-use software
dedicated to innovative data analyses for practitioners and researchers. We provide 2 examples
in forensics. Spe3dLab has been developed by 3 French teams: a bioinformatics laboratory (LaTIM),
a private partner (Tekliko) and a department of forensic medicine (Jean Verdier Hospital). It was
designed to be open source, relying on documented and maintained libraries, query-oriented and
capable of handling the entire data process from capture to export of best predictive models for
their integration in information systems. Spe3dLab was used for 2 specific forensics applications:
i) the search for multiple causal factors and ii) the best predictive model of the functional impairment
(total incapacity to work, TIW) of assault survivors. 2,892 patients were included over a 6-month
period. Time to evaluation was the only direct cause identified for TIW, and victim category was
an indirect cause. The specificity and sensitivity of the predictive model were 99.9% and 90%, respectively.
Spe3dLab is a quick and efficient tool for accessing observational, routinely collected data and
performing innovative analyses. Analyses can be exported for validation and routine use by practitioners,
e.g., for computer-aided evaluation of complex problems. It can provide a fully integrated solution
for individualized medicine.
