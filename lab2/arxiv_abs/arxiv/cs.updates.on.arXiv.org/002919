In Taobao, the largest e-commerce platform in China, billions of items are provided and typically
displayed with their images. For better user experience and business effectiveness, Click Through
Rate (CTR) prediction in online advertising system exploits abundant user historical behaviors
to identify whether a user is interested in a candidate ad. Enhancing behavior representations
with user behavior images will bring user's visual preference and can greatly help CTR prediction.
So we propose to model user preference jointly with user behavior ID features and behavior images.
However, comparing with utilizing candidate ad image in CTR prediction which only introduces one
image in one sample, training with user behavior images brings tens to hundreds of images in one sample,
giving rise to a great challenge in both communication and computation. With the well-known Parameter
Server (PS) framework, implementing such model needs to communicate the raw image features, leading
to unacceptable communication load. It indicates PS is not suitable for this scenario. In this paper,
we propose a novel and efficient distributed machine learning paradigm called Advanced Model Server
(AMS). In AMS, the forward/backward process can also happen in the server side, and only high level
semantic features with much smaller size need to be sent to workers. AMS thus dramatically reduces
the communication load, which enables the arduous joint training process. Based on AMS, the methods
of effectively combining the images and ID features are carefully studied, and then we propose a
Deep Image CTR Model. Our approach is shown to achieve significant improvements in both online and
offline evaluations, and has been deployed in Taobao display advertising system serving the main
traffic.
