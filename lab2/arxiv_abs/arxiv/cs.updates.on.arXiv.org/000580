We introduce a new structure for a set of points in the plane and an angle $\alpha$, which is similar
in flavor to a bounded-degree MST. We name this structure $\alpha$-MST. Let $P$ be a set of points
in the plane and let $0 < \alpha \le 2\pi$ be an angle. An $\alpha$-ST of $P$ is a spanning tree of
the complete Euclidean graph induced by $P$, with the additional property that for each point $p
\in P$, the smallest angle around $p$ containing all the edges adjacent to $p$ is at most $\alpha$.
An $\alpha$-MST of $P$ is then an $\alpha$-ST of $P$ of minimum weight. For $\alpha < \pi/3$, an
$\alpha$-ST does not always exist, and, for $\alpha \ge \pi/3$, it always exists. In this paper,
we study the problem of computing an $\alpha$-MST for several common values of $\alpha$. Motivated
by wireless networks, we formulate the problem in terms of directional antennas. With each point
$p \in P$, we associate a wedge $W_p$ of angle $\alpha$ and apex $p$. The goal is to assign an orientation
and a radius $r_p$ to each wedge $W_p$, such that the resulting graph is connected and its MST is an
$\alpha$-MST. (We draw an edge between $p$ and $q$ if $p \in W_q$, $q \in W_p$, and $|pq| \le r_p, r_q$.)
Unsurprisingly, the problem of computing an $\alpha$-MST is NP-hard, at least for $\alpha=\pi$
and $\alpha=2\pi/3$. We present constant-factor approximation algorithms for $\alpha = \pi/2,
2\pi/3, \pi$. One of our major results is a surprising theorem for $\alpha = 2\pi/3$, which, besides
being interesting from a geometric point of view, has important applications. For example, the
theorem guarantees that given any set $P$ of $3n$ points in the plane and any partitioning of the points
into $n$ triplets, one can orient the wedges of each triplet {\em independently}, such that the graph
induced by $P$ is connected. We apply the theorem to the {\em antenna conversion} problem.
