Many problems in geophysical and atmospheric modelling require the fast solution of elliptic partial
differential equations (PDEs) in "flat" three dimensional geometries. In particular, an anisotropic
elliptic PDE for the pressure correction has to be solved at every time step in the dynamical core
of many numerical weather prediction models, and equations of a very similar structure arise in
global ocean models, subsurface flow simulations and gas and oil reservoir modelling. The elliptic
solve is often the bottleneck of the forecast, and an algorithmically optimal method has to be used
and implemented efficiently. Graphics Processing Units have been shown to be highly efficient
for a wide range of applications in scientific computing, and recently iterative solvers have been
parallelised on these architectures. We describe the GPU implementation and optimisation of a
Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) algorithm for the solution of a three dimensional anisotropic
elliptic PDE for the pressure correction in NWP. Our implementation exploits the strong vertical
anisotropy of the elliptic operator in the construction of a suitable preconditioner. As the algorithm
is memory bound, performance can be improved significantly by reducing the amount of global memory
access. We achieve this by using a matrix-free implementation which does not require explicit storage
of the matrix and instead recalculates the local stencil. Global memory access can also be reduced
by rewriting the algorithm using loop fusion and we show that this further reduces the runtime on
the GPU. We demonstrate the performance of our matrix-free GPU code by comparing it to a sequential
CPU implementation and to a matrix-explicit GPU code which uses existing libraries. The absolute
performance of the algorithm for different problem sizes is quantified in terms of floating point
throughput and global memory bandwidth.
