Informally, a chemical reaction network is "atomic" if each reaction may be interpreted as the rearrangement
of indivisible units of matter. There are several reasonable definitions formalizing this idea.
We investigate the computational complexity of deciding whether a given network is atomic according
to each of these definitions. Our first definition, primitive atomic, which requires each reaction
to preserve the total number of atoms, is to shown to be equivalent to mass conservation. Since it
is known that it can be decided in polynomial time whether a given chemical reaction network is mass-conserving,
the equivalence gives an efficient algorithm to decide primitive atomicity. Another definition,
subset atomic, further requires that all atoms are species. We show that deciding whether a given
network is subset atomic is in $\textsf{NP}$, and the problem "is a network subset atomic with respect
to a given atom set" is strongly $\textsf{NP}$-$\textsf{Complete}$. A third definition, reachably
atomic, studied by Adleman, Gopalkrishnan et al., further requires that each species has a sequence
of reactions splitting it into its constituent atoms. We show that there is a $\textbf{polynomial-time
algorithm}$ to decide whether a given network is reachably atomic, improving upon the result of
Adleman et al. that the problem is $\textbf{decidable}$. We show that the reachability problem
for reachably atomic networks is $\textsf{Pspace}$-$\textsf{Complete}$. Finally, we demonstrate
equivalence relationships between our definitions and some special cases of another existing
definition of atomicity due to Gnacadja.
