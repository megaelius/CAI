Quantitative image analysis often depends on accurate classification of pixels through a segmentation
process. However, imaging artifacts such as the partial volume effect and sensor noise complicate
the classification process. These effects increase the pixel intensity variance of each constituent
class, causing intensities from one class to overlap with another. This increased variance makes
threshold based segmentation methods insufficient due to ambiguous overlap regions in the pixel
intensity distributions. The class ambiguity becomes even more complex for systems with more than
two constituents, such as unsaturated moist granular media. In this paper, we propose an image processing
workflow that improves segmentation accuracy for multiphase systems. First, the ambiguous transition
regions between classes are identified and removed, which allows for global thresholding of single-class
regions. Then the transition regions are classified using a distance function, and finally both
segmentations are combined into one classified image. This workflow includes three methodologies
for identifying transition pixels and we demonstrate on a variety of synthetic images that these
approaches are able to accurately separate the ambiguous transition pixels from the single-class
regions. For situations with typical amounts of image noise, misclassification errors and area
differences calculated between each class of the synthetic images and the resultant segmented
images range from 0.69-1.48% and 0.01-0.74%, respectively, showing the segmentation accuracy
of this approach. We demonstrate that we are able to accurately segment x-ray microtomography images
of moist granular media using these computationally efficient methodologies.
