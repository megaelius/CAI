With the advent of big data applications and the increasing amount of data being produced in these
applications, the importance of efficient methods for big data analysis has become highly evident.
However, the success of any such method will be hindered should the data lacks the required quality.
Big data quality assessment is therefore a major requirement for any organization or business that
use big data analytics for its decision making. On the other hand, using contextual information
is advantageous in many analysis tasks in various domains, e.g. user behavior analysis in the social
networks. However, the big data quality assessment has benefited less from this potential. There
is a vast variety of data sources in the big data domain that can be utilized to improve the quality
evaluation of big data. Including contextual information provided by these sources into the big
data quality assessment process is an emerging trend towards more advanced techniques aimed at
enhancing the performance and accuracy of quality assessment. This paper presents a context classification
framework for big data quality, categorizing the context features into four primary dimensions:
1) context category, 2) data source type that contextual features come from, 3) discovery and extraction
method of context, and 4) the quality factors affected by the contextual data. The proposed model
introduces new context features and dimensions that need to be taken into consideration in quality
assessment of big data. The initial evaluation demonstrates that the model is more understandable,
more comprehensive, richer, and more useful compared to existing models.
