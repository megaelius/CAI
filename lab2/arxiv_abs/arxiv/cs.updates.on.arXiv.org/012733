Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak hours, by storing some
content at the user's local cache memory, even without knowledge of user's later demands. Maddah-Ali
and Niesen proposed a two-phase (placement phase and delivery phase) coded caching strategy for
broadcast channels with cache-aided users. This paper investigates the same model under the constraint
that content is placed uncoded within the caches, that is, when bits of the files are simply copied
within the caches. When the cache contents are uncoded and the users' demands are revealed, the caching
problem can be connected to an index coding problem. This paper focuses on deriving fundamental
performance limits for the caching problem by using tools for the index coding problem that were
either known or are newly developed in this work. First, a converse bound for the caching problem
under the constraint of uncoded cache placement is proposed based on the "acyclic index coding converse
bound". This converse bound is proved to be achievable by the Maddah-Ali and Niesen's scheme when
the number of files is not less than the number of users, and by a newly derived index coding achievable
scheme otherwise. The proposed index coding achievable scheme is based on distributed source coding
and strictly improves on the widely used "composite (index) coding" achievable bound and its improvements,
and is of independent interest. An important consequence of the findings of this paper is that advancements
on the coded caching problem posed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen are thus only possible by considering
strategies with coded placement phase. A recent work by Yu et al. has however shown that coded cache
placement can at most half the network load compared to the results presented in this paper.
