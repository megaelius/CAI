Neuromorphic computing devices attempt to emulate features of biological nervous systems through
mimicking the properties of synapses, towards implementing the emergent properties of their counterparts,
such as learning. Inspired by recent advances in the utilisation of liquid marbles (microlitre
quantities of fluid coated in hydrophobic powder) for the creation of unconventional computing
devices, we describe the development of liquid marbles with neuromorphic properties through the
use of copper coatings and 1.0 mg/ml carbon nanotube-containing fluid cores. Experimentation
was performed through sandwiching the marbles between two cup-style electrodes and stimulating
them with repeated DC pulses at 3.0 V. Our results demonstrate that `entrainment' of a carbon nanotube
filled-copper liquid marble via periodic pulses can cause their electrical resistance to rapidly
switch between high to low resistance profiles, upon inverting the polarity of stimulation: the
reduction in resistance between high and low profiles was approximately 88\% after two rounds of
entrainment. This effect was found to be reversible through reversion to the original stimulus
polarity and was strengthened by repeated experimentation, as evidenced by a mean reduction in
time to switching onset of 43\%. These effects were not replicated in nanotube solutions not bound
inside liquid marbles. Our electrical characterisation also reveals that nanotube-filled liquid
marbles exhibit pinched loop hysteresis IV profiles consistent with the description of memristors.
We conclude by discussing the applications of this technology to the development of unconventional
computing devices and the study of emergent characteristics in biological neural tissue.
