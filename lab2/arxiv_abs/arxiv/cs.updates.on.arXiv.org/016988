A context-aware recommender system (CARS) applies sensing and analysis of user context to provide
personalized services. The contextual information can be driven from sensors in order to improve
the accuracy of the recommendations. Yet, generating accurate recommendations is not enough to
constitute a useful system from the users' perspective, since certain contextual information
may cause different issues, such as draining the user's battery, privacy issues, and more. Adding
high-dimensional contextual information may increase both the dimensionality and sparsity of
the model. Previous studies suggest reducing the amount of contextual information by selecting
the most suitable contextual information using a domain knowledge. Another solution is compressing
it into a denser latent space, thus disrupting the ability to explain the recommendation item to
the user, and damaging users' trust. In this paper we present an approach for selecting low-dimensional
subsets of the contextual information and incorporating them explicitly within CARS. Specifically,
we present a novel feature-selection algorithm, based on genetic algorithms (GA), that outperforms
SOTA dimensional-reduction CARS algorithms, improves the accuracy and the explainability of
the recommendations, and allows for controlling user aspects, such as privacy and battery consumption.
Furthermore, we exploit the top subsets that are generated along the evolutionary process, by learning
multiple deep context-aware models and applying a stacking technique on them, thus improving the
accuracy while remaining at the explicit space. We evaluated our approach on two high-dimensional
context-aware datasets driven from smartphones. An empirical analysis of our results validates
that our proposed approach outperforms SOTA CARS models while improving transparency and explainability
to the user.
