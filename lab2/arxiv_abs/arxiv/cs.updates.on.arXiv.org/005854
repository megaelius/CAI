Due to its high computational speed and accuracy compared to ab-initio quantum chemistry and forcefield
modeling, the prediction of molecular properties using machine learning has received great attention
in the fields of materials design and drug discovery. A main ingredient required for machine learning
is a training dataset consisting of molecular features\textemdash for example fingerprint bits,
chemical descriptors, etc. that adequately characterize the corresponding molecules. However,
choosing features for any application is highly non-trivial. No "universal" method for feature
selection exists. In this work, we propose a data fusion framework that uses Independent Vector
Analysis to exploit underlying complementary information contained in different molecular featurization
methods, bringing us a step closer to automated feature generation. Our approach takes an arbitrary
number of individual feature vectors and automatically generates a single, compact (low dimensional)
set of molecular features that can be used to enhance the prediction performance of regression models.
At the same time our methodology retains the possibility of interpreting the generated features
to discover relationships between molecular structures and properties. We demonstrate this on
the QM7b dataset for the prediction of several properties such as atomization energy, polarizability,
frontier orbital eigenvalues, ionization potential, electron affinity, and excitation energies.
In addition, we show how our method helps improve the prediction of experimental binding affinities
for a set of human BACE-1 inhibitors. To encourage more widespread use of IVA we have developed the
PyIVA Python package, an open source code which is available for download on Github.
