Compressive sensing (CS) has been studied and applied in structural health monitoring for wireless
data acquisition and transmission, structural modal identification, and spare damage identification.
The key issue in CS is finding the optimal solution for sparse optimization. In the past years, many
algorithms have been proposed in the field of applied mathematics. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based
approach to solve the CS data-reconstruction problem. By treating a computation process as a data
flow, the process of CS-based data reconstruction is formalized into a standard supervised-learning
task. The prior knowledge, i.e., the basis matrix and the CS-sampled signals, are used as the input
and the target of the network; the basis coefficient matrix is embedded as the parameters of a certain
layer; the objective function of conventional compressive sensing is set as the loss function of
the network. Regularized by l1-norm, these basis coefficients are optimized to reduce the error
between the original CS-sampled signals and the masked reconstructed signals with a common optimization
algorithm. Also, the proposed network can handle complex bases, such as a Fourier basis. Benefiting
from the nature of a multi-neuron layer, multiple signal channels can be reconstructed simultaneously.
Meanwhile, the disassembled use of a large-scale basis makes the method memory-efficient. A numerical
example of multiple sinusoidal waves and an example of field-test wireless data from a suspension
bridge are carried out to illustrate the data-reconstruction ability of the proposed approach.
The results show that high reconstruction accuracy can be obtained by the machine learning-based
approach. Also, the parameters of the network have clear meanings; the inference of the mapping
between input and output is fully transparent, making the CS data reconstruction neural network
interpretable.
