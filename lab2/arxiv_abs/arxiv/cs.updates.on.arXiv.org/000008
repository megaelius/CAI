Mulmuley recently gave an explicit version of Noether's Normalization lemma for ring of invariants
of matrices under simultaneous conjugation, under the conjecture that there are deterministic
black-box algorithms for polynomial identity testing (PIT). He argued that this gives evidence
that constructing such algorithms for PIT is beyond current techniques. In this work, we show this
is not the case. That is, we improve Mulmuley's reduction and correspondingly weaken the conjecture
regarding PIT needed to give explicit Noether Normalization. We then observe that the weaker conjecture
has recently been nearly settled by the authors, who gave quasipolynomial size hitting sets for
the class of read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABPs). This gives the desired
explicit Noether Normalization unconditionally, up to quasipolynomial factors. We also study
the strength of conjectures that Mulmuley requires to obtain similar results as ours. We prove that
his conjectures are stronger, in the sense that the computational model he needs PIT algorithms
for is equivalent to the well-known algebraic branching program (ABP) model, which is provably
stronger than the ROABP model. Also, as a consequence of our work we give a deterministic parallel
polynomial-time algorithm for deciding if two matrix tuples have intersecting orbit closures,
under simultaneous conjugation. We also show that the corresponding problem for (non-closed)
orbits is reducible to PIT of ABPs, and thus solvable in randomized parallel polynomial-time. Finally,
we consider the depth-3 diagonal circuit model as defined by Saxena, as PIT algorithms for this model
also have implications in Mulmuley's work. Previous work have given quasipolynomial size hitting
sets for this model. In this work, we give a much simpler construction of such hitting sets, using
techniques of Shpilka and Volkovich.
