Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) propagation channel characterization plays a key role on
the design and performance analysis of Vehicular Visible Light Communication (VVLC) systems.
Current OWC channel models based on deterministic and stochastic methods, fail to address mobility
induced ambient light, optical turbulence and road reflection effects on channel characterization.
Therefore, alternative machine learning (ML) based schemes, considering ambient light, optical
turbulence, road reflection effects in addition to intervehicular distance and geometry, are
proposed to obtain accurate VVLC channel loss and channel frequency response (CFR). This work demonstrates
synthesis of ML based VVLC channel model frameworks through multi layer perceptron feed-forward
neural network (MLP), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) and Random Forest ensemble
learning algorithms. Predictor and response variables, collected through practical road measurements,
are employed to train and validate proposed models for various conditions. Additionally, the importance
of different predictor variables on channel loss and CFR is assessed, normalized importance of
features for measured VVLC channel is introduced. We show that RBF-NN, Random Forest and MLP based
models yield more accurate channel loss estimations with 3.53 dB, 3.81 dB, 3.95 dB root mean square
error (RMSE), respectively, when compared to fitting curve based VVLC channel model with 7 dB RMSE.
Moreover, RBF-NN and MLP models are demonstrated to predict VVLC CFR with respect to distance, ambient
light and receiver inclination angle predictor variables with 3.78 dB and 3.60 dB RMSE respectively.
