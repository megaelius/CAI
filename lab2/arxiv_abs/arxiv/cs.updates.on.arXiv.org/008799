Arctic environments are rapidly changing under the warming climate. Of particular interest are
wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most effective terrestrial long-term carbon
store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon that was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes
available for aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,
back to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this transfer of carbon from the
land to the atmosphere further contributes to global warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost
degradation in a positive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and dynamics
is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy. However, the identification and delineation
of these important wetland ecosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent
of Arctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional, coarser remote
sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and micro-topographically complex
non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic wetlands, presenting the need for better identification
methods. To tackle this challenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind
Arctic Wetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural network that exploits
the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from nanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats)
with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM project, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six
types, in which three Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold efforts
to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the choice of fusion strategies.
Preliminary results endorse the high promise of ArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out
set of regions in our Arctic study area.
