Generic visual tracking is difficult due to many challenge factors (e.g., occlusion, blur, etc.).
Each of these factors may cause serious problems for a tracking algorithm, and when they work together
can make things even more complicated. Despite a great amount of efforts devoted to understanding
the behavior of tracking algorithms, reliable and quantifiable ways for studying the per factor
tracking behavior remain barely available. Addressing this issue, in this paper we contribute
to the community a tracking diagnosis toolkit, TracKlinic, for diagnosis of challenge factors
of tracking algorithms. TracKlinic consists of two novel components focusing on the data and analysis
aspects, respectively. For the data component, we carefully prepare a set of 2,390 annotated videos,
each involving one and only one major challenge factor. When analyzing an algorithm for a specific
challenge factor, such one-factor-per-sequence rule greatly inhibits the disturbance from other
factors and consequently leads to more faithful analysis. For the analysis component, given the
tracking results on all sequences, it investigates the behavior of the tracker under each individual
factor and generates the report automatically. With TracKlinic, a thorough study is conducted
on ten state-of-the-art trackers on nine challenge factors (including two compound ones). The
results suggest that, heavy shape variation and occlusion are the two most challenging factors
faced by most trackers. Besides, out-of-view, though does not happen frequently, is often fatal.
By sharing TracKlinic, we expect to make it much easier for diagnosing tracking algorithms, and
to thus facilitate developing better ones.
