The best known size lower bounds against unrestricted circuits have remained around $3n$ for several
decades. Moreover, the only known technique for proving lower bounds in this model, gate elimination,
is inherently limited to proving lower bounds of less than $5n$. In this work, we propose a non-gate-elimination
approach for obtaining circuit lower bounds, via certain depth-three lower bounds. We prove that
every (unbounded-depth) circuit of size $s$ can be expressed as an OR of $2^{s/3.9}$ $16$-CNFs.
For DeMorgan formulas, the best known size lower bounds have been stuck at around $n^{3-o(1)}$ for
decades. Under a plausible hypothesis about probabilistic polynomials, we show that $n^{4-\varepsilon}$-size
DeMorgan formulas have $2^{n^{1-\Omega(\varepsilon)}}$-size depth-3 circuits which are approximate
sums of $n^{1-\Omega(\varepsilon)}$-degree polynomials over ${\mathbb F}_2$. While these structural
results do not immediately lead to new lower bounds, they do suggest new avenues of attack on these
longstanding lower bound problems. Our results complement the classical depth-$3$ reduction
results of Valiant, which show that logarithmic-depth circuits of linear size can be computed by
an OR of $2^{\varepsilon n}$ $n^{\delta}$-CNFs, and slightly stronger results for series-parallel
circuits. It is known that no purely graph-theoretic reduction could yield interesting depth-3
circuits from circuits of super-logarithmic depth. We overcome this limitation (for small-size
circuits) by taking into account both the graph-theoretic and functional properties of circuits
and formulas. We show that improvements of the following pseudorandom constructions imply new
circuit lower bounds: dispersers for varieties, correlation with constant degree polynomials,
matrix rigidity, and hardness for depth-$3$ circuits with constant bottom fan-in.
