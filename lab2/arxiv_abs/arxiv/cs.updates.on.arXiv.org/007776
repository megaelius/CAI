Organic Solar Cells are a promising technology for solving the clean energy crisis in the world.
However, generating candidate chemical compounds for solar cells is a time-consuming process
requiring thousands of hours of laboratory analysis. For a solar cell, the most important property
is the power conversion efficiency which is dependent on the highest occupied molecular orbitals
(HOMO) values of the donor molecules. Recently, machine learning techniques have proved to be very
useful in building predictive models for HOMO values of donor structures of Organic Photovoltaic
Cells (OPVs). Since experimental datasets are limited in size, current machine learning models
are trained on data derived from calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Molecular
line notations such as SMILES or InChI are popular input representations for describing the molecular
structure of donor molecules. The two types of line representations encode different information,
such as SMILES defines the bond types while InChi defines protonation. In this work, we present an
ensemble deep neural network architecture, called SINet, which harnesses both the SMILES and InChI
molecular representations to predict HOMO values and leverage the potential of transfer learning
from a sizeable DFT-computed dataset- Harvard CEP to build more robust predictive models for relatively
smaller HOPV datasets. Harvard CEP dataset contains molecular structures and properties for 2.3
million candidate donor structures for OPV while HOPV contains DFT-computed and experimental
values of 350 and 243 molecules respectively. Our results demonstrate significant performance
improvement from the use of transfer learning and leveraging both molecular representations.
