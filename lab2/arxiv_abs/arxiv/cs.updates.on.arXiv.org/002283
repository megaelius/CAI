Understanding the mechanisms underlying the formation of cultural traits, such as preferences,
opinions and beliefs is an open challenge. Trait formation is intimately connected to cultural
dynamics, which has been the focus of a variety of quantitative models. Recently, some studies have
emphasized the importance of connecting those models to snapshots of cultural dynamics that are
empirically accessible. By analyzing data obtained from different sources, it has been suggested
that culture has properties that are universally present, and that empirical cultural states differ
systematically from randomized counterparts. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible
for the observed patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural model
for generating cultural states that retain those robust, empirical properties. One ingredient
of the model, already used in previous work, assumes that every individual's set of traits is partly
dictated by one of several, universal "rationalities", informally postulated by several social
science theories. The second, new ingredient taken from the same theories assumes that, apart from
a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure to the other rationalities.
It is shown that both ingredients are required for reproducing the empirical regularities. This
key result suggests that the effects of cultural dynamics in the real world can be described as an
interplay of multiple, mixing rationalities, and thus provides indirect evidence for the class
of social science theories postulating such mixing. The model should be seen as a static, effective
description of culture, while a dynamical, more fundamental description is left for future research.
