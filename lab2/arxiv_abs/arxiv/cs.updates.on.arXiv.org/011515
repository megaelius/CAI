Background and Objective: It is commonly accepted that accurate monitoring of neurodegenerative
diseases is crucial for effective disease management and delivery of medication and treatment.
This research develops automatic clinical monitoring techniques for PD, following treatment,
using the novel application of EAs. Specifically, the research question addressed was: Can accurate
monitoring of PD be achieved using EAs on rs-fMRI data for patients prescribed Modafinil (typically
prescribed for PD patients to relieve physical fatigue)? Methods: This research develops novel
clinical monitoring tools using data from a controlled experiment where participants were administered
Modafinil versus placebo, examining the novel application of EAs to both map and predict the functional
connectivity in participants using rs-fMRI data. Specifically, CGP was used to classify DCM analysis
and timeseries data. Results were validated with two other commonly used classification methods
(ANN and SVM) and via k-fold cross-validation. Results: Findings revealed a maximum accuracy of
74.57% for CGP. Furthermore, CGP provided comparable performance accuracy relative to ANN and
SVM. Nevertheless, EAs enable us to decode the classifier, in terms of understanding the data inputs
that are used, more easily than in ANN and SVM. Conclusions: These findings underscore the applicability
of both DCM analyses for classification and CGP as a novel classification technique for brain imaging
data with medical implications for medication monitoring. Furthermore, classification of fMRI
data for research typically involves statistical modelling techniques being often hypothesis
driven, whereas EAs use data-driven explanatory modelling methods resulting in numerous benefits.
DCM analysis is novel for classification and advantageous as it provides information on the causal
links between different brain regions.
