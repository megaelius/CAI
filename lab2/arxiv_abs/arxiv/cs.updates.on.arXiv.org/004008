In this paper, we propose a novel curvature-penalized minimal path model via an orientation-lifted
Finsler metric and the Euler elastica curve. The original minimal path model computes the globally
minimal geodesic by solving an Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE). Essentially, this
first-order model is unable to penalize curvature which is related to the path rigidity property
in the classical active contour models. To solve this problem, we present an Eikonal PDE-based Finsler
elastica minimal path approach to address the curvature-penalized geodesic energy minimization
problem. We were successful at adding the curvature penalization to the classical geodesic energy.
The basic idea of this work is to interpret the Euler elastica bending energy via a novel Finsler elastica
metric that embeds a curvature penalty. This metric is non-Riemannian, anisotropic and asymmetric,
and is defined over an orientation-lifted space by adding to the image domain the orientation as
an extra space dimension. Based on this orientation lifting, the proposed minimal path model can
benefit from both the curvature and orientation of the paths. Thanks to the fast marching method,
the global minimum of the curvature-penalized geodesic energy can be computed efficiently. We
introduce two anisotropic image data-driven speed functions that are computed by steerable filters.
Based on these orientation-dependent speed functions, we can apply the proposed Finsler elastica
minimal path model to the applications of closed contour detection, perceptual grouping and tubular
structure extraction. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that these
applications of the proposed model indeed obtain promising results.
