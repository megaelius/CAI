Fixed and mobile telecom operators, enterprise network operators and cloud providers strive to
face the challenging demands coming from the evolution of IP networks (e.g. huge bandwidth requirements,
integration of billions of devices and millions of services in the cloud). Proposed in the early
2010's, the Segment Routing (SR) architecture helps facing these challenging demands and it is
being adopted and deployed. The SR architecture is based on the concept of source routing and has
interesting scalability properties as it dramatically reduces the amount of state information
to be configured in the core nodes to support complex services. The SR architecture has been first
implemented with the MPLS dataplane and then, quite recently, with the IPv6 dataplane (SRv6). The
IPv6 SR architecture (SRv6) has been extended from the simple steering of packets across nodes to
a general network programming approach, making it very suitable for use cases like Service Function
Chaining and Network Function Virtualization. In this paper we present a tutorial and a comprehensive
survey on the SR technology, analyzing standardization efforts, research activities and implementation
results. We start with an introduction on the motivations for Segment Routing and an overview of
its evolution and standardization. Then, we provide a tutorial on the Segment Routing technology,
with focus on the novel SRv6 solution. We discuss the standardization efforts, providing details
on the most important documents and mentioning other ongoing activities. Then, we thoroughly analyze
the research activities according to a taxonomy. We have identified 8 main categories during our
analysis of the current state of the art: Monitoring, Traffic Engineering, Failure Recovery, Centrally
Controlled Architectures, Path Encoding, Network Programming, Performance Evaluation and Miscellaneous.
We report the current status of SR...
