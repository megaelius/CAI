It is widely accepted that optimization of medical imaging system performance should be guided
by task-based measures of image quality (IQ). Task-based measures of IQ quantify the ability of
an observer to perform a specific task such as detection or estimation of a signal (e.g., a tumor).
For binary signal detection tasks, the Bayesian Ideal Observer (IO) sets an upper limit of observer
performance and has been advocated for use in optimizing medical imaging systems and data-acquisition
designs. Except in special cases, determination of the IO test statistic is analytically intractable.
Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques can be employed to approximate IO detection performance,
but their reported applications have been limited to relatively simple object models. In cases
where the IO test statistic is difficult to compute, the Hotelling Observer (HO) can be employed.
To compute the HO test statistic, potentially large covariance matrices must be accurately estimated
and subsequently inverted, which can present computational challenges. This work investigates
supervised learning-based methodologies for approximating the IO and HO test statistics. Convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and single-layer neural networks (SLNNs) are employed to approximate the
IO and HO test statistics, respectively. Numerical simulations were conducted for both signal-known-exactly
(SKE) and signal-known-statistically (SKS) signal detection tasks. The performances of the supervised
learning methods are assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the results
are compared to those produced by use of traditional numerical methods or analytical calculations
when feasible. The potential advantages of the proposed supervised learning approaches for approximating
the IO and HO test statistics are discussed.
