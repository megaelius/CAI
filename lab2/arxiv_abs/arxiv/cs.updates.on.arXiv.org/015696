Ensemble smoothers are among the most successful and efficient techniques currently available
for history matching. However, because these methods rely on Gaussian assumptions, their performance
is severely degraded when the prior geology is described in terms of complex facies distributions.
Inspired by the impressive results obtained by deep generative networks in areas such as image and
video generation, we started an investigation focused on the use of autoencoders networks to construct
a continuous parameterization for facies models. In our previous publication, we combined a convolutional
variational autoencoder (VAE) with the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA)
for history matching production data in models generated with multiple-point geostatistics.
Despite the good results reported in our previous publication, a major limitation of the designed
parameterization is the fact that it does not allow applying distance-based localization during
the ensemble smoother update, which limits its application in large-scale problems. The present
work is a continuation of this research project focusing in two aspects: firstly, we benchmark seven
different formulations, including VAE, generative adversarial network (GAN), Wasserstein GAN,
variational auto-encoding GAN, principal component analysis (PCA) with cycle GAN, PCA with transfer
style network and VAE with style loss. These formulations are tested in a synthetic history matching
problem with channelized facies. Secondly, we propose two strategies to allow the use of distance-based
localization with the deep learning parameterizations.
