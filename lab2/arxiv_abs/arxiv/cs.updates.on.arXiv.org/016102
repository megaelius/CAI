Genetic Programming (GP) has been primarily used to tackle optimization, classification, and
feature selection related tasks. The widespread use of GP is due to its flexible and comprehensible
tree-type structure. Similarly, research is also gaining momentum in the field of Image Processing,
because of its promising results over vast areas of applications ranging from medical Image Processing
to multispectral imaging. Image Processing is mainly involved in applications such as computer
vision, pattern recognition, image compression, storage, and medical diagnostics. This universal
nature of images and their associated algorithm, i.e., complexities, gave an impetus to the exploration
of GP. GP has thus been used in different ways for Image Processing since its inception. Many interesting
GP techniques have been developed and employed in the field of Image Processing, and consequently,
we aim to provide the research community an extensive view of these techniques. This survey thus
presents the diverse applications of GP in Image Processing and provides useful resources for further
research. Also, the comparison of different parameters used in different applications of Image
Processing is summarized in tabular form. Moreover, analysis of the different parameters used
in Image Processing related tasks is carried-out to save the time needed in the future for evaluating
the parameters of GP. As more advancement is made in GP methodologies, its success in solving complex
tasks, not only in Image Processing but also in other fields, may increase. Additionally, guidelines
are provided for applying GP in Image Processing related tasks, the pros and cons of GP techniques
are discussed, and some future directions are also set.
