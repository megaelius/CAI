Individuals post stroke experience motor impairments, such as loss of independent joint control,
leading to an overall reduction in arm function. Their motion becomes slower and more discoordinated,
making it difficult to complete timing-sensitive tasks, such as balancing a glass of water or carrying
a bowl with a ball inside it. Understanding how the stroke-induced motor impairments interact with
each other can help design assisted training regimens for improved recovery. In this study, we investigate
the effects of abnormal joint coupling patterns induced by flexion synergy on timing-sensitive
motor coordination in the paretic upper limb. We design a virtual ball-in-bowl task that requires
fast movements for optimal performance and implement it on a robotic system, capable of providing
varying levels of abduction loading at the shoulder. We recruit 12 participants (6 individuals
with chronic stroke and 6 unimpaired controls) and assess their skill at the task at 3 levels of loading,
defined by the vertical force applied at the robot end-effector. Our results show that, for individuals
with stroke, loading has a significant effect on their ability to generate quick coordinated motion.
With increases in loading, their overall task performance decreases and they are less able to compensate
for ball dynamics---frequency analysis of their motion indicates that abduction loading weakens
their ability to generate movements at the resonant frequency of the dynamic task. This effect is
likely due to an increased reliance on lower resolution indirect motor pathways in individuals
post stroke. Given the inter-dependency of loading and dynamic task performance, we can create
targeted robot-aided training protocols focused on improving timing-sensitive motor control,
similar to existing progressive loading therapies, which have shown efficacy for expanding reachable
workspace post stroke.
