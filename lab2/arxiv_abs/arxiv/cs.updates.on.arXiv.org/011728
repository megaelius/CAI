Principal component analysis (PCA) is arguably the most widely used dimension reduction method
for vector type data. When applied to image data, PCA demands the images to be portrayed as vectors.
The resulting computation is heavy because it will solve an eigenvalue problem of a huge covariance
matrix due to the vectorization step. To mitigate the computation burden, multilinear PCA (MPCA)
that generates each basis vector using a column vector and a row vector with a Kronecker product was
introduced, for which the success was demonstrated on face image sets. However, when we apply MPCA
on the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) particle images, the results are not satisfactory when
compared with PCA. On the other hand, to compare the reduced spaces as well as the number of parameters
of MPCA and PCA, Kronecker Envelope PCA (KEPCA) was proposed to provide a PCA-like basis from MPCA.
Here, we apply KEPCA to denoise cryo-EM images through a two-stage dimension reduction (2SDR) algorithm.
2SDR first applies MPCA to extract the projection scores and then applies PCA on these scores to further
reduce the dimension. 2SDR has two benefits that it inherits the computation advantage of MPCA and
its projection scores are uncorrelated as those of PCA. Testing with three cryo-EM benchmark experimental
datasets shows that 2SDR performs better than MPCA and PCA alone in terms of the computation efficiency
and denoising quality. Remarkably, the denoised particles boxed out from the 2SDR-denoised micrographs
allow subsequent structural analysis to reach a high-quality 3D density map. This demonstrates
that the high resolution information can be well preserved through this 2SDR denoising strategy.
