Recent years have witnessed dramatic growth in smart vehicles and computation-intensive jobs,
which pose new challenges to the provision of efficient services related to the internet of vehicles.
Graph jobs, in which computations are represented by graphs consisting of components (denoting
either data sources or data processing) and edges (corresponding to data flows between the components)
are one type of computation-intensive job warranting attention. Limitations on computational
resources and capabilities of on-board equipment are primary obstacles to fulfilling the requirements
of such jobs. Vehicular clouds, formed by a collection of vehicles allowing jobs to be offloaded
among vehicles, can substantially alleviate heavy on-board workloads and enable on-demand provisioning
of computational resources. In this article, we present a novel framework for vehicular clouds
that maps components of graph jobs to service providers via opportunistic vehicle-to-vehicle
communication. Then, graph job allocation over vehicular clouds is formulated as a form of non-linear
integer programming with respect to vehicles' contact duration and available resources, aiming
to minimize job completion time and data exchange cost. The problem is approached from two scenarios:
low-traffic and rush-hours. For the former, we determine the optimal solutions for the problem.
In the latter case, given intractable computations for deriving feasible allocations, we propose
a novel low-complexity randomized algorithm. Numerical analysis and comparative evaluations
are performed for the proposed algorithms under different graph job topologies and vehicular cloud
configurations.
