Neuro-evolution and neural architecture search algorithms have gained increasing interest due
to the challenges involved in designing optimal artificial neural networks (ANNs). While these
algorithms have been shown to possess the potential to outperform the best human crafted architectures,
a less common use of them is as a tool for analysis of ANN structural components and connectivity structures.
In this work, we focus on this particular use-case to develop a rigorous examination and comparison
framework for analyzing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) applied to time series prediction using
the novel neuro-evolutionary process known as Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory
Models (EXAMM). Specifically, we use our EXAMM-based analysis to investigate the capabilities
of recurrent memory cells and the generalization ability afforded by various complex recurrent
connectivity patterns that span one or more steps in time, i.e., deep recurrent connections. EXAMM,
in this study, was used to train over 10.56 million RNNs in 5,280 repeated experiments with varying
components. While many modern, often hand-crafted RNNs rely on complex memory cells (which have
internal recurrent connections that only span a single time step) operating under the assumption
that these sufficiently latch information and handle long term dependencies, our results show
that networks evolved with deep recurrent connections perform significantly better than those
without. More importantly, in some cases, the best performing RNNs consisted of only simple neurons
and deep time skip connections, without any memory cells. These results strongly suggest that utilizing
deep time skip connections in RNNs for time series data prediction not only deserves further, dedicated
study, but also demonstrate the potential of neuro-evolution as a means to better study, understand,
and train effective RNNs.
