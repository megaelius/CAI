The world-changing blockchain technique provides a novel method to establish a secure, trusted
and decentralized system for solving the security and personal privacy problems in Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. The mining process in blockchain requires miners to solve
a proof-of-work puzzle, which requires high computational power. However, the lightweight IIoT
devices cannot directly participate in the mining process due to the limitation of power and computational
resources. The edge computing service makes it possible for IIoT applications to build a blockchain
network, in which IIoT devices purchase computational resources from edge servers and thus can
offload their computational tasks. The amount of computational resource purchased by IIoT devices
depends on how many profits they can get in the mining process, and will directly affect the security
of the blockchain network. In this paper, we investigate the incentive mechanism for the blockchain
platform to attract IIoT devices to purchase more computational power from edge servers to participate
in the mining process, thereby building a more secure blockchain network. We model the interaction
between the blockchain platform and IIoT devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the blockchain
platform act as the leader, and IIoT devices act as followers. We analyze the existence and uniqueness
of the Stackelberg equilibrium, and propose an efficient algorithm to compute the Stackelberg
equilibrium point. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm through extensive
simulations, and analyze the strategies of blockchain platform and IIoT devices under different
situations.
