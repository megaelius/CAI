This paper presents a survey and a comparative evaluation of recent techniques for moving cast shadow
detection. We identify shadow removal as a critical step for improving object detection and tracking.
The survey covers methods published during the last decade, and places them in a feature-based taxonomy
comprised of four categories: chromacity, physical, geometry and textures. A selection of prominent
methods across the categories is compared in terms of quantitative performance measures (shadow
detection and discrimination rates, colour desaturation) as well as qualitative observations.
Furthermore, we propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for determining
the practical usefulness of shadow detection methods. The evaluation indicates that all shadow
detection approaches make different contributions and all have individual strength and weaknesses.
Out of the selected methods, the geometry-based technique has strict assumptions and is not generalisable
to various environments, but it is a straightforward choice when the objects of interest are easy
to model and their shadows have different orientation. The chromacity based method is the fastest
to implement and run, but it is sensitive to noise and less effective in low saturated scenes. The
physical method improves upon the accuracy of the chromacity method by adapting to local shadow
models, but fails when the spectral properties of the objects are similar to that of the background.
The small-region texture based method is especially robust for pixels whose neighbourhood is textured,
but may take longer to implement and is the most computationally expensive. The large-region texture
based method produces the most accurate results, but has a significant computational load due to
its multiple processing steps.
