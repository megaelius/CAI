The use of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agricultural knowledge management systems is one of the
most promising approaches to increasing the efficiency of agriculture. However, the existing
physical sensors in agriculture are limited for monitoring various changes in the characteristics
of crops and may be expensive for the average farmer. We propose a combination of physical and human
sensors (the five human senses). By using their own eyes, ears, noses, tongues, and fingers, farmers
could check the various changes in the characteristics and conditions (colors of leaves, diseases,
pests, faulty or malfunctioning equipment) of their crops and equipment, verbally describe their
observations, and capture the descriptions with audio recording devices, such as smartphones.
The voice recordings could be transcribed into text by web servers. The data captured by the physical
and human sensors (voice messages) are analyzed by data and text mining to create and improve agricultural
knowledge. An agricultural knowledge management system using physical and human sensors encourages
to share and transfer knowledge among farmers for the purpose of improving the efficiency and productivity
of agriculture. We applied one such agricultural knowledge management system (smart voice messaging
system) to a greenhouse vegetable farm in Hokkaido. A qualitative analysis of accumulated voice
messages and an interview with the farmer demonstrated the effectiveness of this system. The contributions
of this study include a new and practical approach to an "agricultural Internet of Everything (IoE)"
and evidence of its effectiveness as a result of our trial experiment at a real vegetable farm.
