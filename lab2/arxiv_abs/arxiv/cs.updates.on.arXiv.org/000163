In an earlier paper, a new theory of measurefree "conditional" objects was presented. In this paper,
emphasis is placed upon the motivation of the theory. The central part of this motivation is established
through an example involving a knowledge-based system. In order to evaluate combination of evidence
for this system, using observed data, auxiliary at tribute and diagnosis variables, and inference
rules connecting them, one must first choose an appropriate algebraic logic description pair (ALDP):
a formal language or syntax followed by a compatible logic or semantic evaluation (or model). Three
common choices- for this highly non-unique choice - are briefly discussed, the logics being Classical
Logic, Fuzzy Logic, and Probability Logic. In all three,the key operator representing implication
for the inference rules is interpreted as the often-used disjunction of a negation (b => a) = (b'v
a), for any events a,b. However, another reasonable interpretation of the implication operator
is through the familiar form of probabilistic conditioning. But, it can be shown - quite surprisingly
- that the ALDP corresponding to Probability Logic cannot be used as a rigorous basis for this interpretation!
To fill this gap, a new ALDP is constructed consisting of "conditional objects", extending ordinary
Probability Logic, and compatible with the desired conditional probability interpretation of
inference rules. It is shown also that this choice of ALDP leads to feasible computations for the
combination of evidence evaluation in the example. In addition, a number of basic properties of
conditional objects and the resulting Conditional Probability Logic are given, including a characterization
property and a developed calculus of relations.
