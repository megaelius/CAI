The cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising paradigm to meet the stringent requirements
of the fifth generation (5G) wireless systems. Meanwhile, wireless traffic prediction is a key
enabler for C-RANs to improve both the spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency through load-aware
network managements. This paper proposes a scalable Gaussian process (GP) framework as a promising
solution to achieve large-scale wireless traffic prediction in a cost-efficient manner. Our contribution
is three-fold. First, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to empower GP regression
with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parallel hyper-parameter optimization
in the training phase, where such a scalable training framework well balances the local estimation
in baseband units (BBUs) and information consensus among BBUs in a principled way for large-scale
executions. Second, in the prediction phase, we fuse local predictions obtained from the BBUs via
a cross-validation based optimal strategy, which demonstrates itself to be reliable and robust
for general regression tasks. Moreover, such a cross-validation based optimal fusion strategy
is built upon a well acknowledged probabilistic model to retain the valuable closed-form GP inference
properties. Third, we propose a C-RAN based scalable wireless prediction architecture, where
the prediction accuracy and the time consumption can be balanced by tuning the number of the BBUs
according to the real-time system demands. Experimental results show that our proposed scalable
GP model can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches considerably, in terms of wireless traffic
prediction performance.
