Recent promising effort for spectral reconstruction (SR) focuses on learning a complicated mapping
through using a deeper and wider convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, most CNN-based
SR algorithms neglect to explore the camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) prior and interdependencies
among intermediate features, thus limiting the representation ability of the network and performance
of SR. To conquer these issues, we propose a novel adaptive weighted attention network (AWAN) for
SR, whose backbone is stacked with multiple dual residual attention blocks (DRAB) decorating with
long and short skip connections to form the dual residual learning. Concretely, we investigate
an adaptive weighted channel attention (AWCA) module to reallocate channel-wise feature responses
via integrating correlations between channels. Furthermore, a patch-level second-order non-local
(PSNL) module is developed to capture long-range spatial contextual information by second-order
non-local operations for more powerful feature representations. Based on the fact that the recovered
RGB images can be projected by the reconstructed hyperspectral image (HSI) and the given CSS function,
we incorporate the discrepancies of the RGB images and HSIs as a finer constraint for more accurate
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AWAN network
in terms of quantitative comparison and perceptual quality over other state-of-the-art SR methods.
