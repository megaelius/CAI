The concept of mathematical modeling is widespread across almost all of the fields of contemporary
science and engineering. Because of the existing necessity of predictions the behavior of natural
phenomena, the researchers develop more and more complex models. However, despite their ability
to better forecasting, the problem of an appropriate fitting ground truth data to those, high-dimensional
and nonlinear models seems to be inevitable. In order to deal with this demanding problem the entire
discipline of data assimilation has been developed. Basing on the Human and Nature Dynamics (HANDY)
model, we have presented a detailed and comprehensive comparison of Approximate Bayesian Computation
(classic data assimilation method) and a novelty approach of Supermodeling. Furthermore, with
the usage of Sensitivity Analysis, we have proposed the methodology to reduce the number of coupling
coefficients between submodels and as a consequence to increase the speed of the Supermodel converging.
In addition, we have demonstrated that usage of Approximate Bayesian Computation method with the
knowledge about parameters' sensitivities could result with satisfactory estimation of the initial
parameters. However, we have also presented the mentioned methodology as unable to achieve similar
predictions to Approximate Bayesian Computation. Finally, we have proved that Supermodeling
with synchronization via the most sensitive variable could effect with the better forecasting
for chaotic as well as more stable systems than the Approximate Bayesian Computation. What is more,
we have proposed the adequate methodologies.
