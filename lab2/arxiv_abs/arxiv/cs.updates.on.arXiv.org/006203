The goal of case-based retrieval is to assist physicians in the clinical decision making process,
by finding relevant medical literature in large archives. We propose a research that aims at improving
the effectiveness of case-based retrieval systems through the use of automatically created document-level
semantic networks. The proposed research tackles different aspects of information systems and
leverages the recent advancements in information extraction and relational learning to revisit
and advance the core ideas of concept-centered hypertext models. We propose a two-step methodology
that in the first step addresses the automatic creation of document-level semantic networks, then
in the second step it designs methods that exploit such document representations to retrieve relevant
cases from medical literature. For the automatic creation of documents' semantic networks, we
design a combination of information extraction techniques and relational learning models. Mining
concepts and relations from text, information extraction techniques represent the core of the
document-level semantic networks' building process. On the other hand, relational learning models
have the task of enriching the graph with additional connections that have not been detected by information
extraction algorithms and strengthening the confidence score of extracted relations. For the
retrieval of relevant medical literature, we investigate methods that are capable of comparing
the documents' semantic networks in terms of structure and semantics. The automatic extraction
of semantic relations from documents, and their centrality in the creation of the documents' semantic
networks, represent our attempt to go one step further than previous graph-based approaches.
