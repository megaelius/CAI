Human-robot interaction can be divided into two categories based on the physical distance between
the human and robot: remote and proximal. In proximal interaction, the human and robot often engage
in close coordination; in remote interaction, the human and robot are less coupled due to communication
constraints. As a result, providing automation for the robot in remote interaction becomes more
important. Thus far, human factor studies on automation in remote human-robot interaction have
been restricted to various forms of supervision, in which the robot is essentially being used as
a smart mobile manipulation platform with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate
the incorporation of general planning capability into the robot to facilitate peer-to-peer human-robot
teaming, in which the human and robot are viewed as teammates that are physically separated. The
human and robot share the same global goal and collaborate to achieve it. Note that humans may feel
uncomfortable at such robot autonomy, which can potentially reduce teaming performance. One important
difference between peer-to-peer teaming and supervised teaming is that an autonomous robot in
peer-to-peer teaming can achieve the goal alone when the task information is completely specified.
However, incompleteness often exists, which implies information asymmetry. While information
asymmetry can be desirable sometimes, it may also lead to the robot choosing improper actions that
negatively influence the teaming performance. We aim to investigate the various trade-offs, e.g.,
mental workload and situation awareness, between these two types of remote human-robot teaming.
