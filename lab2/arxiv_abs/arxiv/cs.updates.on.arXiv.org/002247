Deep learning (DL), a new-generation artificial neural network research, has made profound strides
in recent years. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists with a simple
technical overview, trans-disciplinary progress update, and potentially inspirations about
DL. Effective architectures, more accessible data, advances in regularization, and new computing
power enabled the success of DL. A trans-disciplinary review reveals that DL is rapidly transforming
myriad scientific disciplines including high-energy physics, astronomy, chemistry, genomics
and remote sensing, where systematic DL toolkits, innovative customizations, and sub-disciplines
have emerged. However, with a few exceptions, its adoption in hydrology has so far been gradual.
The literature suggests that novel regularization techniques can effectively prevent high-capacity
deep networks from overfitting. As a result, in most scientific disciplines, DL models demonstrated
superior predictive and generalization performance to conventional methods. Meanwhile, less
noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed "AI neuroscience",
has been born. This budding sub-discipline is accumulating a significant body of work, e.g., distilling
knowledge obtained in DL networks to interpretable models, attributing decisions to inputs via
back-propagation of relevance, or visualization of activations. These methods are designed to
interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights. While scientists so far have
mostly been using customized, ad-hoc methods for interpretation, vast opportunities await for
DL to propel advancement in water science.
