This study here suggests a classification of technologies based on taxonomic characteristics
of interaction between technologies in complex systems that is not a studied research field in economics
of technical change. The proposed taxonomy here categorizes technologies in four typologies,
in a broad analogy with the ecology: 1) technological parasitism is a relationship between two technologies
T1 and T2 in a complex system S where one technology T1 benefits from the interaction with T2, whereas
T2 has a negative side from interaction with T1; 2) technological commensalism is a relationship
between two technologies in S where one technology benefits from the other without affecting it;
3) technological mutualism is a relationship in which each technology benefits from the activity
of the other within complex systems; 4) technological symbiosis is a long-term interaction between
two (or more) technologies that evolve together in complex systems. This taxonomy systematizes
the typologies of interactive technologies within complex systems and predicts their evolutionary
pathways that generate stepwise coevolutionary processes of complex systems of technology. This
study here begins the process of generalizing, as far as possible, critical typologies of interactive
technologies that explain the long-run evolution of technology. The theoretical framework developed
here opens the black box of the interaction between technologies that affects, with different types
of technologies, the evolutionary pathways of complex systems of technology over time and space.
Overall, then, this new theoretical framework may be useful for bringing a new perspective to categorize
the gradient of benefit to technologies from interaction with other technologies that can be a ground
work for development of more sophisticated concepts to clarify technological and economic change
in human society.
