The advent of WWW changed the way we can produce and access information. Recent studies showed that
users tend to select information that is consistent with their system of beliefs, forming polarized
groups of like-minded people around shared narratives where dissenting information is ignored.
In this environment, users cooperate to frame and reinforce their shared narrative making any attempt
at debunking inefficient. Such a configuration occurs even in the consumption of news online, and
considering that 63% of users access news directly form social media, one hypothesis is that more
polarization allows for further spreading of misinformation. Along this path, we focus on the polarization
of users around news outlets on Facebook in different European countries (Italy, France, Spain
and Germany). First, we compare the pages' posting behavior and the users' interacting patterns
across countries and observe different posting, liking and commenting rates. Second, we explore
the tendency of users to interact with different pages (i.e., selective exposure) and the emergence
of polarized communities generated around specific pages. Then, we introduce a new metric -- i.e.,
polarization rank -- to measure polarization of communities for each country. We find that Italy
is the most polarized country, followed by France, Germany and lastly Spain. Finally, we present
a variation of the Bounded Confidence Model to simulate the emergence of these communities by considering
the users' engagement and trust on the news. Our findings suggest that trust in information broadcaster
plays a pivotal role against polarization of users online.
