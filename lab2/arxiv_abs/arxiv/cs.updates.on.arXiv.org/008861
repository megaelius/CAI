In this work, we simulate a scenario, where a publicly available ASV system is used to enhance mimicry
attacks against another closed source ASV system. In specific, ASV technology is used to perform
a similarity search between the voices of recruited attackers (6) and potential target speakers
(7,365) from VoxCeleb corpora to find the closest targets for each of the attackers. In addition,
we consider 'median', 'furthest', and 'common' targets to serve as a reference points. Our goal
is to gain insights how well similarity rankings transfer from the attacker's ASV system to the attacked
ASV system, whether the attackers are able to improve their attacks by mimicking, and how the properties
of the voices of attackers change due to mimicking. We address these questions through ASV experiments,
listening tests, and prosodic and formant analyses. For the ASV experiments, we use i-vector technology
in the attacker side, and x-vectors in the attacked side. For the listening tests, we recruit listeners
through crowdsourcing. The results of the ASV experiments indicate that the speaker similarity
scores transfer well from one ASV system to another. Both the ASV experiments and the listening tests
reveal that the mimicry attempts do not, in general, help in bringing attacker's scores closer to
the target's. A detailed analysis shows that mimicking does not improve attacks, when the natural
voices of attackers and targets are similar to each other. The analysis of prosody and formants suggests
that the attackers were able to considerably change their speaking rates when mimicking, but the
changes in F0 and formants were modest. Overall, the results suggest that untrained impersonators
do not pose a high threat towards ASV systems, but the use of ASV systems to attack other ASV systems
is a potential threat.
