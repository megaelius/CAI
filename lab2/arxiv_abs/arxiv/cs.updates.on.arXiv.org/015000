Determining a process-structure-property relationship is the holy grail of materials science,
where both computational prediction in the forward direction and materials design in the inverse
direction are essential. Problems in materials design are often considered in the context of process-property
linkage by bypassing the materials structure, or in the context of structure-property linkage
as in microstructure-sensitive design problems. However, there is a lack of research effort in
studying materials design problems in the context of process-structure linkage, which has a great
implication in reverse engineering. In this work, given a target microstructure, we propose an
active learning high-throughput microstructure calibration framework to derive a set of processing
parameters, which can produce an optimal microstructure that is statistically equivalent to the
target microstructure. The proposed framework is formulated as a noisy multi-objective optimization
problem, where each objective function measures a deterministic or statistical difference of
the same microstructure descriptor between a candidate microstructure and a target microstructure.
Furthermore, to significantly reduce the physical waiting wall-time, we enable the high-throughput
feature of the microstructure calibration framework by adopting an asynchronously parallel Bayesian
optimization by exploiting high-performance computing resources. Case studies in additive manufacturing
and grain growth are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, where kinetic
Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation is used as a forward predictive model, such that for a given target microstructure,
the target processing parameters that produced this microstructure are successfully recovered.
