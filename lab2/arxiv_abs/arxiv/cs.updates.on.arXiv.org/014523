In fluid dynamics, one of the most important research fields is hydrodynamic instabilities and
their evolution in different flow regimes. The investigation of said instabilities is concerned
with the highly non-linear dynamics. Currently, three main methods are used for understanding
of such phenomenon - namely analytical models, experiments and simulations - and all of them are
primarily investigated and correlated using human expertise. In this work we claim and demonstrate
that a major portion of this research effort could and should be analysed using recent breakthrough
advancements in the field of Computer Vision with Deep Learning (CVDL, or Deep Computer-Vision).
Specifically, we target and evaluate specific state-of-the-art techniques - such as Image Retrieval,
Template Matching, Parameters Regression and Spatiotemporal Prediction - for the quantitative
and qualitative benefits they provide. In order to do so we focus in this research on one of the most
representative instabilities, the Rayleigh-Taylor one, simulate its behaviour and create an
open-sourced state-of-the-art annotated database (RayleAI). Finally, we use adjusted experimental
results and novel physical loss methodologies to validate the correspondence of the predicted
results to actual physical reality to prove the models efficiency. The techniques which were developed
and proved in this work can be served as essential tools for physicists in the field of hydrodynamics
for investigating a variety of physical systems, and also could be used via Transfer Learning to
other instabilities research. A part of the techniques can be easily applied on already exist simulation
results. All models as well as the data-set that was created for this work, are publicly available
