COVID-19 infodemic has been spreading faster than the pandemic itself with misinformation riding
upon the infodemic wave being a major threat to people's health and governance systems. Since social
media is the largest source of information, managing the infodemic not only requires mitigating
of misinformation but also an early understanding of psychological patterns resulting from it.
During the COVID-19 crisis, Twitter alone has seen a sharp 45% increase in the usage of its curated
events page, and a 30% increase in its direct messaging usage, since March 6th 2020. In this study,
we analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official bulletins
related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic
lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep
skip-gram based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related emotions.
We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related emotions in social media and official
bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag relationships between the time series of extracted emotions
from official bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state bulletins
were leading the social media for some emotions such as fear. Further insights that are potentially
relevant for the policymaker and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation
are also discussed. Our paper also introduces CoronaIndiaDataset2, the first social media based
COVID-19 dataset at national and state levels from India with over 5.6 million national and 2.6 million
state-level tweets. Finally, we present our findings as COVibes, an interactive web application
capturing psychometric insights captured upon the CoronaIndiaDataset, both at a national and
state level.
