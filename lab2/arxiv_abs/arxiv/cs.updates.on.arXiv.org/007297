This paper introduces a new solution concept for non-cooperative games in normal form with no ties
and pure strategies: the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium. The players are rational and are perfect
predictors in all possible worlds. A player's decision is perfectly correlated with its anticipation
by other players, unlike in Nash equilibra where the decisions are made independently. The equilibrium,
when it exists, is unique and is Pareto optimal. This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart
of the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium, where the prediction happens "in another room" rather than
in the past. The equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter's superrationality
to non-symmetric games. Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational
strategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a strategy profile that
is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible worlds and rationality in all possible
worlds, a stronger concept than common knowledge of rationality. This paper defines the Perfectly
Transparent Equilibrium algorithmically and, when it exists, proves its uniqueness, its Pareto-optimality,
and that it coincides with the Hofstadter equillibrium on symmetric games. We also relate to concepts
found in literature such as Individual Rationality, Rationalizability, Halpern's and Pass's
Minimax-Rationalizability, Second-Order Nash Equilibria, the Program Equilibrium, the Perfect
Prediction Equilibrium, Shiffrin's Joint-Selfish-Rational Equilibrium, the Stalnaker-Bonanno
Equilibrium, the Perfect Cooperation Equilibrium and the Translucent Equilibrium.
