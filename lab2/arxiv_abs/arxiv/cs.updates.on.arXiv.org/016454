Carpooling has gained considerable importance in developed as well as in developing countries
as an effective solution for controlling vehicular pollution, both sound and air. As carpooling
decreases the number of vehicles used by commuters, it results in multiple benefits like mitigation
of traffic and congestion on the roads, reduced demand for parking facilities, lesser energy or
fuel consumption and most importantly, reduction in carbon emission, thus improving the quality
of life in cities. This work presents a hybrid GA-A* algorithm to obtain optimal routes for the carpooling
problem in the domain of multi-objective optimization having multiple conflicting objectives.
Though Genetic algorithm provides optimal solutions, A* algorithm because of its efficiency in
providing the shortest route between any two points based on heuristics, enhances the optimal routes
obtained using Genetic algorithm. The refined routes, obtained using the GA-A* algorithm, are
further subjected to dominance test to obtain non-dominating solutions based on Pareto-Optimality.
The routes obtained maximize the profit of the service provider by minimizing the travel and detour
distance as well as pick-up/drop costs while maximizing the utilization of the car. The proposed
algorithm has been implemented over the Salt Lake area of Kolkata. Route distance and detour distance
for the optimal routes obtained using the proposed algorithm are consistently lesser for the same
number of passengers when compared with the corresponding data obtained using the existing algorithm.
Various statistical analyses like boxplots have also confirmed that the proposed algorithm regularly
performed better than the existing algorithm using only Genetic Algorithm.
