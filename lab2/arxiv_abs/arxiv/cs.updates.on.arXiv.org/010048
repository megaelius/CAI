This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying weather & climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. This deliverable contains the description of the characteristics
of a second set of so-called numerical weather & climate prediction dwarfs that form key functional
components of prediction models in terms of the science that they encapsulate and in terms of computational
cost they impose on the forecast production. The ESCAPE work flow between work packages centres
on these dwarfs and hence their selection, their performance assessment, code adaptation and optimisation
is crucial for the success of the project. These new dwarfs have been chosen with the purpose of extending
the range of computational characteristic represented by the dwarfs previously selected in batch
1 (see Deliverable D1.1). The dwarfs have been made, their documentation has been compiled and the
software has been made available on the software exchange platform. The dwarfs in this deliverable
include a multigrid elliptic solver, a novel advection scheme for unstructured meshes, an advection
scheme for structured meshes and a radiation scheme. This deliverable includes their scientific
description and the guidance for installation, execution and testing.
