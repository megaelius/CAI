The impact of non verbal behaviour in a hiring decision remains an open question. Investigating
this question is important, as it could provide a better understanding on how to train candidates
for job interviews and make recruiters be aware of influential non verbal behaviour. This research
has recently been accelerated due to the development of tools for the automatic analysis of social
signals, and the emergence of machine learning methods. However, these studies are still mainly
based on hand engineered features, which imposes a limit to the discovery of influential social
signals. On the other side, deep learning methods are a promising tool to discover complex patterns
without the necessity of feature engineering. In this paper, we focus on studying influential non
verbal social signals in asynchronous job video interviews that are discovered by deep learning
methods. We use a previously published deep learning system that aims at inferring the hirability
of a candidate with regard to a sequence of interview questions. One particularity of this system
is the use of attention mechanisms, which aim at identifying the relevant parts of an answer. Thus,
information at a fine-grained temporal level could be extracted using global (at the interview
level) annotations on hirability. While most of the deep learning systems use attention mechanisms
to offer a quick visualization of slices when a rise of attention occurs, we perform an in-depth analysis
to understand what happens during these moments. First, we propose a methodology to automatically
extract slices where there is a rise of attention (attention slices). Second, we study the content
of attention slices by comparing them with randomly sampled slices. Finally, we show that they bear
significantly more information for hirability than randomly sampled slices.
