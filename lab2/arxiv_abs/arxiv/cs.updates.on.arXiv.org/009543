Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most successful approaches for recommender systems.
With the emergence of online social networks, social recommendation has become a popular research
direction. Most of these social recommendation models utilized each user's local neighbors' preferences
to alleviate the data sparsity issue in CF. However, they only considered the local neighbors of
each user and neglected the process that users' preferences are influenced as information diffuses
in the social network. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCN) have shown promising results
by modeling the information diffusion process in graphs that leverage both graph structure and
node feature information. To this end, in this paper, we propose an effective graph convolutional
neural network based model for social recommendation. Based on a classical CF model, the key idea
of our proposed model is that we borrow the strengths of GCNs to capture how users' preferences are
influenced by the social diffusion process in social networks. The diffusion of users' preferences
is built on a layer-wise diffusion manner, with the initial user embedding as a function of the current
user's features and a free base user latent vector that is not contained in the user feature. Similarly,
each item's latent vector is also a combination of the item's free latent vector, as well as its feature
representation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is flexible when user and item features
are not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly
show the effectiveness of our proposed model.
