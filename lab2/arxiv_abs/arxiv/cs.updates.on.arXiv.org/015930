We study the fundamental problem of index coding under an additional privacy constraint that requires
each receiver to learn nothing more about the collection of messages beyond its demanded messages
from the server and what is available to it as side information. To enable such private communication,
we allow the use of a collection of independent secret keys, each of which is shared amongst a subset
of users and is known to the server. The goal is to study properties of the key access structures which
make the problem feasible and then design encoding and decoding schemes efficient in the size of
the server transmission as well as the sizes of the secret keys. We call this the private index coding
problem. We begin by characterizing the key access structures that make private index coding feasible.
We also give conditions to check if a given linear scheme is a valid private index code. For up to three
users, we characterize the rate region of feasible server transmission and key rates, and show that
all feasible rates can be achieved using scalar linear coding and time sharing; we also show that
scalar linear codes are sub-optimal for four receivers. The outer bounds used in the case of three
users are extended to arbitrary number of users and seen as a generalized version of the well-known
polymatroidal bounds for the standard non-private index coding. We also show that the presence
of common randomness and private randomness does not change the rate region. Furthermore, we study
the case where no keys are shared among the users and provide some necessary and sufficient conditions
for feasibility in this setting under a weaker notion of privacy. If the server has the ability to
multicast to any subset of users, we demonstrate how this flexibility can be used to provide privacy
and characterize the minimum number of server multicasts required.
