Fashion as characterized by its nature, is driven by style. In this paper, we propose a method that
takes into account the style information to complete a given set of selected fashion items with a
complementary fashion item. Complementary items are those items that can be worn along with the
selected items according to the style. Addressing this problem facilitates in automatically generating
stylish fashion ensembles leading to a richer shopping experience for users. Recently, there has
been a surge of online social websites where fashion enthusiasts post the outfit of the day and other
users can like and comment on them. These posts contain a gold-mine of information about style. In
this paper, we exploit these posts to train a deep neural network which captures style in an automated
manner. We pose the problem of predicting complementary fashion items as a sequence to sequence
problem where the input is the selected set of fashion items and the output is a complementary fashion
item based on the style information learned by the model. We use the encoder decoder architecture
to solve this problem of completing the set of fashion items. We evaluate the goodness of the proposed
model through a variety of experiments. We empirically observe that our proposed model outperforms
competitive baseline like apriori algorithm by ~28 in terms of accuracy for top-1 recommendation
to complete the fashion ensemble. We also perform retrieval based experiments to understand the
ability of the model to learn style and rank the complementary fashion items and find that using attention
in our encoder decoder model helps in improving the mean reciprocal rank by ~24. Qualitatively we
find the complementary fashion items generated by our proposed model are richer than the apriori
algorithm.
