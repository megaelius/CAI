For offering proactive services to students in intelligent education, one of the fundamental tasks
is predicting their performance (e.g., scores) on future exercises, where it is necessary to track
each student's knowledge acquisition during her exercising activities. However, existing approaches
can only exploit the exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich information
existed in the exercise's materials (e.g., knowledge concepts, exercise content) to achieve both
precise predictions of student performance and interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition
remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction.
To directly achieve the primary goal of prediction, we first propose a general Exercise-Enhanced
Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both student's records and the exercise
contents. In EERNN, we simply summarize each student's state into an integrated vector and trace
it with a recurrent neural network, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of
each exercise's content. For making predictions, we propose two implementations under EERNN with
different strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism.
Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge acquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we
extend EERNN to an explainable Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) by incorporating the knowledge
concept effects, where the student's integrated state vector is extended to a knowledge state matrix.
In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how much each exercise can affect the
mastery of students on concepts during the exercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments
on large-scale real-world data. The results demonstrate the prediction effectiveness of two frameworks
as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.
