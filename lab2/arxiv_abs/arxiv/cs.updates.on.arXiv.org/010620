Increasingly, discrimination by algorithms is perceived as a societal and legal problem. As a response,
a number of criteria for implementing algorithmic fairness in machine learning have been developed
in the literature. This paper proposes the Continuous Fairness Algorithm (CFA$\theta$) which
enables a continuous interpolation between different fairness definitions. More specifically,
we make three main contributions to the existing literature. First, our approach allows the decision
maker to continuously vary between specific concepts of individual and group fairness. As a consequence,
the algorithm enables the decision maker to adopt intermediate ``worldviews'' on the degree of
discrimination encoded in algorithmic processes, adding nuance to the extreme cases of ``we're
all equal'' (WAE) and ``what you see is what you get'' (WYSIWYG) proposed so far in the literature.
Second, we use optimal transport theory, and specifically the concept of the barycenter, to maximize
decision maker utility under the chosen fairness constraints. Third, the algorithm is able to handle
cases of intersectionality, i.e., of multi-dimensional discrimination of certain groups on grounds
of several criteria. We discuss three main examples (credit applications; college admissions;
insurance contracts) and map out the legal and policy implications of our approach. The explicit
formalization of the trade-off between individual and group fairness allows this post-processing
approach to be tailored to different situational contexts in which one or the other fairness criterion
may take precedence. Finally, we evaluate our model experimentally.
