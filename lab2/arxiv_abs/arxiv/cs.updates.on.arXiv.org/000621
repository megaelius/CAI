We study the simple genetic algorithm with a ranking selection mechanism (linear ranking or tournament).
We denote by $\ell$ the length of the chromosomes, by $m$ the population size, by $p_C$ the crossover
probability and by $p_M$ the mutation probability. We introduce a parameter $\sigma$, called the
selection drift, which measures the selection intensity of the fittest chromosome. We show that
the dynamics of the genetic algorithm depend in a critical way on the parameter $$\pi \,=\,\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\ell\,.$$
If $\pi<1$, then the genetic algorithm operates in a disordered regime: an advantageous mutant
disappears with probability larger than $1-1/m^\beta$, where $\beta$ is a positive exponent.
If $\pi>1$, then the genetic algorithm operates in a quasispecies regime: an advantageous mutant
invades a positive fraction of the population with probability larger than a constant $p^*$ (which
does not depend on $m$). We estimate next the probability of the occurrence of a catastrophe (the
whole population falls below a fitness level which was previously reached by a positive fraction
of the population). The asymptotic results suggest the following rules: $\pi=\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\ell$
should be slightly larger than $1$; $p_M$ should be of order $1/\ell$; $m$ should be larger than $\ell\ln\ell$;
the running time should be of exponential order in $m$. The first condition requires that $ \ell p_M
+p_C< \ln\sigma$. These conclusions must be taken with great care: they come from an asymptotic
regime, and it is a formidable task to understand the relevance of this regime for a real-world problem.
At least, we hope that these conclusions provide interesting guidelines for the practical implementation
of the simple genetic algorithm.
