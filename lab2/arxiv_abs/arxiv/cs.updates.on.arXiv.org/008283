Mobile phones provide a powerful sensing platform that researchers may adopt to understand proximity
interactions among people and the diffusion, through these interactions, of diseases, behaviors,
and opinions. However, it remains a challenge to track the proximity-based interactions of a whole
community and then model the social diffusion of diseases and behaviors starting from the observations
of a small fraction of the volunteer population. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that tries
to connect together these sparse observations using a model of how individuals interact with each
other and how social interactions happen in terms of a sequence of proximity interactions. We apply
our approach to track the spreading of flu in the spatial-proximity network of a 3000-people university
campus by mobilizing 300 volunteers from this population to monitor nearby mobile phones through
Bluetooth scanning and to daily report flu symptoms about and around them. Our aim is to predict the
likelihood for an individual to get flu based on how often her/his daily routine intersects with
those of the volunteers. Thus, we use the daily routines of the volunteers to build a model of the volunteers
as well as of the non-volunteers. Our results show that we can predict flu infection two weeks ahead
of time with an average precision from 0.24 to 0.35 depending on the amount of information. This precision
is six to nine times higher than with a random guess model. At the population level, we can predict
infectious population in a two-week window with an r-squared value of 0.95 (a random-guess model
obtains an r-squared value of 0.2). These results point to an innovative approach for tracking individuals
who have interacted with people showing symptoms, allowing us to warn those in danger of infection
and to inform health researchers about the progression of contact-induced diseases.
