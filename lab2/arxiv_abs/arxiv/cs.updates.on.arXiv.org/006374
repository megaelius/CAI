SSDs are emerging storage devices which unlike HDDs, do not have mechanical parts and therefore,
have superior performance compared to HDDs. Due to the high cost of SSDs, entirely replacing HDDs
with SSDs is not economically justified. Additionally, SSDs can endure a limited number of writes
before failing. To mitigate the shortcomings of SSDs while taking advantage of their high performance,
SSD caching is practiced in both academia and industry. Previously proposed caching architectures
have only focused on either performance or endurance and neglected to address both parameters in
suggested architectures. Moreover, the cost, reliability, and power consumption of such architectures
is not evaluated. This paper proposes a hybrid I/O caching architecture that while offers higher
performance than previous studies, it also improves power consumption with a similar budget. The
proposed architecture uses DRAM, Read-Optimized SSD, and Write-Optimized SSD in a three-level
cache hierarchy and tries to efficiently redirect read requests to either DRAM or RO-SSD while sending
writes to WO-SSD. To provide high reliability, dirty pages are written to at least two devices which
removes any single point of failure. The power consumption is also managed by reducing the number
of accesses issued to SSDs. The proposed architecture reconfigures itself between performance-
and endurance-optimized policies based on the workload characteristics to maintain an effective
tradeoff between performance and endurance. We have implemented the proposed architecture on
a server equipped with industrial SSDs and HDDs. The experimental results show that as compared
to state-of-the-art studies, the proposed architecture improves performance and power consumption
by an average of 8% and 28%, respectively, and reduces the cost by 5% while increasing the endurance
cost by 4.7% and negligible reliability penalty.
