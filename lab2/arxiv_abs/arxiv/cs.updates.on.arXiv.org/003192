Consider a directed point-to-point network. We are interested in the asynchronous crash-tolerant
consensus problem in incomplete directed networks in which not all pair of nodes are connected by
a communication channel. Our prior work [35] presented a tight condition, Condition CCA, for achieving
approximate consensus in asynchronous networks. This paper proves tight necessary and sufficient
conditions on the directed communication graphs for solving exact and approximate consensus under
different assumptions. Particularly, we present the following results: -Randomization: We show
that Condition CCA from [35] is also necessary and sufficient for solving exact consensus in asynchronous
directed networks using randomized algorithms. This result implies that randomization does not
affect feasibility of consensus in our context. -Limited Topology Knowledge: We are interested
in the algorithms in which nodes only have k-hop neighborhood knowledge and propagate state values
to nodes that are at most k-hops away. The family of algorithms of interest is called iterative k-hop
algorithms. Unlike the algorithm in [35], these algorithms does not flood the network, and each
node does not need the full topology knowledge. For iterative k-hop algorithms, we derive a family
of tight conditions, namely Condition k-CCA for $1\leq k\leq n$, for solving approximate consensus
in asynchronous directed networks. -Topology Discovery: We consider the case where nodes initially
have only one-hop neighborhood knowledge, i.e., immediate incoming and outgoing neighbors. We
show that Condition CCA from [35] is necessary and sufficient for asynchronous approximate consensus
with one-hop neighborhood knowledge. One result that may be of independent interest is a topology
discovery mechanism to learn and "estimate" the topology in asynchronous directed networks with
crash faults.
