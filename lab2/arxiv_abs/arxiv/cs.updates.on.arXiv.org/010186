Traffic simulation is a cost-effective way to test the deployment of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise
Control (CACC) vehicles in a large-scale transportation network. By using a previously developed
microscopic simulation testbed, this paper examines the impacts of four managed lane strategies
for the near-term deployment of CACC vehicles under mixed traffic conditions. Network-wide performance
measures are investigated from the perspectives of mobility, safety, equity, and environmental
impacts. In addition, the platoon formation performance of CACC vehicles is evaluated with platoon-orientated
measures, such as the percentage of platooned CACC vehicles, average platoon depth, and vehicle-hour-platooned
that is proposed in this paper under the imperfect DSRC communication environment. Moreover, managed
lane score matrices are developed to incorporate heterogeneous categories of performance measures,
aiming to provide a more comprehensive picture for stakeholders. The results show that mixing CACC
traffic along with non-CACC traffic across all travel lanes is an acceptable option when the market
penetration (MP) is lower than 30% for roadways where a managed lane is absent. Providing CACC with
priority access to an existing managed lane, if available, is also a good strategy for improving
the overall traffic performance when the MP is lower than 40%. When the MP reaches above 40%, a dedicated
lane for CACC vehicles is recommended, as it provides greater opportunity for CACC vehicles to form
platoons. The facilitation of homogeneous CACC traffic flow could make further improvements possible
in the future.
