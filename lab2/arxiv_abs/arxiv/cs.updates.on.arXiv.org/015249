Let G = ((A,B),E) be an instance of the stable marriage problem where every vertex ranks its neighbors
in a strict order of preference. A matching M in G is popular if M does not lose a head-to-head election
against any matching. Popular matchings are a well-studied generalization of stable matchings,
introduced with the goal of enlarging the set of admissible solutions, while maintaining a certain
level of fairness. Every stable matching is a min-size popular matching. Unfortunately, when there
are edge costs, it is NP-hard to find a popular matching of minimum cost -- even worse, the min-cost
popular matching problem is hard to approximate up to any factor. Let opt be the cost of a min-cost
popular matching. Our goal is to efficiently compute a matching of cost at most opt by paying the price
of mildly relaxing popularity. Our main positive results are two bi-criteria algorithms that find
in polynomial time a near-popular or quasi-popular matching of cost at most opt. Moreover, one of
the algorithms finds a quasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost popular fractional
matching, which could be much smaller than opt. Key to the other algorithm is a polynomial-size extended
formulation for an integral polytope sandwiched between the popular and quasi-popular matching
polytopes. We complement these results by showing that it is NP-hard to find a quasi-popular matching
of minimum cost, and that both the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes have near-exponential
extension complexity. This version of the paper goes beyond the conference version [12] in the following
two points: (i) the algorithm for finding a quasi-popular matching of cost at most that of a min-cost
popular fractional matching is new; (ii) the proofs from Section 6.1 and Section 7.3 are now self-contained
(the conference version used constructions from [10] to show these lower bounds).
