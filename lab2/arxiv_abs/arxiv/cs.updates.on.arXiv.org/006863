We present a distributed asynchronous algorithm for approximating a single component of the solution
to a system of linear equations $Ax = b$, where $A$ is a positive definite real matrix, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
This is equivalent to solving for $x_i$ in $x = Gx + z$ for some $G$ and $z$ such that the spectral radius
of $G$ is less than 1. Our algorithm relies on the Neumann series characterization of the component
$x_i$, and is based on residual updates. We analyze our algorithm within the context of a cloud computation
model, in which the computation is split into small update tasks performed by small processors with
shared access to a distributed file system. We prove a robust asymptotic convergence result when
the spectral radius $\rho(|G|) < 1$, regardless of the precise order and frequency in which the update
tasks are performed. We provide convergence rate bounds which depend on the order of update tasks
performed, analyzing both deterministic update rules via counting weighted random walks, as well
as probabilistic update rules via concentration bounds. The probabilistic analysis requires
analyzing the product of random matrices which are drawn from distributions that are time and path
dependent. We specifically consider the setting where $n$ is large, yet $G$ is sparse, e.g., each
row has at most $d$ nonzero entries. This is motivated by applications in which $G$ is derived from
the edge structure of an underlying graph. Our results prove that if the local neighborhood of the
graph does not grow too quickly as a function of $n$, our algorithm can provide significant reduction
in computation cost as opposed to any algorithm which computes the global solution vector $x$. Our
algorithm obtains an $\epsilon \|x\|_2$ additive approximation for $x_i$ in constant time with
respect to the size of the matrix when the maximum row sparsity $d = O(1)$ and $1/(1-\|G\|_2) = O(1)$.
