Typical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan may take 20 to 60 minutes. Reducing MRI scan time is
beneficial for both patient experience and cost considerations. Accelerated MRI scan may be achieved
by acquiring less amount of k-space data (down-sampling in the k-space). However, this leads to
lower resolution and aliasing artifacts for the reconstructed images. There are many existing
approaches for attempting to reconstruct high-quality images from down-sampled k-space data,
with varying complexity and performance. In recent years, deep-learning approaches have been
proposed for this task, and promising results have been reported. Still, the problem remains challenging
especially because of the high fidelity requirement in most medical applications employing reconstructed
MRI images. In this work, we propose a deep-learning approach, aiming at reconstructing high-quality
images from accelerated MRI acquisition. Specifically, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
to learn the differences between the aliased images and the original images, employing a U-Net-like
architecture. Further, a micro-architecture termed Residual Dense Block (RDB) is introduced
for learning a better feature representation than the plain U-Net. Considering the peculiarity
of the down-sampled k-space data, we introduce a new term to the loss function in learning, which
effectively employs the given k-space data during training to provide additional regularization
on the update of the network weights. To evaluate the proposed approach, we compare it with other
state-of-the-art methods. In both visual inspection and evaluation using standard metrics, the
proposed approach is able to deliver improved performance, demonstrating its potential for providing
an effective solution.
