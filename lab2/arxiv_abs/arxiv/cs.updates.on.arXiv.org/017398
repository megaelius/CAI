Computing is bottlenecked by data. Large amounts of application data overwhelm storage capability,
communication capability, and computation capability of the modern machines we design today.
As a result, many key applications' performance, efficiency and scalability are bottlenecked
by data movement. In this keynote talk, we describe three major shortcomings of modern architectures
in terms of 1) dealing with data, 2) taking advantage of the vast amounts of data, and 3) exploiting
different semantic properties of application data. We argue that an intelligent architecture
should be designed to handle data well. We show that handling data well requires designing architectures
based on three key principles: 1) data-centric, 2) data-driven, 3) data-aware. We give several
examples for how to exploit each of these principles to design a much more efficient and high performance
computing system. We especially discuss recent research that aims to fundamentally reduce memory
latency and energy, and practically enable computation close to data, with at least two promising
novel directions: 1) performing massively-parallel bulk operations in memory by exploiting the
analog operational properties of memory, with low-cost changes, 2) exploiting the logic layer
in 3D-stacked memory technology in various ways to accelerate important data-intensive applications.
We discuss how to enable adoption of such fundamentally more intelligent architectures, which
we believe are key to efficiency, performance, and sustainability. We conclude with some guiding
principles for future computing architecture and system designs.
