Neuromorphic hardware with non-volatile memory (NVM) can implement machine learning workload
in an energy-efficient manner. Unfortunately, certain NVMs such as phase change memory (PCM) require
high voltages for correct operation. These voltages are supplied from an on-chip charge pump. If
the charge pump is activated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress,
accelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) generated
defects. Forcefully discharging the stressed charge pump can lower the aging rate of its CMOS devices,
but makes the neuromorphic hardware unavailable to perform computations while its charge pump
is being discharged. This negatively impacts performance such as latency and accuracy of the machine
learning workload being executed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to exploit workload-specific
performance and lifetime trade-offs in neuromorphic computing. Our framework first extracts
the precise times at which a charge pump in the hardware is activated to support neural computations
within a workload. This timing information is then used with a characterized NBTI reliability model
to estimate the charge pump's aging during the workload execution. We use our framework to evaluate
workload-specific performance and reliability impacts of using 1) different SNN mapping strategies
and 2) different charge pump discharge strategies. We show that our framework can be used by system
designers to explore performance and reliability trade-offs early in the design of neuromorphic
hardware such that appropriate reliability-oriented design margins can be set.
