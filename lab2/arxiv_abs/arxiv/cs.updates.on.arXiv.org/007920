Accurately identifying anatomical landmarks is a crucial step in deformation analysis and surgical
planning for craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bones. Available methods require segmentation of the
object of interest for precise landmarking. Unlike those, our purpose in this study is to perform
anatomical landmarking using the inherent relation of CMF bones without explicitly segmenting
them. We propose a new deep network architecture, called relational reasoning network (RRN), to
accurately learn the local and the global relations of the landmarks. Specifically, we are interested
in learning landmarks in CMF region: mandible, maxilla, and nasal bones. The proposed RRN works
in an end-to-end manner, utilizing learned relations of the landmarks based on dense-block units
and without the need for segmentation. For a given a few landmarks as input, the proposed system accurately
and efficiently localizes the remaining landmarks on the aforementioned bones. For a comprehensive
evaluation of RRN, we used cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 250 patients. The proposed
system identifies the landmark locations very accurately even when there are severe pathologies
or deformations in the bones. The proposed RRN has also revealed unique relationships among the
landmarks that help us infer several reasoning about informativeness of the landmark points. RRN
is invariant to order of landmarks and it allowed us to discover the optimal configurations (number
and location) for landmarks to be localized within the object of interest (mandible) or nearby objects
(maxilla and nasal). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first of its kind algorithm finding
anatomical relations of the objects using deep learning.
