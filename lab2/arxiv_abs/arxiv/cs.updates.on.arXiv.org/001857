This contribution to a special issue on "Computer-aided processing of intertextuality" in ancient
texts will illustrate how using digital tools to interact with the Hebrew Bible offers new promising
perspectives for visualizing the texts and for performing tasks in education and research. This
contribution explores how the corpus of the Hebrew Bible created and maintained by the Eep Talstra
Centre for Bible and Computer can support new methods for modern knowledge workers within the field
of digital humanities and theology be applied to ancient texts, and how this can be envisioned as
a new field of digital intertextuality. The article first describes how the corpus was used to develop
the Bible Online Learner as a persuasive technology to enhance language learning with, in, and around
a database that acts as the engine driving interactive tasks for learners. Intertextuality in this
case is a matter of active exploration and ongoing practice. Furthermore, interactive corpus-technology
has an important bearing on the task of textual criticism as a specialized area of research that depends
increasingly on the availability of digital resources. Commercial solutions developed by software
companies like Logos and Accordance offer a market-based intertextuality defined by the production
of advanced digital resources for scholars and students as useful alternatives to often inaccessible
and expensive printed versions. It is reasonable to expect that in the future interactive corpus
technology will allow scholars to do innovative academic tasks in textual criticism and interpretation.
We have already seen the emergence of promising tools for text categorization, analysis of translation
shifts, and interpretation. Broadly speaking, interactive tools and tasks within the three areas
of language learning, textual criticism, and Biblical studies illustrate a new kind of intertextuality
emerging within digital humanities.
