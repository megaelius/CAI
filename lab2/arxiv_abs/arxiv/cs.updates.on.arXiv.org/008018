In multimedia crowdsourcing, the requester's quality requirements and reward decisions will
affect the workers' task selection strategies and the quality of their multimedia contributions.
In this paper, we present a first study on how the workers' bounded cognitive rationality interacts
with and affects the decisions and performance of a multimedia crowdsourcing system. Specifically,
we consider a two-stage model, where a requester first determines the reward and the quality requirement
for each task, and the workers select the tasks to accomplish accordingly. First, we consider the
benchmark case where users are fully rational, and derive the requester's optimal rewards and quality
requirements for the tasks. Next, we focus on the more practical bounded rational case by modeling
the workers' task selection behaviors using the cognitive hierarchy theory. Comparing with the
fully rational benchmark, we show that the requester can increase her profit by taking advantage
of the workers' bounded cognitive rationality, especially when the workers' population is large
or the workers' average cognitive level is low. When the workers' average cognitive level is very
high, however, the equilibrium under the practical bounded rational model converges to that under
the benchmark fully rational model. It is because workers at different levels make decisions sequentially
and high cognitive level workers can accurately predict other users' strategies. Under both the
fully and bounded rational models, we show that if workers are heterogeneous but one type of workers
(either the high or the low quality) dominates the platform, the requester cannot make a higher profit
by setting different quality requirements for different tasks.
