The advent of distributed power generation, e.g., from rooftop solar panels, storage and control
devices, is inducing a transformation of a share of electricity consumers into prosumers, those
having a proactive behavior when it comes to managing their consumption, production and energy
storage. This empowerment of consumers brings new opportunities and challenges to the operation
of power systems in a market environment. Recently, a novel proposal for the design and operation
of electricity markets has emerged: these so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets conceptually
allow the prosumers to directly share their electrical energy. Such P2P markets rely on a consumer-centric
and bottom-up perspective by giving the opportunity to consumers to freely choose the way they are
to source their electric energy, for instance based on expressed preferences (e.g. renewable type,
CO2 emissions and localization). A community can also be formed by prosumers who want to collaborate
to share their investments, or in terms of operational energy management. Our paper contributes
with an overview of these new P2P markets that covers the motivation, challenges, market designs
and the potential future developments in this field. Starting from the motivation and enablers
behind the rising of such a disruptive concept for electricity markets, it progresses in presenting
the ongoing research projects and real-world examples. We explore the different P2P market designs
that have been proposed in terms of mathematical formulation, optimization techniques, advantages
and challenges. The future prospects and recommendations about this topic are also made. Finally,
a test-case is also presented to compare the different P2P market designs. The authors have made
the data of the test-case available to allow future research on P2P markets while encouraging reproducibility
and benchmarking.
