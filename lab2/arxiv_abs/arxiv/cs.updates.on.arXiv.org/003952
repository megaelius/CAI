The most popular approach for analyzing survival data is the Cox regression model. The Cox model
may, however, be misspecified, and its proportionality assumption may not always be fulfilled.
An alternative approach for survival prediction is random forests for survival outcomes. The standard
split criterion for random survival forests is the log-rank test statistics, which favors splitting
variables with many possible split points. Conditional inference forests avoid this split variable
selection bias. However, linear rank statistics are utilized by default in conditional inference
forests to select the optimal splitting variable, which cannot detect non-linear effects in the
independent variables. An alternative is to use maximally selected rank statistics for the split
point selection. As in conditional inference forests, splitting variables are compared on the
p-value scale. However, instead of the conditional Monte-Carlo approach used in conditional inference
forests, p-value approximations are employed. We describe several p-value approximations and
the implementation of the proposed random forest approach. A simulation study demonstrates that
unbiased split variable selection is possible. However, there is a trade-off between unbiased
split variable selection and runtime. In benchmark studies of prediction performance on simulated
and real datasets the new method performs better than random survival forests if informative dichotomous
variables are combined with uninformative variables with more categories and better than conditional
inference forests if non-linear covariate effects are included. In a runtime comparison the method
proves to be computationally faster than both alternatives, if a simple p-value approximation
is used.
