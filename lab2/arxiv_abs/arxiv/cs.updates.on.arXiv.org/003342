Automobiles are equipped with Electronic Control Units (ECU) that communicate via in-vehicle
network protocol standards such as Controller Area Network (CAN). These protocols are designed
under the assumption that separating in-vehicle communications from external networks is sufficient
for protection against cyber attacks. This assumption, however, has been shown to be invalid by
recent attacks in which adversaries were able to infiltrate the in-vehicle network. Motivated
by these attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been proposed for in-vehicle networks
that attempt to detect attacks by making use of device fingerprinting using properties such as clock
skew of an ECU. In this paper, we propose the cloaking attack, an intelligent masquerade attack in
which an adversary modifies the timing of transmitted messages in order to match the clock skew of
a targeted ECU. The attack leverages the fact that, while the clock skew is a physical property of
each ECU that cannot be changed by the adversary, the estimation of the clock skew by other ECUs is
based on network traffic, which, being a cyber component only, can be modified by an adversary. We
implement the proposed cloaking attack and test it on two IDSs, namely, the current state-of-the-art
IDS and a new IDS that we develop based on the widely-used Network Time Protocol (NTP). We implement
the cloaking attack on two hardware testbeds, a prototype and a real connected vehicle, and show
that it can always deceive both IDSs. We also introduce a new metric called the Maximum Slackness
Index to quantify the effectiveness of the cloaking attack even when the adversary is unable to precisely
match the clock skew of the targeted ECU.
