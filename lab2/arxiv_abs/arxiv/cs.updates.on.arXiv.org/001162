Motivated by applications in online social networks, we introduce and study the problem of Community
Detection on a new class of sparse \emph{spatial} random graphs embedded in the Euclidean space.
Our random graph is the planted-partition version of the classical random connection model studied
in Stochastic Geometry. Roughly speaking, each node of our graph has an uniform i.i.d. $\{-1,+1\}$
valued community label and a $\mathbb{R}^d$ valued location label given by the support of a homogeneous
Poisson point process of intensity $\lambda$. Conditional on the labels, edges are drawn independently
at random depending both on the Euclidean distance between the nodes and the community labels on
the nodes. We study the Community Detection problem on this random graph which consists in estimating
the partition of nodes into communities, based on an observation of the random graph along with the
spatial location labels on nodes. We show that for $d=1$, Community Detection is impossible for
any parameters. For $d \geq 2$, we establish a phase-transition based on the intensity $\lambda$
of the point process. In particular, we show that if the intensity $\lambda$ is small, then no algorithm
for community detection can beat a random guess for the partitions. We prove this by introducing
and analyzing a new problem which we call `Information Flow from Infinity'. On the positive side,
we give a novel algorithm that performs Community Detection as long as the intensity $\lambda$ is
larger than a sufficiently high constant. Along the way, we establish a \emph{distinguishability}
result which says that one can always efficiently infer the existence of a partition given the graph
and the spatial locations even when one cannot identify the partition better than at random. This
is a surprising new phenomenon not observed thus far in any non-spatial Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi based
planted-partition models.
