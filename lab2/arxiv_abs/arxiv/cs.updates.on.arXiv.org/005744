Continuous Architecture (CA) is an approach that supports companies in decreasing the time between
deliveries. Migration to microservices is one of the most common situations when companies adopt
continuous architecting processes [4]. Companies commonly adopt an initial migration strategy
to extract some components from the monolithic system as microservices, making use of simplified
microservices patterns [5][4]. As an example, companies commonly directly connect the microservices
to the legacy monolithic system and do not adopt any message bus at the beginning. When the system
starts to grow in complexity, they usually start re-architecting their systems, considering different
architectural patterns. Some companies introduce API gateway patterns to simplify the management
and load balancing of the different services, while others also consider a lightweight message
bus [4][5][6]. All these architectural changes require deep refactoring of the system, thereby
increasing the risk of new faults being introduced. In this paper, we report the preliminary results
of work in progress, where we monitored the TD of an SME (SMEs = small and medium enterprises) that
adopted a CA approach while migrating a legacy monolithic system to an ecosystem of microservices.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies exist on the impact of postponed activities on the TD, especially
in the context of CA and microservices. This work will help companies understand how TD grows and
changes over time while at the same time opening up new avenues for future research on the analysis
of TD interest in continuous architecting processes.
