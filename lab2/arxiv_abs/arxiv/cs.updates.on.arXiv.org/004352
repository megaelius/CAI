We give exponential lower bounds on the Price of Stability (PoS) of weighted congestion games with
polynomial cost functions. In particular, for any positive integer $d$ we construct rather simple
games with cost functions of degree at most $d$ which have a PoS of at least $\varOmega(\Phi_d)^{d+1}$,
where $\Phi_d\sim d/\ln d$ is the unique positive root of equation $x^{d+1}=(x+1)^d$. This essentially
closes the huge gap between $\varTheta(d)$ and $\Phi_d^{d+1}$ and asymptotically matches the
Price of Anarchy upper bound. We further show that the PoS remains exponential even for singleton
games. More generally, we also provide a lower bound of $\varOmega((1+1/\alpha)^d/d)$ on the PoS
of $\alpha$-approximate Nash equilibria, even for singleton games. All our lower bounds extend
to network congestion games, and hold for mixed and correlated equilibria as well. On the positive
side, we give a general upper bound on the PoS of $\alpha$-approximate Nash equilibria, which is
sensitive to the range $W$ of the player weights and the approximation parameter $\alpha$. We do
this by explicitly constructing a novel approximate potential function, based on Faulhaber's
formula, that generalizes Rosenthal's potential in a continuous, analytic way. From the general
theorem, we deduce two interesting corollaries. First, we derive the existence of an approximate
pure Nash equilibrium with PoS at most $(d+3)/2$; the equilibrium's approximation parameter ranges
from $\varTheta(1)$ to $d+1$ in a smooth way with respect to $W$. Secondly, we show that for unweighted
congestion games, the PoS of $\alpha$-approximate Nash equilibria is at most $(d+1)/\alpha$.
