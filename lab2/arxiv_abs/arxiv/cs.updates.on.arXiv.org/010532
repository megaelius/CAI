In this paper, we consider the general non-oblivious stochastic optimization where the underlying
stochasticity may change during the optimization procedure and depends on the point at which the
function is evaluated. We develop Stochastic Frank-Wolfe++ ($\text{SFW}{++} $), an efficient
variant of the conditional gradient method for minimizing a smooth non-convex function subject
to a convex body constraint. We show that $\text{SFW}{++} $ converges to an $\epsilon$-first order
stationary point by using $O(1/\epsilon^3)$ stochastic gradients. Once further structures are
present, $\text{SFW}{++}$'s theoretical guarantees, in terms of the convergence rate and quality
of its solution, improve. In particular, for minimizing a convex function, $\text{SFW}{++} $ achieves
an $\epsilon$-approximate optimum while using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. It is
known that this rate is optimal in terms of stochastic gradient evaluations. Similarly, for maximizing
a monotone continuous DR-submodular function, a slightly different form of $\text{SFW}{++} $,
called Stochastic Continuous Greedy++ ($\text{SCG}{++} $), achieves a tight $[(1-1/e)\text{OPT}
-\epsilon]$ solution while using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. Through an information
theoretic argument, we also prove that $\text{SCG}{++} $'s convergence rate is optimal. Finally,
for maximizing a non-monotone continuous DR-submodular function, we can achieve a $[(1/e)\text{OPT}
-\epsilon]$ solution by using $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. We should highlight that
our results and our novel variance reduction technique trivially extend to the standard and easier
oblivious stochastic optimization settings for (non-)covex and continuous submodular settings.
