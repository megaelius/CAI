As machine learning and cybersecurity continue to explode in the context of the digital ecosystem,
the complexity of cybersecurity data combined with complicated and evasive machine learning algorithms
leads to vast difficulties in designing an end to end system for intelligent, automatic anomaly
classification. On the other hand, traditional systems use elementary statistics techniques
and are often inaccurate, leading to weak centralized data analysis platforms. In this paper, we
propose a novel system that addresses these two problems, titled CAMLPAD, for Cybersecurity Autonomous
Machine Learning Platform for Anomaly Detection. The CAMLPAD systems streamlined, holistic approach
begins with retrieving a multitude of different species of cybersecurity data in real time using
elasticsearch, then running several machine learning algorithms, namely Isolation Forest, Histogram
Based Outlier Score (HBOS), Cluster Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF), and K Means Clustering,
to process the data. Next, the calculated anomalies are visualized using Kibana and are assigned
an outlier score, which serves as an indicator for whether an alert should be sent to the system administrator
that there are potential anomalies in the network. After comprehensive testing of our platform
in a simulated environment, the CAMLPAD system achieved an adjusted rand score of 95 percent, exhibiting
the reliable accuracy and precision of the system. All in all, the CAMLPAD system provides an accurate,
streamlined approach to real time cybersecurity anomaly detection, delivering a novel solution
that has the potential to revolutionize the cybersecurity sector.
