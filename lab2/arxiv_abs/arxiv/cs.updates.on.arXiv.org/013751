The ability of animals to interact with complex dynamics is unmatched in robots. Especially important
to the interaction performances is the online adaptation of body dynamics, which can be modeled
as an impedance behaviour. However, the variable impedance controller still possesses a challenge
in the current control frameworks due to the difficulties of retaining stability when adapting
the controller gains. The fractal impedance controller has been recently proposed to solve this
issue. However, it still has limitations such as sudden jumps in force when it starts to converge
to the desired position and the lack of a force feedback loop. In this manuscript, two improvements
are made to the control framework to solve these limitations. The force discontinuity has been addressed
introducing a modulation of the impedance via a virtual antagonist that modulates the output force.
The force tracking has been modeled after the parallel force/position controller architecture.
In contrast to traditional methods, the fractal impedance controller enables the implementation
of a search algorithm on the force feedback to adapt its behaviour on the external environment instead
of on relying on \textit{a priori} knowledge of the external dynamics. Preliminary simulation
results presented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and it allows to evaluate
the trade-off that needs to be made when relying on the proposed controller for interaction. In conclusion,
the proposed method mimics the behaviour of an agonist/antagonist system adapting to unknown external
dynamics, and it may find application in computational neuroscience, haptics, and interaction
control.
