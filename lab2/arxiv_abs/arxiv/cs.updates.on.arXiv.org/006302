The Internet of things (IoT) comprises of wireless sensors and actuators connected via access points
to the Internet. Often, the sensing devices are remotely deployed with limited battery power and
equipped with energy harvesting equipment such as solar panels. These devices transmit real-time
data to the base stations which is used in the detection of other applications. Under sufficient
power availability, wireless transmissions from sensors can be scheduled at regular time intervals
to maintain real-time detection and information retrieval by the base station. However, once the
battery is significantly depleted, the devices enter into power saving mode and is required to be
more selective in transmitting information to the base station (BS). Transmitting a particular
piece of sensed data will result in power consumption while discarding it might result in loss of
utility at the BS. The goal is to design an optimal dynamic policy which enables the device to decide
whether to transmit or to discard a piece of sensing data particularly under the power saving mode.
This will enable the sensor to prolong its operation while causing minimum loss of utility of the
application. We develop a mathematical model to capture the utility of the IoT sensor transmissions
and use tools from dynamic programming to derive an optimal real-time transmission policy that
is based on the statistics of information arrival, the likelihood of harvested energy, and designed
lifetime of the sensors. Numerical results show that if the statistics of future data valuation
can be accurately predicted, there is a significant increase in the utility obtained at the BS as
well as the battery lifetime.
