Self-stabilizing protocols enable distributed systems to recover correct behavior starting
from any arbitrary configuration. In particular, when processors communicate by message passing,
fake messages may be placed in communication links by an adversary. When the number of such fake messages
is unknown, self-stabilization may require huge resources: (a) generic solutions (a.k.a. data
link protocols) require unbounded resources, which makes them unrealistic to deploy and (b) specific
solutions (e.g., census or tree construction) require $O(n\log n)$ or $O(\Delta\log n)$ bits of
memory per node, where $n$ denotes the network size and $\Delta$ its maximum degree, which may prevent
scalability. We investigate the possibility of resource efficient self-stabilizing protocols
in this context. Specifically, we present a self-stabilizing protocol for $(\Delta+1)$-coloring
in any n-node graph, under the asynchronous message-passing model. It is deterministic, it converges
in $O(k\Delta n^2\log n)$ message exchanges, where $k$ is the bound of the link capacity in terms
of number of messages, and it uses messages on $O(\log\log n+\log\Delta)$ bits with a memory of $O(\Delta\log\Delta+\log\log
n)$ bits at each node. The resource consumption of our protocol is thus almost oblivious to the number
of nodes, enabling scalability. Moreover, a striking property of our protocol is that the nodes
do not need to know the number, or any bound on the number of messages initially present in each communication
link of the initial (potentially corrupted) network configuration. This permits our protocol
to handle any future network with unknown message capacity communication links. A key building
block of our coloring scheme is a spanning directed acyclic graph construction, that is of independent
interest, and can serve as a useful tool for solving other tasks in this challenging setting.
