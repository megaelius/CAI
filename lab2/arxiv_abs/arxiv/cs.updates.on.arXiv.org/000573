In this paper, a new descriptor selection method for selecting an optimal combination of important
descriptors of sulfonamide derivatives data, named self tuned reweighted sampling (STRS), is
developed. descriptors are defined as the descriptors with large absolute coefficients in a multivariate
linear regression model such as partial least squares(PLS). In this study, the absolute values
of regression coefficients of PLS model are used as an index for evaluating the importance of each
descriptor Then, based on the importance level of each descriptor, STRS sequentially selects N
subsets of descriptors from N Monte Carlo (MC) sampling runs in an iterative and competitive manner.
In each sampling run, a fixed ratio (e.g. 80%) of samples is first randomly selected to establish
a regresson model. Next, based on the regression coefficients, a two-step procedure including
rapidly decreasing function (RDF) based enforced descriptor selection and self tuned sampling
(STS) based competitive descriptor selection is adopted to select the important descriptorss.
After running the loops, a number of subsets of descriptors are obtained and root mean squared error
of cross validation (RMSECV) of PLS models established with subsets of descriptors is computed.
The subset of descriptors with the lowest RMSECV is considered as the optimal descriptor subset.
The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by sulfanomide derivative dataset. The
results reveal an good characteristic of STRS that it can usually locate an optimal combination
of some important descriptors which are interpretable to the biologically of interest. Additionally,
our study shows that better prediction is obtained by STRS when compared to full descriptor set PLS
modeling, Monte Carlo uninformative variable elimination (MC-UVE).
