Although Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been employed for accelerating materials design in computational
materials engineering, existing works are restricted to problems with quantitative variables.
However, real designs of materials systems involve both qualitative and quantitative design variables
representing material compositions, microstructure morphology, and processing conditions.
For mixed-variable problems, existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) approaches represent qualitative
factors by dummy variables first and then fit a standard Gaussian process (GP) model with numerical
variables as the surrogate model. This approach is restrictive theoretically and fails to capture
complex correlations between qualitative levels. We present in this paper the integration of a
novel latent-variable (LV) approach for mixed-variable GP modeling with the BO framework for materials
design. LVGP is a fundamentally different approach that maps qualitative design variables to underlying
numerical LV in GP, which has strong physical justification. It provides flexible parameterization
and representation of qualitative factors and shows superior modeling accuracy compared to the
existing methods. We demonstrate our approach through testing with numerical examples and materials
design examples. It is found that in all test examples the mapped LVs provide intuitive visualization
and substantial insight into the nature and effects of the qualitative factors. Though materials
designs are used as examples, the method presented is generic and can be utilized for other mixed
variable design optimization problems that involve expensive physics-based simulations.
