We study the problem of Bayesian learning in a dynamical system involving strategic agents with
asymmetric information. In a series of seminal papers in the literature, this problem has been investigated
under a simplifying model where myopically selfish players appear sequentially and act once in
the game, based on private noisy observations of the system state and public observation of past
players' actions. It has been shown that there exist information cascades where users discard their
private information and mimic the action of their predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework
for studying Bayesian learning dynamics in a more general setting than the one described above.
In particular, our model incorporates cases where players are non-myopic and strategically participate
for the whole duration of the game, and cases where an endogenous process selects which subset of
players will act at each time instance. The proposed framework hinges on a sequential decomposition
methodology for finding structured perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) of a general class of dynamic
games with asymmetric information, where user-specific states evolve as conditionally independent
Markov processes and users make independent noisy observations of their states. Using this methodology,
we study a specific dynamic learning model where players make decisions about public investment
based on their estimates of everyone's types. We characterize a set of informational cascades for
this problem where learning stops for the team as a whole. We show that in such cascades, all players'
estimates of other players' types freeze even though each individual player asymptotically learns
its own true type.
