Background. Recently, In Italy the vaccination coverage for key immunizations, as MMR, has been
declining, with measles outbreaks. In 2017, the Italian Government expanded the number of mandatory
immunizations establishing penalties for families of unvaccinated children. During the 2018
elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate, with the government accusing
oppositions of fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new government established in 2018 temporarily
relaxed penalties and announced the introduction of flexibility. Objectives and Methods. By a
sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018, we aimed at (i) characterising the temporal
flow of communication on vaccines, (ii) evaluating the usefulness of Twitter data for estimating
vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigating whether the ambiguous political communication
might have originated disorientation among the public. Results. The population appeared to be
mostly composed by "serial twitterers" tweeting about everything including vaccines. Tweets
favourable to vaccination accounted for 75% of retained tweets, undecided for 14% and unfavourable
for 11%. Twitter activity of the Italian public health institutions was negligible. After smoothing
the temporal pattern, an up-and-down trend in the favourable proportion emerged, synchronized
with the switch between governments, providing clear evidence of disorientation. Conclusion.
The reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical health topics, as immunization,
should never be used for political consensus. This is especially true given the increasing role
of online social media as information source, which might yield to social pressures eventually
harmful for vaccine uptake, and is worsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter. This
calls for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.
