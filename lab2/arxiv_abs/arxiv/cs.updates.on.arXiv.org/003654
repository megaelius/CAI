Ensemble control deals with the problem of how to use finitely many control inputs to simultaneously
steer a large population (in the limit, a continuum) of control systems. Dual to the ensemble control
problem, ensemble estimation deals with the problem of using finitely many measurement outputs
to estimate the initial condition of every system in the ensemble. We introduce in the paper an innovative
class of ensemble systems, termed distinguished ensemble system, and establish sufficient conditions
for controllability and observability of such system. A distinguished ensemble system is comprised
of two key components, namely distinguished control vector fields and codistinguished observation
functions. Roughly speaking, a set of vector fields is distinguished if they are closed (up to scaling)
under Lie bracket, and moreover, every vector field in the set can be generated (up to scaling) by
a Lie bracket of two vector fields in the same set. Similarly, a set of functions is codistinguished
with respect to a set of vector fields if the directional derivatives of the functions along the given
vector fields yield (up to scaling) the same set of functions. We further address in the paper the
existence of a distinguished ensemble system over Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces. Specifically,
we show that every connected, semi-simple Lie group admits a set of distinguished vector fields,
together with a set of codistinguished functions. The proof is constructive, leveraging the structure
theory for semi-simple real Lie algebras. Various examples will be introduced along the presentation
illustrating the key definitions and the main results.
