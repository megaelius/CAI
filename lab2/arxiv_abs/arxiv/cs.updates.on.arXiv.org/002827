Depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) oriented view synthesis has been widely employed in the current
depth-based 3D video systems by synthesizing a virtual view from an arbitrary viewpoint. However,
holes may appear in the synthesized view due to disocclusion, thus significantly degrading the
quality. Consequently, efforts have been made on developing effective and efficient hole filling
algorithms. Current hole filling techniques generally extrapolate/interpolate the hole regions
with the neighboring information based on an assumption that the texture pattern in the holes is
similar to that of the neighboring background information. However, in many scenarios especially
of complex texture, the assumption may not hold. In other words, hole filling techniques can only
provide an estimation for a hole which may not be good enough or may even be erroneous considering
a wide variety of complex scene of images. In this paper, we first examine the view interpolation
with multiple reference views, demonstrating that the problem of emerging holes in a target virtual
view can be greatly alleviated by making good use of other neighboring complementary views in addition
to its two (commonly used) most neighboring primary views. The effects of using multiple views for
view extrapolation in reducing holes are also investigated in this paper. In view of the 3D Video
and ongoing free-viewpoint TV standardization, we propose a new view synthesis framework which
employs multiple views to synthesize output virtual views. Furthermore, a scheme of selective
warping of complementary views is developed by efficiently locating a small number of useful pixels
in the complementary views for hole reduction, to avoid a full warping of additional complementary
views thus lowering greatly the warping complexity.
