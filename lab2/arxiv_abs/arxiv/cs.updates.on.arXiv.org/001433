Gynecologic malignancies are a leading cause of death in women worldwide. Standard treatment for
many primary and recurrent gynecologic cancer cases includes a combination of external beam radiation,
followed by brachytherapy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is benefitial in diagnostic evaluation,
in mapping the tumor location to tailor radiation dose, and in monitoring the tumor response to treatment.
Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic brachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize
tumor coverage and reduce radiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for
patients. In this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and treatment planning
for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed specifically for gynecologic cancers.
This has been used in 18 cases to date in the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite
at Brigham and Women's Hospital. It is comprised of state of the art methods for MR imaging, image
analysis, and treatment planning. An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state free precession
in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for catheter identification with ballooning artifact
at the tip. 3D treatment planning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software
module designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes probabilistic bias
correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration algorithms. The results demonstrate
that 3T MR has a role in gynecologic brachytherapy. These novel developments improve targeted treatment
to the tumor while sparing the normal tissues.
