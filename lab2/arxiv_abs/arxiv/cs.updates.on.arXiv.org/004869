This Ph.D. thesis discusses advanced design issues of the evolutionary-based algorithm \textit{"Coral
Reef Optimization"}, in its Substrate-Layer (CRO-SL) version, for optimization problems in Engineering
Applications. The problems that can be tackled with meta-heuristic approaches is very wide and
varied, and it is not exclusive of engineering. However we focus the Thesis on it area, one of the most
prominent in our time. One of the proposed application is battery scheduling problem in Micro-Grids
(MGs). Specifically, we consider an MG that includes renewable distributed generation and different
loads, defined by its power profiles, and is equipped with an energy storage device (battery) to
address its programming (duration of loading / discharging and occurrence) in a real scenario with
variable electricity prices. Also, we discuss a problem of vibration cancellation over structures
of two and four floors, using Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD's). The optimization algorithm will try to
find the best solution by obtaining three physical parameters and the TMD location. As another related
application, CRO-SL is used to design Multi-Input-Multi-Output Active Vibration Control (MIMO-AVC)
via inertial-mass actuators, for structures subjected to human induced vibration. In this problem,
we will optimize the location of each actuator and tune control gains. Finally, we tackle the optimization
of a textile modified meander-line Inverted-F Antenna (IFA) with variable width and spacing meander,
for RFID systems. Specifically, the CRO-SL is used to obtain an optimal antenna design, with a good
bandwidth and radiation pattern, ideal for RFID readers. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
has become one of the most numerous manufactured devices worldwide due to a reliable and inexpensive
means of locating people. They are used in access and money cards and product labels and many other
applications.
