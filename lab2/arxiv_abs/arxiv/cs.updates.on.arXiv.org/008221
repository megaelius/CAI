Long-term evolution (LTE) and LTE-advance (LTE-A) are widely used efficient network technologies
serving billions of users, since they are featured with high spectrum efficiency, less latency,
and higher bandwidth. Despite remarkable advantages offered by these technologies, signaling
overhead remains a major issue in accessing the network. In particular, the load of signaling is
mainly attributed to location management. This paper proposes an efficient approach for minimizing
the total signaling overhead of location management in LTE networks using multi-objective particle
swarm optimization (MOPSO). Tracking area update (TAU) and paging are considered to be the main
elements of the signaling overhead of optimal location management in LTE. In addition, the total
inter-list handover contributes significantly to the total signaling overhead. However, the
total signaling cost of TAU and paging is adversely related to the total inter-list handover. Two
cost functions should be minimized, the first is the total signaling cost of TAU and paging and the
second is the total signaling overhead. The trade-off between these two objectives can be circumvented
by MOPSO, which alleviates the total signaling overhead. A set of non-dominated solutions on the
Pareto-optimal front is defined and the best compromise solution. The proposed algorithm results
feasible compromise solution, minimizing the signaling overhead and the consumption of the power
battery of a user. The efficacy and the robustness of the proposed algorithm have been proven using
large scale environment problem illustrative example. The location management in LTE networks
using MOPSO best compromise solution has been compared to a mixed integer non-linear programming
(MINLP) algorithm. Location management mobility management entity MME pooling clustering SON
