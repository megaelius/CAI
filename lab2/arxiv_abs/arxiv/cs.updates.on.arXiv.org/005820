In this paper, a likelihood based evidence acquisition approach is proposed to acquire evidence
from experts'assessments as recorded in historical datasets. Then a data-driven evidential reasoning
rule based model is introduced to R&D project selection process by combining multiple pieces of
evidence with different weights and reliabilities. As a result, the total belief degrees and the
overall performance can be generated for ranking and selecting projects. Finally, a case study
on the R&D project selection for the National Science Foundation of China is conducted to show the
effectiveness of the proposed model. The data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model for
project evaluation and selection (1) utilizes experimental data to represent experts' assessments
by using belief distributions over the set of final funding outcomes, and through this historic
statistics it helps experts and applicants to understand the funding probability to a given assessment
grade, (2) implies the mapping relationships between the evaluation grades and the final funding
outcomes by using historical data, and (3) provides a way to make fair decisions by taking experts'
reliabilities into account. In the data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model, experts
play different roles in accordance with their reliabilities which are determined by their previous
review track records, and the selection process is made interpretable and fairer. The newly proposed
model reduces the time-consuming panel review work for both managers and experts, and significantly
improves the efficiency and quality of project selection process. Although the model is demonstrated
for project selection in the NSFC, it can be generalized to other funding agencies or industries.
