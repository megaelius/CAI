Involuntary motion during weight-bearing cone-beam computed tomography (CT) scans of the knee
causes artifacts in the reconstructed volumes making them unusable for clinical diagnosis. Currently,
image-based or marker-based methods are applied to correct for this motion, but often require long
execution or preparation times. We propose to attach an inertial measurement unit (IMU) containing
an accelerometer and a gyroscope to the leg of the subject in order to measure the motion during the
scan and correct for it. To validate this approach, we present a simulation study using real motion
measured with an optical 3D tracking system. With this motion, an XCAT numerical knee phantom is
non-rigidly deformed during a simulated CT scan creating motion corrupted projections. A biomechanical
model is animated with the same tracked motion in order to generate measurements of an IMU placed
below the knee. In our proposed multi-stage algorithm, these signals are transformed to the global
coordinate system of the CT scan and applied for motion compensation during reconstruction. Our
proposed approach can effectively reduce motion artifacts in the reconstructed volumes. Compared
to the motion corrupted case, the average structural similarity index and root mean squared error
with respect to the no-motion case improved by 13-21% and 68-70%, respectively. These results are
qualitatively and quantitatively on par with a state-of-the-art marker-based method we compared
our approach to. The presented study shows the feasibility of this novel approach, and yields promising
results towards a purely IMU-based motion compensation in C-arm CT.
