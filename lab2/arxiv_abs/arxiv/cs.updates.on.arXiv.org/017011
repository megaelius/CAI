The development and analysis of mobile applications in term of security have become an active research
area from many years as many apps are vulnerable to different attacks. Especially the concept of
hybrid applications has emerged in the last three years where applications are developed in both
native and web languages because the use of web languages raises certain security risks in hybrid
mobile applications as it creates possible channels where malicious code can be injected inside
the application. WebView is an important component in hybrid mobile applications which used to
implements a sandbox mechanism to protect the local resources of smartphone devices from un-authorized
access of JavaScript. However, the WebView application program interfaces (APIs) also have security
issues. For example, an attacker can attack the hybrid application via JavaScript code by bypassing
the sandbox security through accessing the public methods of the applications. Cross-site scripting
(XSS) is one of the most popular malicious code injection technique for accessing the public methods
of the application through JavaScript. This research proposes a framework for detection and prevention
of XSS attacks in hybrid applications using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms.
The detection of the attacks have been perform by exploiting the registered Java object features.
The dataset and the sample hybrid applications have been developed using the android studio. Then
the widely used toolkit, RapidMiner, has been used for empirical analysis. The results reveal that
the ensemble based Random Forest algorithm outperforms other algorithms and achieves both the
accuracy and F-measures as high as of 99%.
