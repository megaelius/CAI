This paper presents a high-level conceptual framework to help orient the discussion and implementation
of open-endedness in evolutionary systems. Drawing upon earlier work by Banzhaf et al., three different
kinds of open-endedness are identified: exploratory, expansive, and transformational. These
are characterised in terms of their relationship to the search space of phenotypic behaviours.
A formalism is introduced to describe three key processes required for an evolutionary process:
the generation of a phenotype from a genetic description, the evaluation of that phenotype, and
the reproduction with variation of individuals according to their evaluation. The distinction
is made between intrinsic and extrinsic implementations of these processes. A discussion then
investigates how various interactions between these processes, and their modes of implementation,
can lead to open-endedness. However, an important contribution of the paper is the demonstration
that these considerations relate to exploratory open-endedness only. Conditions for the implementation
of the more interesting kinds of open-endedness - expansive and transformational - are also discussed,
emphasizing factors such as multiple domains of behaviour, transdomain bridges, and non-additive
compositional systems. These factors relate not to the generic evolutionary properties of individuals
and populations, but rather to the nature of the building blocks out of which individual organisms
are constructed, and the laws and properties of the environment in which they exist. The paper ends
with suggestions of how the framework can be used to categorise and compare the open-ended evolutionary
potential of different systems, how it might guide the design of systems with greater capacity for
open-ended evolution, and how it might be further improved.
