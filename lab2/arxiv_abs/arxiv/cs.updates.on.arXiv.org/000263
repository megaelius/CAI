We suggest and analyze algorithms for routing in multi-hop wireless ad-hoc networks that exploit
mutual information accumulation as the physical layer transmission scheme, and are capable of
routing multiple packet streams (commodities) when only the average channel state information
is present and that only locally. The proposed algorithms are modifications of the Diversity Backpressure
(DIVBAR) algorithm, under which the packet whose commodity has the largest "backpressure metric"
is chosen to be transmitted and is forwarded through the link with the largest differential backlog
(queue length). In contrast to traditional DIVBAR, each receiving node stores and accumulates
the partially received packet in a separate "partial packet queue", thus increasing the probability
of successful reception during a later possible retransmission. We present two variants of the
algorithm: DIVBAR-RMIA, under which all the receiving nodes clear the received partial information
of a packet once one or more receiving nodes firstly decode the packet; and DIVBAR-MIA, under which
all the receiving nodes retain the partial information of a packet until the packet has reached its
destination. We characterize the network capacity region with RMIA and prove that (under certain
mild conditions) it is strictly larger than the network capacity region with the repetition (REP)
transmission scheme that is used by the traditional DIVBAR. We also prove that DIVBAR-RMIA is throughput-optimum
among the polices with RMIA, i.e., it achieves the network capacity region with RMIA, which in turn
demonstrates that DIVBAR-RMIA outperforms traditional DIVBAR on the achievable throughput.
Moreover, we prove that DIVBAR-MIA performs at least as well as DIVBAR-RMIA with respect to throughput.
Simulations also confirm these results.
