Nyquist ghost artifacts in EPI are originated from phase mismatch between the even and odd echoes.
However, conventional correction methods using reference scans often produce erroneous results
especially in high-field MRI due to the non-linear and time-varying local magnetic field changes.
Recently, it was shown that the problem of ghost correction can be reformulated as k-space interpolation
problem that can be solved using structured low-rank Hankel matrix approaches. Another recent
work showed that data driven Hankel matrix decomposition can be reformulated to exhibit similar
structures as deep convolutional neural network. By synergistically combining these findings,
we propose a k-space deep learning approach that immediately corrects the phase mismatch without
a reference scan in both accelerated and non-accelerated EPI acquisitions. To take advantage of
the even and odd-phase directional redundancy, the k-space data is divided into two channels configured
with even and odd phase encodings. The redundancies between coils are also exploited by stacking
the multi-coil k-space data into additional input channels. Then, our k-space ghost correction
network is trained to learn the interpolation kernel to estimate the missing virtual k-space data.
For the accelerated EPI data, the same neural network is trained to directly estimate the interpolation
kernels for missing k-space data from both ghost and subsampling. Reconstruction results using
3T and 7T in-vivo data showed that the proposed method outperformed the image quality compared to
the existing methods, and the computing time is much faster.The proposed k-space deep learning
for EPI ghost correction is highly robust and fast, and can be combined with acceleration, so that
it can be used as a promising correction tool for high-field MRI without changing the current acquisition
protocol.
