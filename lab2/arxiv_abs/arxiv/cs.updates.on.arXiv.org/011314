We prove essentially tight lower bounds, conditionally to the Exponential Time Hypothesis, for
two fundamental but seemingly very different cutting problems on surface-embedded graphs: the
Shortest Cut Graph problem and the Multiway Cut problem. A cut graph of a graph $G$ embedded on a surface
$S$ is a subgraph of $G$ whose removal from $S$ leaves a disk. We consider the problem of deciding whether
an unweighted graph embedded on a surface of genus $g$ has a cut graph of length at most a given value.
We prove a time lower bound for this problem of $n^{\Omega(g/\log g)}$ conditionally to ETH. In other
words, the first $n^{O(g)}$-time algorithm by Erickson and Har-Peled [SoCG 2002, Discr.\ Comput.\
Geom.\ 2004] is essentially optimal. We also prove that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized
by the genus, answering a 17-year old question of these authors. A multiway cut of an undirected graph
$G$ with $t$ distinguished vertices, called terminals, is a set of edges whose removal disconnects
all pairs of terminals. We consider the problem of deciding whether an unweighted graph $G$ has a
multiway cut of weight at most a given value. We prove a time lower bound for this problem of $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{gt
+ g^2+t}/\log(g+t))}$, conditionally to ETH, for any choice of the genus $g\ge0$ of the graph and
the number of terminals $t\ge4$. In other words, the algorithm by the second author [Algorithmica
2017] (for the more general multicut problem) is essentially optimal; this extends the lower bound
by the third author [ICALP 2012] (for the planar case). Reductions to planar problems usually involve
a grid-like structure. The main novel idea for our results is to understand what structures instead
of grids are needed if we want to exploit optimally a certain value $g$ of the genus.
