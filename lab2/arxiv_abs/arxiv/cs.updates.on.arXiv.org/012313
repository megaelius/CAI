Opportunistic Routing (OR) scheme increases the transmission reliability despite the lossy wireless
radio links by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium. However, OR schemes in low
power Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) leads to energy drain in constrained sensor nodes due to constant
overhearing, periodic beaconing for Neighbourhood Management (NM) and increase in packet header
length to append priority wise sorted Forwarding Candidates Set (FCS) prior to data transmission.
The focus of this work is to propose a hybrid opportunistic energy efficient routing design for large
scale, low power and lossy WSN. This design avoids periodic 'hello' beacons for NM, limits constant
overhearing and increase in packet header length. There are two modes of operation i) opportunistic
ii) unicast mode. The sender node adopts opportunistic forwarding for its initial data packet transmission
and instead of pre-computing the FCS, it is dynamically computed in a completely distributed manner.
The nodes part of FCS based on cross layered multi-metrics and fuzzy decision logic determines its
priority level to compute Dynamic Holding Delay (DHD) for effective timer coordination. The differentiated
back off implementation along with DHD enables the higher priority candidate that had received
data packet to forward the packet first and facilitates others to cancel its timer upon overhearing.
The sender node switches to unicast mode for successive transmissions to achieve energy efficiency
till link-level transmission error occur. Opportunistic mode is used as the first and last resort
to increase the transmission reliability. Simulation results in NS2 show significant increase
in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), decrease in both average energy consumption per node and Normalized
Energy Consumption (NEC) per packet in comparison with existing protocols.
