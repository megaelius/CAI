Dynamic replication is a wide-spread multi-copy routing approach for efficiently coping with
the intermittent connectivity in mobile opportunistic networks. According to it, a node forwards
a message replica to an encountered node based on a utility value that captures the latter's fitness
for delivering the message to the destination. The popularity of the approach stems from its flexibility
to effectively operate in networks with diverse characteristics without requiring special customization.
Nonetheless, its drawback is the tendency to produce a high number of replicas that consume limited
resources such as energy and storage. To tackle the problem we make the observation that network
nodes can be grouped, based on their utility values, into clusters that portray different delivery
capabilities. We exploit this finding to transform the basic forwarding strategy, which is to move
a packet using nodes of increasing utility, and actually forward it through clusters of increasing
delivery capability. The new strategy works in synergy with the basic dynamic replication algorithms
and is fully configurable, in the sense that it can be used with virtually any utility function. We
also extend our approach to work with two utility functions at the same time, a feature that is especially
efficient in mobile networks that exhibit social characteristics. By conducting experiments
in a wide set of real-life networks, we empirically show that our method is robust in reducing the
overall number of replicas in networks with diverse connectivity characteristics without at the
same time hindering delivery efficiency.
