Literature considers under the name \emph{unimaginable numbers} any positive integer going beyond
any physical application, with this being more of a vague description of what we are talking about
rather than an actual mathematical definition. This simply means that research in this topic must
always consider shortened representations, usually involving \emph{recursion}, to even being
able to describe such numbers.\par\medskip One of the most known methodologies to conceive such
numbers is using \emph{hyperoperations}, that is a sequence of binary functions defined recursively
starting from the usual chain: addition - multiplication - exponentiation. The most important
notations to represent such hyperoperations have been considered by Knuth, Goodstein, Ackermann
and Conway as described in this work's introduction.\par\medskip Within this work we will give
an axiomatic set for this topic, and then try to find on one hand other ways to represent unimaginable
numbers, as well as on the other hand applications to computer science, where the algorithmic nature
of representations and the increased computation capabilities of computers give the perfect field
to develop further the topic.\par\medskip After the introduction, we will give axioms and generalizations
for the up-arrow notation; in the subsequent section we consider a representation via rooted trees
of the \emph{hereditary base-$n$ notation} involved in Goodstein's theorem, which can be used
efficiently to represent some defective unimaginable numbers, and in the last section we will analyse
some methods to compare big numbers, proving specifically a theorem about approximation using
scientific notation.
