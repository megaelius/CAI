The rise of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has caused an insurmountable amount of interest from advertisers
and researchers seeking to monopolize on its features. Researchers aim to develop strategies for
determining how information is propagated among users within an OSN that is captured by diffusion
or influence models. We consider the influence models for the IM-RO problem, a novel formulation
to the Influence Maximization (IM) problem based on implementing Stochastic Dynamic Programming
(SDP). In contrast to existing approaches involving influence spread and the theory of submodular
functions, the SDP method focuses on optimizing clicks and ultimately revenue to advertisers in
OSNs. Existing approaches to influence maximization have been actively researched over the past
decade, with applications to multiple fields, however, our approach is a more practical variant
to the original IM problem. In this paper, we provide an analysis on the influence models of the IM-RO
problem by conducting experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. We propose a Bayesian
and Machine Learning approach for estimating the parameters of the influence models for the (Influence
Maximization- Revenue Optimization) IM-RO problem. We present a Bayesian hierarchical model
and implement the well-known Naive Bayes classifier (NBC), Decision Trees classifier (DTC) and
Random Forest classifier (RFC) on three real-world datasets. Compared to previous approaches
to estimating influence model parameters, our strategy has the great advantage of being directly
implementable in standard software packages such as WinBUGS/OpenBUGS/JAGS and Apache Spark.
We demonstrate the efficiency and usability of our methods in terms of spreading information and
generating revenue for advertisers in the context of OSNs.
