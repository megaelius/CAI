In the Maximum Independent Set problem we are asked to find a set of pairwise nonadjacent vertices
in a given graph with the maximum possible cardinality. In general graphs, this classical problem
is known to be NP-hard and hard to approximate within a factor of $n^{1-\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon
> 0$. Due to this, investigating the complexity of \textsc{Maximum Independent Set} in various
graph classes in hope of finding better tractability results is an active research direction. In
$H$-free graphs, that is, graphs not containing a fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph, the problem
is known to remain NP-hard and APX-hard whenever $H$ contains a cycle, a vertex of degree at least
four, or two vertices of degree at least three in one connected component. For the remaining cases,
where every component of $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, the complexity of Maximum Independent
Set remains widely open, with only a handful of polynomial-time solvability results for small graphs
$H$ such as $P_5$, $P_6$, the claw, or the fork. We prove that for every such "possibly tractable"
graph $H$ there exists an algorithm that, given an $H$-free graph $G$ and an accuracy parameter $\varepsilon
> 0$, finds an independent set in $G$ of cardinality within a factor of $(1-\varepsilon)$ of the optimum
in time exponential in a polynomial of $\log |V(G)|$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$. That is, we show that
for every graph $H$ for which Maximum Independent Set is not known to be APX-hard in $H$-free graphs,
the problem admits a quasi-polynomial time approximation scheme in this graph class. Our algorithm
works also in the more general weighted setting, where the input graph is supplied with a weight function
on vertices and we are maximizing the total weight of an independent set.
