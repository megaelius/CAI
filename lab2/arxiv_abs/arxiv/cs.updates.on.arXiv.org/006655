Understanding and keeping the customer happy is a central tenet of requirements engineering. Strategies
to gather, analyze, and negotiate requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer
input after products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in allowing customers
to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests. Whenever insufficient attention is
given to support issues, however, their escalation to management is time-consuming and expensive,
especially for large organizations managing hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets.
Our work provides a step towards simplifying the job of support analysts and managers, particularly
in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field study at our large industrial partner,
IBM, we used a design science methodology to characterize the support process and data available
to IBM analysts in managing escalations. Through iterative cycles of design and evaluation, we
translated our understanding of support analysts' expert knowledge of their customers into features
of a support ticket model to be implemented into a Machine Learning model to predict support ticket
escalations. We trained and evaluated our Machine Learning model on over 2.5 million support tickets
and 10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 79.9% and an 80.8% reduction in the workload for support
analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of escalation. Further on-site evaluations,
through a prototype tool we developed to implement our Machine Learning techniques in practice,
showed more efficient weekly support-ticket-management meetings. The features we developed
in the Support Ticket Model are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations interested
in implementing our model to predict support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to
build on to advance research in ...
