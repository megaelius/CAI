The approach defines information process from probabilistic observation, emerging microprocess,qubit,
encoding bits, evolving macroprocess, and extends to Observer information self-organization,
cognition, intelligence and understanding communicating information. Studying information
originating in quantum process focuses not on particle physics but on natural interactive impulse
modeling Bit composing information observer. Information emerges from Kolmogorov probabilities
field when sequences of 1-0 probabilities link Markov probabilities modeling arising observer.
These objective yes-no probabilities virtually cuts observing entropy hidden in cutting correlation
decreasing Markov process entropy and increasing entropy of cutting impulse running minimax principle.
Merging impulse curves and rotates yes-no conjugated entropies in microprocess. The entropies
entangle within impulse time interval ending with beginning space. The opposite curvature lowers
potential energy converting entropy to memorized bit. The memorized information binds reversible
microprocess with irreversible information macroprocess. Multiple interacting Bits self-organize
information process encoding causality, logic and complexity. Trajectory of observation process
carries probabilistic and certain wave function self-building structural macrounits. Macrounits
logically self-organize information networks encoding in triplet code. Multiple IN enclose observer
information cognition and intelligence. Observer cognition assembles attracting common units
in resonances forming IN hierarchy accepting only units recognizing IN node. Maximal number of
accepted triplets measures the observer information intelligence. Intelligent observer recognizes
and encodes digital images in message transmission enables understanding the message meaning.
Cognitive logic self-controls encoding the intelligence in double helix code.
