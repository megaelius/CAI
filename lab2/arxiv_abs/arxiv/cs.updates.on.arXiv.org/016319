Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) are particle imaging detectors recording 2D or
3D images of trajectories of charged particles. Identifying points of interest in these images,
namely the initial and terminal points of track-like particle trajectories such as muons and protons,
and the initial points of electromagnetic shower-like particle trajectories such as electrons
and gamma rays, is a crucial step of identifying and analyzing these particles and impacts the inference
of physics signals such as neutrino interaction. The Point Proposal Network is designed to discover
these specific points of interest. The algorithm predicts with a sub-voxel precision their spatial
location, and also determines the category of the identified points of interest. Using as a benchmark
the PILArNet public LArTPC data sample in which the voxel resolution is 3mm/voxel, our algorithm
successfully predicted 96.8% and 97.8% of 3D points within a distance of 3 and 10~voxels from the
provided true point locations respectively. For the predicted 3D points within 3 voxels of the closest
true point locations, the median distance is found to be 0.25 voxels, achieving the sub-voxel level
precision. In addition, we report our analysis of the mistakes where our algorithm prediction differs
from the provided true point positions by more than 10~voxels. Among 50 mistakes visually scanned,
25 were due to the definition of true position location, 15 were legitimate mistakes where a physicist
cannot visually disagree with the algorithm's prediction, and 10 were genuine mistakes that we
wish to improve in the future. Further, using these predicted points, we demonstrate a simple algorithm
to cluster 3D voxels into individual track-like particle trajectories with a clustering efficiency,
purity, and Adjusted Rand Index of 96%, 93%, and 91% respectively.
