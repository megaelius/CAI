The CMOS integrated chips at advanced technology nodes are becoming more vulnerable to various
sources of faults like manufacturing imprecisions, variations, aging, etc. Additionally, the
intentional fault attacks (e.g., high power microwave, cybersecurity threats, etc.) and environmental
effects (i.e., radiation) also pose reliability threats to integrated circuits. Though the traditional
hardware redundancy-based techniques like Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), Quadded (QL) Logic
etc. mitigate the risk to some extent, they add huge hardware overhead and are not very effective.
Truly polymorphic circuits that are inherently capable of achieving multiple functionalities
in a limited footprint could enhance the faultresilience/recovery of the circuits with limited
overhead. We demonstrate a novel crosstalk logic based polymorphic circuit approach to achieve
compact and efficient fault resilient circuits. We show a range of polymorphic primitive gates
and their usage in a functional unit. The functional unit is a single arithmetic circuit that is capable
of delivering Multiplication/Sorting/Addition output depending on the control inputs. Using
such polymorphic computing units in an ALU would imply that a correct path for functional output
is possible even when 2/3rd of the ALU is damaged. Our comparison results with respect to existing
polymorphic techniques and CMOS reveal 28% and 62% reduction in transistor count respectively
for the same functionalities. In conjunction with fault detection algorithms, the proposed polymorphic
circuit concept can be transformative for fault tolerant circuit design directions with minimum
overhead.
