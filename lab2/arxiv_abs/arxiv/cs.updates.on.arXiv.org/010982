Future mobile communication networks require an Aerial Base Station (ABS) with fast mobility and
long-term hovering capabilities. At present, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones do not have
long flight times and are mainly used for monitoring, surveillance, and image post-processing.
On the other hand, the traditional airship is too large and not easy to take off and land. Therefore,
we propose to develop an "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Drone-Cruiser" base station that can help
5G mobile communication systems and beyond quickly recover the network after a disaster and handle
the instant communications by the flash crowd. The drone-cruiser base station can overcome the
communications problem for three types of flash crowds, such as in stadiums, parades, and large
plaza so that an appropriate number of aerial base stations can be accurately deployed to meet large
and dynamic traffic demands. Artificial intelligence can solve these problems by analyzing the
collected data, and then adjust the system parameters in the framework of Self-Organizing Network
(SON) to achieve the goals of self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. With
the help of AI technologies, 5G networks can become more intelligent. This paper aims to provide
a new type of service, On-Demand Aerial Base Station as a Service. This work needs to overcome the
following five technical challenges: innovative design of drone-cruisers for the long-time hovering,
crowd estimation and prediction, rapid 3D wireless channel learning and modeling, 3D placement
of aerial base stations and the integration of WiFi front-haul and millimeter wave/WiGig back-haul
networks.
