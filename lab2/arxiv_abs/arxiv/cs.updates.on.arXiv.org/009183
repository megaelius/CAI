Query expansion (QE) is a well-known technique used to enhance the effectiveness of information
retrieval. QE reformulates the initial query by adding similar terms that help in retrieving more
relevant results. Several approaches have been proposed in literature producing quite favorable
results, but they are not evenly favorable for all types of queries (individual and phrase queries).
One of the main reasons for this is the use of the same kind of data sources and weighting scheme while
expanding both the individual and the phrase query terms. As a result, the holistic relationship
among the query terms is not well captured or scored. To address this issue, we have presented a new
approach for QE using Wikipedia and WordNet as data sources. Specifically, Wikipedia gives rich
expansion terms for phrase terms, while WordNet does the same for individual terms. We have also
proposed novel weighting schemes for expansion terms: in-link score (for terms extracted from
Wikipedia) and a tf-idf based scheme (for terms extracted from WordNet). In the proposed Wikipedia-WordNet-based
QE technique (WWQE), we weigh the expansion terms twice: first, they are scored by the weighting
scheme individually, and then, the weighting scheme scores the selected expansion terms concerning
the entire query using correlation score. The proposed approach gains improvements of 24% on the
MAP score and 48% on the GMAP score over unexpanded queries on the FIRE dataset. Experimental results
achieve a significant improvement over individual expansion and other related state-of-the-art
approaches. We also analyzed the effect on retrieval effectiveness of the proposed technique by
varying the number of expansion terms.
