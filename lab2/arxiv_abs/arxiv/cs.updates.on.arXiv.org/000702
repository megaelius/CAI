Challenges related to development, deployment, and maintenance of reusable software for science
are becoming a growing concern. Many scientists' research increasingly depends on the quality
and availability of software upon which their works are built. To highlight some of these issues
and share experiences, the First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences
(WSSSPE1) was held in Nov. 2013 in conjunction with the SC13 Conference. The workshop featured keynote
presentations and a large number (54) of solicited extended abstracts that were grouped into three
themes and presented via panels. A set of collaborative notes of the presentations and discussion
was taken during the workshop. Unique perspectives were captured about issues such as comprehensive
documentation, development and deployment practices, software licenses and career paths for
developers. Attribution systems that accounts for evidence of software contribution and impact
were also discussed. These include mechanisms such as Dig. Obj. IDs (DOIs), publication of software
papers, and the use of online systems, for example source code repositories like GitHub. For truly
sustainable software, there should be no endpoint, as the software products continue to be used
beyond a single institution, grant, and developer or development team. This paper summarizes the
issues and shared experiences that were discussed, including cross-cutting issues and use cases.
It joins a nascent literature seeking to understand what drives software work in science, and how
it is impacted by the reward systems of science. These incentives can determine the extent to which
developers are motivated to build software for the long-term, for the use of others, and whether
to work collaboratively or separately. It also explores community building, leadership, and dynamics
in relation to successful scientific software.
