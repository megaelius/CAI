Large scale systems are forecasted to greatly impact our future lives thanks to their wide ranging
applications including cooperative robotics, mobility on demand, resource allocation, supply
chain management. While technological developments have paved the way for the realization of such
futuristic systems, we have a limited grasp on how to coordinate the individual components to achieve
the desired global objective. This thesis deals with the analysis and coordination of large scale
systems without the need of a centralized authority. In the first part of this thesis, we consider
non-cooperative decision making problems where each agent's objective is a function of the aggregate
behavior of the population. First, we compare the performance of an equilibrium allocation with
that of an optimal allocation and propose conditions under which all equilibrium allocations are
efficient. Towards this goal, we prove a novel result bounding the distance between the strategies
at a Nash and Wardrop equilibrium that might be of independent interest. Second, we show how to derive
scalable algorithms that guide agents towards an equilibrium allocation. In the second part of
this thesis, we consider large-scale cooperative problems, where a number of agents need to be allocated
to a set of resources with the goal of jointly maximizing a given submodular or supermodular set function.
Since this class of problems is computationally intractable, we aim at deriving tractable algorithms
for attaining approximate solutions. We approach the problem from a game-theoretic perspective
and ask the following: how should we design agents' utilities so that any equilibrium configuration
is almost optimal? To answer this question we introduce a novel framework that allows to characterize
and optimize the system performance as a function of the chosen utilities by means of a tractable
linear program.
