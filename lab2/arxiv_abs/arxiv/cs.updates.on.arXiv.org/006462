Pinterest is a popular photo sharing website. Fashion is one the most popular and content generating
category on this platform. Most of the popular fashion brands and designers use boards on Pinterest
for showcasing their products. However, the characteristics of popular fashion boards are not
well-known. These characteristics can be used for predicting popularity of a nascent board. Further,
newly formed boards can organize their content in a way similar to the popular fashion boards to garner
enhanced popularity. What properties on these fashion boards determine their popularity? Can
these properties be systematically quantified? In this paper, we show how social, temporal and
image signals can together help in characterizing the popular fashion boards. In particular, we
study the sharing/borrowing behavior of pins and the image content characteristics of the fashion
boards. We analyze the sharing behavior using social and temporal signals, and propose six novel
yet simple metrics: originality score, retention coefficients, production coefficients, inter-copying
time, duration of sharing and speed coefficients. We further study the image based content properties
by extracting fashion, color and gender terms embedded in the pin images. We observe significant
differences across the popular (highly followed or highly ranked by the experts) and the unpopular
(less followed) boards. We then use these characteristic features to early predict the popularity
of a board and achieve a high correlation of 0.874 with low RMSE value. Our key observation is that
likes and repin retention coefficients are the most discriminatory factors of a board's popularity
apart from the usage of various color, gender and fashion terms.
