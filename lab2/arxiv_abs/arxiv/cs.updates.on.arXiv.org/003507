The goal of this work is to systematically extract information from hacker forums, whose information
would be in general described as unstructured: the text of a post is not necessarily following any
writing rules. By contrast, many security initiatives and commercial entities are harnessing
the readily public information, but they seem to focus on structured sources of information. Here,
we focus on the problem of identifying malicious IP addresses, among the IP addresses which are reported
in the forums. We develop a method to automate the identification of malicious IP addresses with
the design goal of being independent of external sources. A key novelty is that we use a matrix decomposition
method to extract latent features of the behavioral information of the users, which we combine with
textual information from the related posts. A key design feature of our technique is that it can be
readily applied to different language forums, since it does not require a sophisticated Natural
Language Processing approach. In particular, our solution only needs a small number of keywords
in the new language plus the users behavior captured by specific features. We also develop a tool
to automate the data collection from security forums. Using our tool, we collect approximately
600K posts from 3 different forums. Our method exhibits high classification accuracy, while the
precision of identifying malicious IP in post is greater than 88% in all three forums. We argue that
our method can provide significantly more information: we find up to 3 times more potentially malicious
IP address compared to the reference blacklist VirusTotal. As the cyber-wars are becoming more
intense, having early accesses to useful information becomes more imperative to remove the hackers
first-move advantage, and our work is a solid step towards this direction.
