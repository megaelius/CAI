Classical monetary systems regularly subject the most vulnerable majority of the world's population
to debilitating financial shocks, and have manifestly allowed uncontrolled global inequality
over the long term. Given these basic failures, how can we avoid asking whether mainstream macroeconomic
principles are actually compatible with democratic principles such as equality or the protection
of human rights and dignity? This idea paper takes a constructive look at this question, by exploring
how alternate monetary principles might result in a form of money more compatible with democratic
principles -- dare we call it "democratic money"? In this alternative macroeconomic philosophy,
both the supply of and the demand for money must be rooted in people, so as to give all people both equal
opportunities for economic participation. Money must be designed around equality, not only across
all people alive at a given moment, but also across past and future generations of people, guaranteeing
that our descendants cannot be enslaved by their ancestors' economic luck or misfortune. Democratic
money must reliably give all people a means to enable everyday commerce, investment, and value creation
in good times and bad, and must impose hard limits on financial inequality. Democratic money must
itself be governed democratically, and must economically facilitate the needs of citizens in a
democracy for trustworthy and unbiased information with which to make wise collective decisions.
An intriguing approach to implementing and deploying democratic money is via a cryptocurrency
built on a proof-of-personhood foundation, giving each opt-in human participant one equal unit
of stake. Such a cryptocurrency would have both interesting similarities to, and important differences
from, a Universal Basic Income (UBI) denominated in an existing currency.
