The ability to monitor respiratory rate is extremely important for medical treatment, healthcare
and fitness sectors. In many situations, mobile methods, which allow users to undertake every day
activities, are required. However, current monitoring systems can be obtrusive, requiring users
to wear respiration belts or nasal probes. Recent advances in thermographic systems have shrunk
their size, weight and cost, to the point where it is possible to create smart-phone based respiration
rate monitoring devices that are not affected by lighting conditions. However, mobile thermal
imaging is challenged in scenes with high thermal dynamic ranges. This challenge is further amplified
by general problems such as motion artifacts and low spatial resolution, leading to unreliable
breathing signals. In this paper, we propose a novel and robust approach for respiration tracking
which compensates for the negative effects of variations in the ambient temperature and motion
artifacts and can accurately extract breathing rates in highly dynamic thermal scenes. It has three
main contributions. The first is a novel Optimal Quantization technique which adaptively constructs
a color mapping of absolute temperature to improve segmentation, classification and tracking.
The second is the Thermal Gradient Flow method that computes thermal gradient magnitude maps to
enhance accuracy of the nostril region tracking. Finally, we introduce the Thermal Voxel method
to increase the reliability of the captured respiration signals compared to the traditional averaging
method. We demonstrate the extreme robustness of our system to track the nostril-region and measure
the respiratory rate in high dynamic range scenes.
