Data-driven material models have many advantages over classical numerical approaches, such as
the direct utilization of experimental data and the possibility to improve performance of predictions
when additional data is available. One approach to develop a data-driven material model is to use
machine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed material behaviour and then
be applied in online applications. However, learning and predicting history dependent material
models, such as plasticity, is still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material
modelling framework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning based
hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network (FNN) directly whereas
the machine learning based plasticity model is developed by using of a novel method called Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward Neural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading
history, the accumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the plasticity
model. Additionally, the strain-stress sequence data for plasticity is collected from different
loading-unloading paths based on the concept of sequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the
multi-dimensional stress sequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient
sequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by multiple independent
neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output, which leads to less training time and
better training performance. To apply the machine learning based material model in finite element
analysis, the tangent matrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen.
The effectiveness and generalization of the presented models are investigated by a series of numerical
examples using both 2D and 3D finite element analysis.
