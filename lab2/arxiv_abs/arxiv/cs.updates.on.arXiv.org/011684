The adequate use of documentation for communication is one challenge in requirements engineering
(RE). In recent years, several researchers addressed this challenge by using videos as a communication
mechanism. All of them concluded that this way of using videos has the potential to facilitate requirements
communication. Nevertheless, software professionals are not directors and thus do not necessarily
know what constitutes a good video. This lack of knowledge is one crucial reason why videos are still
not an established communication mechanism in RE. When videos shall be established in the RE activities,
practices, and techniques, requirements engineers have to acquire the necessary knowledge to
produce and use good videos on their own at moderate costs, yet sufficient quality. In our research
project ViViReq (see Acknowledgment), we aspire to bridge this knowledge gap about what constitutes
a good video. Whether a video is good or not depends on its quality perceived by its viewers. However,
video quality is a rather ill-defined concept due to numerous unspecified technical and subjective
characteristics. As part of our research plan, we develop a quality model for videos inspired by
the idea of Femmer and Vogelsang to define and evaluate the quality of videos as RE artifacts. In addition
to evaluating videos, this quality model can be used to identify the relevant characteristics of
videos for their specific purpose which can be further used to specify requirements, their criteria
for satisfaction, and corresponding measures. Therefore, software professionals may use the
quality model as guidance for producing and using videos.
