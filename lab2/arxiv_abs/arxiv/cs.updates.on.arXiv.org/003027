In smart grid, the Utility Provider (UP) collects users power measurements' for two main reasons:
billing and operation. Billing needs coarse-grained measurements where there are no, or minimal,
privacy concerns. On the other hand, operation needs fine-grained measurements which can highly
affect users' privacy. Hence, users might be reluctant to participate in operational metering
to protect their privacy. To overcome this issue, UP might offer rewards to allure users to report
their measurements which endangers their privacy. In this paper, we survey the literature on privacy-preserving
metering in smart grid. We propose a new taxonomy to categorize the literature based on whether measurements
need to be attributable to users or not. This categorization is highly effective because attribution
is one of the main causes of privacy issues. Our survey shows that rewarding schemes and incentive-based
demand response are new research topics with limited studies on it. Hence, we propose two privacy-preserving
rewarding schemes for operational metering. First, a light-weight solution that utilizes an already
established link of trust i.e. Banks. It is based on the assumption that banks will not leak a client
account details. This solution is based on hash chains and blind signatures to assure users anonymity
with minimal overhead for the UP and the smart meter. The bank in this approach is state-less in which
is not required the bank to keep communications states of users and the UP. Second, we proposed another
approach that does not rely on or banks or trusted third parties. It is based on Paillier homomorphic
encryption and Pedersen commitments. It assumes that the smart meters are organized in a tree structure;
which is widely used implementation in the literature. Security analysis for the proposed approaches
is presented including unlinkability proof for measurements to users.
