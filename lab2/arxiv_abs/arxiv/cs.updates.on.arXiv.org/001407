Automated detection of abnormalities in data has been studied in research area in recent years because
of its diverse applications in practice including video surveillance, industrial damage detection
and network intrusion detection. However, building an effective anomaly detection system is a
non-trivial task since it requires to tackle challenging issues of the shortage of annotated data,
inability of defining anomaly objects explicitly and the expensive cost of feature engineering
procedure. Unlike existing appoaches which only partially solve these problems, we develop a unique
framework to cope the problems above simultaneously. Instead of hanlding with ambiguous definition
of anomaly objects, we propose to work with regular patterns whose unlabeled data is abundant and
usually easy to collect in practice. This allows our system to be trained completely in an unsupervised
procedure and liberate us from the need for costly data annotation. By learning generative model
that capture the normality distribution in data, we can isolate abnormal data points that result
in low normality scores (high abnormality scores). Moreover, by leverage on the power of generative
networks, i.e. energy-based models, we are also able to learn the feature representation automatically
rather than replying on hand-crafted features that have been dominating anomaly detection research
over many decades. We demonstrate our proposal on the specific application of video anomaly detection
and the experimental results indicate that our method performs better than baselines and are comparable
with state-of-the-art methods in many benchmark video anomaly detection datasets.
