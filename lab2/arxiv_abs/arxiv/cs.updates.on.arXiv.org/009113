Many important properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined upon the relationship between
multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time. Examples include probabilistic fairness
and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. These
requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. In this work, we focus on verifying probabilistic
hyperproperties for CPS. To cover a wide range of modeling formalisms, we first propose a general
model of probabilistic uncertain systems (PUSs) that unify commonly studied CPS models such as
continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and probabilistically parametrized Hybrid I/O Automata.
To formally specify hyperproperties, we propose a new temporal logic, hyper probabilistic signal
temporal logic (HyperPSTL) that serves as a hyper and probabilistic version of the conventional
signal temporal logic (STL). Considering complexity of real-world systems that can be captured
as PUSs, we adopt a statistical model checking (SMC) approach for their verification. We develop
a new SMC technique based on the direct computation of the significance levels of statistical assertions
for HyperPSTL specifications, which requires no a priori knowledge on the indifference margin.
Then, we introduce SMC algorithms for HyperPSTL specifications on the joint probabilistic distribution
of multiple paths, as well as specifications with nested probabilistic operators quantifying
different paths, which cannot be handled by existing SMC algorithms. Finally, we show the effectiveness
of our SMC algorithms on CPS benchmarks with varying levels of complexity, including the Toyota
Powertrain Control~System.
