Ensemble learning use multiple algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than any single
one of its constituent algorithms could. With growing popularity of deep learning, researchers
have started to ensemble them for various purposes. Few if any, however, has used the deep learning
approach as a means to ensemble algorithms. This paper presents a deep ensemble learning framework
which aims to harness deep learning algorithms to integrate multisource data and tap the wisdom
of experts. At the voting layer, a sparse autoencoder is trained for feature learning to reduce the
correlation of attributes and diversify the base classifiers ultimately. At the stacking layer,
a nonlinear feature-weighted method based on deep belief networks is proposed to rank the base classifiers
which may violate the conditional independence. Neural network is used as meta classifier. At the
optimizing layer, under-sampling and threshold-moving are used to cope with cost-sensitive problem.
Optimized predictions are obtained based on ensemble of probabilistic predictions by similarity
calculation. The proposed deep ensemble learning framework is used for Alzheimers disease classification.
Experiments with the clinical dataset from national Alzheimers coordinating center demonstrate
that the classification accuracy of our proposed framework is 4% better than 6 well-known ensemble
approaches as well as the standard stacking algorithm. Adequate coverage of more accurate diagnostic
services can be provided by utilizing the wisdom of averaged physicians. This paper points out a
new way to boost the primary care of Alzheimers disease from the view of machine learning.
