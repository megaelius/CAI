Finding dense components in graphs is of great importance in analyzing the structure of networks.
Popular and computationally feasible frameworks for discovering dense subgraphs are core and
truss decompositions. Recently, Sariy\"uce et al. introduced nucleus decomposition, a generalization
which uses higher-order structures and can reveal interesting subgraphs that can be missed by core
and truss decompositions. In this paper, we present nucleus decomposition in probabilistic graphs.
We study the most interesting case of nucleus decomposition, $k$-$(3,4)$-nucleus, which asks
for maximal subgraphs where each triangle is contained in $k$ $4$-cliques. The major questions
we address are: How to define meaningfully nucleus decomposition in probabilistic graphs? How
hard is computing nucleus decomposition in probabilistic graphs? Can we devise efficient algorithms
for exact or approximate nucleus decomposition in large graphs? We present three natural definitions
of nucleus decomposition in probabilistic graphs: local, global, and weakly-global. We show that
the local version is in PTIME, whereas global and weakly-global are #P-hard and NP-hard, respectively.
We present an efficient and exact dynamic programming approach for the local case and furthermore,
present statistical approximations that can scale to large datasets without much loss of accuracy.
For global and weakly-global decompositions, we complement our intractability results by proposing
efficient algorithms that give approximate solutions based on search space pruning and Monte-Carlo
sampling. Our extensive experimental results show the scalability and efficiency of our algorithms.
Compared to probabilistic core and truss decompositions, nucleus decomposition significantly
outperforms in terms of density and clustering metrics.
