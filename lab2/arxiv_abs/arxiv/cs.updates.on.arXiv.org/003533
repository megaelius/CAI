For a fixed collection of graphs ${\cal F}$, the ${\cal F}$-M-Deletion problem consists in, given
a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether there exists $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $|S| \leq k$ such
that $G \setminus S$ does not contain any of the graphs in ${\cal F}$ as a minor. We are interested in
its parameterized complexity when the parameter is the treewidth of $G$, denoted by $tw$. Our objective
is to determine, for a fixed ${\cal F}$, the smallest function $f_{{\cal F}}$ such that ${\cal F}$-M-Deletion
can be solved in time $f_{{\cal F}}(tw) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ on $n$-vertex graphs. Using the machinery
of boundaried graphs and small sets of representatives introduced by Bodlaender et al. [J. ACM,
2016], we prove that when all the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are connected and at least one is planar, then
$f_{{\cal F}}(w) = 2^{O(w \cdot\log w)}$. We put attention to the cases where ${\cal F}$ contains
a single "famous" graph. Namely, when ${\cal F}$ is a singleton containing a clique, a cycle, a path,
a star, or a multiedge, we provide tight dichomities for the complexity of ${\cal F}$-M-Deletion.
The lower bounds hold unless the ETH fails, and the superexponential ones are inspired by reductions
of Marcin Pilipczuk [Discrete Appl Math, 2016] and Bonnet et al. [IPEC 2017]. The single-exponential
algorithms use the rank-based approach introduced by Bodlaender et al. [Inform Comput, 2015].
We also consider the version of the problem where the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are forbidden as topological
minors, and prove essentially the same set of results, except that $f_{\{K_{1,i}\}}(w) = 2^{\Theta
(w)}$ for every $i \geq 1$. Finally, we attempt to classify the complexity of ${\cal F}$-Deletion
when ${\cal F}$ consists of a connected simple graph on at most 5 vertices. Out of the 30 possibilities,
we solve 20 of them and provide conjectures for the remaining 10 cases.
