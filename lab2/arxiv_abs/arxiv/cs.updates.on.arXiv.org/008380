This work presents a text mining context and its use for a deep analysis of the messages delivered
by the politicians. Specifically, we deal with an expert systems-based exploration of the rhetoric
dynamics of a large collection of US Presidents' speeches, ranging from Washington to Trump. In
particular, speeches are viewed as complex expert systems whose structures can be effectively
analyzed through rank-size laws. The methodological contribution of the paper is twofold. First,
we develop a text mining-based procedure for the construction of the dataset by using a web scraping
routine on the Miller Center website -- the repository collecting the speeches. Second, we explore
the implicit structure of the discourse data by implementing a rank-size procedure over the individual
speeches, being the words of each speech ranked in terms of their frequencies. The scientific significance
of the proposed combination of text-mining and rank-size approaches can be found in its flexibility
and generality, which let it be reproducible to a wide set of expert systems and text mining contexts.
The usefulness of the proposed method and the speech subsequent analysis is demonstrated by the
findings themselves. Indeed, in terms of impact, it is worth noting that interesting conclusions
of social, political and linguistic nature on how 45 United States Presidents, from April 30, 1789
till February 28, 2017 delivered political messages can be carried out. Indeed, the proposed analysis
shows some remarkable regularities, not only inside a given speech, but also among different speeches.
Moreover, under a purely methodological perspective, the presented contribution suggests possible
ways of generating a linguistic decision-making algorithm.
