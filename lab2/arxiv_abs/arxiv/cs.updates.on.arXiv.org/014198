In this paper, we study resilient distributed diffusion for multi-task estimation in the presence
of adversaries where networked agents must estimate distinct but correlated states of interest
by processing streaming data. We show that in general diffusion strategies are not resilient to
malicious agents that do not adhere to the diffusion-based information processing rules. In particular,
by exploiting the adaptive weights used for diffusing information, we develop time-dependent
attack models that drive normal agents to converge to states selected by the attacker. We show that
an attacker that has complete knowledge of the system can always drive its targeted agents to its
desired estimates. Moreover, an attacker that does not have complete knowledge of the system including
streaming data of targeted agents or the parameters they use in diffusion algorithms, can still
be successful in deploying an attack by approximating the needed information. The attack models
can be used for both stationary and non-stationary state estimation.In addition, we present and
analyze a resilient distributed diffusion algorithm that is resilient to any data falsification
attack in which the number of compromised agents in the local neighborhood of a normal agent is bounded.
The proposed algorithm guarantees that all normal agents converge to their true target states if
appropriate parameters are selected. We also analyze trade-off between the resilience of distributed
diffusion and its performance in terms of steady-state mean-square-deviation (MSD) from the correct
estimates. Finally, we evaluate the proposed attack models and resilient distributed diffusion
algorithm using stationary and non-stationary multi-target localization.
