Social media in scientific research offer a unique digital observatory of human behaviours and
hence great opportunities to conduct research at large scale answering complex sociodemographic
questions. We focus on the identification and assessment of biases in social media administered
surveys. This study aims to shed light on population, self-selection and behavioural biases, empirically
comparing the consistency between self-reported information collected traditionally versus
social media administered questionnaires, including demographic and psychometric attributes.
We engaged a demographically representative cohort of young adults in Italy (approximately 4,000
participants) in taking a traditionally administered online survey and then, after one year, we
invited them to use our ad hoc Facebook application (988 accepted) where they filled in part of the
initial survey. We assess the statistically significant differences indicating population,
self-selection, and behavioural biases due to the different context in which the questionnaire
is administered. Our findings suggest that surveys administered on Facebook do not exhibit major
biases with respect to traditionally administered surveys neither in terms of demographics, nor
personality traits. Loyalty, authority, and social binding values were higher in the Facebook
platform, probably due to the platform's intrinsic social character. We conclude, that Facebook
apps are valid research tools for administering demographic and psychometric surveys provided
that the entailed biases are taken into consideration. We contribute to the characterisation of
Facebook apps as a valid scientific tool to administer demographic and psychometric surveys, and
to the assessment of population, self-selection, and behavioural biases in the collected data.
