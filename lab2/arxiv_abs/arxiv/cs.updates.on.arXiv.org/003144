We examined the structure of intra- and postoperative case-collaboration networks among the surgical
service providers in a quaternary-care academic medical center, using retrospective electronic
medical record (EMR) data. We also analyzed the evolution of the network properties over time, as
changes in nodes and edges can affect the network structure. We used de-identified intra- and postoperative
data for adult patients, ages >= 21, who received nonambulatory/nonobstetric surgery at Shands
at the University of Florida between June 1, 2011 and November 1, 2014. The intraoperative segment
contained 30,245 surgical cases, and the postoperative segment considered 30,202 hospitalizations.
Our results confirmed the existence of strict small world structure in both intra- and postoperative
surgical team networks. A sudden declining trend is expected in the future in both intra- and postoperative
networks, since the small world property is currently at its peak. In addition, high network density
was observed in the intraoperative segment and partially in postoperative one, representing the
existence of cohesive clusters of providers. We also observed that the small world property is exhibited
more in the intraoperative compared to the postoperative network. Analyzing the temporal aspects
of the networks revealed the postoperative segment tends to lose its cohesiveness as the time passes.
Our results highlight the importance of stability of personnel in key positions. This highlights
the important role of the central players in the network that offers change-leaders the opportunity
to quantify and target those nodes as mediators of process change.
