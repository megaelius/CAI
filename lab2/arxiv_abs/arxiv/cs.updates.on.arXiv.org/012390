We study the problem of inter cell interference coordination (ICIC) with fixed transmit power in
OFDMA-based cellular networks, in which each base station (BS) needs to decide as to which subchannel,
if any, to allocate to each of its associated mobile stations (MS) for data transmission. In general,
there exists a trade-off between the total throughput (sum of throughputs of all the MSs) and fairness
under the allocations found by resource allocation schemes. We introduce the concept of $\tau-\alpha-$fairness
by modifying the concept of $\alpha-$fairness, which was earlier proposed in the context of designing
fair end-to-end window-based congestion control protocols for packet-switched networks. The
concept of $\tau-\alpha-$fairness allows us to achieve arbitrary trade-offs between the total
throughput and degree of fairness by selecting an appropriate value of $\alpha$ in $[0,\infty)$.
We show that for every $\alpha \in [0,\infty)$ and every $\tau > 0$, the problem of finding a $\tau-\alpha-$fair
allocation is NP-Complete. Further, we show that for every $\alpha \in [0, \infty)$, there exist
thresholds such that if the potential interference levels experienced by each MS on every subchannel
are above the threshold values, then the problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time by reducing
it to the bipartite graph matching problem. Also, we propose a simple, distributed subchannel allocation
algorithm for the ICIC problem, which is flexible, requires a small amount of time to operate, and
requires information exchange among only neighboring BSs. We investigate via simulations as to
how the algorithm parameters should be selected so as to achieve any desired trade-off between the
total throughput and fairness.
