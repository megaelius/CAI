We present algorithms for the $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate version of the closest vector problem
for certain norms. The currently fastest algorithm (Dadush and Kun 2016) for general norms has running
time of $2^{O(n)} (1/\epsilon)^n$. We improve this substantially in the following two cases. For
$\ell_p$-norms with $p>2$ (resp. $p \in [1,2]$) fixed, we present an algorithm with a running time
of $2^{O(n)} (1/\epsilon)^{n/2}$ (resp. $2^{O(n)} (1/\epsilon)^{n/p}$). This result is based
on a geometric covering problem, that was introduced in the context of CVP by Eisenbrand et al.: How
many convex bodies are needed to cover the ball of the norm such that, if scaled by two around their
centroids, each one is contained in the $(1+\epsilon)$-scaled homothet of the norm ball? We provide
upper bounds for this problem by exploiting the \emph{modulus of smoothness} of the $\ell_p$-balls.
Applying a covering scheme, we can boost any constant approximation algorithm for CVP to a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm with the improved run time, either using a straightforward sampling routine or using
the deterministic algorithm of Dadush for the construction of an epsilon net. The space requirement
only depends on the constant approximation CVP solver used. Furthermore, we generalise the result
of Eisenbrand et al. for the $\ell_\infty$-norm. For centrally symmetric polytopes (resp. zonotopes)
with $O(n)$ facets (resp. generated by $O(n)$ line segments), we provide a deterministic $O(\log_2(1/\epsilon))^{O(n)}$
time algorithm. Finally, we establish a connection between the \emph{modulus of smoothness} and
\emph{lattice sparsification}. Using the enumeration and sparsification tools developped by
Dadush, Kun, Peikert and Vempala, this leads to a simple alternative to the boosting procedure for
CVP under $\ell_p$-norms. This connection might be of independent interest.
