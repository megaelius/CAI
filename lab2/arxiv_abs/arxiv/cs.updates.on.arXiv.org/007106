Deep learning has been successfully applied to a variety of image classification tasks. There has
been keen interest to apply deep learning in the medical domain, particularly specialties that
heavily utilize imaging, such as ophthalmology. One issue that may hinder application of deep learning
to the medical domain is the vast amount of data necessary to train deep neural networks (DNNs). Because
of regulatory and privacy issues associated with medicine, and the generally proprietary nature
of data in medical domains, obtaining large datasets to train DNNs is a challenge, particularly
in the ophthalmology domain. Transfer learning is a technique developed to address the issue of
applying DNNs for domains with limited data. Prior reports on transfer learning have examined custom
networks to fully train or used a particular DNN for transfer learning. However, to the best of my
knowledge, no work has systematically examined a suite of DNNs for transfer learning for classification
of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and two key features of age-related macular degeneration.
This work attempts to investigate transfer learning for classification of these ophthalmic conditions.
Part I gives a condensed overview of neural networks and the DNNs under evaluation. Part II gives
the reader the necessary background concerning diabetic retinopathy and prior work on classification
using retinal fundus photographs. The methodology and results of transfer learning for diabetic
retinopathy classification are presented, showing that transfer learning towards this domain
is feasible, with promising accuracy. Part III gives an overview of diabetic macular edema, choroidal
neovascularization and drusen (features associated with age-related macular degeneration),
and presents results for transfer learning evaluation using optical coherence tomography to classify
these entities.
