Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) play a significant role in our critical infrastructure networks
from power-distribution to utility networks. The emerging smart-grid concept is a compelling
critical CPS infrastructure that relies on two-way communications between smart devices to increase
efficiency, enhance reliability, and reduce costs. However, compromised devices in the smart
grid poses several security challenges. Consequences of propagating fake data or stealing sensitive
smart grid information via compromised devices are costly. Hence, early behavioral detection
of compromised devices is critical for protecting the smart grid's components and data. To address
these concerns, in this paper, we introduce a novel and configurable system-level framework to
identify compromised smart grid devices. The framework combines system and function call tracing
techniques with signal processing and statistical analysis to detect compromised devices based
on their behavioral characteristics. We measure the efficacy of our framework with a realistic
smart grid substation testbed that includes both resource-limited and resource-rich devices.
In total, using our framework, we analyze six different types of compromised device scenarios with
different resources and attack payloads. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is
the first in detecting compromised CPS smart grid devices with system and function-level call tracing
techniques. The experimental results reveal an excellent rate for the detection of compromised
devices. Specifically, performance metrics include accuracy values between 95% and 99% for the
different attack scenarios. Finally, the performance analysis demonstrates that the use of the
proposed framework has minimal overhead on the smart grid devices' computing resources.
