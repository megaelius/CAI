Understanding protein function is one of the keys to understanding life at the molecular level.
It is also important in several scenarios including human disease and drug discovery. In this age
of rapid and affordable biological sequencing, the number of sequences accumulating in databases
is rising with an increasing rate. This presents many challenges for biologists and computer scientists
alike. In order to make sense of this huge quantity of data, these sequences should be annotated with
functional properties. UniProtKB consists of two components: i) the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database
containing protein sequences with reliable information manually reviewed by expert bio-curators
and ii) the UniProtKB/TrEMBL database that is used for storing and processing the unknown sequences.
Hence, for all proteins we have available the sequence along with few more information such as the
taxon and some structural domains. Pairwise similarity can be defined and computed on proteins
based on such attributes. Other important attributes, while present for proteins in Swiss-Prot,
are often missing for proteins in TrEMBL, such as their function and cellular localization. The
enormous number of protein sequences now in TrEMBL calls for rapid procedures to annotate them automatically.
In this work, we present DistNBLP, a novel Distributed Neighborhood-Based Label Propagation approach
for large-scale annotation of proteins. To do this, the functional annotations of reviewed proteins
are used to predict those of non-reviewed proteins using label propagation on a graph representation
of the protein database. DistNBLP is built on top of the "akka" toolkit for building resilient distributed
message-driven applications.
