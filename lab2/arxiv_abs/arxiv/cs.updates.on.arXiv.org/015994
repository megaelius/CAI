Network management, whether for malfunction analysis, failure prediction, performance monitoring
and improvement, generally involves large amounts of data from different sources. To effectively
integrate and manage these sources, automatically finding semantic matches among their schemas
or ontologies is crucial. Existing approaches on database matching mainly fall into two categories.
One focuses on the schema-level matching based on schema properties such as field names, data types,
constraints and schema structures. Network management databases contain massive tables (e.g.,
network products, incidents, security alert and logs) from different departments and groups with
nonuniform field names and schema characteristics. It is not reliable to match them by those schema
properties. The other category is based on the instance-level matching using general string similarity
techniques, which are not applicable for the matching of large network management databases. In
this paper, we develop a matching technique for large NEtwork MAnagement databases (NEMA) deploying
instance-level matching for effective data integration and connection. We design matching metrics
and scores for both numerical and non-numerical fields and propose algorithms for matching these
fields. The effectiveness and efficiency of NEMA are evaluated by conducting experiments based
on ground truth field pairs in large network management databases. Our measurement on large databases
with 1,458 fields, each of which contains over 10 million records, reveals that the accuracies of
NEMA are up to 95%. It achieves 2%-10% higher accuracy and 5x-14x speedup over baseline methods.
