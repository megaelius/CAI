Finding the next venue to be visited by a user in a specific city is an interesting, but challenging,
problem. Different techniques have been proposed, combining collaborative, content, social,
and geographical signals; however it is not trivial to decide which tech- nique works best, since
this may depend on the data density or the amount of activity logged for each user or item. At the same
time, cross-domain strategies have been exploited in the recommender systems literature when
dealing with (very) sparse situations, such as those inherently arising when recommendations
are produced based on information from a single city. In this paper, we address the problem of venue
recommendation from a novel perspective: applying cross-domain recommenda- tion techniques
considering each city as a different domain. We perform an experimental comparison of several recommendation
techniques in a temporal split under two conditions: single-domain (only information from the
target city is considered) and cross- domain (information from many other cities is incorporated
into the recommendation algorithm). For the latter, we have explored two strategies to transfer
knowledge from one domain to another: testing the target city and training a model with information
of the k cities with more ratings or only using the k closest cities. Our results show that, in general,
applying cross-domain by proximity increases the performance of the majority of the recom- menders
in terms of relevance. This is the first work, to the best of our knowledge, where so many domains (eight)
are combined in the tourism context where a temporal split is used, and thus we expect these results
could provide readers with an overall picture of what can be achieved in a real-world environment.
