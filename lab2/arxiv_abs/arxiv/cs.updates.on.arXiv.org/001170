Network analysis techniques remain rarely used for understanding international management strategies.
Our paper highlights their value as research tool in this field of social science using a large set
of micro-data (20,000) to investigate the presence of networks of subsidiaries overseas. The research
question is the following: to what extent did/do global Japanese business networks mirror organizational
models existing in Japan? In particular, we would like to assess how much the links building such
business networks are shaped by the structure of big-size industrial conglomerates of firms headquartered
in Japan, also described as HK. The major part of the academic community in the fields of management
and industrial organization considers that formal links can be identified among firms belonging
to HK. Miwa and Ramseyer (Miwa and Ramseyer 2002; Ramseyer 2006) challenge this claim and argue that
the evidence supporting the existence of HK is weak. So far, quantitative empirical investigation
has been conducted exclusively using data for firms incorporated in Japan. Our study tests the Miwa-Ramseyer
hypothesis (MRH) at the global level using information on the network of Japanese subsidiaries
overseas. The results obtained lead us to reject the MRH for the global dataset, as well as for subsets
restricted to the two main regions/countries of destination of Japanese foreign investment. The
results are robust to the weighting of the links, with different specifications, and are observed
in most industrial sectors. The global Japanese network became increasingly complex during the
late 20th century as a consequence of increase in the number of Japanese subsidiaries overseas but
the key features of the structure remained rather stable. We draw implications of these findings
for academic research in international business and for professionals involved in corporate strategy.
