In state-of-the-art deep neural networks, both feature normalization and feature attention have
become ubiquitous with significant performance improvement shown in a vast amount of tasks. They
are usually studied as separate modules, however. In this paper, we propose a light-weight integration
between, and thus harness the best of, the two schema. We present Attentive Normalization (AN) which
generalizes the common affine transformation component in the vanilla feature normalization.
Instead of learning a single affine transformation, AN learns a mixture of affine transformations
and utilizes their weighted-sum as the final affine transformation applied to re-calibrate features
in an instance-specific way. The weights are learned by leveraging feature attention. AN introduces
negligible extra parameters and computational cost (i.e., light-weight). AN can be used as a drop-in
replacement for any feature normalization technique which includes the affine transformation
component. In experiments, we test the proposed AN using three representative neural architectures
(ResNets, MobileNets-v2 and AOGNets) in the ImageNet-1000 classification benchmark and the MS-COCO
2107 object detection and instance segmentation benchmark. AN obtains consistent performance
improvement for different neural architectures in both benchmarks with absolute increase of top-1
accuracy in ImageNet-1000 between 0.5% and 2.0%, and absolute increase up to 1.8% and 2.2% for bounding
box and mask AP in MS-COCO respectively. The source codes are publicly available(Classification
