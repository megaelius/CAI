The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected virtually every region of the globe. At the time
of conducting this study, the number of daily cases in the United States is more than any other country,
and the trend is increasing in most of its states. Google trends provide public interest in various
topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods might provide
useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. The objective of this study
was to consider the predictive ability of different search terms (i.e., bars and restaurants) with
regards to the increase of daily cases in the US. We considered the causation of two different search
query trends, namely restaurant and bars, on daily positive cases in top-10 states/territories
of the United States with the highest and lowest daily new positive cases. In addition, to measure
the linear relation of different trends, we used Pearson correlation. Our results showed for states/territories
with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants,
which mainly happened after re-opening, significantly affect the daily new cases, on average.
California, for example, had most searches for restaurants on June 7th, 2020, which affected the
number of new cases within two weeks after the peak with the P-value of .004 for Granger's causality
test. Although a limited number of search queries were considered, Google search trends for restaurants
and bars showed a significant effect on daily new cases for regions with higher numbers of daily new
cases in the United States. We showed that such influential search trends could be used as additional
information for prediction tasks in new cases of each region. This prediction can help healthcare
leaders manage and control the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks on society and be prepared for the outcomes.
