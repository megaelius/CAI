This paper presents a novel feedback method on the motion planning for unicycle robots in environments
with static obstacles, along with extensions to the navigation and collision avoidance in multi-agent
robotic systems. The method employs a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, which have
high-order singular points, and whose integral curves exhibit various patterns depending on the
value of a parameter lambda. More specifically, for an a priori known value of lambda, the vector
field has a unique singular point of dipole type and its integral curves can be used to steer the unicycle
to a goal configuration. Furthermore, for the unique value of lambda that the vector field has a continuum
of singular points the integral curves are used to define flows around obstacles. An almost global
feedback motion plan can then be constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector
fields in a static obstacle environment. The approach does not suffer from the appearance of sinks
(stable nodes) away from goal point. Compared to other methods employing scalar functions which
are free of local minima, the proposed approach does not require any parameter tuning to render the
desired convergence properties; the values of the parameter lambda involved in the definition
of the vector field are a priori known. The proposed motion planning and control design is also extended
to the distributed coordination and control of multiple agents, where each agent needs to navigate
to a desired configuration while avoiding collisions with the remaining agents. The efficacy and
flexibility of the proposed methodology in adopting various sensing/communication patterns
is demonstrated via simulation results in static and dynamic environments.
