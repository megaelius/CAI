Until now, there is no e-management and automation necessary for the operations or procedures of
the departments in the Technical Education Foundation Erbil, and the foundation like any other
organization in Kurdistan region is not connected to the network, because there is not infrastructure
for that purpose. To solve this problem, comes the proposal DLMS4TEF, which requirements are divided
into hardware and software, as hardware will need Fast-Ethernet (LAN) technology to connect the
departments of the Foundation via Client-Server network later, when an infrastructure is established
for e-governments or e-management, it may be extended to the campus network. The software is represented
by installing windows server to implement the proposal design of DLMS4TEF, PHP script is used as
web programming that supports the server, where as the HTML and JavaScript are used to support the
client side. The dynamic DLMS4TEF will be based on relational database, which is created by using
MySQL, to support processing hundreds of queries per second, and the Kurdish Unicode to support
Kurdish fonts of GUI's, Moreover, for security DLMS4TEF allows each department in the Foundation
to enter its own section and prevent accessing other sections by using HTAccessible program which
allows the user to access by using his IP address and his computer only. The important conclusions
and advantages of applying DLMS4TEF are making backup to DLMS4TEF's databases using the option
(zipped) which allows them to reach the size of (3%) of the original database size, sufficient security
techniques, through achieving levels of security, hidden access to the administrator section,
and finally DLMS4TEF, when compared with the traditional methods and project of Oman, shows the
same efficiency of some, if not better, features of Oman. Keywords- E-management, Client-Server
