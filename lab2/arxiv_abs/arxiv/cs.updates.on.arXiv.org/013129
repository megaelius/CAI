The free energy plays a fundamental role in descriptions of many systems in continuum physics. Notably,
in multiphysics applications, it encodes thermodynamic coupling between different fields, such
as mechanics and chemistry. It thereby gives rise to driving forces on the dynamics of interaction
between the constituent phenomena. In mechano-chemically interacting materials systems, even
consideration of only compositions, order parameters and strains can render the free energy to
be reasonably high-dimensional. In proposing free energy functions as a paradigm for scale bridging,
we have previously exploited neural networks for their representation of such high-dimensional
functions. Specifically, we have developed an integrable deep neural network (IDNN) that can be
trained to free energy derivative data obtained from atomic scale models and statistical mechanics,
then analytically integrated to recover a free energy function. The motivation comes from the statistical
mechanics formalism, in which certain free energy derivatives are accessible for control of the
system, rather than the free energy itself in its entirety. Our current work combines the IDNN with
an active learning workflow to improve sampling of the free energy derivative data in a high-dimensional
input space. Treated as input-output maps, machine learning representations accommodate role
reversals between independent and dependent quantities as the mathematical descriptions change
across scale boundaries. As a prototypical material system we focus on Ni-Al. Phase field simulations
using the resulting IDNN representation for the free energy of Ni-Al demonstrates that the appropriate
physics of the material have been learned.
