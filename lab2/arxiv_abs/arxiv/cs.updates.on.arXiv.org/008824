Drone base station (DBS) is a promising technique to extend wireless connections for uncovered
users of terrestrial radio access networks (RAN). To improve user fairness and network performance,
in this paper, we design 3D trajectories of multiple DBSs in the drone assisted radio access networks
(DA-RAN) where DBSs fly over associated areas of interests (AoIs) and relay communications between
the base station (BS) and users in AoIs. We formulate the multi-DBS 3D trajectory planning and scheduling
as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem with the objective of minimizing the
average DBS-to-user (D2U) pathloss. The 3D trajectory variations in both horizontal and vertical
directions, as well as the state-of-the-art DBS-related channel models are considered in the formulation.
To address the non-convexity and NP-hardness of the MINLP problem, we first decouple it into multiple
integer linear programming (ILP) and quasi-convex sub-problems in which AoI association, D2U
communication scheduling, horizontal trajectories and flying heights of DBSs are respectively
optimized. Then, we design a multi-DBS 3D trajectory planning and scheduling algorithm to solve
the sub-problems iteratively based on the block coordinate descent (BCD) method. A k-means-based
initial trajectory generation and a search-based start slot scheduling are considered in the proposed
algorithm to improve trajectory design performance and ensure inter-DBS distance constraint,
respectively. Extensive simulations are conducted to investigate the impacts of DBS quantity,
horizontal speed and initial trajectory on the trajectory planning results. Compared with the
static DBS deployment, the proposed trajectory planning can achieve 10-15 dB reduction on average
D2U pathloss, and reduce the D2U pathloss standard deviation by 68%, which indicate the improvements
of network performance and user fairness.
