Stack Overflow has been heavily used by software developers as a popular way to seek programming-related
information from peers via the internet. The Stack Overflow community recommends users to provide
the related code snippet when they are creating a question to help others better understand it and
offer their help. Previous studies have shown that} a significant number of these questions are
of low-quality and not attractive to other potential experts in Stack Overflow. These poorly asked
questions are less likely to receive useful answers and hinder the overall knowledge generation
and sharing process. Considering one of the reasons for introducing low-quality questions in SO
is that many developers may not be able to clarify and summarize the key problems behind their presented
code snippets due to their lack of knowledge and terminology related to the problem, and/or their
poor writing skills, in this study we propose an approach to assist developers in writing high-quality
questions by automatically generating question titles for a code snippet using a deep sequence-to-sequence
learning approach. Our approach is fully data-driven and uses an attention mechanism to perform
better content selection, a copy mechanism to handle the rare-words problem and a coverage mechanism
to eliminate word repetition problem. We evaluate our approach on Stack Overflow datasets over
a variety of programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, Javascript, C# and SQL) and our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines
in both automatic and human evaluation. We have released our code and datasets to facilitate other
researchers to verify their ideas and inspire the follow-up work.
