In this work we propose a graph-based model that, utilizing relations between groups of System-calls,
distinguishes malicious from benign software samples and classifies the detected malicious samples
to one of a set of known malware families. More precisely, given a System-call Dependency Graph (ScDG)
that depicts the malware's behavior, we first transform it to a more abstract representation, utilizing
the indexing of System-calls to a set of groups of similar functionality, constructing thus an abstract
and mutation-tolerant graph that we call Group Relation Graph (GrG); then, we construct another
graph representation, which we call Coverage Graph (CvG), that depicts the dominating relations
between the nodes of a GrG graph. Based on the research so far in the field, we pointed out that behavior-based
graph representations had not leveraged the aspect of the temporal evolution of the graph. Hence,
the novelty of our work is that, preserving the initial representations of GrG and CvG graphs, we
focus on augmenting the potentials of theses graphs by adding further features that enhance its
abilities on detecting and further classifying to a known malware family an unknown malware sample.
To that end, we construct periodical instances of the graph that represent its temporal evolution
concerning its structural modifications, creating another graph representation that we call
Temporal Graphs. In this paper, we present the theoretical background behind our approach, discuss
the current technological status on malware detection and classification and demonstrate the
overall architecture of our proposed detection and classification model alongside with its underlying
main principles and its structural key-components.
