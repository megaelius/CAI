Rain streaks might severely degenerate the performance of video/image processing tasks. The investigations
on rain removal from video or a single image has thus been attracting much research attention in the
field of computer vision and pattern recognition, and various methods have been proposed against
this task in the recent years. However, there is still not a comprehensive survey paper to summarize
current rain removal methods and fairly compare their generalization performance, and especially,
still not a off-the-shelf toolkit to accumulate recent representative methods for easy performance
comparison and capability evaluation. Aiming at this meaningful task, in this study we present
a comprehensive review for current rain removal methods for video and a single image. Specifically,
these methods are categorized into model-driven and data-driven approaches, and more elaborate
branches of each approach are further introduced. Intrinsic capabilities, especially generalization,
of representative state-of-the-art methods of each approach have been evaluated and analyzed
by experiments implemented on synthetic and real data both visually and quantitatively. Furthermore,
we release a comprehensive repository, including direct links to 74 rain removal papers, source
codes of 9 methods for video rain removal and 20 ones for single image rain removal, 19 related project
pages, 6 synthetic datasets and 4 real ones, and 4 commonly used image quality metrics, to facilitate
reproduction and performance comparison of current existing methods for general users. Some limitations
and research issues worthy to be further investigated have also been discussed for future research
of this direction.
