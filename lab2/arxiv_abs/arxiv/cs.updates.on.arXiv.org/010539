This thesis consists of original contributions in the area of digital signal processing. The reconstruction
of signals sparse (highly concentrated) in various transform domains is the primary problem analyzed
in the thesis. The considered domains include Fourier, discrete Hermite, one-dimensional and
two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, as well as various time-frequency representations.
Sparse signals are reconstructed using sparsity measures, being, in fact, the measures of signal
concentration in the considered domains. The thesis analyzes the compressive sensing reconstruction
algorithms and introduces new approaches to the problem at hand. The missing samples influence
on analyzed transform domains is studied in detail, establishing the relations with the general
compressive sensing theory. This study provides new insights on phenomena arising due to the reduced
number of signal samples. The theoretical contributions involve new exact mathematical expressions
which describe performance and outcomes of reconstruction algorithms, also including the study
of the influence of additive noise, sparsity level and the number of available measurements on the
reconstruction performance, exact expressions for reconstruction errors and error probabilities.
Parameter optimization of the discrete Hermite transform is also studied, as well as the additive
noise influence on Hermite coefficients, resulting in new parameter optimization and denoising
algorithms. Additionally, an algorithm for the decomposition of multivariate multicomponent
signals is introduced, as well as an instantaneous frequency estimation algorithm based on the
Wigner distribution. Extensive numerical examples and experiments with real and synthetic data
validate the presented theory and shed a new light on practical applications of the results.
