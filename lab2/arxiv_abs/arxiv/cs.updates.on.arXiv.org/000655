The intuition that profit is optimized by maximizing marginal revenue is a guiding principle in
microeconomics. In the classical auction theory for agents with linear utility and single-dimensional
preferences, Bulow and Roberts (1989) show that the optimal auction of Myerson (1981) is in fact
optimizing marginal revenue. In particular Myerson's virtual values are exactly the derivative
of an appropriate revenue curve. This paper considers mechanism design in environments where the
agents have multi-dimensional and non-linear preferences. Understanding good auctions for these
environments is considered to be the main challenge in Bayesian optimal mechanism design. In these
environments maximizing marginal revenue may not be optimal and there is sometimes no direct way
to implement the marginal revenue maximization. Our contributions are three fold: we characterize
the settings for which marginal revenue maximization is optimal (by identifying an important condition
that we call revenue linearity), we give simple procedures for implementing marginal revenue maximization
in general, and we show that marginal revenue maximization is approximately optimal. Our approximation
factor smoothly degrades in a term that quantifies how far the environment is from ideal (where marginal
revenue maximization is optimal). Because the marginal revenue mechanism is optimal for single-dimensional
agents, our generalization immediately approximately extends many results for single-dimensional
agents. One of the biggest open questions in Bayesian algorithmic mechanism design is developing
methodologies that are not brute-force in the size of the agent type space. Our methods identify
a subproblem that, e.g., for unit-demand agents with values drawn from product distributions,
enables approximation mechanisms that are polynomial in the dimension.
