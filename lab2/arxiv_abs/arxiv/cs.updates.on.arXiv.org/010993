Spherical deconvolution is a widely used approach to quantify fiber orientation distribution
from diffusion MRI data. The damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) is developed to perform robust spherical
deconvolution on single shell diffusion MRI data. While the dRL algorithm could in theory be directly
applied to multi-shell data, it is not optimised to model the signal from multiple tissue types.
In this work, we introduce a new framework based on dRL - dubbed Generalized Richardson Lucy (GRL)
- that uses multi-shell data in combination with user-chosen tissue models to disentangle partial
volume effects and increase the accuracy in FOD estimation. The optimal weighting of multi-shell
data in the fit and the robustness to noise and partial volume effects of GRL was studied with synthetic
data. Subsequently, we investigated the performances of GRL in comparison to dRL on a high-resolution
diffusion MRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project and on an MRI dataset acquired at 3T on a clinical
scanner. The feasibility of including intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) effects in the modelling
was studied on a third dataset. Results of simulations show that GRL can robustly disentangle different
tissue types at SNR above 20 and improves the angular accuracy of the FOD estimation. On real data,
GRL provides signal fraction maps that are physiologically plausible and consistent between datasets.
When considering IVIM effects, high blood pseudo-diffusion fraction is observed in the medial
temporal lobe and in the sagittal sinus. In comparison to dRL, GRL provides sharper FODs and less
spurious peaks in presence of partial volume effects and results in a better tract termination at
the grey/white matter interface or at the outer cortical surface. In conclusion, GRL offers a new
modular and flexible framework to perform spherical deconvolution of multi-shell data.
