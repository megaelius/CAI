The paper presents a novel approach of spoofing wireless signals by using a general adversarial
network (GAN) to generate and transmit synthetic signals that cannot be reliably distinguished
from intended signals. It is of paramount importance to authenticate wireless signals at the PHY
layer before they proceed through the receiver chain. For that purpose, various waveform, channel,
and radio hardware features that are inherent to original wireless signals need to be captured.
In the meantime, adversaries become sophisticated with the cognitive radio capability to record,
analyze, and manipulate signals before spoofing. Building upon deep learning techniques, this
paper introduces a spoofing attack by an adversary pair of a transmitter and a receiver that assume
the generator and discriminator roles in the GAN and play a minimax game to generate the best spoofing
signals that aim to fool the best trained defense mechanism. The output of this approach is two-fold.
From the attacker point of view, a deep learning-based spoofing mechanism is trained to potentially
fool a defense mechanism such as RF fingerprinting. From the defender point of view, a deep learning-based
defense mechanism is trained against potential spoofing attacks when an adversary pair of a transmitter
and a receiver cooperates. The probability that the spoofing signal is misclassified as the intended
signal is measured for random signal, replay, and GAN-based spoofing attacks. Results show that
the GAN-based spoofing attack provides a major increase in the success probability of wireless
signal spoofing even when a deep learning classifier is used as the defense.
