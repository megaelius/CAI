The emergence of an ageing population is a significant public health concern. This has led to an increase
in the number of people living with progressive neurodegenerative disorders like dementia. Consequently,
the strain this is places on health and social care services means providing 24-hour monitoring
is not sustainable. Technological intervention is being considered, however no solution exists
to non-intrusively monitor the independent living needs of patients with dementia. As a result
many patients hit crisis point before intervention and support is provided. In parallel, patient
care relies on feedback from informal carers about significant behavioural changes. Yet, not all
people have a social support network and early intervention in dementia care is often missed. The
smart meter rollout has the potential to change this. Using machine learning and signal processing
techniques, a home energy supply can be disaggregated to detect which home appliances are turned
on and off. This will allow Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) to be assessed, such as eating and drinking,
and observed changes in routine to be detected for early intervention. The primary aim is to help
reduce deterioration and enable patients to stay in their homes for longer. A Support Vector Machine
(SVM) and Random Decision Forest classifier are modelled using data from three test homes. The trained
models are then used to monitor two patients with dementia during a six-month clinical trial undertaken
in partnership with Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust. In the case of load disaggregation for appliance
detection, the SVM achieved (AUC=0.86074, Sen=0.756 and Spec=0.92838). While the Decision Forest
achieved (AUC=0.9429, Sen=0.9634 and Spec=0.9634). ADLs are also analysed to identify the behavioural
patterns of the occupant while detecting alterations in routine.
