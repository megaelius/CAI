Operational cellular networks rely on closed and inflexible infrastructure tightly controlled
by a handful of vendors. As a consequence, configuration requires vendor support and lengthy manual
operations, which prevent Telco Operators (TOs) from unlocking the full network potential and
from being able to perform fine grained performance optimization, especially on a per-user basis.
To address this key issue, this paper introduces CellOS, a fully automated optimization and management
framework for cellular networks that requires negligible intervention ("zero-touch"). CellOS
leverages softwarization and automatic optimization principles to bridge the gap between Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) and cross-layer optimization. Unlike state-of-the-art SDN-inspired solutions
for cellular networking, CellOS: (i) Hides low-level network details through a general virtual
network abstraction; (ii) allows TOs to define high-level control objectives to dictate the desired
network behavior without requiring knowledge of optimization techniques, and (iii) automatically
generates and executes distributed control programs for the simultaneous optimization of heterogeneous
control objectives on different network slices. CellOS has been implemented and evaluated on an
indoor testbed with different LTE-compliant implementations: OpenAirInterface and srsLTE.
We further demonstrated CellOS capabilities on the long-range outdoor POWDER PAWR 5G platform.
Results from scenarios with multiple base stations and users show that CellOS is platform-independent
and self-adapts to diverse network deployments. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that CellOS
outperforms existing solutions on key performance metrics, including throughput (up to 86%),
energy efficiency (up to 84%) and fairness (up to 29%).
