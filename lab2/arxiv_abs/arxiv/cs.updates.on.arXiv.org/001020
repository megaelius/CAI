Distributed consensus computation over random graph processes is considered. The random graph
process is defined as a sequence of random variables which take values from the set of all possible
digraphs over the node set. At each time step, every node updates its state based on a Bernoulli trial,
independent in time and among different nodes: either averaging among the neighbor set generated
by the random graph, or sticking with its current state. Connectivity-independence and arc-independence
are introduced to capture the fundamental influence of the random graphs on the consensus convergence.
Necessary and/or sufficient conditions are presented on the success probabilities of the Bernoulli
trials for the network to reach a global almost sure consensus, with some sharp threshold established
revealing a consensus zero-one law. Convergence rates are established by lower and upper bounds
of the $\epsilon$-computation time. We also generalize the concepts of connectivity/arc independence
to their analogues from the $*$-mixing point of view, so that our results apply to a very wide class
of graphical models, including the majority of random graph models in the literature, e.g., Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi,
gossiping, and Markovian random graphs. We show that under $*$-mixing, our convergence analysis
continues to hold and the corresponding almost sure consensus conditions are established. Finally,
we further investigate almost sure finite-time convergence of random gossiping algorithms, and
prove that the Bernoulli trials play a key role in ensuring finite-time convergence. These results
add to the understanding of the interplay between random graphs, random computations, and convergence
probability for distributed information processing.
