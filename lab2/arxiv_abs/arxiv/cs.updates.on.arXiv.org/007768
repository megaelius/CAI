We study integrality gap (IG) lower bounds on strong LP and SDP relaxations derived by the Sherali-Adams
(SA), Lovasz-Schrijver-SDP (LS+), and Sherali-Adams-SDP (SA+) lift-and-project (L&P) systems
for the t-Partial-Vertex-Cover (t-PVC) problem, a variation of the classic Vertex-Cover problem
in which only t edges need to be covered. t-PVC admits a 2-approximation using various algorithmic
techniques, all relying on a natural LP relaxation. Starting from this LP relaxation, our main results
assert that for every epsilon > 0, level-Theta(n) LPs or SDPs derived by all known L&P systems that
have been used for positive algorithmic results (but the Lasserre hierarchy) have IGs at least (1-epsilon)n/t,
where n is the number of vertices of the input graph. Our lower bounds are nearly tight. Our results
show that restricted yet powerful models of computation derived by many L&P systems fail to witness
c-approximate solutions to t-PVC for any constant c, and for t = O(n). This is one of the very few known
examples of an intractable combinatorial optimization problem for which LP-based algorithms
induce a constant approximation ratio, still lift-and-project LP and SDP tightenings of the same
LP have unbounded IGs. We also show that the SDP that has given the best algorithm known for t-PVC has
integrality gap n/t on instances that can be solved by the level-1 LP relaxation derived by the LS
system. This constitutes another rare phenomenon where (even in specific instances) a static LP
outperforms an SDP that has been used for the best approximation guarantee for the problem at hand.
Finally, one of our main contributions is that we make explicit of a new and simple methodology of
constructing solutions to LP relaxations that almost trivially satisfy constraints derived by
all SDP L&P systems known to be useful for algorithmic positive results (except the La system).
