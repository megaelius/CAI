We present a distributed formation control strategy for agents with a variety of dynamics to achieve
a desired planar formation. Our approach is based on the barycentric-coordinate-based (BCB) control,
which is fully distributed, does not require inter-agent communication or a common sense of orientation,
and can be implemented using relative position measurements acquired by agents in their local coordinate
frames. This removes the need for global positioning or alignment of local coordinate frames, which
are required across several existing strategies. We show how the BCB control for agents with the
simplest dynamical model, i.e., the single-integrator dynamics, can be extended to agents with
higher-order dynamics such as quadrotors, and nonholonomic agents such as unicycles and cars.
Specifically, our extension preserves the desired convergence and robustness guarantees of the
BCB approach and is provably robust to saturations in the input and unmodeled linear actuator dynamics
for unicycle and car agents. We further show that under our proposed BCB control design, the agents
can move along a rotated and scaled control direction without affecting the convergence to the desired
formation. This observation is used to design a fully distributed collision avoidance strategy,
which is often not considered in the formation control literature. We demonstrate the proposed
approach in simulations and further present a distributed robotic platform to test the strategy
experimentally. Our experimental platform consists of off-the-shelf equipment that can be used
to test and validate other multi-agent algorithms. The code and implementation instructions for
this platform are available online.
