Small-cell densification is a strategy enabling the offloading of users from macro base stations
(MBSs), in order to alleviate their load and increase the coverage, especially, for cell-edge users.
In parallel, as the network increases in density, the BS cooperation emerges as an efficient design
method towards the demands for drastic improvement of the system performance against the detrimental
overall interference. In addition, the tiers are enhanced with cell association policies by introducing
the concept of the association probability. Above this and motivated by the advantages of cooperation
among BSs, the small base stations (SBSs) are enriched with this property in their design. SBS cooperation
allows shedding light into its impact on the cell selection rules in multi-antenna HetNets. Under
these settings, software-defined networking (SDN) is introduced smoothly to play the leading
role in the orchestration of the network. {In particular, heavy operations such as the coordination
and the cell association are undertaken by virtue of an SDN controller performing and managing efficiently
the corresponding computations due to its centralized adaptability and dynamicity towards the
enhancement and potential scalability of the network}. In this context, we derive the coverage
probability and the mean achievable rate. Not only we show the outperformance of BS cooperation
over uncoordinated BSs, but we also demonstrate that the SBS cooperation enables the admittance
of more users from the macro-cell BSs (MBSs). Moreover, we investigate the performance of different
transmission techniques, and we identify the optimal bias in each case when SBSs cooperate. Finally,
we depict that the SBS densification is beneficial until a specific density value since a further
increase does not increase the coverage probability.
