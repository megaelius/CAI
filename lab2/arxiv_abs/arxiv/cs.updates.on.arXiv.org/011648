Rental scams are a type of advance fee fraud, in which the scammer tries to get a victim to pay a deposit
to rent an apartment of which the scammer pretends to be the landlord. We specifically focused on
fraudulent long-term rentals advertised in the UK on Craigslist. After a victim responds to the
scammer's advertisement, the scammer attempts to persuade them to transfer money without having
seen the property. We were interested in which persuasion techniques scammers use, and in assessing
their skill at the art of persuasion. During a period of three weeks, we scraped 2112 letting advertisements,
identified the fraudulent advertisements and had 44 conversations of around 4 or 5 emails each with
the scammers. Our analysis indicates that Cialdini`s marketing-based social persuasion strategies,
such as liking, appeal to authority, and the need for commitment and consistency are extensively
implemented by rental scammers. Of Stajano and Wilson's scam-based persuasion strategies, an
appeal to sympathy (i.e., kindness) and need for greed were commonly used. We identified two further
social persuasion strategies: establishing credibility and removing objections. At a superficial
level, rental scammers seem skilled at their job, because they mimic genuine landlords and use a
range of effective persuasion techniques. However, when examining their emails more closely,
we see they often use pre-scripted emails, their mimicry is often incompetent, and they have a lack
of language skills and cultural knowledge that may tip people off. They appear to be the criminal
equivalent of a boilerhouse sales operation, a modus operandi that has not previously been studied
by cybercrime researchers.
