We evaluated the effectiveness of an automated bird sound identification system in a situation
that emulates a realistic, typical application. We trained classification algorithms on a crowd-sourced
collection of bird audio recording data and restricted our training methods to be completely free
of manual intervention. The approach is hence directly applicable to the analysis of multiple species
collections, with labelling provided by crowd-sourced collection. We evaluated the performance
of the bird sound recognition system on a realistic number of candidate classes, corresponding
to real conditions. We investigated the use of two canonical classification methods, chosen due
to their widespread use and ease of interpretation, namely a k Nearest Neighbour (kNN) classifier
with histogram-based features and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with time-summarisation features.
We further investigated the use of a certainty measure, derived from the output probabilities of
the classifiers, to enhance the interpretability and reliability of the class decisions. Our results
demonstrate that both identification methods achieved similar performance, but we argue that
the use of the kNN classifier offers somewhat more flexibility. Furthermore, we show that employing
an outcome certainty measure provides a valuable and consistent indicator of the reliability of
classification results. Our use of generic training data and our investigation of probabilistic
classification methodologies that can flexibly address the variable number of candidate species/classes
that are expected to be encountered in the field, directly contribute to the development of a practical
bird sound identification system with potentially global application. Further, we show that certainty
measures associated with identification outcomes can significantly contribute to the practical
usability of the overall system.
