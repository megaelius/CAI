We consider the following problem: There is a set of items (e.g., movies) and a group of agents (e.g.,
passengers on a plane); each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items. Our goal is to
pick a set of $K$ items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example
we are to pick $K$ movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system). However, the actual utility
that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends
on how the agent ranks the item among available ones (in the movie example, the perceived value of
a movie depends on the values of the other ones available). Extreme examples of our model include
the setting where each agent derives utility from his or her most preferred item only (e.g., an agent
will watch his or her favorite movie only), from his or her least preferred item only (e.g., the agent
worries that he or she will be somehow forced to watch the worst available movie), or derives $1/K$
of the utility from each of the available items (e.g., the agent will pick a movie at random). Formally,
to model this process of adjusting the derived utility, we use the mechanism of ordered weighted
average (OWA) operators. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a formal specification
of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where particular OWA operators are applicable.
Second, we show that, in general, our problem is NP-hard but---depending on the OWA operator and
the nature of agents' utilities---there exist good, efficient approximation algorithms (sometimes
even polynomial time approximation schemes). Interestingly, our results generalize and build
upon those for proportional represented in multiwinner voting scenarios.
