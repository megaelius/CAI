Caching has recently attracted a lot of attention in the wireless communications community, as
a means to cope with the increasing number of users consuming web content from mobile devices. Caching
offers an opportunity for a win-win scenario: nearby content can improve the video streaming experience
for the user, and free up valuable network resources for the operator. At the same time, recent works
have shown that recommendations of popular content apps are responsible for a significant percentage
of users requests. As a result, some very recent works have considered how to nudge recommendations
to facilitate the network (e.g., increase cache hit rates). In this paper, we follow up on this line
of work, and consider the problem of designing cache friendly recommendations for long viewing
sessions; specifically, we attempt to answer two open questions in this context: (i) given that
recommendation position affects user click rates, what is the impact on the performance of such
network-friendly recommender solutions? (ii) can the resulting optimization problems be solved
efficiently, when considering both sequences of dependent accesses (e.g., YouTube) and position
preference? To this end, we propose a stochastic model that incorporates position-aware recommendations
into a Markovian traversal model of the content catalog, and derive the average cost of a user session
using absorbing Markov chain theory. We then formulate the optimization problem, and after a careful
sequence of equivalent transformations show that it has a linear program equivalent and thus can
be solved efficiently. Finally, we use a range of real datasets we collected to investigate the impact
of position preference in recommendations on the proposed optimal algorithm. Our results suggest
more than 30\% improvement with respect to state-of-the-art methods.
