The trade-off between language expressiveness and system scalability (E&S) is a well-known problem
in RDF stream reasoning. Higher expressiveness supports more complex reasoning logic, however,
it may also hinder system scalability. Current research mainly focuses on logical frameworks suitable
for stream reasoning as well as the implementation and the evaluation of prototype systems. These
systems are normally developed in a centralized setting which suffer from inherent limited scalability,
while an in-depth study of applying distributed solutions to cover E&S is still missing. In this
paper, we aim to explore the feasibility of applying modern distributed computing frameworks to
meet E&S all together. To do so, we first propose BigSR, a technical demonstrator that supports a
positive fragment of the LARS framework. For the sake of generality and to cover a wide variety of
use cases, BigSR relies on the two main execution models adopted by major distributed execution
frameworks: Bulk Synchronous Processing (BSP) and Record-at-A-Time (RAT). Accordingly, we implement
BigSR on top of Apache Spark Streaming (BSP model) and Apache Flink (RAT model). In order to conclude
on the impacts of BSP and RAT on E&S, we analyze the ability of the two models to support distributed
stream reasoning and identify several types of use cases characterized by their levels of support.
This classification allows for quantifying the E&S trade-off by assessing the scalability of each
type of use case \wrt its level of expressiveness. Then, we conduct a series of experiments with 15
queries from 4 different datasets. Our experiments show that BigSR over both BSP and RAT generally
scales up to high throughput beyond million-triples per second (with or without recursion), and
RAT attains sub-millisecond delay for stateless query operators.
