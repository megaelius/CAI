Purpose: The purpose of this study was to observe change in accuracies of convolutional neural networks
(CNN) models (ratio of correct classifications to total predictions) on thoracic radiological
images by creating different binary classification models based on age, gender, and image pre-processing
filters on 14 pathologies. Methodology: This is a quantitative research exploring variation in
CNN model accuracies. Radiological thoracic images were divided by age and gender and pre-processed
by various image processing filters. Findings: We found partial support for enhancement to model
accuracies by segregating modeling images by age and gender and applying image processing filters
even though image processing filters are sometimes thought of as information filters. Research
limitations: This study may be biased because it is based on radiological images by another research
that tagged the images using an automated process that was not checked by a human. Practical implications:
Researchers may want to focus on creating models segregated by demographics and pre-process the
modeling images using image processing filters. Practitioners developing assistive technologies
for thoracic diagnoses may benefit from incorporating demographics and employing multiple models
simultaneously with varying statistical likelihood. Originality/value: This study uses demographics
in model creation and utilizes image processing filters to improve model performance. Keywords:
