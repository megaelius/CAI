In the near future, it is envisioned that cellular networks will have to cope with extensive Internet
of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, a required feature of cellular IoT will be the capability to
serve simultaneously a large number of devices with heterogeneous demands and qualities of Channel
State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we focus on an overloaded Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with two groups of CSIT qualities, namely one group
of users (representative of high-end devices) for which the transmitter has partial knowledge
of the CSI, the other group of users (representative of IoT devices) for which the transmitter only
has knowledge of the statistical CSI. We introduce Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), a new
multiple access based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) for cellular IoT. Two strategies are
proposed, namely, Time Partitioning-RSMA (TP-RSMA) and Power Partitioning-RSMA (PP-RSMA).
The former independently serves the two groups of users over orthogonal time slots while the latter
jointly serves the two groups of users within the same time slot in a non-orthogonal manner. We first
show at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) that PP-RSMA achieves the optimum Degrees-of-Freedom
(DoF) in an overloaded MISO BC with heterogeneous CSIT qualities and then show at finite SNR that,
by marrying the benefits of PP and RSMA, PP-RSMA achieves explicit sum rate gain over TP-RSMA and
all baseline schemes. Furthermore, PP-RSMA is robust to CSIT inaccuracy and flexible to cope with
Quality of Service (QoS) rate constraints of all users. The DoF and rate analysis helps us draw the
conclusion that PP-RSMA is a powerful framework for cellular IoT with a large number of devices.
