Neuromorphic systems are designed to emulate certain structural and dynamical properties of biological
neuronal networks, with the aim of inheriting the brain's functional performance and energy efficiency
in artificial-intelligence applications [1,2]. Among the platforms existing today, the spike-based
BrainScaleS system stands out by realizing fast analog dynamics which can boost computationally
expensive tasks [3]. Here we use the latest BrainScaleS generation [4] for the algorithm-free simulation
of quantum systems, thereby opening up an entirely new application space for these devices. This
requires an appropriate spike-based representation of quantum states and an associated training
method for imprinting a desired target state onto the network. We employ a representation of quantum
states using probability distributions [5,6], enabling the use of a Bayesian sampling framework
for spiking neurons [7]. For training, we developed a Hebbian learning scheme that explicitly exploits
the inherent speed of the substrate, which enables us to realize a variety of network topologies.
We encoded maximally entangled states of up to four qubits and observed fidelities that imply genuine
$N$-partite entanglement. In particular, the encoding of entangled pure and mixed two-qubit states
reaches a quality that allows the observation of Bell correlations, thus demonstrating that non-classical
features of quantum systems can be captured by spiking neural dynamics. Our work establishes an
intriguing connection between quantum systems and classical spiking networks, and demonstrates
the feasibility of simulating quantum systems with neuromorphic hardware.
