Community structure is one of the most relevant features encountered in numerous real-world applications
of networked systems. Despite the tremendous effort of scientists working on this subject over
the past few decades to characterize, model, and analyze communities, more investigations are
needed to better understand the impact of community structure and its dynamics on networked systems.
Here, we first focus on generative models of communities in complex networks and their role in developing
strong foundation for community detection algorithms. We discuss modularity and the use of modularity
maximization as the basis for community detection. Then, we overview the Stochastic Block Model,
its different variants, and inference of community structures from such models. Next, we focus
on time evolving networks, where existing nodes and links can disappear and/or new nodes and links
may be introduced. The extraction of communities under such circumstances poses an interesting
and non-trivial problem that has gained considerable interest over the last decade. We briefly
discuss considerable advances made in this field recently. Finally, we focus on immunization strategies
essential for targeting the influential spreaders of epidemics in modular networks. Their main
goal is to select and immunize a small proportion of individuals from the whole network to control
the diffusion process. Various strategies have emerged over the years suggesting different ways
to immunize nodes in networks with overlapping and non-overlapping community structure. We first
discuss stochastic strategies that require little or no information about the network topology
at the expense of their performance. Then, we introduce deterministic strategies that have proven
to be very efficient in controlling the epidemic outbreaks, but require complete knowledge of the
network.
