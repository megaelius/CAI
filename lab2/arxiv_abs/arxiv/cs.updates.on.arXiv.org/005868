Non-malleable codes were introduced by Dziembowski, Pietrzak, and Wichs (JACM 2018) as a generalization
of standard error correcting codes to handle severe forms of tampering on codewords. This notion
has attracted a lot of recent research, resulting in various explicit constructions, which have
found applications in tamper-resilient cryptography and connections to other pseudorandom objects
in theoretical computer science. We continue the line of investigation on explicit constructions
of non-malleable codes in the information theoretic setting, and give explicit constructions
for several new classes of tampering functions. (1) Interleaved split-state tampering: Here the
codeword is partitioned in an unknown way by an adversary, and then tampered with by a split-state
tampering function. (2) Linear function composed with split-state tampering: In this model, the
codeword is first tampered with by a split-state adversary, and then the whole tampered codeword
is further tampered with by a linear function. In fact our results are stronger, and we can handle
linear function composed with interleaved split-state tampering. (3) Bounded communication
split-state tampering: In this model, the two split-state tampering adversaries are allowed to
participate in a communication protocol with a bounded communication budget. Our results are the
first explicit constructions of non-malleable codes in any of these tampering models. We derive
all these results from explicit constructions of seedless non-malleable extractors, which we
believe are of independent interest. Using our techniques, we also give an improved seedless extractor
for an unknown interleaving of two independent sources.
