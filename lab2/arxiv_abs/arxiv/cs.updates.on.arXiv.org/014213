Nonlinear parametric inverse problems appear in many applications and are typically very expensive
to solve, especially if they involve many measurements. These problems pose huge computational
challenges as evaluating the objective function or misfit requires the solution of a large number
of parameterized partial differential equations, typically one per source term. Newton-type
algorithms, which may be required for fast convergence, typically require the additional solution
of a large number of adjoint problems. The use of parametric model reduction may substantially alleviate
this problem. In [de Sturler, E., Gugercin, S., Kilmer, M. E., Chaturantabut, S., Beattie, C., and
O'Connell, M. (2015). Nonlinear Parametric Inversion Using Interpolatory Model Reduction. SIAM
Journal on Scientific Computing, 37(3)], interpolatory model reduction was successfully used
to drastically speed up inversion for Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT). However, when using model
reduction in high dimensional parameter spaces, obtaining error bounds in parameter space is typically
intractable. In this paper, we propose to use stochastic estimates to remedy this problem. At the
cost of one (randomized) full-scale linear solve per optimization step we obtain a robust algorithm.
Moreover, since we can now update the model when needed, this robustness allows us to further reduce
the order of the reduced order model and hence the cost of computing and using it, further decreasing
the cost of inversion. We also propose a method to update the model reduction basis that reduces the
number of large linear solves required by 46%-98% compared with the fixed reduced-order model.
We demonstrate that this leads to a highly efficient and robust inversion method.
