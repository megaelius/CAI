Scientists are attempting to use models of ever increasing complexity, especially in medicine,
where gene-based diseases such as cancer require better modeling of cell regulation. Complex models
suffer from uncertainty and experiments are needed to reduce this uncertainty. Because experiments
can be costly and time-consuming it is desirable to determine experiments providing the most useful
information. If a sequence of experiments is to be performed, experimental design is needed to determine
the order. A classical approach is to maximally reduce the overall uncertainty in the model, meaning
maximal entropy reduction. A recently proposed method takes into account both model uncertainty
and the translational objective, for instance, optimal structural intervention in gene regulatory
networks, where the aim is to alter the regulatory logic to maximally reduce the long-run likelihood
of being in a cancerous state. The mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) quantifies uncertainty
based on the degree to which model uncertainty affects the objective. Experimental design involves
choosing the experiment that yields the greatest reduction in MOCU. This paper introduces finite-horizon
dynamic programming for MOCU-based sequential experimental design and compares it to the greedy
approach, which selects one experiment at a time without consideration of the full horizon of experiments.
A salient aspect of the paper is that it demonstrates the advantage of MOCU-based design over the
widely used entropy-based design for both greedy and dynamic-programming strategies and investigates
the effect of model conditions on the comparative performances.
