Path planning in robotics often requires finding high-quality solutions to continuously valued
and/or high-dimensional problems. These problems are challenging and most planning algorithms
instead solve simplified approximations. Popular approximations include graphs and random samples,
as respectively used by informed graph-based searches and anytime sampling-based planners. Informed
graph-based searches, such as A*, traditionally use heuristics to search a priori graphs in order
of potential solution quality. This makes their search efficient but leaves their performance
dependent on the chosen approximation. If its resolution is too low, they may not find a (suitable)
solution but if it is too high, they may take a prohibitively long time to do so. Anytime sampling-based
planners, such as RRT*, traditionally use random sampling to approximate the problem domain incrementally.
This allows them to increase resolution until a suitable solution is found but makes their search
dependent on the random samples. This arbitrary sequence fills the problem domain by expanding
the search in every direction and may be prohibitively inefficient at finding a solution. This paper
unifies and extends these two approaches to develop Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed, anytime
sampling-based planner. BIT* solves continuous planning problems efficiently by using sampling
and heuristics to alternately approximate and search the problem domain. Its search is ordered
by potential solution quality, as in A*, and its approximation improves indefinitely with additional
computational time, as in RRT*. It is shown analytically to be almost-surely asymptotically optimal
and experimentally to outperform existing sampling-based planners, especially on high-dimensional
planning problems.
