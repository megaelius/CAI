Knowledge graphs are structured representations of facts in a graph, where nodes represent entities
and edges represent relationships between them. Recent research has resulted in the development
of several large KGs. However, all of them tend to be sparse with very few facts per entity. In the first
part of the thesis, we propose three solutions to alleviate this problem: (1) KG Canonicalization,
i.e., identifying and merging duplicate entities in a KG, (2) Relation Extraction which involves
automating the process of extracting semantic relationships between entities from unstructured
text, and (3) Link prediction which includes inferring missing facts based on the known facts in
a KG. Traditional Neural Networks like CNNs and RNNs are constrained to handle Euclidean data. However,
graphs in Natural Language Processing (NLP) are prominent. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) have been proposed to address this shortcoming and have been successfully applied for several
problems. In the second part of the thesis, we utilize GCNs for Document Timestamping problem and
for learning word embeddings using dependency context of a word instead of sequential context.
In this third part of the thesis, we address two limitations of existing GCN models, i.e., (1) The
standard neighborhood aggregation scheme puts no constraints on the number of nodes that can influence
the representation of a target node. This leads to a noisy representation of hub-nodes which coves
almost the entire graph in a few hops. (2) Most of the existing GCN models are limited to handle undirected
graphs. However, a more general and pervasive class of graphs are relational graphs where each edge
has a label and direction associated with it. Existing approaches to handle such graphs suffer from
over-parameterization and are restricted to learning representation of nodes only.
