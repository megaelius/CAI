Introduction: Internet technologies could strengthen data collection and integration and have
been used extensively in public health research. It is necessary to apply this technology to further
investigate the behaviour and health of biomedical researchers. A browser-based extension was
developed by researchers and clinicians to promote the collection and analysis of researchers'
behavioural and psychological data. This protocol illustrates an observational study aimed at
(1) characterising the health status of biomedical researchers in China and assessing work stress,
job satisfaction, role conflict, role ambiguity, and family support; (2) identifying the association
between work, behaviour, and health; and (3) investigating the association between behaviour
and mental status. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of the influences of job, work
environment, and family support on the mental and physical health of biomedical researchers. Methods
and analysis: This is a prospective observational study; all candidates will be recruited from
China. Participants will install an extension on their Internet browsers, which will collect data
when they are accessing PubMed. A web-based survey will be sent to the user interfaces every 6 months
that will involve sociodemographic variables, perceived stress scale, job satisfaction scale,
role conflict and ambiguity scale, and family support scale. Machine-learning algorithms will
analyse the data generated during daily access. Ethics and dissemination: This study received
ethical approval from the ethics committee of the Shanghai Children's Medical Centre (reference
number SCMCIRB-K2018082). Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications
and conference presentations.
