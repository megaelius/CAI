MultiWOZ 2.0 (Budzianowski et al., 2018) is a recently released multi-domain dialogue dataset
spanning 7 distinct domains and containing over 10,000 dialogues. Though immensely useful and
one of the largest resources of its kind to-date, MultiWOZ 2.0 has a few shortcomings. Firstly, there
is substantial noise in the dialogue state annotations and dialogue utterances which negatively
impact the performance of state-tracking models. Secondly, follow-up work (Lee et al., 2019) has
augmented the original dataset with user dialogue acts. This leads to multiple co-existent versions
of the same dataset with minor modifications. In this work we tackle the aforementioned issues by
introducing MultiWOZ 2.1. To fix the noisy state annotations, we use crowdsourced workers to re-annotate
state and utterances based on the original utterances in the dataset. This correction process results
in changes to over 32% of state annotations across 40% of the dialogue turns. In addition, we fix 146
dialogue utterances by canonicalizing slot values in the utterances to the values in the dataset
ontology. To address the second problem, we combined the contributions of the follow-up works into
MultiWOZ 2.1. Hence, our dataset also includes user dialogue acts as well as multiple slot descriptions
per dialogue state slot. We then benchmark a number of state-of-the-art dialogue state tracking
models on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset and show the joint state tracking performance on the corrected
state annotations. We are publicly releasing MultiWOZ 2.1 to the community, hoping that this dataset
resource will allow for more effective models across various dialogue subproblems to be built in
the future.
