Many clinical workflows depend on interactive computer systems for highly technical, conceptual
work products, such as diagnoses, treatment plans, care coordination, and case management. We
describe an automatic logic reasoner to verify objective specifications for these highly technical,
but abstract, work products that are essential to care. The conceptual work products specifications
serve as a fundamental output requirement, which must be clearly stated, correct and solvable.
There is strategic importance for such specifications because, in turn, they enable system model
checking to verify that machine functions taken with user procedures are actually able to achieve
these abstract products. We chose case management of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) outpatients as our
use case for its challenging complexity. As a first step, we illustrate how graphical class and state
diagrams from UML can be developed and critiqued with subject matter experts to serve as specifications
of the conceptual work product of case management. A key feature is that the specification must be
declarative and thus independent of any process or technology. Our Work Domain Ontology with tools
from Semantic Web is needed to translate UML class and state diagrams for verification of solvability
with automatic reasoning. The solvable model will then be ready for subsequent use with model checking
on the system of human procedures and machine functions. We used the expressive rule language SPARQL
Inferencing Notation (SPIN) to develop formal representations of the UML class diagram, the state
machine, and their interactions. Using SPIN, we proved the consistency of the interactions of static
and dynamic concepts. We discussed how the new SPIN rule engine could be incorporated in the Object
Management Group (OMG) Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM)
