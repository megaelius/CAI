Experimental data is often affected by uncontrolled variables that make analysis and interpretation
difficult. For spatiotemporal systems, this problem is further exacerbated by their intricate
dynamics. Modern machine learning methods are particularly well-suited for analyzing and modeling
complex datasets, but to be effective in science, the result needs to be interpretable. We demonstrate
an unsupervised learning technique for extracting interpretable physical parameters from noisy
spatiotemporal data and for building a transferable model of the system. In particular, we implement
a physics-informed architecture based on variational autoencoders that is designed for analyzing
systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The architecture is trained end-to-end
and extracts latent parameters that parameterize the dynamics of a learned predictive model for
the system. To test our method, we train our model on simulated data from a variety of PDEs with varying
dynamical parameters that act as uncontrolled variables. Numerical experiments show that our
method can accurately identify relevant parameters and extract them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal
data (tested with roughly 10% added noise). These extracted parameters correlate well (linearly
with $R^2 > 0.95$) with the ground truth physical parameters used to generate the datasets. Our method
for discovering interpretable latent parameters in spatiotemporal systems will allow us to better
analyze and understand real-world phenomena and datasets, which often have unknown and uncontrolled
variables that alter the system dynamics and cause varying behaviors that are difficult to disentangle.
