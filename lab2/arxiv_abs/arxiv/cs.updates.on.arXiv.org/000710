Current low-latency anonymity systems use complex overlay networks to conceal a user's IP address,
introducing significant latency and network efficiency penalties compared to normal Internet
usage. Rather than obfuscating network identity through higher level protocols, we propose a more
direct solution: a routing protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity,
providing a strong foundation for Internet privacy, while allowing identity to be defined in those
higher level protocols where it adds value. Given current research initiatives advocating "clean
slate" Internet designs, an opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol
that decouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity problem. Recently,
Hsiao et al. proposed such a protocol (LAP), but it does not protect the user against a local eavesdropper
or an untrusted ISP, which will not be acceptable for many users. Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation
Internet routing protocol that provides anonymity against an active attacker located at any single
point within the network, including the user's ISP. A major design challenge is to provide this protection
without including an application-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge
in path construction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path segments at a dovetail
node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of the path so that data transmission bypasses
the matchmaker. Additional design features include the choice of many different paths through
the network and the joining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party. We develop
a systematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and we demonstrate
the privacy and efficiency of our proposal by simulation, using a model of the complete Internet
at the AS-level.
