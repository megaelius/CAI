The ever-increasing demand for unlicensed spectrum has prompted regulators in the US and Europe
to consider opening up the 6 GHz bands for unlicensed access. These bands will open up 1.2 GHz of additional
spectrum for unlicensed radio access technologies (RATs), such as Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio Unlicensed
(NR-U), in the US and if permitted, 500 MHz of additional spectrum in Europe. The abundance of spectrum
in these bands creates new opportunities for the design of mechanisms and features that can support
the emerging bandwidth-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. However, coexistence
of unlicensed devices both with the bands' incumbent users and across different unlicensed RATs
present significant challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing
literature on various issues surrounding the operations of unlicensed RATs in the 6 GHz bands. In
particular, we discuss how key features in next-generation Wi-Fi are being designed to leverage
these additional unlicensed bands. We also shed light on the foreseeable challenges that designers
of unlicensed RATs might face in the near future. Our survey encompasses key research papers, contributions
submitted to standardization bodies and regulatory agencies, and documents presented at various
other venues. Finally, we highlight a few key research problems that are likely to arise due to unlicensed
operations in the 6 GHz bands. Tackling these research challenges effectively will be critical
in ensuring that the new unlicensed bands are efficiently utilized while guaranteeing the interference-free
operation of the bands' incumbent users.
