Cryptocurrencies came to the world in the recent decade and attempted to offer a new order where the
financial system is not governed by a centralized entity, and where you have complete control over
your account without the need to trust strangers (governments and banks above all). However, cryptocurrency
systems face many challenges that prevent them from being used as an everyday coin. In this paper
we attempt to take one step forward by introducing a cryptocurrency system that has many important
properties. Perhaps the most revolutionary property is its deterministic operation over a fully
asynchronous communication network, which has sometimes been mistakenly considered to be impossible.
By avoiding any temporal assumptions, we get a system that is robust against arbitrary delays in
the network, and whose latency is only a function of the actual communication delay. The presented
system is based on familiar concepts $-$ banking and democracy. Our banks, just like normal banks,
keep their clients' money and perform their clients' requests. However, because of the cryptographic
scheme, your bank cannot do anything in your account without your permission and its entire operation
is transparent so you don't have to trust it blindly. The democracy means that every operation performed
by the banks (e.g., committing a client transaction) has to be accepted by a majority of the coin holders,
in a way that resembles representative democracy where the banks are the representatives and where
each client implicitly delegates his voting power (the sum of money in his account) to his bank. A
client can switch banks at any moment, by simply applying a corresponding request to the new bank
of his choice.
