Dementia is a syndrome characterised by the decline of different cognitive abilities. Alzheimer's
Disease (AD) is the most common dementia affecting cognitive domains such as memory and learning,
perceptual-motion or executive function. High rate of deaths and high cost for detection, treatments
and patient's care count amongst its consequences. Early detection of AD is considered of high importance
for improving the quality of life of patients and their families. The aim of this thesis is to introduce
novel non-invasive early diagnosis methods in order to speed the diagnosis, reduce the associated
costs and make them widely accessible. Novel AD's screening tests based on virtual environments
using new immersive technologies combined with advanced Human Computer Interaction (HCI) systems
are introduced. Four tests demonstrate the wide range of screening mechanisms based on cognitive
domain impairments that can be designed using virtual environments. The use of emotion recognition
to analyse AD symptoms has been also proposed. A novel multimodal dataset was specifically created
to remark the autobiographical memory deficits of AD patients. Data from this dataset is used to
introduce novel descriptors for Electroencephalogram (EEG) and facial images data. EEG features
are based on quaternions in order to keep the correlation information between sensors, whereas,
for facial expression recognition, a preprocessing method for motion magnification and descriptors
based on origami crease pattern algorithm are proposed to enhance facial micro-expressions. These
features have been proved on classifiers such as SVM and Adaboost for the classification of reactions
to autobiographical stimuli such as long and short term memories.
