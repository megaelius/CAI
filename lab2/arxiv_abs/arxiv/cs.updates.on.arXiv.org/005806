Multiple design iterations are inevitable in nanometer Integrated Circuit (IC) design flow until
desired printability and performance metrics are achieved. This starts with placement optimization
aimed at improving routability, wirelength, congestion and timing in the design. Contrarily,
no such practice exists on a floorplanned layout, during the early stage of the design flow. Recently,
STAIRoute \cite{karb2} aimed to address that by identifying the shortest routing path of a net through
a set of routing regions in the floorplan in multiple metal layers. Since the blocks in hierarchical
ASIC/SoC designs do not use all the permissible routing layers for the internal routing corresponding
to standard cell connectivity, the proposed STAIRoute framework is not an effective for early global
routability assessment. This leads to improper utilization of routing area, specifically in higher
routing layers with fewer routing blockages, as the lack of placement of standard cells does not
facilitates any routing of their interconnections. This paper presents a generalized model for
early global routability assessment, HGR, by utilizing the free regions over the blocks beyond
certain metal layers. The proposed (hybrid) routing model comprises of (a) the junction graph model
in STAIRoute routing through the block boundary regions in lower routing layers, and (ii) the grid
graph model for routing in higher layers over the free regions of the blocks. Experiment with the
latest floorplanning benchmarks exhibit an average reduction of $4\%$, $54\%$ and $70\%$ in netlength,
via count, and congestion respectively when HGR is used over STAIRoute. Further, we conducted another
experiment on an industrial design flow targeted for $45nm$ process, and the results are encouraging
with $~3$X runtime boost when early global routing is used in conjunction with the existing physical
design flow.
