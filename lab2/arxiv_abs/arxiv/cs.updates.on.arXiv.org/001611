Decentralized control of robots has attracted huge research interests. However, some of the research
used unrealistic assumptions without collision avoidance. This report focuses on the collision-free
control for multiple robots in both complete coverage and search tasks in 2D and 3D areas which are
arbitrary unknown. All algorithms are decentralized as robots have limited abilities and they
are mathematically proved. The report starts with the grid selection in the two tasks. Grid patterns
simplify the representation of the area and robots only need to move straightly between neighbor
vertices. For the 100% complete 2D coverage, the equilateral triangular grid is proposed. For the
complete coverage ignoring the boundary effect, the grid with the fewest vertices is calculated
in every situation for both 2D and 3D areas. The second part is for the complete coverage in 2D and 3D
areas. A decentralized collision-free algorithm with the above selected grid is presented driving
robots to sections which are furthest from the reference point. The area can be static or expanding,
and the algorithm is simulated in MATLAB. Thirdly, three grid-based decentralized random algorithms
with collision avoidance are provided to search targets in 2D or 3D areas. The number of targets can
be known or unknown. In the first algorithm, robots choose vacant neighbors randomly with priorities
on unvisited ones while the second one adds the repulsive force to disperse robots if they are close.
In the third algorithm, if surrounded by visited vertices, the robot will use the breadth-first
search algorithm to go to one of the nearest unvisited vertices via the grid. The second search algorithm
is verified on Pioneer 3-DX robots. The general way to generate the formula to estimate the search
time is demonstrated. Algorithms are compared with five other algorithms in MATLAB to show their
effectiveness.
