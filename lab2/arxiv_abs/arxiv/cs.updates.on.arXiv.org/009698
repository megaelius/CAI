A self-adaptive system can modify its own structure and behavior at runtime based on its perception
of the environment, of itself and of its requirements. To develop a self-adaptive system, software
developers codify knowledge about the system and its environment, as well as how adaptation actions
impact on the system. However, the codified knowledge may be insufficient due to design time uncertainty,
and thus a self-adaptive system may execute adaptation actions that do not have the desired effect.
Online learning is an emerging approach to address design time uncertainty by employing machine
learning at runtime. Online learning accumulates knowledge at runtime by, for instance, exploring
not-yet executed adaptation actions. We address two specific problems with respect to online learning
for self-adaptive systems. First, the number of possible adaptation actions can be very large.
Existing online learning techniques randomly explore the possible adaptation actions, but this
can lead to slow convergence of the learning process. Second, the possible adaptation actions can
change as a result of system evolution. Existing online learning techniques are unaware of these
changes and thus do not explore new adaptation actions, but explore adaptation actions that are
no longer valid. We propose using feature models to give structure to the set of adaptation actions
and thereby guide the exploration process during online learning. Experimental results involving
four real-world systems suggest that considering the hierarchical structure of feature models
may speed up convergence by 7.2% on average. Considering the differences between feature models
before and after an evolution step may speed up convergence by 64.6% on average. [...]
