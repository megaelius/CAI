A set of about 80 researchers, practitioners, and federal agency program managers participated
in the NSF-sponsored Grand Challenges in Resilience Workshop held on Purdue campus on March 19-21,
2019. The workshop was divided into three themes: resilience in cyber, cyber-physical, and socio-technical
systems. About 30 attendees in all participated in the discussions of cyber resilience. This article
brings out the substantive parts of the challenges and solution approaches that were identified
in the cyber resilience theme. In this article, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber
resilience in a few representative application domains and outline foundational solutions to
address these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes: resilience-by-design and
resilience-by-reaction. We use examples of autonomous systems as the application drivers motivating
cyber resilience. We focus on some autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and
aerial vehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief). For resilience-by-design,
we focus on design methods in software that are needed for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast,
for resilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding, reconfiguring,
or recovering at runtime when failures happen. We also discuss the notion of adaptive execution
to improve resilience, execution transparently and adaptively among available execution platforms
(mobile/embedded, edge, and cloud). For each of the two themes, we survey the current state, and
the desired state and ways to get there. We conclude the paper by looking at the research challenges
we will have to solve in the short and the mid-term to make the vision of resilient autonomous systems
a reality.
