Next-generation Home WiFi networks have to step forward in terms of performance. New applications
such as on-line games, virtual reality or high quality video contents will further demand higher
throughput levels, as well as low latency. Beyond physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC)
improvements, deploying multiple access points (APs) in a given area may significantly contribute
to achieve those performance goals by simply improving average coverage and data rates. However,
it opens a new challenge: to determine the best AP for each given station (STA). This article studies
the achievable performance gains of using secondary APs, also called Extenders, in Home WiFi networks
in terms of throughput and delay. To do that, we introduce a centralized, easily implementable channel
load aware selection mechanism for WiFi networks that takes full advantage of IEEE 802.11k/v capabilities
to collect data from STAs, and distribute association decisions accordingly. These decisions
are completely computed in the AP (or, alternatively, in an external network controller) based
on an AP selection decision metric that, in addition to RSSI, also takes into account the load of both
access and backhaul wireless links for each potential STA-AP/Extender connection. Performance
evaluation of the proposed channel load aware AP and Extender selection mechanism has been first
conducted in a purpose-built simulator, resulting in an overall improvement of the main analyzed
metrics (throughput, delay, and fraction of scenarios that are kept uncongested) when compared
to the traditional RSSI-based WiFi association. This trend was confirmed when the channel load
aware mechanism was tested in a real deployment, and STAs were associated to the indicated AP/Extender.
