With widespread applications of artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of the perception,
understanding, decision-making and control for autonomous systems have improved significantly
in the past years. When autonomous systems consider the performance of accuracy and transferability
simultaneously, several AI methods, like adversarial learning, reinforcement learning (RL)
and meta-learning, show their powerful performance. Here, we review the learning-based approaches
in autonomous systems from the perspectives of accuracy and transferability. Accuracy means that
a well-trained model shows good results during the testing phase, in which the testing set shares
a same task or a data distribution with the training set. Transferability means that when an trained
model is transferred to other testing domains, the accuracy is still good. Firstly, we introduce
some basic concepts of transfer learning and then present some preliminaries of adversarial learning,
RL and meta-learning. Secondly, we focus on reviewing the accuracy and transferability to show
the advantages of adversarial learning, like generative adversarial networks (GANs), in typical
computer vision tasks in autonomous systems, including image style transfer, image super-resolution,
image deblurring/dehazing/rain removal, semantic segmentation, depth estimation and person
re-identification. Then, we further review the performance of RL and meta-learning from the aspects
of accuracy and transferability in autonomous systems, involving robot navigation and robotic
manipulation. Finally, we discuss several challenges and future topics for using adversarial
learning, RL and meta-learning in autonomous systems.
