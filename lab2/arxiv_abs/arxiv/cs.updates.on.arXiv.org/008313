Objective: This paper suggests a novel deep learning architecture for multi-class classification
and localization of abnormalities in mammograms. We first assume a weakly supervised setting and
present a new approach with data driven decisions. Next, we extend this method to a semi-supervised
setting that engages a small set of local annotations. Methods: This novel network combines two
learning branches with region-level classification and region ranking, explicitly handling
the common normal images without any finding. Our method enables detection of abnormalities in
full mammogram resolution for both weakly and semi-supervised settings. A novel objective function
allows engagement of local annotations into the model. Results: We present the impact of our schemes
with several performance measures for classification and localization, to evaluate the cost effectiveness
of lesion annotation effort. Our evaluation is mainly made over a large multi-center mammography
dataset of $\sim$3,000 mammograms with various findings. The results for weakly supervised learning
show improvement of 4% in AUC, 10-17% in partial AUC (AUC at high sensitivity) and 8-15% in specificity
at 0.85 sensitivity, compared to a previous approach. Local annotation of only 5% of the mammograms
further boosts performance by 8.2% in specificity and 30% in detection. Conclusion: Lack of laborious
local annotations for supervised learning can be addressed by a weakly supervised method that can
leverage a subset of locally annotated data. Significance: Weakly and semi-supervised methods
coupled with detection suggest a cost effective and explainable model to be adopted by radiologists
in the field.
