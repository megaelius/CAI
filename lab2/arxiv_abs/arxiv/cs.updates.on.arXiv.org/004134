The efficiency of decentralized book systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum has always been a challenge.
It is usually measured by three major factors: scalability, throughput, and latency. Scalability
refers to how the system capacity is increased by adding more physical resources. Throughput measures
the volume of transactions for a given period of time, where most current solutions attempt to improve
such as NEO, EOS, etc. Latency measures the processing time of any single transaction. In current
blockchain based systems, the block generation rate is the main latency bottleneck. Off-chain
processes such as state channels are the most recent work that can integrate partial inbound transactions,
reducing latency. Unfortunately, the state channel introduces more issues at the same time, such
as cross-channel synchronization, which makes the state channel unavailable for full adoption
of current blockchain solutions. In order to solve the efficiency problem, we proposed an end-to-end
solution called ALZA, which links the dedicated high-throughput blockchain with self-organizing
payment fields. This mechanism allows arbitrary set of users to create payment fields that process
extremely low latency transactions within each field. Therefore, users can make transactions
almost immediately. Since all transactions are conducted within fields, transaction costs will
be reduced by several orders of magnitude. In addition, ALZA distributes main ledger to each client
through an innovative replication mechanism. Therefore, the system will be significantly more
robust to blockchain system failures. In theory, ALZA can complete millions of transactions in
one second, which naturally supports high-frequency trading.
