We extend the Mobile Server Problem, introduced in SPAA'17, to a model where k identical mobile resources,
here named servers, answer requests appearing at points in the Euclidean space. In order to reduce
communication costs, the positions of the servers can be adapted by a limited distance m_s per round
for each server. The costs are measured similar to the classical Page Migration Problem, i.e., answering
a request induces costs proportional to the distance to the nearest server, and moving a server induces
costs proportional to the distance multiplied with a weight D. We show that, in our model, no online
algorithm can have a constant competitive ratio, i.e., one which is independent of the input length
n, even if an augmented moving distance of (1+\delta)m_s is allowed for the online algorithm. Therefore
we investigate a restriction of the power of the adversary dictating the sequence of requests: We
demand locality of requests, i.e., that consecutive requests come from points in the Euclidean
space with distance bounded by some constant m_c. We show constant lower bounds on the competitiveness
in this setting (independent of n, but dependent on k, m_s and m_c). On the positive side, we present
a deterministic online algorithm with bounded competitiveness when augmented moving distance
and locality of requests is assumed. Our algorithm simulates any given algorithm for the classical
k-Page Migration problem as guidance for its servers and extends it by a greedy move of one server
in every round. The resulting competitive ratio is polynomial in the number of servers k, the ratio
between m_c and m_s, the inverse of the augmentation factor 1/\delta and the competitive ratio of
the simulated k-Page Migration algorithm.
