Off-chain scaling techniques allow mutually distrustful parties to execute a contract locally
among themselves instead of on the global blockchain. Parties involved in the transaction maintain
a multi-signature fraud-proof off-chain replicated state machine, and only resort to on-chain
consensus when absolutely necessary (e.g., when two parties disagree on a state). Off-chain scaling
is the only way to support fully scale-out decentralized applications ("dApps") with better privacy
and no compromise on the trust and decentralization guarantees. It is the inflection point for blockchain
mass adoption, and will be the engine behind all scalable dApps. Celer Network is an Internet-scale,
trust-free, and privacy-preserving platform where everyone can quickly build, operate, and use
highly scalable dApps. It is not a standalone blockchain but a networked system running on top of
existing and future blockchains. It provides unprecedented performance and flexibility through
innovation in off-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned cryptoeconomics. Celer Network
embraces a layered architecture with clean abstractions that enable rapid evolution of each individual
component, including a generalized state channel and sidechain suite that supports fast and generic
off-chain state transitions; a provably optimal value transfer routing mechanism that achieves
an order of magnitude higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions; a powerful development
framework and runtime for off-chain applications; and a new cryptoeconomic model that provides
network effect, stable liquidity, and high availability for the off-chain ecosystem.
