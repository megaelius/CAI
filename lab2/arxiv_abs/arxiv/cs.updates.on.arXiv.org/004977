For workers, the exposure to on-site hazards can result in fatalities and serious injuries. To improve
safety outcomes, different approaches have been implemented for health and safety training in
the construction sector, such as traditional tools and computer-aided technologies (e.g., serious
games and virtual reality). However, the effectiveness of these approaches has been barely explored.
In order to bridge this gap, a systematic review of existing studies was conducted. Unlike previous
review studies in this field that focused on uncovering the technology characters and challenges,
this study mainly evaluated the effectiveness of training using traditional tools and computer-aided
technologies on the well-being of individuals. Measures of the effectiveness included knowledge
acquisition, unsafe behaviour alteration, and injury rate reduction. Results indicated that:
1. the effectiveness of traditional tools is sufficiently supported by statistical evidence;
and 2. the use of computer-aided technologies has evidence to support its effectiveness, but more
solid evidence is required to support this statement. It was also found that the overall performance
of computer-aided technologies is superior in several technical aspects compared to traditional
tools, namely, representing actual workplace situations, providing text-free interfaces, having
better user engagement, and being more cost-efficient. Finally, using the systematic review findings,
a theoretical framework is proposed as a potential solution to help future research in this field
systematically examine the effectiveness and usability of their approaches. This framework is
theoretical in nature and requires further validation. A further study is therefore proposed to
test and validate this framework.
