The problem of dispatching emergency responders to service traffic accidents, fire, distress
calls and crimes plagues urban areas across the globe. While such problems have been extensively
looked at, most approaches are offline. Such methodologies fail to capture the dynamically changing
environments under which critical emergency response occurs, and therefore, fail to be implemented
in practice. Any holistic approach towards creating a pipeline for effective emergency response
must also look at other challenges that it subsumes - predicting when and where incidents happen
and understanding the changing environmental dynamics. We describe a system that collectively
deals with all these problems in an online manner, meaning that the models get updated with streaming
data sources. We highlight why such an approach is crucial to the effectiveness of emergency response,
and present an algorithmic framework that can compute promising actions for a given decision-theoretic
model for responder dispatch. We argue that carefully crafted heuristic measures can balance the
trade-off between computational time and the quality of solutions achieved and highlight why such
an approach is more scalable and tractable than traditional approaches. We also present an online
mechanism for incident prediction, as well as an approach based on recurrent neural networks for
learning and predicting environmental features that affect responder dispatch. We compare our
methodology with prior state-of-the-art and existing dispatch strategies in the field, which
show that our approach results in a reduction in response time with a drastic reduction in computational
time.
