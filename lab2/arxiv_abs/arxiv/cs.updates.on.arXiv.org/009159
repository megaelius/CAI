The safety of mobile robots in dynamic environments is predicated on making sure that they do not
collide with obstacles. In support of such safety arguments, we analyze and formally verify a series
of increasingly powerful safety properties of controllers for avoiding both stationary and moving
obstacles: (i) static safety, which ensures that no collisions can happen with stationary obstacles,
(ii) passive safety, which ensures that no collisions can happen with stationary or moving obstacles
while the robot moves, (iii) the stronger passive friendly safety in which the robot further maintains
sufficient maneuvering distance for obstacles to avoid collision as well, and (iv) passive orientation
safety, which allows for imperfect sensor coverage of the robot, i. e., the robot is aware that not
everything in its environment will be visible. We complement these provably correct safety properties
with liveness properties: we prove that provably safe motion is flexible enough to let the robot
still navigate waypoints and pass intersections. We use hybrid system models and theorem proving
techniques that describe and formally verify the robot's discrete control decisions along with
its continuous, physical motion. Moreover, we formally prove that safety can still be guaranteed
despite sensor uncertainty and actuator perturbation, and when control choices for more aggressive
maneuvers are introduced. Our verification results are generic in the sense that they are not limited
to the particular choices of one specific control algorithm but identify conditions that make them
simultaneously apply to a broad class of control algorithms.
