The list scheduling or online load balancing problem is a central question in scheduling theory:
given a set of $m$ offline machines $i\in M$ and a sequence of $n$ jobs $j\in J$ arriving online with
load $p_{i,j} \geq 0$ if assigned to machine $i$, find an assignment of each job to some machine so
as to minimize a given norm of overall machine loads. Chekuri and Khanna (SIAM J. of Comp. 2006) generalized
the list scheduling problem to vector loads, where the load of job $j$ on machine $i$ is now a $d$-dimensional
vector $\langle p_{i,j}(k): k\in [d]\rangle$. They gave an $O(\log^2 d)$ offline algorithm in
the case of identical machines for the makespan norm, which was later improved to $O(\log d)$ by Azar
et al. (STOC 2013) (and independently by Meyerson et al. (APPROX 2013)) using an online algorithm.
In this paper, we completely solve the online vector scheduling problem in both the identical and
unrelated machines settings. Our main results are: -Identical machines: For the makespan norm,
we show that the optimal competitive ratio is $O(\log d / \log \log d)$. The main component of this
result is a new information theoretic lower bound of $\Omega(\log d / \log \log d)$ for online algorithms.
We also show that our lower bound is asymptotically tight by giving an $O(\log d / \log \log d)$-competitive
online algorithm. Our techniques also extend to asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds for
general $L_p$ norms. -Unrelated machines:For arbitrary (and non-identical) $L_p$ norms on each
dimension, we give an algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(p + \log d)$. We also show that this
result is asymptotically tight by demonstrating a lower bound of $\Omega(\log d)$. For the makespan
norm, our algorithm has a competitive ratio of $O(\log m + \log d)$, which is also asymptotically
tight.
