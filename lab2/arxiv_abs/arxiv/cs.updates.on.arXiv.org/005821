As object recognition becomes an increasingly common ML task, and recent research demonstrating
CNNs vulnerability to attacks and small image perturbations necessitate fully understanding
the foundations of object recognition. We focus on understanding the mechanisms behind how neural
networks generalize to spatial transformations of complex objects. While humans excel at discriminating
between objects shown at new positions, orientations, and scales, past results demonstrate that
this may be limited to familiar objects - humans demonstrate low tolerance of spatial-variances
for purposefully constructed novel objects. Because training artificial neural networks from
scratch is similar to showing novel objects to humans, we seek to understand the factors influencing
the tolerance of CNNs to spatial transformations. We conduct a thorough empirical examination
of seven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. By training on a controlled face image
dataset, we measure model accuracy across different degrees of 5 transformations: position, size,
rotation, Gaussian blur, and resolution transformation due to resampling. We also examine how
learning strategy affects generalizability by examining how different amounts of pre-training
have on model robustness. Overall, we find that the most significant contributor to transformation
invariance is pre-training on a large, diverse image dataset. Moreover, while AlexNet tends to
be the least robust network, VGG and ResNet architectures demonstrate higher robustness for different
transformations. Along with kernel visualizations and qualitative analyses, we examine differences
between learning strategy and inherent architectural properties in contributing to invariance
of transformations, providing valuable information towards understanding how to achieve greater
robustness to transformations in CNNs.
