Glass published the first report on the assessment of systems and software engineering scholars
and institutions two decades ago. The ongoing, annual survey of publications in this field provides
fund managers, young scholars, graduate students, etc. with useful information for different
purposes. However, the studies have been questioned by some critics because of a few shortcomings
of the evaluation method. It is actually very hard to reach a widely recognized consensus on such
an assessment of scholars and institutions. This paper presents a module and automated method for
assessment and trends analysis in software engineering compared with the prior studies. To achieve
a more reasonable evaluation result, we take into consideration more high-quality publications,
the rank of each publication analyzed, and the different roles of authors named on each paper in question.
According to the 7638 papers published in 36 publications from 2008 to 2013, the statistics of research
subjects roughly follow power laws, implying the interesting Matthew Effect. We then identify
the Top 20 scholars, institutions and countries or regions in terms of a new evaluation rule based
on the frequently-used one. The top-ranked scholar is Mark Harman of the University College London,
UK, the top-ranked institution is the University of California, USA, and the top-ranked country
is the USA. Besides, we also show two levels of trend changes based on the EI classification system
and user-defined uncontrolled keywords, as well as noteworthy scholars and institutions in a specific
research area. We believe that our results would provide a valuable insight for young scholars and
graduate students to seek possible potential collaborators and grasp the popular research topics
in software engineering.
