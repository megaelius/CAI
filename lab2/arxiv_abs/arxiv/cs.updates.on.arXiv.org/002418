Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables a passive backscatter device to transmit information
to a reader using ambient RF signals, and has emerged as a promising solution to green Internet-of-Things
(IoT). Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient
backscatter device (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which
the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish
the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then,
for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal
linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For
frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal
ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the
proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown
that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based
detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when
the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered
signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks
to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF
source.
