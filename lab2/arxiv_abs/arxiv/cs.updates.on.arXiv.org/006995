In this paper, a novel derivative-free pattern search based algorithm for Black-box optimization
is proposed over a simplex constrained parameter space. At each iteration, starting from the current
solution, new possible set of solutions are found by adding a set of derived step-size vectors to
the initial starting point. While deriving these step-size vectors, precautions and adjustments
are considered so that the set of new possible solution points still remain within the simplex constrained
space. Thus, no extra time is spent in evaluating the (possibly expensive) objective function at
infeasible points (points outside the unit-simplex space). While minimizing any objective function
of m parameters, within each iteration, the objective function is evaluated at 2m new possible solution
points. So, upto 2m parallel threads can be incorporated which makes the computation even faster
while optimizing expensive objective functions over high-dimensional parameter space. Once
a local minimum is discovered, in order to find a better solution, a novel `re-start' strategy is
considered to increase the likelihood of finding a better solution. Unlike existing pattern search
based methods, a sparsity control parameter is introduced which can be used to induce sparsity in
the solution in case the solution is expected to be sparse in prior. A comparative study of the performances
of the proposed algorithm and other existing algorithms are shown for a few low, moderate and high-dimensional
optimization problems. Upto 338 folds improvement in computation time is achieved using the proposed
algorithm over Genetic algorithm along with better solution. The proposed algorithm is used to
estimate the simultaneous quantiles of North Atlantic Hurricane velocities during 1981-2006
by maximizing a non-closed form likelihood function with (possibly) multiple maximums.
