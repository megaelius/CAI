Public databases of large-scale topology measures (e.g.RIPE Atlas) are very popular both in the
research and in the practitioners communities. They are used, at least, for understanding the state
of the Internet in real time, for outage detection, and to get a broad baseline view of the Internet
evolution over time. However, despite the large amount of investigations, the dynamic aspects
of these measures have not been fully understood. As an example, looking at time-series of such measures,
patterns that repeat at regular intervals. More specifically, looking at a time-series of traceroutes
involving certain source-target pairs it happens to observe that the paths follow alternations
that repeat several times. Have they the features of periodicity? What are their main characteristics?
In this paper we study the problem of detecting and characterizing periodicities in Internet topology
measures. For this purpose we devise an algorithm based on autocorrelation and string matching.
First, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in-vitro, on randomly generated measures
containing artificial periodicities. Second, we exploit the algorithm to verify how frequently
traceroute sequences extracted from popular databases of topology measures exhibit a periodic
behavior. We show that a surprisingly high percentage of measures present one or more periodicities.
This happens both with traceroutes performed at different frequencies and with different types
of traceroutes. Third, we apply our algorithm to databases of BGP updates, a context where periodicities
are even more unexpected than the one of traceroutes. Also in this case our algorithm is able to spot
periodicities. We argue that some of them are related to oscillations of the BGP control plane.
