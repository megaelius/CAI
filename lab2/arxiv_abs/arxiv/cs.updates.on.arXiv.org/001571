Developing an automated vehicle, that can handle the complicated driving scenarios and appropriately
interact with other road users, requires the ability to semantically learn and understand the driving
environment, oftentimes, based on the analysis of massive amount of naturalistic driving data.
An important paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and develop
deeper insights is understanding traffic primitives, representing principal compositions of
the entire traffic. However, the exploding driving data growth presents a great challenge in extracting
primitives from a long-term multidimensional time-series traffic scenario data with multiscale
varieties of road users get involved. Therefore, automatic primitive extraction is becoming one
of the cost-efficient ways to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic
scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be appropriate for automated
driving applications and also 2) be easily combined to generate new driving scenarios. Existing
literature does not provide a method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale
traffic data. The contribution of this paper has two manifolds. One is that we proposed a new framework
to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of limited traffic data. The other one is that we
introduce a nonparametric Bayesian learning method -- a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process
hidden Markov model -- that can automatically extract primitives from multidimensional driving
data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed method is validated using
one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment results show that the nonparametric Bayesian
learning method extracts primitives from traffic scenarios where both the binary and continuous
events coexist.
