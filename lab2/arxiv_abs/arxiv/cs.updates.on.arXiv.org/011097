We propose a simple and computationally efficient method for dense subgraph discovery, which is
a classic problem both in theory and in practice. It is well known that dense subgraphs can have strong
correlation with structures of interest in real-world networks across various domains ranging
from social networks to biological systems [Gionis and Tsourakakis `15]. For the densest subgraph
problem, Charikar's greedy algorithm [Asashiro `00, Charikar `00] is very simple, and can typically
find result of quality much better than the provable factor 2-approximation, which makes it very
popular in practice. However, it is also known to give suboptimal output in many real-world examples.
On the other hand, finding the exact optimal solution requires the computation of maximum flow.
Despite the existence of highly optimized maximum flow solvers, such computation still incurs
prohibitive computational costs for the massive graphs arising in modern data science applications.
We devise an iterative algorithm which naturally generalizes the greedy algorithm of Charikar.
Our algorithm draws insights from the iterative approaches from convex optimization, and also
exploits the dual interpretation of the densest subgraph problem. We have empirical evidence that
our algorithm is much more robust against the structural heterogeneities in real-world datasets,
and converges to the optimal subgraph density even when the simple greedy algorithm fails. On the
other hand, in instances where Charikar's algorithm performs well, our algorithm is able to quickly
verify its optimality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is significantly faster than
the maximum flow based exact optimal algorithm. We conduct experiments on datasets from broad domains,
and our algorithm achieves $\sim$145$\times$ speedup on average to find subgraphs whose density
is at least 90\% of the optimal value.
