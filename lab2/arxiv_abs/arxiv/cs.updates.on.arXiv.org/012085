Traffic forecasting is a classical task for traffic management and it plays an important role in
intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic data are mostly collected by traffic
sensors or probe vehicles, sensor failures and the lack of probe vehicles will inevitably result
in missing values in the collected raw data for some specific links in the traffic network. Although
missing values can be imputed, existing data imputation methods normally need long-term historical
traffic state data. As for short-term traffic forecasting, especially under edge computing and
online prediction scenarios, traffic forecasting models with the capability of handling missing
values are needed. In this study, we consider the traffic network as a graph and define the transition
between network-wide traffic states at consecutive time steps as a graph Markov process. In this
way, missing traffic states can be inferred step by step and the spatial-temporal relationships
among the roadway links can be Incorporated. Based on the graph Markov process, we propose a new neural
network architecture for spatial-temporal data forecasting, i.e. the graph Markov network (GMN).
By incorporating the spectral graph convolution operation, we also propose a spectral graph Markov
network (SGMN). The proposed models are compared with baseline models and tested on three real-world
traffic state datasets with various missing rates. Experimental results show that the proposed
GMN and SGMN can achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
Besides, the proposed models' parameters, weights, and predicted results are comprehensively
analyzed and visualized.
