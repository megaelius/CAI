The development in the area of wireless communication, mobile and embedded computing leads to significant
changes in the application of devices. Over the last years, embedded devices were brought into the
consumer area creating the Internet of Things. Furthermore, industrial applications increasingly
rely on communication through trust boundaries. Networking is cheap and easily applicable while
providing the possibility to make everyday life more easy and comfortable and industry more efficient
and less time-consuming. One of the crucial parts of this interconnected world is sound and secure
authentication of entities. Only entities with valid authorisation should be enabled to act on
a resource according to an access control scheme. An overview of challenges and practices of authentication
is provided in this work, with a special focus on context information as part of security solutions.
It can be used for authentication and security solutions in industrial applications. Additional
information about events in networks can aid intrusion detection, especially in combination with
security information and event management systems. Finally, an authentication and access control
approach, based on context information and - depending on the scenario - multiple factors is presented.
The combination of multiple factors with context information makes it secure and at the same time
case adaptive, so that the effort always matches, but never exceeds, the security demand. This is
a common issue of standard cyber security, entities having to obey strict, inflexible and unhandy
policies. This approach has been implemented exemplary based on RADIUS. Different scenarios were
considered, showing that this approach is capable of providing flexible and scalable security
for authentication processes.
