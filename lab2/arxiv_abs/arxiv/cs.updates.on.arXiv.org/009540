Most aspects of our lives are governed by large, highly developed institutions that integrate several
governance tasks under one authority structure. But theorists differ as to the mechanisms that
drive the development of such concentrated governance systems from rudimentary beginnings. Is
the emergence of integrated governance schemes a symptom of consolidation of authority by small
status groups? Or does integration occur because a complex institution has more potential responses
to a complex environment? Here we examine the emergence of complex governance regimes in 5,000 sovereign,
resource-constrained, self-governing online communities, ranging in scale from one to thousands
of users. Each community begins with no community members and no governance infrastructure. As
communities grow, they are subject to selection pressures that keep better managed servers better
populated. We identify predictors of community success and test the hypothesis that governance
complexity can enhance community fitness. We find that what predicts success depends on size: changes
in complexity predict increased success with larger population servers. Specifically, governance
rules in a large successful community are more numerous and broader in scope. They also tend to rely
more on rules that concentrate power in administrators, and on rules that manage bad behavior and
limited server resources. Overall, this work is consistent with theories that formal integrated
governance systems emerge to organize collective responses to interdependent resource management
problems, especially as factors such as population size exacerbate those problems.
