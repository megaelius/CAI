Coarsely quantized MIMO signalling methods have gained popularity in the recent developments
of massive MIMO as they open up opportunities for massive MIMO implementation using cheap and power-efficient
radio-frequency front-ends. This paper presents a new one-bit MIMO precoding approach using spatial
Sigma-Delta ($\Sigma \Delta$) modulation. In previous one-bit MIMO precoding research, one mainly
focuses on using optimization to tackle the difficult binary signal optimization problem that
arises from the precoding design. Our approach attempts a different route. Assuming angular MIMO
channels, we apply $\Sigma \Delta$ modulation--a classical concept in analog-to-digital conversion
of temporal signals--in space. The resulting $\Sigma \Delta$ precoding approach has two main advantages:
First, we no longer need to deal with binary optimization in $\Sigma \Delta$ precoding design. Particularly,
the binary signal restriction is replaced by peak signal amplitude constraints. Second, the impact
of the quantization error can be well controlled via modulator design and under appropriate operating
conditions. Through symbol error probability analysis, we reveal that the very large number of
antennas in massive MIMO provides favorable operating conditions for $\Sigma \Delta$ precoding.
In addition, we develop a new $\Sigma \Delta$ modulation architecture that is capable of adapting
the channel to achieve nearly zero quantization error for a targeted user. Furthermore, we consider
multi-user $\Sigma \Delta$ precoding using the zero-forcing and symbol-level precoding schemes.
These two $\Sigma \Delta$ precoding schemes perform considerably better than their direct one-bit
quantized counterparts, as simulation results show.
