We introduce a new scheduling problem in distributed computing that we call the DSMS problem. We
are given a set of $k \geq 1$ mobile identical servers that are initially hosted by some processors
of the given network. Further, we are given a set of requests that are issued by the processors possibly
at any time in an online fashion, and the servers must serve them. A request must be scheduled before
the request is served. The delay for scheduling a request is the time taken since the request is issued
until it is scheduled. The goal is to minimize the average delay. Navigating mobile servers in a large-scale
distributed system needs a scalable location service. We devise the distributed GNN protocol,
a novel linked-reversal-based protocol for the DSMS problem that works on overlay trees. We prove
that GNN is a starvation-free protocol that correctly integrates locating the servers and synchronizing
the concurrent access to the servers despite asynchrony. Further, we analyze the GNN protocol for
one-shot executions where all requests are simultaneously issued. We show that when running the
GNN protocol on top of a special family of tree topologies---known as hierarchically well-separated
trees (HSTs)---we obtain a randomized distributed protocol with an expected competitive ratio
of $O(\log n)$ on general network topologies for the DSMS problem where $n$ is the number of processors
in the given network. From a technical point of view, the main result of our paper shows that the GNN
protocol optimally solves the DSMS problem on HSTs for one-shot executions. Our results hold even
if communication is asynchronous.
