This paper considers the problem of finite dimensional output feedback H-infinity control for
a class of nonlinear spatially distributed processes (SDPs) described by highly dissipative partial
differential equations (PDEs), whose state is observed by a sensor network (SN) with a given topology.
A highly dissipative PDE system typically involves a spatial differential operator with eigenspectrum
that can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional slow one and an infinite-dimensional stable
fast complement. Motivated by this fact, the modal decomposition and singular perturbation techniques
are initially applied to the PDE system to derive a finite dimensional ordinary differential equation
model, which accurately captures the dynamics of the slow modes of the PDE system. Subsequently,
based on the slow system and the topology of the SN, a set of finite dimensional distributed consensus
observers are constructed to estimate the state of the slow system. Then, a centralized control
scheme, which only uses the available estimates from a specified group of SN nodes, is proposed for
the PDE system. An H-infinity control design method is developed in terms of bilinear matrix inequality
(BMI), such that the original closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable and a prescribed level
of disturbance attenuation is satisfied for the slow system. Furthermore, a suboptimal H-infinity
controller is also provided to make the attenuation level as small as possible, which can be obtained
via a local optimization algorithm that treats the BMI as double linear matrix inequality. Finally,
the proposed method is applied to the control of one dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation
(KSE) system.
