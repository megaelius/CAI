At the heart of technology transitions lie complex processes of technology choices. Understanding
and planning sustainability transitions requires modelling work, which necessitates a theory
of technology substitution. A theoretical model of technological change and turnover is presented,
intended as a methodological paradigm shift from widely used conventional modelling approaches
such as cost optimisation. It follows the tradition of evolutionary economics and evolutionary
game theory, using ecological population growth dynamics to represent the evolution of technology
populations in the marketplace, with substitutions taking place at the level of the decision-maker.
Extended to use principles of human demography or the age structured evolution of species in interacting
ecosystems, this theory is built from first principles, and through an appropriate approximation,
reduces to a form identical to empirical models of technology diffusion common in the technology
transitions literature. Using an age structure, it provides the appropriate groundwork and theoretical
framework to understand interacting technologies, their birth, ageing and mutual substitution.
This analysis provides insight in explaining the nature and origin of observed timescales of technology
transitions, in terms of technology life expectancies, the dynamic process of production capacity
expansion or collapse and its timescales, in what is termed a `demographic phase'. While this model
contributes to the general understanding of technological change, the information in this work
is intended to be used practically for the parameterisation of technology diffusion in large scale
models of technology systems when measured data is unknown or uncertain, as is the case for new technologies,
notably for modelling future energy systems and greenhouse gas emissions.
