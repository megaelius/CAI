We present prior robust algorithms for a large class of resource allocation problems where requests
arrive one-by-one (online), drawn independently from an unknown distribution at every step. We
design a single algorithm that, for every possible underlying distribution, obtains a $1-\epsilon$
fraction of the profit obtained by an algorithm that knows the entire request sequence ahead of time.
The factor $\epsilon$ approaches $0$ when no single request consumes/contributes a significant
fraction of the global consumption/contribution by all requests together. We show that the tradeoff
we obtain here that determines how fast $\epsilon$ approaches $0$, is near optimal: we give a nearly
matching lower bound showing that the tradeoff cannot be improved much beyond what we obtain. Going
beyond the model of a static underlying distribution, we introduce the adversarial stochastic
input model, where an adversary, possibly in an adaptive manner, controls the distributions from
which the requests are drawn at each step. Placing no restriction on the adversary, we design an algorithm
that obtains a $1-\epsilon$ fraction of the optimal profit obtainable w.r.t. the worst distribution
in the adversarial sequence. In the offline setting we give a fast algorithm to solve very large LPs
with both packing and covering constraints. We give algorithms to approximately solve (within
a factor of $1+\epsilon$) the mixed packing-covering problem with $O(\frac{\gamma m \log (n/\delta)}{\epsilon^2})$
oracle calls where the constraint matrix of this LP has dimension $n\times m$, the success probability
of the algorithm is $1-\delta$, and $\gamma$ quantifies how significant a single request is when
compared to the sum total of all requests. We discuss implications of our results to several special
cases including online combinatorial auctions, network routing and the adwords problem.
