The sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) suffers from manually set initial regressor
values and ineffectiveness of the input features for some high dimensional applications. This
has significantly constrained its applications for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.
In order to address these problems, in this paper, we propose a fast and robust SMLR framework for
effective classification of HSI. First, the HSI dataset are represented by a new method. More precisely,
the weight and the bias are randomly generated for the HSI data, which project the HSI data to a new
feature space. And it has been shown that it is a good method for the data representation. Second,
the objective of our goal is minimize the training error and the regressor value, then the Lagrange
multiplier method and the dual principle are used to find a better initial regressor. Based on these
improvements, this paper proposes a new approach called extreme sparse multinomial logistic regression
(ESMLR) for performing the HSI classification. Furthermore, the extended multi-attribute profiles
(EMAPs) are used for extracting the spectral and spatial feature extraction in order to improve
the classification accuracy of the proposed ESMLR. Third, a combinational linear multiple features
learning (MFL) method is proposed to further improve the classification accuracy and maintain
the fast speed of the proposed framework. Finally, the logistic regression via the variable splitting
and the augmented Lagrangian (LORSAL) is adopted to the proposed framework for reducing the computational
time. Experiments are conducted in two well-known HSI datasets, namely the Indian Pines dataset
and the Pavia University dataset, which show the fast and robust performance of the proposed ESMLR
framework.
