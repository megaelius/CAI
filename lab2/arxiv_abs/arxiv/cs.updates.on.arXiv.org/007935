Influenza epidemics result in a public health and economic burden around the globe. Traditional
surveillance techniques, which rely on doctor visits, provide data with a delay of 1-2 weeks. A means
of obtaining real-time data and forecasting future outbreaks is desirable to provide more timely
responses to influenza epidemics. In this work, we present the first implementation of a novel data
set by demonstrating its ability to supplement traditional disease surveillance at multiple spatial
resolutions. We use Internet traffic data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
website to determine the potential usability of this data source. We test the traffic generated
by ten influenza-related pages in eight states and nine census divisions within the United States
and compare it against clinical surveillance data. Our results yield $r^2$ = 0.955 in the most successful
case, promising results for some cases, and unsuccessful results for other cases. These results
demonstrate that Internet data may be able to complement traditional influenza surveillance in
some cases but not in others. Specifically, our results show that the CDC website traffic may inform
national and division-level models but not models for each individual state. In addition, our results
show better agreement when the data were broken up by seasons instead of aggregated over several
years. In the interest of scientific transparency to further the understanding of when Internet
data streams are an appropriate supplemental data source, we also include negative results (i.e.,
unsuccessful models). We anticipate that this work will lead to more complex nowcasting and forecasting
models using this data stream.
