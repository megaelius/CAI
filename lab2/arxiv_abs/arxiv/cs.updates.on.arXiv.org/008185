Underlay device-to-device (D2D) multicast communication has potential to improve performance
of cellular networks. However, co-channel interference among cellular users (CUs) and D2D multicast
groups (MGs) limits the gains of such communication. Allowing the CUs to have exclusion zones around
them where no receiver of any MG can exist, is a realistic and pragmatic approach to reduce the co-channel
interference of cellular transmission on D2D multicast reception. We use a stochastic geometry
based approach to model this scenario. Specifically, we model the locations of CUs and D2D MG receivers
with homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP), and Poisson Hole Process (PHP), respectively. We
formulate the network sum throughput maximization problem in terms of a joint MG channel and power
allocation problem with constraints on cellular and MG users maximum transmit and acceptable quality
of service. We establish that the MG channel allocation problem has computational complexity that
is exponential in both, the number of MGs and the number of available cellular channels. Then, we
decompose this problem into two subproblems: subset selection problem and subset channel assignment
problem. Based on observations and insights obtained from numerical analysis of the optimal solution
of the subset selection problem in wide variety of scenarios, we propose a computationally efficient
scheme that achieves almost optimal performance for the subset selection problem. We further provide
a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves almost optimal performance for the subset
channel assignment problem. Finally, combining these two schemes, we provide a computationally
efficient and almost optimal scheme to solve the MG channel allocation problem, and various results
and insights on the variation of the optimal system performance with respect to different system
parameters.
