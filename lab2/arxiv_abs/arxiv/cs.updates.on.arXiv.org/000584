In this paper, we study the problem of lossless universal source coding for stationary memoryless
sources on countably infinite alphabets. This task is generally not achievable without restricting
the class of sources over which universality is desired. Building on our prior work, we propose natural
families of sources characterized by a common dominating envelope. We particularly emphasize
the notion of adaptivity, which is the ability to perform as well as an oracle knowing the envelope,
without actually knowing it. This is closely related to the notion of hierarchical universal source
coding, but with the important difference that families of envelope classes are not discretely
indexed and there is no well-ordered nesting. Our contribution is to extend the classes of envelopes
over which adaptive universal source coding is possible, namely by including max-stable (heavy-tailed)
envelopes which are excellent models in many applications, such as natural language modeling.
We derive a minimax lower bound on the redundancy of any code on such envelope classes, including
an oracle that knows the envelope. We then propose a constructive code that does not use knowledge
of the envelope. The code is computationally efficient and is structured to use an \underline{e}xpanding
\underline{t}hreshold for \underline{a}uto-\underline{c}ensoring, and we therefore dub it
the \textsc{ETAC}-code. We prove that the \textsc{ETAC}-code achieves the lower bound on the minimax
redundancy within a factor logarithmic in the sequence length, and can be therefore qualified as
a near-adaptive code over families of heavy-tailed envelopes. For finite and light-tailed envelopes
the penalty is even less, and the same code follows closely previous results that explicitly made
the light-tailed assumption. Our technical results are founded on methods from regular variation
theory and concentration of measure.
