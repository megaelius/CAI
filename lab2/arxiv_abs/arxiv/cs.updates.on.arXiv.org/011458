Many animals, modern aircraft, and underwater vehicles use streamlined body shapes that reduce
fluid dynamic drag to achieve fast and effective locomotion in air and water. Similarly, numerous
small terrestrial animals move through cluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles
like grass, shrubs, vines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body shape
plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial robots have used body shape to
effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we challenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid
cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded body to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like
compliant beams. Animals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4
+/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches primarily (48
+/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to rapidly traverse obstacle gaps
narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s traversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition
of artificial shells nearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired
by this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot with a nearly cuboidal
body, common to many existing terrestrial robots. Without adding sensory feedback or changing
the open-loop control, the rounded shell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps
narrower than shell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce terrain
resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body reorientation via distributed
mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the need to consider body shape to improve robot mobility
in real-world terrain often filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact
models to understand interaction with complex terrain.
