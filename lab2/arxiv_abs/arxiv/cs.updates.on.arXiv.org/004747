Research goals: determine the characteristics of the development process, installation, configuration
and usage of the filter SageMath for learning support system Moodle. Research objectives: to prove
the feasibility of using Moodle system as a tool to support the process of competency formation in
technical objects simulation of future bachelors in electromechanical engineering; to analyze
existing support tools of technical objects simulation and to identify the ways of it's integration
into Moodle; to describe the structure and features of the software implementation of the new SageMath
filter for Moodle; to provide the guidance on installing and configuring developed filter; to describe
the examples of filter usage. Research subject: text filter development process for learning support
system Moodle to processing the commands of computer mathematics system SageMath. Research results.
Designed SageMath filter allows to execute the Sage code on the external SageMathCell public server,
to view the execution results at the Moodle pages without reloading by using AJAX technology, to
stave off XSS attacks and ready for use with Moodle. The main conclusions and recommendations: 1.
The perspective direction of learning environment development for bachelors in electromechanical
engineering is the integration of learning support system Moodle and computer mathematics system
SageMath. 2. An effective tool for embedded a computer mathematics systems SageMath models into
Moodle is a text filter. The software engineering process for this filter is presented in the article.
3. Promising area of future research is the use of a developed filter in the process of bachelor's
in electromechanical engineering competencies in technical objects simulation by embedding
into Moodle learning courses the interactive labs programmed in Sage.
