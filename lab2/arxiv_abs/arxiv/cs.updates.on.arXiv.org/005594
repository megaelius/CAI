This paper explores the impact of simulator accuracy on architecture design decisions in the general-purpose
graphics processing unit (GPGPU) space. We perform a detailed, quantitative analysis of the most
popular publicly available GPU simulator, GPGPU-Sim, against our enhanced version of the simulator,
updated to model the memory system of modern GPUs in more detail. Our enhanced GPU model is able to
describe the NVIDIA Volta architecture in sufficient detail to reduce error in memory system even
counters by as much as 66X. The reduced error in the memory system further reduces execution time
error versus real hardware by 2.5X. To demonstrate the accuracy of our enhanced model against a real
machine, we perform a counter-by-counter validation against an NVIDIA TITAN V Volta GPU, demonstrating
the relative accuracy of the new simulator versus the publicly available model. We go on to demonstrate
that the simpler model discounts the importance of advanced memory system designs such as out-of-order
memory access scheduling, while overstating the impact of more heavily researched areas like L1
cache bypassing. Our results demonstrate that it is important for the academic community to enhance
the level of detail in architecture simulators as system complexity continues to grow. As part of
this detailed correlation and modeling effort, we developed a new Correlator toolset that includes
a consolidation of applications from a variety of popular GPGPU benchmark suites, designed to run
in reasonable simulation times. The Correlator also includes a database of hardware profiling
results for all these applications on NVIDIA cards ranging from Fermi to Volta and a toolchain that
enables users to gather correlation statistics and create detailed counter-by-counter hardware
correlation plots with minimal effort.
