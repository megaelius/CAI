Hrube\v{s} and Wigderson [HW14] initiated the study of noncommutative arithmetic circuits with
division computing a noncommutative rational function in the free skew field, and raised the question
of rational identity testing. It is now known that the problem can be solved in deterministic polynomial
time in the white-box model for noncommutative formulas with inverses, and in randomized polynomial
time in the black-box model [GGOW16, IQS18, DM18], where the running time is polynomial in the size
of the formula. The complexity of identity testing of noncommutative rational functions remains
open in general (when the formula size is not polynomially bounded). We solve the problem for a natural
special case. We consider polynomial expressions in the free group algebra $\mathbb{F}\langle
X, X^{-1}\rangle$ where $X=\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$, a subclass of rational expressions of inversion
height one. Our main results are the following. 1. Given a degree $d$ expression $f$ in $\mathbb{F}\langle
X, X^{-1}\rangle$ as a black-box, we obtain a randomized $\text{poly}(n,d)$ algorithm to check
whether $f$ is an identically zero expression or not. We obtain this by generalizing the Amitsur-Levitzki
theorem [AL50] to $\mathbb{F}\langle X, X^{-1}\rangle$. This also yields a deterministic identity
testing algorithm (and even an expression reconstruction algorithm) that is polynomial time in
the sparsity of the input expression. 2. Given an expression $f$ in $\mathbb{F}\langle X, X^{-1}\rangle$
of degree at most $D$, and sparsity $s$, as black-box, we can check whether $f$ is identically zero
or not in randomized $\text{poly}(n,\log s, \log D)$ time.
