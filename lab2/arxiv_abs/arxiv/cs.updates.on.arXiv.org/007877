Variational Bayes (VB) methods have emerged as a fast and computationally-efficient alternative
to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian estimation of mixed multinomial logit (MMNL)
models. It has been established that VB is substantially faster than MCMC at practically no compromises
in predictive accuracy. In this paper, we address two critical gaps concerning the usage and understanding
of VB for MMNL. First, extant VB methods are limited to utility specifications involving only individual-specific
taste parameters. Second, the finite-sample properties of VB estimators and the relative performance
of VB, MCMC and maximum simulated likelihood estimation (MSLE) are not known. To address the former,
this study extends several VB methods for MMNL to admit utility specifications including both fixed
and random utility parameters. To address the latter, we conduct an extensive simulation-based
evaluation to benchmark the extended VB methods against MCMC and MSLE in terms of estimation times,
parameter recovery and predictive accuracy. The results suggest that all VB variants perform as
well as MCMC and MSLE at prediction and recovery of all model parameters with the exception of the
covariance matrix of the multivariate normal mixing distribution. In particular, VB with nonconjugate
variational message passing and the delta-method (VB-NCVMP-Delta) is relatively accurate and
up to 15 times faster than MCMC and MSLE. On the whole, VB-NCVMP-Delta is most suitable for applications
in which fast predictions are paramount, while MCMC should be preferred in applications in which
accurate inferences are most important.
