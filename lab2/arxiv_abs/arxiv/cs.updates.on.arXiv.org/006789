Inspired by Nature, molecular communications (MC), i.e., use of molecules to encode, transmit
and receive information, stands as the most promising communication paradigm to realize nanonetworks.
Even though there has been extensive theoretical research towards nanoscale MC, there are no examples
of implemented nanoscale MC networks. The main reason for this lies in the peculiarities of nanoscale
physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication and highly stochastic nature of biochemical domain
of envisioned nanonetwork applications. This mandates developing novel device architectures
and communication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various transmitter and
receiver designs for MC have been proposed in literature together with numerable modulation, coding
and detection techniques. However, these works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines,
including but not limited to information and communication theory, quantum physics, materials
science, nanofabrication, physiology and synthetic biology. Therefore, we believe it is imperative
for the progress of the field that, an organized exposition of cumulative knowledge on subject matter
be compiled. Thus, to fill this gap, in this comprehensive survey we review the existing literature
on transmitter and receiver architectures towards realizing MC amongst nanomaterial-based nanomachines
and/or biological entities, and provide a complete overview of modulation, coding and detection
techniques employed for MC. Moreover, we identify the most significant shortcomings and challenges
in all these research areas, and propose potential solutions to overcome some of them.
