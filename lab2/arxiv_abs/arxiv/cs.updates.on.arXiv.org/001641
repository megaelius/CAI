This paper considers a discrete-time opinion dynamics model in which each individual's susceptibility
to being influenced by others is dependent on her current opinion. We assume that the social network
has time-varying topology and that the opinions are scalars on a continuous interval. We first propose
a general opinion dynamics model based on the DeGroot model, with a general function to describe
the functional dependence of each individual's susceptibility on her own opinion, and show that
this general model is analogous to the Friedkin-Johnsen model, which assumes a constant susceptibility
for each individual. We then consider two specific functions in which the individual's susceptibility
depends on the \emph{polarity} of her opinion, and provide motivating social examples. First,
we consider stubborn positives, who have reduced susceptibility if their opinions are at one end
of the interval and increased susceptibility if their opinions are at the opposite end. A court jury
is used as a motivating example. Second, we consider stubborn neutrals, who have reduced susceptibility
when their opinions are in the middle of the spectrum, and our motivating examples are social networks
discussing established social norms or institutionalized behavior. For each specific susceptibility
model, we establish the initial and graph topology conditions in which consensus is reached, and
develop necessary and sufficient conditions on the initial conditions for the final consensus
value to be at either extreme of the opinion interval. Simulations are provided to show the effects
of the susceptibility function when compared to the DeGroot model.
