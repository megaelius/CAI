Element-based textures are a kind of texture formed by nameable elements, the texels [1], distributed
according to specific statistical distributions; it is of primary importance in many sectors,
namely textile, fashion and interior design industry. State-of-theart texture descriptors fail
to properly characterize element-based texture, so we present Texel-Att to fill this gap. Texel-Att
is the first fine-grained, attribute-based representation and classification framework for
element-based textures. It first individuates texels, characterizing them with individual attributes;
subsequently, texels are grouped and characterized through layout attributes, which give the
Texel-Att representation. Texels are detected by a Mask-RCNN, trained on a brand-new element-based
texture dataset, ElBa, containing 30K texture images with 3M fully-annotated texels. Examples
of individual and layout attributes are exhibited to give a glimpse on the level of achievable graininess.
In the experiments, we present detection results to show that texels can be precisely individuated,
even on textures "in the wild"; to this sake, we individuate the element-based classes of the Describable
Texture Dataset (DTD), where almost 900K texels have been manually annotated, leading to the Element-based
DTD (E-DTD). Subsequently, classification and ranking results demonstrate the expressivity
of Texel-Att on ElBa and E-DTD, overcoming the alternative features and relative attributes, doubling
the best performance in some cases; finally, we report interactive search results on ElBa and E-DTD:
with Texel-Att on the E-DTD dataset we are able to individuate within 10 iterations the desired texture
in the 90% of cases, against the 71% obtained with a combination of the finest existing attributes
so far. Dataset and code is available at https://github.com/godimarcovr/Texel-Att
