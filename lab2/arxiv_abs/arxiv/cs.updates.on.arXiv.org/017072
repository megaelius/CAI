With the rise of third parties in the machine learning pipeline, the service provider in "Machine
Learning as a Service'' (MLaaS), or external data contributors in online learning, or the retraining
of existing models, the need to ensure the security of the resulting machine learning models has
become an increasingly important topic. The security community has demonstrated that without
transparency of the data and the resulting model, there exist many potential security risks, with
new risks constantly being discovered. In this paper, we focus on one of these security risks -- poisoning
attacks. Specifically, we analyze how attackers may interfere with the results of regression learning
by poisoning the training datasets. To this end, we analyze and develop a new poisoning attack algorithm.
Our attack, termed Nopt, in contrast with previous poisoning attack algorithms, can produce larger
errors with the same proportion of poisoning data-points. Furthermore, we also significantly
improve the state-of-the-art defense algorithm, termed TRIM, proposed by Jagielsk et al. (IEEE
S&P 2018), by incorporating the concept of probability estimation of unpolluted data-points into
the algorithm. Our new defense algorithm, termed Proda, demonstrates an increased effectiveness
in reducing errors arising from the poisoning dataset. We highlight that the time complexity of
TRIM had not been estimated; however, we deduce from their work that TRIM can take exponential time
complexity in the worst-case scenario, in excess of Proda's logarithmic time. The performance
of both our proposed attack and defense algorithms is extensively evaluated on four real-world
datasets of housing prices, loans, health care, and bike sharing services. We hope that our work
will inspire future research to develop more robust learning algorithms immune to poisoning attacks.
