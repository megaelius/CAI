The characterization of various properties of real-world systems requires the knowledge of the
underlying network of connections among the system's components. Unfortunately, in many situations
the complete topology of this network is empirically inaccessible, and one has to resort to probabilistic
techniques to infer it from limited information. While network reconstruction methods have reached
some degree of maturity in the case of single-layer networks (where nodes can be connected only by
one type of links), the problem is practically unexplored in the case of multiplex networks, where
several interdependent layers, each with a different type of links, coexist. Even the most advanced
network reconstruction techniques, if applied to each layer separately, fail in replicating the
observed inter-layer dependencies making up the whole coupled multiplex. Here we develop a methodology
to reconstruct a class of correlated multiplexes which includes the World Trade Multiplex as a specific
example we study in detail. Our method starts from any reconstruction model that successfully reproduces
some desired marginal properties, including node strengths and/or node degrees, of each layer
separately. It then introduces the minimal dependency structure required to replicate an additional
set of higher-order properties that quantify the portion of each node's degree and each node's strength
that is shared and/or reciprocated across pairs of layers. These properties are found to provide
empirically robust measures of inter-layer coupling. Our method allows joint multi-layer connection
probabilities to be reliably reconstructed from marginal ones, effectively bridging the gap between
single-layer properties and truly multiplex information.
