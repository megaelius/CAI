Over the past decade, mobile phones have become prevalent in all parts of the world, across all demographic
backgrounds. Mobile phones are used by men and women across a wide age range in both developed and
developing countries. Consequently, they have become one of the most important mechanisms for
social interaction within a population, making them an increasingly important source of information
to understand human demographics and human behaviour. In this work we combine two sources of information:
communication logs from a major mobile operator in a Latin American country, and information on
the demographics of a subset of the users population. This allows us to perform an observational
study of mobile phone usage, differentiated by age groups categories. This study is interesting
in its own right, since it provides knowledge on the structure and demographics of the mobile phone
market in the studied country. We then tackle the problem of inferring the age group for all users
in the network. We present here an exclusively graph-based inference method relying solely on the
topological structure of the mobile network, together with a topological analysis of the performance
of the algorithm. The equations for our algorithm can be described as a diffusion process with two
added properties: (i) memory of its initial state, and (ii) the information is propagated as a probability
vector for each node attribute (instead of the value of the attribute itself). Our algorithm can
successfully infer different age groups within the network population given known values for a
subset of nodes (seed nodes). Most interestingly, we show that by carefully analysing the topological
relationships between correctly predicted nodes and the seed nodes, we can characterize particular
subsets of nodes for which our inference method has significantly higher accuracy.
