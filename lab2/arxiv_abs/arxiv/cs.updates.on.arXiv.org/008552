There are different problems for resolution of complex LC-MS or GC-MS data, such as the existence
of embedded chromatographic peaks, continuum background and overlapping in mass channels for
different components. These problems cause rotational ambiguity in recovered profiles calculated
using multivariate curve resolution (MCR) methods. Since mass spectra are sparse in nature, sparsity
has been proposed recently as a constraint in MCR methods for analyzing LC-MS data. There are different
ways for implementation of the sparsity constraint, and majority of methods rely on imposing a penalty
based on the L0-, L1- and L2-norms of recovered mass spectra. Ridge regression and least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) can be used for implementation of L2- and L1-norm penalties
in MCR, respectively. The main question is which Lx-norm penalty is more worthwhile for implementation
of the sparsity constraint in MCR methods. In order to address this question, two and three component
LC-MS data were simulated and used for the case study in this work. The areas of feasible solutions
(AFS) were calculated using the grid search strategy. Calculating Lx-norms values in AFS for x between
zero and two revealed that the gradient of optimization surface increased from x values equal to
two to x values near zero. However, for x equal to zero, the optimization surface was similar to a plateau,
which increased the risk of sticking in local minima. Generally, results in this work, recommend
the use of L1-norm penalty methods like Lasso for implementation of sparsity constraint in MCR-ALS
algorithm for finding more sparse solutions and reducing the extent of rotational ambiguity.
