Most integers are composite and most univariate polynomials over a finite field are reducible.
The Prime Number Theorem and a classical result of Gau{\ss} count the remaining ones, approximately
and exactly. For polynomials in two or more variables, the situation changes dramatically. Most
multivariate polynomials are irreducible. This survey presents counting results for some special
classes of multivariate polynomials over a finite field, namely the the reducible ones, the s-powerful
ones (divisible by the s-th power of a nonconstant polynomial), the relatively irreducible ones
(irreducible but reducible over an extension field), the decomposable ones, and also for reducible
space curves. These come as exact formulas and as approximations with relative errors that essentially
decrease exponentially in the input size. Furthermore, a univariate polynomial f is decomposable
if f = g o h for some nonlinear polynomials g and h. It is intuitively clear that the decomposable polynomials
form a small minority among all polynomials. The tame case, where the characteristic p of Fq does
not divide n = deg f, is fairly well-understood, and we obtain closely matching upper and lower bounds
on the number of decomposable polynomials. In the wild case, where p does divide n, the bounds are
less satisfactory, in particular when p is the smallest prime divisor of n and divides n exactly twice.
The crux of the matter is to count the number of collisions, where essentially different (g, h) yield
the same f. We present a classification of all collisions at degree n = p^2 which yields an exact count
of those decomposable polynomials.
