Layout-Aware Data Scheduler (LADS) data transfer tool, identifies and addresses the issues that
lead to congestion on the path of an end-to-end data transfer in the terabit network environments.
It exploits the underlying storage layout at each endpoint to maximize throughput without negatively
impacting the performance of shared storage resources for other users. LADS can avoid congested
storage elements within the shared storage resource, improving input/output bandwidth, and hence
the data transfer rates across the high speed networks. However, absence of FT (fault tolerance)
support in LADS results in data re-transmission overhead along with the possible integrity issues
upon errors. In this paper, we propose object based logging methods to avoid transmitting the objects
which are successfully written to Parallel File System (PFS) at the sink end. Depending on the number
of logger files created, for the whole dataset, we classified our fault tolerance mechanisms into
three different categories: File logger, Transaction logger and Universal logger. Also, to address
space overhead of these object based logging mechanisms, we have proposed different methods of
populating logger files with the information of the completed objects. We have evaluated the data
transfer performance and recovery time overhead of the proposed object based logging fault tolerant
mechanisms on LADS data transfer tool. Our experimental results show that, LADS in conjunction
with proposed object based fault tolerance mechanisms exhibit an overhead of less than 1% with respect
to data transfer time and total recovery time overhead is around 10% of total data transfer time at
any fault point.
