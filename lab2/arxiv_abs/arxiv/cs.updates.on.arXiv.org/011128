The theory of limits of discrete combinatorial objects has been thriving for the last decade or so.
The syntactic, algebraic approach to the subject is popularly known as "flag algebras", while the
semantic, geometric one is often associated with the name ``graph limits''. The language of graph
limits is generally more intuitive and expressible, but a price that one has to pay for it is that it
is better suited for the case of ordinary graphs than for more general combinatorial objects. Accordingly,
there have been several attempts in the literature, of varying degree of generality, to define limit
objects for more complicated combinatorial structures. This paper is another attempt at a workable
general theory of dense limit objects. Unlike previous efforts in this direction (with notable
exception of [Ashwini Aroskar and James Cummings. Limits, regularity and removal for finite structures.
Technical Report arXiv:1412.2014 [math.LO], arXiv e-print, 2014.]), we base our account on the
same concepts from the first-order logic and the model theory as in the theory of flag algebras. We
show how our definition naturally encompasses a host of previously considered cases (graphons,
hypergraphons, digraphons, permutons, posetons, colored graphs, etc.), and we extend the fundamental
properties of existence and uniqueness to this more general case. We also give an intuitive general
proof of the continuous version of the Induced Removal Lemma based on the completeness theorem for
propositional calculus. We capitalize on the notion of an open interpretation that often allows
to transfer methods and results from one situation to another. Again, we show that some previous
arguments can be quite naturally framed using this language.
