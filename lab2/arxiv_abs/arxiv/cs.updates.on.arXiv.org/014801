For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-IS-Deletion problem asks, given a graph $G$, for the minimum size of
a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that $G\setminus S$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. Motivated
by previous work about hitting (topological) minors and subgraphs on bounded treewidth graphs,
we are interested in determining, for a fixed graph $H$, the smallest function $f_H(t)$ such that
$H$-IS-Deletion can be solved in time $f_H(t) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis
(ETH), where $t$ and $n$ denote the treewidth and the number of vertices of the input graph, respectively.
We show that $f_H(t) = 2^{O(t^{h-2})}$ for every graph $H$ on $h \geq 3$ vertices, and that $f_H(t)
= 2^{O(t)}$ if $H$ is a clique or an independent set. We present a number of lower bounds by generalizing
a reduction of Cygan et al. [MFCS 2014] for the subgraph version. In particular, we show that when
$H$ deviates slightly from a clique, the function $f_H(t)$ suffers a sharp jump: if $H$ is obtained
from a clique of size $h$ by removing one edge, then $f_H(t) = 2^{\Theta(t^{h-2})}$. We also show
that $f_H(t) = 2^{\Omega(t^{h})}$ when $H=K_{h,h}$, and this reduction answers an open question
of Mi. Pilipczuk [MFCS 2011] about the function $f_{C_4}(t)$ for the subgraph version. Motivated
by Cygan et al. [MFCS 2014], we also consider the colorful variant of the problem, where each vertex
of $G$ is colored with some color from $V(H)$ and we require to hit only induced copies of $H$ with matching
colors. In this case, we determine, under the ETH, the function $f_H(t)$ for every connected graph
$H$ on $h$ vertices: if $h\leq 2$ the problem can be solved in polynomial time; if $h\geq 3$, $f_H(t)
= 2^{\Theta(t)}$ if $H$ is a clique, and $f_H(t) = 2^{\Theta(t^{h-2})}$ otherwise.
