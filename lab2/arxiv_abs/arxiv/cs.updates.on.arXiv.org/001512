We provide algorithms that learn simple auctions whose revenue is approximately optimal in multi-item
multi-bidder settings, for a wide range of valuations including unit-demand, additive, constrained
additive, XOS, and subadditive. We obtain our learning results in two settings. The first is the
commonly studied setting where sample access to the bidders' distributions over valuations is
given, for both regular distributions and arbitrary distributions with bounded support. Our algorithms
require polynomially many samples in the number of items and bidders. The second is a more general
max-min learning setting that we introduce, where we are given "approximate distributions," and
we seek to compute an auction whose revenue is approximately optimal simultaneously for all "true
distributions" that are close to the given ones. These results are more general in that they imply
the sample-based results, and are also applicable in settings where we have no sample access to the
underlying distributions but have estimated them indirectly via market research or by observation
of previously run, potentially non-truthful auctions. Our results hold for valuation distributions
satisfying the standard (and necessary) independence-across-items property. They also generalize
and improve upon recent works, which have provided algorithms that learn approximately optimal
auctions in more restricted settings with additive, subadditive and unit-demand valuations using
sample access to distributions. We generalize these results to the complete unit-demand, additive,
and XOS setting, to i.i.d. subadditive bidders, and to the max-min setting. Our results are enabled
by new uniform convergence bounds for hypotheses classes under product measures. Our bounds result
in exponential savings in sample complexity compared to bounds derived by bounding the VC dimension,
and are of independent interest.
