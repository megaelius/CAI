We propose a compositional approach for constructing abstractions of general Markov decision
processes using approximate probabilistic relations. The abstraction framework is based on the
notion of $\delta$-lifted relations, using which one can quantify the distance in probability
between the interconnected gMDPs and that of their abstractions. This new approximate relation
unifies compositionality results in the literature by incorporating the dependencies between
state transitions explicitly and by allowing abstract models to have either finite or infinite
state spaces. Accordingly, one can leverage the proposed results to perform analysis and synthesis
over abstract models, and then carry the results over concrete ones. To this end, we first propose
our compositionality results using the new approximate probabilistic relation which is based
on lifting. We then focus on a class of stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems and construct their
abstractions using both model order reduction and space discretization in a unified framework.
We provide conditions for simultaneous existence of relations incorporating the structure of
the network. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results by considering
a network of four nonlinear dynamical subsystems (together 12 dimensions) and constructing finite
abstractions from their reduced-order versions (together 4 dimensions) in a unified compositional
framework. We benchmark our results against the compositional abstraction techniques that construct
both infinite abstractions (reduced-order models) and finite MDPs in two consecutive steps. We
show that our approach is much less conservative than the ones available in the literature.
