The infamous exploration-exploitation dilemma is one of the oldest and most important problems
in reinforcement learning (RL). Deliberate and effective exploration is necessary for RL agents
to succeed in most environments. However, until very recently even very sophisticated RL algorithms
employed simple, undirected exploration strategies in large-scale RL tasks. We introduce a new
optimistic count-based exploration algorithm for RL that is feasible in high-dimensional MDPs.
The success of RL algorithms in these domains depends crucially on generalization from limited
training experience. Function approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalize in order
to estimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods have achieved generalization
about the agent's uncertainty regarding unvisited states. We present a new method for computing
a generalized state visit-count, which allows the agent to estimate the uncertainty associated
with any state. In contrast to existing exploration techniques, our $\phi$-$\textit{pseudocount}$
achieves generalization by exploiting the feature representation of the state space that is used
for value function approximation. States that have less frequently observed features are deemed
more uncertain. The resulting $\phi$-$\textit{Exploration-Bonus}$ algorithm rewards the agent
for exploring in feature space rather than in the original state space. This method is simpler and
less computationally expensive than some previous proposals, and achieves near state-of-the-art
results on high-dimensional RL benchmarks. In particular, we report world-class results on several
notoriously difficult Atari 2600 video games, including Montezuma's Revenge.
