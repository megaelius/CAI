Homeostasis is a running theme in biology. Often achieved through feedback regulation strategies,
homeostasis allows living cells to control their internal environment as a means for surviving
changing and unfavourable environments. While many endogenous homeostatic motifs have been studied
in living cells, synthetic homeostatic circuits have received far less attention. The tight regulation
of the abundance of cellular products and intermediates in the noisy environment of the cell is now
recognised as a critical requirement for several biotechnology and therapeutic applications.
Here we lay the foundation for a regulation theory at the molecular level that explicitly takes into
account the noisy nature of biochemical reactions and provides novel tools for the analysis and
design of robust synthetic homeostatic circuits. Using these ideas, we propose a new regulation
motif that implements an integral feedback strategy which can generically and effectively regulate
a wide class of reaction networks. By combining tools from probability and control theory, we show
that the proposed control motif preserves the stability of the overall network, steers the population
of any regulated species to a desired set point, and achieves robust perfect adaptation -- all without
any prior knowledge of reaction rates. Moreover, our proposed control motif can be implemented
using a very small number of molecules and hence has a negligible metabolic load. Strikingly, the
regulatory motif exploits stochastic noise, leading to enhanced regulation in scenarios where
noise-free implementations result in dysregulation. Several examples demonstrate the potential
of the approach.
