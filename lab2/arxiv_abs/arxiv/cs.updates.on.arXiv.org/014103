Event extraction (EE) is one of the core information extraction tasks, whose purpose is to automatically
identify and extract information about incidents and their actors from texts. This may be beneficial
to several domains such as knowledge bases, question answering, information retrieval and summarization
tasks, to name a few. The problem of extracting event information from texts is longstanding and
usually relies on elaborately designed lexical and syntactic features, which, however, take a
large amount of human effort and lack generalization. More recently, deep neural network approaches
have been adopted as a means to learn underlying features automatically. However, existing networks
do not make full use of syntactic features, which play a fundamental role in capturing very long-range
dependencies. Also, most approaches extract each argument of an event separately without considering
associations between arguments which ultimately leads to low efficiency, especially in sentences
with multiple events. To address the two above-referred problems, we propose a novel joint event
extraction framework that aims to extract multiple event triggers and arguments simultaneously
by introducing shortest dependency path (SDP) in the dependency graph. We do this by eliminating
irrelevant words in the sentence, thus capturing long-range dependencies. Also, an attention-based
graph convolutional network is proposed, to carry syntactically related information along the
shortest paths between argument candidates that captures and aggregates the latent associations
between arguments; a problem that has been overlooked by most of the literature. Our results show
a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
