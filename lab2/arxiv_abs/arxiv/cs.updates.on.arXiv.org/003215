Modern deep learning enabled artificial neural networks, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN) and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have achieved a series of breaking records on a broad spectrum
of recognition applications. However, the enormous computation and storage requirements associated
with such deep and complex neural network models greatly challenge their implementations on resource-limited
platforms. Time-based spiking neural network has recently emerged as a promising solution in Neuromorphic
Computing System designs for achieving remarkable computing and power efficiency within a single
chip. However, the relevant research activities have been narrowly concentrated on the biological
plausibility and theoretical learning approaches, causing inefficient neural processing and
impracticable multilayer extension thus significantly limitations on speed and accuracy when
handling the realistic cognitive tasks. In this work, a practical multilayer time-based spiking
neuromorphic architecture, namely "MT-Spike", is developed to fill this gap. With the proposed
practical time-coding scheme, average delay response model, temporal error backpropagation
algorithm, and heuristic loss function, "MT-Spike" achieves more efficient neural processing
through flexible neural model size reduction while offering very competitive classification
accuracy for realistic recognition tasks. Simulation results well validated that the algorithmic
power of deep multi-layer learning can be seamlessly merged with the efficiency of time-based spiking
neuromorphic architecture, demonstrating great potentials of "MT-Spike" in resource and power
constrained embedded platforms.
