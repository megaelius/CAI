New larger and more diverse wireless markets have emerged. Modelling them can be challenging due
to various business and network aspects. Existing models of wireless markets are either microscopic,
focusing on a specific technical aspect (e.g., network topology) at a fine scale or macroscopic
modelling wireless markets at a large-scale, e.g., considering homogeneous populations. In contrast
to these approaches, this work develops a multi-layer game-theoretical framework, which allows
providers to model users at multiple-level of detail by considering a different number of user sub-populations.
It also models the mobility, traffic demand, and networks of providers. A population game using
Logit dynamics models the user selection of the dataplan and provider, capturing the diversity
in customer profile and relaxing the assumption about the user rationality. It analytically computes
the equilibriums of users and providers and numerically evaluates the performance of the market
as a function of the traffic demand, the number of available dataplans, and the knowledge about customer
population. Significant benefits in revenue can be achieved by a provider when it integrates more
detailed information about the user population. The number of disconnected users also decreases.
Moreover the availability of several dataplans further enhances the gains. The stronger the provider,
the more prominent the benefits. However the benefits diminish when all the providers model the
customer population at the same degree of detail due to an increased competition. The analysis highlights
the strategies of the providers depending on their capacity, level of knowledge about the customer
population, and traffic conditions. It illustrates how a provider changes its strategy under different
conditions, focusing potentially on different customer segments and also the pressure introduced
by specific customer types.
