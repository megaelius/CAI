This study presents an efficient incremental/decremental approach for big streams based on Kernel
Ridge Regression (KRR), a frequently used data analysis in cloud centers. To avoid reanalyzing
the whole dataset whenever sensors receive new training data, typical incremental KRR used a single-instance
mechanism for updating an existing system. However, this inevitably increased redundant computational
time, not to mention applicability to big streams. To this end, the proposed mechanism supports
incremental/decremental processing for both single and multiple samples (i.e., batch processing).
A large scale of data can be divided into batches, processed by a machine, without sacrificing the
accuracy. Moreover, incremental/decremental analyses in empirical and intrinsic space are also
proposed in this study to handle different types of data either with a large number of samples or high
feature dimensions, whereas typical methods focused only on one type. At the end of this study, we
further the proposed mechanism to statistical Kernelized Bayesian Regression, so that uncertainty
modeling with incremental/decremental computation becomes applicable. Experimental results
showed that computational time was significantly reduced, better than the original nonincremental
design and the typical single incremental method. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed method
remained the same as the baselines. This implied that the system enhanced efficiency without sacrificing
the accuracy. These findings proved that the proposed method was appropriate for variable streaming
data analysis, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
