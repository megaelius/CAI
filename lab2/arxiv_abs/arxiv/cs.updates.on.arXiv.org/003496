Most existing non-blind restoration methods are based on the assumption that a precise degradation
model is known. As the degradation process can only partially known or inaccurately modeled, images
may not be well restored. Rain streak removal and image deconvolution with inaccurate blur kernels
are two representative examples of such tasks. For rain streak removal, although an input image
can be decomposed into a scene layer and a rain streak layer, there exists no explicit formulation
for modeling rain streaks and the composition with scene layer. For blind deconvolution, as estimation
error of blur kernel is usually introduced, the subsequent non-blind deconvolution process does
not restore the latent image well. In this paper, we propose a principled algorithm within the maximum
a posterior framework to tackle image restoration with a partially known or inaccurate degradation
model. Specifically, the residual caused by a partially known or inaccurate degradation model
is spatially dependent and complexly distributed. With a training set of degraded and ground-truth
image pairs, we parameterize and learn the fidelity term for a degradation model in a task-driven
manner. Furthermore, the regularization term can also be learned along with the fidelity term,
thereby forming a simultaneous fidelity and regularization learning model. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for image deconvolution with inaccurate
blur kernels and rain streak removal. Furthermore, for image restoration with precise degradation
process, e.g., Gaussian denoising, the proposed model can be applied to learn the proper fidelity
term for optimal performance based on visual perception metrics.
