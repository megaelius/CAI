Purpose: To evaluate diagnostic utility of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for severity
staging anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. Materials and Methods: This retrospective
analysis was conducted on 1243 knee MR images (1008 intact, 18 partially torn, 77 fully torn, 140
reconstructed ACLs) from 224 subjects collected between 2011 and 2014 (age=46.50+\-13.55 years,
body mass index=24.58+\-3.60 kg/m2, 46% women (mean+\-standard deviation). Images were acquired
with a 3.0T MR scanner using 3D fast spin echo CUBE-sequences. The radiologists used a modified scoring
metric analagous to the ACLOAS and WORMS for grading standard. To classify ACL injuries with deep
learning, two types of CNNs were used, one with three-dimensional (3D) and the other with two-dimensional
(2D) convolutional kernels. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, weighted
Cohen's kappa, and overall accuracy, followed by two-sample t-tests to compare CNN performance.
Results: The overall accuracy (84%) and weighted Cohen's kappa (.92) reported for ACL injury classification
were higher using the 2D CNN than the 3D CNN. The 2D CNN and 3D CNN performed similarly in assessing
intact ACLs (2D CNN: 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity, 3D CNN: 89% sensitivity and 88% specificity).
Classification of full tears by both networks were also comparable (2D CNN: 83% sensitivity and
94% specificity, 3D CNN: 77% sensitivity and 100% sensitivity). The 2D CNN classified all reconstructed
ACLs correctly. Conclusion: CNNs applied to ACL lesion classification results in high sensitivity
and specificity, leading to potential use in helping grade ACL injuries by non-experts.
