A binary matrix $M$ has the consecutive ones property ($C1P$) for rows (resp. columns) if there is
a permutation of its columns (resp. rows) that arranges the ones consecutively in all the rows (resp.
columns). If $M$ has the $C1P$ for rows and the $C1P$ for columns, then $M$ is said to have the simultaneous
consecutive ones property ($SC1P$). We focus on the classical complexity and fixed parameter tractability
of Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Submatrix ($SC1S$) and Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Editing
($SC1E$) problems here. $SC1S$ problems focus on deleting a minimum number of rows, columns and
rows as well as columns to establish the $SC1P$ whereas $SC1E$ problems deal with flipping a minimum
number of $1$-entries, $0$-entries and $0$-entries as well as $1$-entries to obtain the $SC1P$.
We show that the decision versions of the $SC1S$ and $SC1E$ problems are NP-complete. We consider
the parameterized versions of the $SC1S$ and $SC1E$ problems with $d$, being the solution size,
as the parameter and are defined as follows. Given a binary matrix $M$ and a positive integer $d$,
$d$-$SC1S$-$R$ ($d$-$SC1S$-$C$) problem decides whether there exists a set of rows (columns)
of size at most $d$ whose deletion results in a matrix with the $SC1P$. The $d$-$SC1S$-$RC$ problem
decides whether there exists a set of rows as well as columns of size at most $d$ whose deletion results
in a matrix with the $SC1P$. The $d$-$SC1P$-$0E$ ($d$-$SC1P$-$1E$) problem decides whether there
exists a set of $0$-entries ($1$-entries) of size at most $d$ whose flipping results in a matrix with
the $SC1P$. The $d$-$SC1P$-$01E$ problem decides whether there exists a set of $0$-entries as well
as $1$-entries of size at most $d$ whose flipping results in a matrix with the $SC1P$.
