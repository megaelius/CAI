The SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) pandemic has caused significant strain on public health institutions
around the world. Contact tracing is an essential tool to change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Manual contact tracing of Covid-19 cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public
health authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact tracing
through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm. Some countries have deployed
centralized tracking systems, but more privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much
of the same benefit without concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit corporations.
Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations of standard digital tracing by
incorporating many clues and their uncertainty into a more graded and precise estimation of infection
risk. The estimated risk can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant
information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform epidemiological models
trained jointly with the machine learning predictor. These models can provide statistical evidence
for the importance of factors involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor,
evaluate and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical and economic
productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile apps and machine learning should
proactively mitigate potential ethical and privacy risks, which could have substantial impacts
on society (not only impacts on health but also impacts such as stigmatization and abuse of personal
data). Here, we present an overview of the rationale, design, ethical considerations and privacy
strategy of `COVI,' a Covid-19 public peer-to-peer contact tracing and risk awareness mobile application
developed in Canada.
