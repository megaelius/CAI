The main goal of our research is to develop an effective method with a wide range of applications for
the statistical reconstruction of heterogeneous microstructures with compact inclusions of
any shape, such as highly irregular grains. The devised approach uses multi-scale extended entropic
descriptors (ED) that quantify the degree of spatial non-uniformity of configurations of finite-sized
objects. This technique is an innovative development of previously elaborated entropy methods
for statistical reconstruction. Here, we discuss the two-dimensional case, but this method can
be generalized into three dimensions. At the first stage, the developed procedure creates a set
of black synthetic clusters that serve as surrogate inclusions. The clusters have the same individual
areas and interfaces as their target counterparts, but random shapes. Then, from a given number
of easy-to-generate synthetic cluster configurations, we choose the one with the lowest value
of the cost function defined by us using extended ED. At the second stage, we make a significant change
in the standard technique of simulated annealing (SA). Instead of swapping pixels of different
phases, we randomly move each of the selected synthetic clusters. To demonstrate the accuracy of
the method, we reconstruct and analyze two-phase microstructures with irregular inclusions of
silica in rubber matrix as well as stones in cement paste. The results show that the two-stage reconstruction
(TSR) method provides convincing realizations for these complex microstructures. The advantages
of TSR include the ease of obtaining synthetic microstructures, very low computational costs,
and satisfactory mapping in the statistical context of inclusion shapes. Finally, its simplicity
should greatly facilitate independent applications.
