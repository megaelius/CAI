Mobile crowdsensing is a people-centric sensing system based on users' contributions and incentive
mechanisms aim at stimulating them. In our work, we have rethought the design of incentive mechanisms
through a game-theoretic methodology. Thus, we have introduced a multi-layer social sensing framework,
where humans as social sensors interact on multiple social layers and various services. We have
proposed to weigh these dynamic interactions by including the concept of homophily and we have modelled
the evolutionary dynamics of sensing behaviours by defining a mathematical framework based on
multiplex EGT, quantifying the impact of homophily, network heterogeneity and various social
dilemmas. We have detected the configurations of social dilemmas and network structures that lead
to the emergence and sustainability of human cooperation. Moreover, we have defined and evaluated
local and global Nash equilibrium points by including the concepts of homophily and heterogeneity.
We have analytically defined and measured novel statistical measures of social honesty, QoI and
users' behavioural reputation scores based on the evolutionary dynamics. We have defined the Decision
Support System and a novel incentive mechanism by operating on the policies in terms of users' reputation
scores, that also incorporate users' behaviours other than quality and quantity of contributions.
Experimentally, we have considered the Waze dataset on vehicular traffic monitoring application
and derived the disbursement of incentives comparing our method with baselines. Results demonstrate
that our methodology, which also includes the local (microscopic) spatio-temporal distribution
of behaviours, is able to better discriminate users' behaviours. This multi-scale characterisation
of users represents a novel research direction and paves the way for novel policies on mobile crowdsensing
systems.
