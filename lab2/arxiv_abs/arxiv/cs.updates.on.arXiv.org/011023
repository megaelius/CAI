Context: Maturity of practices and infrastructure in healthcare domain directly impacts the quality
and efficiency of healthcare services. Therefore, various healthcare administrations (e.g.,
hospital management to nation-wide health authority) need to assess and improve their operational
maturity. Objective: This study aims to review and classify studies that propose/use maturity
assessment or maturity models (MMs) as a vehicle to achieve operational excellence in healthcare
domain. Method: To achieve this objective, we performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) that
is a form of Systematic Review and includes data from the grey literature (e.g., white papers and
online documents) in addition to formal, peer-reviewed literature. Results: Based on 101 sources,
80 of which are from the peer-reviewed literature and 21 are from the grey literature, we identified
68 different MMs on, e.g., telemedicine, care pathways, and digital imaging. We reviewed them with
respect to various aspects including: types of research and contribution; list of MMs proposed/used
with their subject focuses; elements of maturity/capability; and application scope or scale.
In the synthesis of empirical benefits of using MMs, two were found significant: (1) Identifying
issues and providing guidance for improvement in healthcare contexts; (2) Improving efficiency,
effectiveness, performance, and productivity. Conclusion: This MLR provides an overview of the
landscape and serves as an index to the vast body of knowledge in this area. Our review creates an opportunity
to cope with the challenges in getting an overview of the state-of-the-art and practice, choosing
the most suitable models, or developing new models with further specialties.
