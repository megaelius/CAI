As a key technique for enabling artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) is capable of solving
complex problems without explicit programming. Motivated by its successful applications to many
practical tasks like image recognition, both industry and the research community have advocated
the applications of ML in wireless communication. This paper comprehensively surveys the recent
advances of the applications of ML in wireless communication, which are classified as: resource
management in the MAC layer, networking and mobility management in the network layer, and localization
in the application layer. The applications in resource management further include power control,
spectrum management, backhaul management, cache management, beamformer design and computation
resource management, while ML based networking focuses on the applications in clustering, base
station switching control, user association and routing. Moreover, literatures in each aspect
is organized according to the adopted ML techniques. In addition, several conditions for applying
ML to wireless communication are identified to help readers decide whether to use ML and which kind
of ML techniques to use, and traditional approaches are also summarized together with their performance
comparison with ML based approaches, based on which the motivations of surveyed literatures to
adopt ML are clarified. Given the extensiveness of the research area, challenges and unresolved
issues are presented to facilitate future studies, where ML based network slicing, infrastructure
update to support ML based paradigms, open data sets and platforms for researchers, theoretical
guidance for ML implementation and so on are discussed.
