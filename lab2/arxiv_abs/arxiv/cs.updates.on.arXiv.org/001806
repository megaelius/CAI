Optical network virtualisation is a promising technology enabler to support the currently growing
and dynamic network services over the widely distributed network resources. The variation of physical
layer impairments in the network and the traffic pattern dynamics themselves will jointly impact
the accommodation of these services as a whole. In this paper, we introduce real-time multi-technology
transport layer monitoring to facilitate the coordinated virtualisation of optical and Ethernet
networks supported by optical virtualise-able transceivers (V-BVT). We present a monitoring
and network resource configuration scheme to include hardware monitoring in both Ethernet and
Optical layers. The scheme also depicts the data and control interactions among multiple network
layers under software defined network (SDN) background, as well as the application that analyse
the monitored data obtained from the database. The use-case of the scheme in an inter-data centre
scenario is also described. In addition, a re-configuration algorithm is described to adaptively
modify the composition of virtual optical networks based on two criteria: (i) according to the monitored
Ethernet traffic, a re-configuration is made in Ethernet layer to groom the traffic, and (ii) depends
on the monitored optical transmission quality of transmission (QoT), a reconfiguration is made
in optical layer to modify the creation of virtual transceivers within the V-BVT. Furthermore,
the proposed monitoring scheme is experimentally demonstrated, including the monitoring of server
network interface cards (NIC), ports of Ethernet switches and the optical transmission links.
The outcome from the algorithm is executed by the SDN control through OpenFlow (OF) extensions,
and a holistic (re-)configuration across both layers in Ethernet switches and V-BVTs are presented
and studied.
