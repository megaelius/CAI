Generative models for graphs are increasingly becoming a popular tool for researchers to generate
realistic approximations of graphs. While in the past, focus was on generating graphs which follow
general laws, such as the power law for degree distribution, current models have the ability to learn
from observed graphs and generate synthetic approximations. The primary emphasis of existing
models has been to closely match different properties of a single observed graph. Such models, though
stochastic, tend to generate samples which do not have significant variance in terms of the various
graph properties. We argue that in many cases real graphs are sampled drawn from a graph population
(e.g., networks sampled at various time points, social networks for individual schools, healthcare
networks for different geographic regions, etc.). Such populations typically exhibit significant
variance. However, existing models are not designed to model this variance, which could lead to
issues such as overfitting. We propose a graph generative model that focuses on matching the properties
of real graphs and the natural variance expected for the corresponding population. The proposed
model adopts a mixture-model strategy to expand the expressiveness of Kronecker product based
graph models (KPGM), while building upon the two strengths of KPGM, viz., ability to model several
key properties of graphs and to scale to massive graph sizes using its elegant fractal growth based
formulation. The proposed model, called x-Kronecker Product Graph Model, or xKPGM, allows scalable
learning from observed graphs and generates samples that match the mean and variance of several
salient graph properties. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the proposed model
to capture the inherent variability in real world graphs on a variety of publicly available graph
data sets.
