Using personal generated health data (PGHD) during medical consultations can be beneficial for
both patients and clinicians. However, multiple acceptance barriers such as lack of PGHD reliability
prevents a routine usage of this data. A clinical decision support system, called FullFlow, has
been developed to address these acceptance barriers. The objective of this study was to determine
if FullFlow was useful during consultations and to verify the hypothesis that the higher PGHD reliability,
the more effective the system is. The assessment relied on a medical pilot during which clinicians
and patients with diabetes used the FullFlow during medical consultations. The data collection
relied on a post-consultation questionnaire in addition to system logs. This study showed that
the PGHD reliability was low for an overwhelming majority of consultations. The information displayed
was useful in half of the consultations according to the clinicians who answered the questionnaire.
Despite this, the overwhelming majority of clinicians who answered the questionnaire found that
the designed FullFlow system permitted to gain insights of the situation of the patients. The study
showed the higher the PGHD reliability is, the more useful the system is for clinicians. PGHD usage
in clinical settings can permit clinicians to gain valuable information regarding the situations
of their patients. A clinical decision system can present useful information to clinicians. While
the PGHD reliability is correlated to the usefulness of such system, it is not the only factor impacting
it: context of the clinicians and patients such as novelty of usage and personal goals also plays
a role in determining on how such system is useful for clinicians. However, due to a limited number
of participants, a new medical pilot must be performed in order to confirm the results of this study.
