Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to improve the accuracy of polarimetric
synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification. However, in most studies, the difference
between PolSAR images and optical images is rarely considered. Most of the existing CNNs are not
tailored for the task of PolSAR image classification, in which complex-valued PolSAR data have
been simply equated to real-valued data to fit the optical image processing architectures and avoid
complex-valued operations. This is one of the reasons CNNs unable to perform their full capabilities
in PolSAR classification. To solve the above problem, the objective of this paper is to develop a
tailored CNN framework for PolSAR image classification, which can be implemented from two aspects:
Seeking a better form of PolSAR data as the input of CNNs and building matched CNN architectures based
on the proposed input form. In this paper, considering the properties of complex-valued numbers,
amplitude and phase of complex-valued PolSAR data are extracted as the input for the first time to
maintain the integrity of original information while avoiding immature complex-valued operations.
Then, a multi-task CNN (MCNN) architecture is proposed to match the improved input form and achieve
better classification results. Furthermore, depthwise separable convolution is introduced
to the proposed architecture in order to better extract information from the phase information.
Experiments on three PolSAR benchmark datasets not only prove that using amplitude and phase as
the input do contribute to the improvement of PolSAR classification, but also verify the adaptability
between the improved input form and the well-designed architectures.
