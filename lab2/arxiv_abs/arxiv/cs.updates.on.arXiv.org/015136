Computing with words (CWW) has emerged as a powerful tool for processing the linguistic information,
especially the one generated by human beings. Various CWW approaches have emerged since the inception
of CWW, such as perceptual computing, extension principle based CWW approach, symbolic method
based CWW approach, and 2-tuple based CWW approach. Furthermore, perceptual computing can use
interval approach (IA), enhanced interval approach (EIA), or Hao-Mendel approach (HMA), for data
processing. There have been numerous works in which HMA was shown to be better at word modelling than
EIA, and EIA better than IA. But, a deeper study of these works reveals that HMA captures lesser fuzziness
than the EIA or IA. Thus, we feel that EIA is more suited for word modelling in multi-person systems
and HMA for single-person systems (as EIA is an improvement over IA). Furthermore, another set of
works, compared the performances perceptual computing to the other above said CWW approaches.
In all these works, perceptual computing was shown to be better than other CWW approaches. However,
none of the works tried to investigate the reason behind this observed better performance of perceptual
computing. Also, no comparison has been performed for scenarios where the inputs are differentially
weighted. Thus, the aim of this work is to empirically establish that EIA is suitable for multi-person
systems and HMA for single-person systems. Another dimension of this work is also to empirically
prove that perceptual computing gives better performance than other CWW approaches based on extension
principle, symbolic method and 2-tuple especially in scenarios where inputs are differentially
weighted.
