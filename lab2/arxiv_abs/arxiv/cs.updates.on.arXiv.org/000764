Intuitionistic logic, in which the double negation law not-not-P = P fails, is dominant in categorical
logic, notably in topos theory. This paper follows a different direction in which double negation
does hold. The algebraic notions of effect algebra/module that emerged in theoretical physics
form the cornerstone. It is shown that under mild conditions on a category, its maps of the form X ->
1+1 carry such effect module structure, and can be used as predicates. Predicates are dentified
in many different situations, and capture for instance ordinary subsets, fuzzy predicates in a
probabilistic setting, idempotents in a ring, and effects (positive elements below the unit) in
a C*-algebra or Hilbert space. In quantum foundations the duality between states and effects plays
an important role. It appears here in the form of an adjunction, where we use maps 1 -> X as states.
For such a state s and a predicate p, the validity probability s |= p is defined, as an abstract Born
rule. It captures many forms of (Boolean or probabilistic) validity known from the literature.
Measurement from quantum mechanics is formalised categorically in terms of `instruments', using
L"uders rule in the quantum case. These instruments are special maps ssociated with predicates
(more generally, with tests), which perform the act of measurement and may have a side-effect that
disturbs the system under observation. This abstract description of side-effects is one of the
main achievements of the current approach. It is shown that in the special case of C*-algebras, side-effect
appear exclusively in the non-commutative case. Also, these instruments are used for test operators
in a dynamic logic that can be used for reasoning about quantum programs/protocols. The paper describes
four successive assumptions, towards a categorical axiomatisation of quantitative logic for
probabilistic and quantum systems.
