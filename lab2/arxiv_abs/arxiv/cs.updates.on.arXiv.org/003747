The Euclidean $k$-center problem is a classical problem that has been extensively studied in many
areas of computer science. Given a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $n$ points in Euclidean space, the problem
is to determine a set $\mathcal{C}$ of $k$ centers (not necessarily part of $\mathcal{G}$) such
that the maximum distance between a point in $\mathcal{G}$ and its nearest neighbor in $\mathcal{C}$
is minimized. In this paper we study the corresponding $(k,\ell)$-center problem for polygonal
curves under the Fr\'echet distance, that is, given a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $n$ polygonal curves
in $\mathbb{R}^d$, each of complexity $m$, determine a set $\mathcal{C}$ of $k$ polygonal curves
in $\mathbb{R}^d$, each of complexity $\ell$, such that the maximum Fr\'echet distance of a curve
in $\mathcal{G}$ to its closest curve in $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized. We show that there is no polynomial-time
$(\frac{3}{2}-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for any $\varepsilon~>~0$ unless $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$.
This bound even holds for one-dimensional curves under the continuous Fr\'echet distance, and
is further improved to $(3\sin(\frac{\pi}{3})-\varepsilon)$ if the curves may lie in the plane
and if the discrete Fr\'echet distance is used. These hardness results hold even when $k=1$, i.e.,
for the minimum-enclosing ball version of the problem. At the same time, we prove that a careful adaptation
of Gonzalez' algorithm in combination with a curve simplification yields a $3$-approximation
in any dimension, provided that an optimal simplification can be computed exactly. We give a comprehensive
analysis of this approximation scheme in spaces of arbitrary dimension and for both the discrete
and continuous Fr\'echet distances. Overall, our results significantly extend and improve the
known approximation bounds for the $(k,\ell)$-center clustering problem.
