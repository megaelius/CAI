Due to cellular heterogeneity, cell nuclei classification, segmentation, and detection from
pathological images are challenging tasks. In the last few years, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(DCNN) approaches have been shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on histopathological
imaging in different studies. In this work, we have proposed different advanced DCNN models and
evaluated for nuclei classification, segmentation, and detection. First, the Densely Connected
Recurrent Convolutional Network (DCRN) model is used for nuclei classification. Second, Recurrent
Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) is applied for nuclei segmentation. Third, the R2U-Net regression model
which is named UD-Net is used for nuclei detection from pathological images. The experiments are
conducted with different datasets including Routine Colon Cancer(RCC) classification and detection
dataset, and Nuclei Segmentation Challenge 2018 dataset. The experimental results show that the
proposed DCNN models provide superior performance compared to the existing approaches for nuclei
classification, segmentation, and detection tasks. The results are evaluated with different
performance metrics including precision, recall, Dice Coefficient (DC), Means Squared Errors
(MSE), F1-score, and overall accuracy. We have achieved around 3.4% and 4.5% better F-1 score for
nuclei classification and detection tasks compared to recently published DCNN based method. In
addition, R2U-Net shows around 92.15% testing accuracy in term of DC. These improved methods will
help for pathological practices for better quantitative analysis of nuclei in Whole Slide Images(WSI)
which ultimately will help for better understanding of different types of cancer in clinical workflow.
