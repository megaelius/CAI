Large-scale quantum computing is a significant threat to classical public-key cryptography.
In strong "quantum access" security models, numerous symmetric-key cryptosystems are also vulnerable.
We consider classical encryption in a model which grants the adversary quantum oracle access to
encryption and decryption, but where the latter is restricted to non-adaptive (i.e., pre-challenge)
queries only. We define this model formally using appropriate notions of ciphertext indistinguishability
and semantic security (which are equivalent by standard arguments) and call it QCCA1 in analogy
to the classical CCA1 security model. Using a bound on quantum random-access codes, we show that
the standard PRF- and PRP-based encryption schemes are QCCA1-secure when instantiated with quantum-secure
primitives. We then revisit standard IND-CPA-secure Learning with Errors (LWE) encryption and
show that leaking just one quantum decryption query (and no other queries or leakage of any kind)
allows the adversary to recover the full secret key with constant success probability. In the classical
setting, by contrast, recovering the key uses a linear number of decryption queries, and this is
optimal. The algorithm at the core of our attack is a (large-modulus version of) the well-known Bernstein-Vazirani
algorithm. We emphasize that our results should *not* be interpreted as a weakness of these cryptosystems
in their stated security setting (i.e., post-quantum chosen-plaintext secrecy). Rather, our
results mean that, if these cryptosystems are exposed to chosen-ciphertext attacks (e.g., as a
result of deployment in an inappropriate real-world setting) then quantum attacks are even more
devastating than classical ones.
