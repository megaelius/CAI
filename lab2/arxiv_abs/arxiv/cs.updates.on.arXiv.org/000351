This paper considers the two-user Gaussian Causal Cognitive Interference Channel (GCCIC), which
consists of two source-destination pairs that share the same channel and where one full-duplex
cognitive source can causally learn the message of the primary source through a noisy link. The GCCIC
is an interference channel with unilateral source cooperation that better models practical cognitive
radio networks than the commonly used model which assumes that one source has perfect non-causal
knowledge of the other source's message. First the sum-capacity of the symmetric GCCIC is determined
to within a constant gap. Then, the insights gained from the derivation of the symmetric sum-capacity
are extended to characterize the whole capacity region to within a constant gap for more general
cases. In particular, the capacity is determined (a) to within 2 bits for the fully connected GCCIC
when, roughly speaking, the interference is not weak at both receivers, (b) to within 2 bits for the
Z-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from the primary user, and (c) to within 2 bits for
the S-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from the secondary user. The parameter regimes
where the GCCIC is equivalent, in terms of generalized degrees-of-freedom, to the noncooperative
interference channel (i.e., unilateral causal cooperation is not useful), to the non-causal cognitive
interference channel (i.e., causal cooperation attains the ultimate limit of cognitive radio
technology), and to bilateral source cooperation are identified. These comparisons shed lights
into the parameter regimes and network topologies that in practice might provide an unbounded throughput
gain compared to currently available (non cognitive) technologies.
