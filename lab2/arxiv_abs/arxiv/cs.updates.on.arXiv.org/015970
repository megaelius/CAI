fMRI semantic category understanding using linguistic encoding models attempts to learn a forward
mapping that relates stimuli to the corresponding brain activation. State-of-the-art encoding
models use a single global model (linear or non-linear) to predict brain activation given the stimulus.
However, the critical assumption in these methods is that a priori different brain regions respond
the same way to all the stimuli, that is, there is no modularity or specialization assumed for any
region. This goes against the modularity theory, supported by many cognitive neuroscience investigations
suggesting that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain. In this paper, we achieve
this by clustering similar regions together and for every cluster we learn a different linear regression
model using a mixture of linear experts model. The key idea here is that each linear expert captures
the behaviour of similar brain regions. Given a new stimulus, the utility of the proposed model is
twofold (i) predicts the brain activation as a weighted linear combination of the activations of
multiple linear experts and (ii) to learn multiple experts corresponding to different brain regions.
We argue that each expert captures activity patterns related to a particular region of interest
(ROI) in the human brain. This study helps in understanding the brain regions that are activated
together given different kinds of stimuli. Importantly, we suggest that the mixture of regression
experts (MoRE) framework successfully combines the two principles of organization of function
in the brain, namely that of specialization and integration. Experiments on fMRI data from paradigm
1 [1]where participants view linguistic stimuli show that the proposed MoRE model has better prediction
accuracy compared to that of conventional models.
