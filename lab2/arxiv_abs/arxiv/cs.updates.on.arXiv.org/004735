Given a stationary state-space model that relates a sequence of hidden states and corresponding
measurements or observations, Bayesian filtering provides a principled statistical framework
for inferring the posterior distribution of the current state given all measurements up to the present
time. For example, the Apollo lunar module implemented a Kalman filter to infer its location from
a sequence of earth-based radar measurements and land safely on the moon. To perform Bayesian filtering,
we require a measurement model that describes the conditional distribution of each observation
given state. The Kalman filter takes this measurement model to be linear, Gaussian. Here we show
how a nonlinear, Gaussian approximation to the distribution of state given observation can be used
in conjunction with Bayes' rule to build a nonlinear, non-Gaussian measurement model. The resulting
approach, called the Discriminative Kalman Filter (DKF), retains fast closed-form updates for
the posterior. We argue there are many cases where the distribution of state given measurement is
better-approximated as Gaussian, especially when the dimensionality of measurements far exceeds
that of states and the Bernstein-von Mises theorem applies. Online neural decoding for brain-computer
interfaces provides a motivating example, where filtering incorporates increasingly detailed
measurements of neural activity to provide users control over external devices. Within the BrainGate2
clinical trial, the DKF successfully enabled three volunteers with quadriplegia to control an
on-screen cursor in real-time using mental imagery alone. Participant "T9" used the DKF to type
out messages on a tablet PC.
