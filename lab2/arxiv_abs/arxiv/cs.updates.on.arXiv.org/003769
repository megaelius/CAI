In the year of 2017, the capital expenditure of Flash-based Solid State Drivers (SSDs) keeps declining
and the storage capacity of SSDs keeps increasing. As a result, the "selling point" of traditional
spinning Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) as a backend storage - low cost and large capacity - is no longer unique,
and eventually they will be replaced by low-end SSDs which have large capacity but perform orders
of magnitude better than HDDs. Thus, it is widely believed that all-flash multi-tier storage systems
will be adopted in the enterprise datacenters in the near future. However, existing caching or tiering
solutions for SSD-HDD hybrid storage systems are not suitable for all-flash storage systems. This
is because that all-flash storage systems do not have a large speed difference (e.g., 10x) among
each tier. Instead, different specialties (such as high performance, high capacity, etc.) of each
tier should be taken into consideration. Motivated by this, we develop an automatic data placement
manager called "AutoTiering" to handle virtual machine disk files (VMDK) allocation and migration
in an all-flash multi-tier datacenter to best utilize the storage resource, optimize the performance,
and reduce the migration overhead. AutoTiering is based on an optimization framework, whose core
technique is to predict VM's performance change on different tiers with different specialties
without conducting real migration. As far as we know, AutoTiering is the first optimization solution
designed for all-flash multi-tier datacenters. We implement AutoTiering on VMware ESXi, and experimental
results show that it can significantly improve the I/O performance compared to existing solutions.
