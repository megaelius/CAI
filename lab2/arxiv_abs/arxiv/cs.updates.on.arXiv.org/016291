Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has attracted significant attention and become the most popular
method for learning graph representations. In recent years, many efforts have been focused on integrating
GCN into the recommender tasks and have made remarkable progress. At its core is to explicitly capture
high-order connectivities between the nodes in user-item bipartite graph. However, we theoretically
and empirically find an inherent drawback existed in these GCN-based recommendation methods,
where GCN is directly applied to aggregate neighboring nodes will introduce noise and information
redundancy. Consequently, the these models' capability of capturing high-order connectivities
among different nodes is limited, leading to suboptimal performance of the recommender tasks.
The main reason is that the the nonlinear network layer inside GCN structure is not suitable for extracting
non-sematic features(such as one-hot ID feature) in the collaborative filtering scenarios. In
this work, we develop a new GCN-based Collaborative Filtering model, named Refined Graph convolution
Collaborative Filtering(RGCF), where the construction of the embeddings of users (items) are
delicately redesigned from several aspects during the aggregation on the graph. Compared to the
state-of-the-art GCN-based recommendation, RGCF is more capable for capturing the implicit high-order
connectivities inside the graph and the resultant vector representations are more expressive.
We conduct extensive experiments on three public million-size datasets, demonstrating that our
RGCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. We release our code at https://github.com/hfutmars/RGCF.
