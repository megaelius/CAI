Granular operator spaces and variants had been introduced and used in theoretical investigations
on the foundations of general rough sets by the present author over the last few years. In this research,
higher order versions of these are presented uniformly as partial algebraic systems. They are also
adapted for practical applications when the data is representable by data table-like structures
according to a minimalist schema for avoiding contamination. Issues relating to valuations used
in information systems or tables are also addressed. The concept of contamination introduced and
studied by the present author across a number of her papers, concerns mixing up of information across
semantic domains (or domains of discourse). Rough inclusion functions (\textsf{RIF}s), variants,
and numeric functions often have a direct or indirect role in contaminating algorithms. Some solutions
that seek to replace or avoid them have been proposed and investigated by the present author in some
of her earlier papers. Because multiple kinds of solution are of interest to the contamination problem,
granular generalizations of RIFs are proposed, and investigated. Interesting representation
results are proved and a core algebraic strategy for generalizing Skowron-Polkowski style of rough
mereology (though for a very different purpose) is formulated. A number of examples have been added
to illustrate key parts of the proposal in higher order variants of granular operator spaces. Further
algorithms grounded in mereological nearness, suited for decision-making in human-machine interaction
contexts, are proposed by the present author. Applications of granular \textsf{RIF}s to partial/soft
solutions of the inverse problem are also invented in this paper.
