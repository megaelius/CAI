A new family of mixed finite element methods$-$compatible-strain mixed finite element methods
(CSFEMs)$-$are introduced for three-dimensional compressible and incompressible nonlinear
elasticity. A Hu-Washizu-type functional is extremized in order to obtain a mixed formulation
for nonlinear elasticity. The independent fields of the mixed formulations are the displacement,
the displacement gradient, and the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress. A pressure-like field is also
introduced in the case of incompressible elasticity. We define the displacement in $H^1$, the displacement
gradient in $H(curl)$, the stress in $H(div)$, and the pressure-like field in $L^2$. In this setting,
for improving the stability of the proposed finite element methods without compromising their
consistency, we consider some stabilizing terms in the Hu-Washizu-type functional that vanish
at its critical points. Using a conforming interpolation, the solution and the test spaces are approximated
with some piecewise polynomial subspaces of them. In three dimensions, this requires using the
N\'ed\'elec edge elements for the displacement gradient and the N\'ed\'elec face elements for
the stress. This approach results in mixed finite element methods that satisfy the Hadamard jump
condition and the continuity of traction on all internal faces of the mesh. This, in particular,
makes CSFEMs quite efficient for modeling heterogeneous solids. We assess the performance of CSFEMs
by solving several numerical examples, and demonstrate their good performance for bending problems,
for bodies with complex geometries, and in the near-incompressible and the incompressible regimes.
Using CSFEMs, one can capture very large strains and accurately approximate stresses and the pressure
field. Moreover, in our numerical examples, we do not observe any numerical artifacts such as checkerboarding
of pressure, hourglass instability, or locking.
