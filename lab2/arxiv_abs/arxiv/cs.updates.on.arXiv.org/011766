The total influence of a function is a central notion in analysis of Boolean functions, and characterizing
functions that have small total influence is one of the most fundamental questions associated with
it. The KKL theorem and the Friedgut junta theorem give a strong characterization of such functions
whenever the bound on the total influence is $o(\log n)$, however, both results become useless when
the total influence of the function is $\omega(\log n)$. The only case in which this logarithmic
barrier has been broken for an interesting class of function was proved by Bourgain and Kalai, who
focused on functions that are symmetric under large enough subgroups of $S_n$. In this paper, we
revisit the key ideas of the Bourgain-Kalai paper. We prove a new general inequality that upper bounds
the correlation between a Boolean function $f$ and a real-valued, low degree function $g$ in terms
of their norms, Fourier coefficients and total influences. Some corollaries of this inequality
are: 1. The Bourgain-Kalai result. 2. A slightly weaker version of the Fourier-Entropy Conjecture.
More precisely, we prove that the Fourier entropy of the low-degree part of $f$ is at most $O(I[f]\log^2
I[f])$, where $I[f]$ is the total influence of $f$. In particular, we conclude that the Fourier spectrum
of a Boolean function is concentrated on at most $2^{O(I[f]\log^2 I[f])}$ Fourier coefficients.
3. Using well-known learning algorithms of sparse functions, the previous point implies that the
class of functions with sub-logarithmic total influence (i.e. at most $O(\log n/(\log \log n)^2)$)
is learnable in polynomial time, using membership queries.
