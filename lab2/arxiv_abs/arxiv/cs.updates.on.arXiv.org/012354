Particle- and agent-based systems are a ubiquitous modeling tool in many disciplines. We consider
the fundamental problem of inferring interaction kernels from observations of agent-based dynamical
systems given observations of trajectories, in particular for collective dynamical systems exhibiting
emergent behaviors with complicated interaction kernels, in a nonparametric fashion, and for
kernels which are parametrized by a single unknown parameter. We extend the estimators introduced
in \cite{PNASLU}, which are based on suitably regularized least squares estimators, to these larger
classes of systems. We provide extensive numerical evidence that the estimators provide faithful
approximations to the interaction kernels, and provide accurate predictions for trajectories
started at new initial conditions, both throughout the ``training'' time interval in which the
observations were made, and often much beyond. We demonstrate these features on prototypical systems
displaying collective behaviors, ranging from opinion dynamics, flocking dynamics, self-propelling
particle dynamics, synchronized oscillator dynamics, and a gravitational system. Our experiments
also suggest that our estimated systems can display the same emergent behaviors of the observed
systems, that occur at larger timescales than those used in the training data. Finally, in the case
of families of systems governed by a parameterized family of interaction kernels, we introduce
novel estimators that estimate the parameterized family of kernels, splitting it into a common
interaction kernel and the action of parameters. We demonstrate this in the case of gravity, by learning
both the ``common component'' $1/r^2$ and the dependency on mass, without any a priori knowledge
of either one, from observations of planetary motions in our solar system.
