In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis investigating the reliability of SSD-based
I/O caching architectures used in enterprise storage systems under power failure and high-operating
temperature. We explore variety of SSDs from top vendors and investigate the cache reliability
in mirrored configuration. To this end, we first develop a physical fault injection and failure
detection platform and then investigate the impact of workload dependent parameters on the reliability
of I/O cache in the presence of two common failure types in data centers, power outage and high temperature
faults. We implement an I/O cache scheme using an open-source I/O cache module in Linux operating
system. The experimental results obtained by conducting more than twenty thousand of physical
fault injections on the implemented I/O cache with different write policies reveal that the failure
rate of the I/O cache is significantly affected by workload dependent parameters. Our results show
that unlike workload requests access pattern, the other workload dependent parameters such as
request size, Working Set Size (WSS), and sequence of the accesses have considerable impact on the
I/O cache failure rate. We observe a significant growth in the failure rate in the workloads by decreasing
the size of the requests (by more than 14X). Furthermore, we observe that in addition to writes, the
read accesses to the I/O cache are subjected to failure in presence of sudden power outage (the failure
mainly occurs during promoting data to the cache). In addition, we observe that I/O cache experiences
no data failure upon high temperature faults.
