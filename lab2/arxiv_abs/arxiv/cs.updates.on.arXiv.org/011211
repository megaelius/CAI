We report the possibility of obtaining complex networks with diverse topology, henceforth called
harmonic networks, by taking into account the consonances and dissonances between sound notes
as defined by scale temperaments. Temperaments define the intervals between musical notes of scales.
In real-world sounds, several additional frequencies (partials) accompany the respective fundamental,
influencing the consonance between simultaneous notes. We use a method based on Helmholtz's consonance
approach to quantify the consonances and dissonances, between each of the pairs of notes in a given
scale temperament. We adopt two distinct partials structures: (i) harmonic; and (ii) shifted,
obtained by taking the harmonic components to a given power $\beta$, which is henceforth called
the anharmonicity index. When these estimated consonances/dissonances are taken along several
octaves, respective harmonic complex networks can be obtained, in which nodes and weighted edge
represent notes, and consonance/dissonance, respectively. We consider five scale temperaments
(i.e., equal, meantone, Werckmeister, just, and Pythagorean). The obtained results can be organized
into two major groups, those related to complex networks and musical implications. Regarding the
former group, we have that the harmonic networks can provide, for varying values of $\beta$, a wide
range of topologies spanning the space comprised between traditional models. The musical interpretations
of the results include the confirmation of the more regular consonance pattern of the equal temperament,
obtained at the expense of a wider range of consonances such as that obtained in the meantone temperament.
We also have that scales derived for shifted partials tend to exhibit a wide range of consonance/dissonance
behavior depending oh the adopted temperament and anharmonicity strength.
