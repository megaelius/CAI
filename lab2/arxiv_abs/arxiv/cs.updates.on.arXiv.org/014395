Caching is an efficient way to reduce network traffic congestion during peak hours by storing some
content at the user's local cache memory. For the shared-link network with end-user-caches, Maddah-Ali
and Niesen proposed a two-phase coded caching strategy, referred to as MAN. In practice, users may
communicate with the server through intermediate relays. This paper studies the tradeoff between
the memory size M and the download time / rate R for networks where a server with N files is connected
to H relays (without caches), which in turns are connected to K users equipped with caches of size
M files. When each user is connected to a different subset of r relays, i.e., $K=\binom{H}{r}$, the
system is referred to as a combination network with end-user-caches. In this work, converse bounds
are derived for the practically motivated case of uncoded cache contents, that is, bits of the various
files are directly copied in the user caches without any coding. In this case, once the cache contents
and the user demands are known, the problem reduces to a general index coding problem. This paper
shows that relying on a well known "acyclic index coding converse bound" results in bounds that are
not tight for combination networks with end-user-caches and provides two novel ways to derive the
tightest known converse bounds to date. As a result of independent interest, an inequality that
generalizes the well-known sub-modularity of entropy is derived. Several novel caching schemes
are proposed, based on the MAN cache placement. These schemes leverage the structure of the combination
network and perform interference elimination at the end-users. The proposed schemes are proved:
(i) to be (order) optimal for some parameters regimes of (N,M,H,r) with or without the constraint
of uncoded cache placement, and (ii) to outperform the state-of-the-art schemes in numerical evaluations.
