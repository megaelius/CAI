For short-term solar irradiance forecasting, the traditional point forecasting methods are rendered
less useful due to the non-stationary characteristic of solar power. The amount of operating reserves
required to maintain reliable operation of the electric grid rises due to the variability of solar
energy. The higher the uncertainty in the generation, the greater the operating-reserve requirements,
which translates to an increased cost of operation. In this research work, we propose a unified architecture
for multi-time-scale predictions for intra-day solar irradiance forecasting using recurrent
neural networks (RNN) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs). This paper also lays out a framework
for extending this modeling approach to intra-hour forecasting horizons thus, making it a multi-time-horizon
forecasting approach, capable of predicting intra-hour as well as intra-day solar irradiance.
We develop an end-to-end pipeline to effectuate the proposed architecture. The performance of
the prediction model is tested and validated by the methodical implementation. The robustness
of the approach is demonstrated with case studies conducted for geographically scattered sites
across the United States. The predictions demonstrate that our proposed unified architecture-based
approach is effective for multi-time-scale solar forecasts and achieves a lower root-mean-square
prediction error when benchmarked against the best-performing methods documented in the literature
that use separate models for each time-scale during the day. Our proposed method results in a 71.5%
reduction in the mean RMSE averaged across all the test sites compared to the ML-based best-performing
method reported in the literature. Additionally, the proposed method enables multi-time-horizon
forecasts with real-time inputs, which have a significant potential for practical industry applications
in the evolving grid.
