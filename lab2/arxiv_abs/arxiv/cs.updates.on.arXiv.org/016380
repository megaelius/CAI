The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects billions of lives around the world and has a significant
impact on public healthcare. Due to rising skepticism towards the sensitivity of RT-PCR as screening
method, medical imaging like computed tomography offers great potential as alternative. For this
reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical decision support for quantitative
assessment and disease monitoring. However, publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited
which leads to overfitting of traditional approaches. To address this problem, we propose an innovative
automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to handle small datasets
by utilization as variant databases. Our method focuses on on-the-fly generation of unique and
random image patches for training by performing several preprocessing methods and exploiting
extensive data augmentation. For further reduction of the overfitting risk, we implemented a standard
3D U-Net architecture instead of new or computational complex neural network architectures. Through
a 5-fold cross-validation on 20 CT scans of COVID-19 patients, we were able to develop a highly accurate
as well as robust segmentation model for lungs and COVID-19 infected regions without overfitting
on the limited data. Our method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.956 for lungs and 0.761
for infection. We demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms related approaches, advances
the state-of-the-art for COVID-19 segmentation and improves medical image analysis with limited
data. The code and model are available under the following link: https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/covid19.MIScnn
