Automatic mapping of buildings from remote sensing imagery is currently limited by insufficient
detection accuracy. A recent technique that can largely promote the building detection accuracy
is convolutional neural network, which is an important branch of deep learning and has substantially
improved the state-of-the-art performance of image segmentation. A benchmark dataset bears significance
in fair comparisons for further accelerating the development of building detection toward automatic
mapping. However, several problems still remain in the current public datasets that address this
task. First, although building detection is generally considered equivalent to extracting roof
outlines, most datasets directly provide building footprints as ground truths for testing and
evaluation; the challenges of these benchmarks are more complicated than roof segmentation, as
relief displacement leads to varying degrees of misalignment between roof outlines and footprints.
On the other hand, an image dataset should feature a large quantity and high spatial resolution to
effectively train a high-performance deep learning model for accurate mapping of buildings. Unfortunately,
the remote sensing community still lacks proper benchmark datasets that can simultaneously satisfy
these requirements. In this paper, we present a new large-scale benchmark dataset termed Aerial
Imagery for Roof Segmentation (AIRS). This dataset provides a wide coverage of aerial imagery with
7.5 cm resolution and contains over 220,000 buildings. The task posed for AIRS is defined as roof
segmentation. We implement several state-of-the-art deep learning methods of semantic segmentation
for performance evaluation and analysis of the proposed dataset. The results can serve as the baseline
for future work.
