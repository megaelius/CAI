Sparse dictionary learning is a popular method for representing signals as linear combinations
of a few elements from a dictionary that is learned from the data. In the classical setting, signals
are represented as vectors and the dictionary learning problem is posed as a matrix factorization
problem where the data matrix is approximately factorized into a dictionary matrix and a sparse
matrix of coefficients. However, in many applications in computer vision and medical imaging,
signals are better represented as matrices or tensors (e.g. images or videos), where it may be beneficial
to exploit the multi-dimensional structure of the data to learn a more compact representation.
One such approach is separable dictionary learning, where one learns separate dictionaries for
different dimensions of the data. However, typical formulations involve solving a non-convex
optimization problem; thus guaranteeing global optimality remains a challenge. In this work,
we propose a framework that builds upon recent developments in matrix factorization to provide
theoretical and numerical guarantees of global optimality for separable dictionary learning.
We propose an algorithm to find such a globally optimal solution, which alternates between following
local descent steps and checking a certificate for global optimality. We illustrate our approach
on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data, a medical imaging modality that measures
water diffusion along multiple angular directions in every voxel of an MRI volume. State-of-the-art
methods in dMRI either learn dictionaries only for the angular domain of the signals or in some cases
learn spatial and angular dictionaries independently. In this work, we apply the proposed separable
dictionary learning framework to learn spatial and angular dMRI dictionaries jointly and provide
preliminary validation on denoising phantom and real dMRI brain data.
