This paper presents a novel adaptive resonance theory (ART)-based modular architecture for unsupervised
learning, namely the distributed dual vigilance fuzzy ART (DDVFA). DDVFA consists of a global ART
system whose nodes are local fuzzy ART modules. It is equipped with the distinctive features of distributed
higher-order activation and match functions, using dual vigilance parameters responsible for
cluster similarity and data quantization. Together, these allow DDVFA to perform unsupervised
modularization, create multi-prototype clustering representations, retrieve arbitrarily-shaped
clusters, and control its compactness. Another important contribution is the reduction of order-dependence,
an issue that affects any agglomerative clustering method. This paper demonstrates two approaches
for mitigating order-dependence: preprocessing using visual assessment of cluster tendency
(VAT) or postprocessing using a novel Merge ART module. The former is suitable for batch processing,
whereas the latter can be used in online learning. Experimental results in the online learning mode
carried out on 30 benchmark data sets show that DDVFA cascaded with Merge ART statistically outperformed
the best other ART-based systems when samples were randomly presented. Conversely, they were found
to be statistically equivalent in the offline mode when samples were pre-processed using VAT. Remarkably,
performance comparisons to non-ART-based clustering algorithms show that DDVFA (which learns
incrementally) was also statistically equivalent to the non-incremental (offline) methods of
DBSCAN, single linkage hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), and k-means, while retaining
the appealing properties of ART. Links to the source code and data are provided. Considering the
algorithm's simplicity, online learning capability, and performance, it is an ideal choice for
many agglomerative clustering applications.
