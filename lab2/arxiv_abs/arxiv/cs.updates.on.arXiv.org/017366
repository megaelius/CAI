Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity for the adoption of self-driving
networks. However, network operators or home-network users still do not have the right tools to
exploit these new advancements in AI, since they have to rely on low-level languages to specify network
policies. Intent-based networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level policies that
dictate how the network should behave without worrying how they are translated into configuration
commands in the network devices. However, the existing research proposals for IBN fail to exploit
the knowledge and feedback from the network operator to validate or improve the translation of intents.
In this paper, we introduce a novel intent-refinement process that uses machine learning and feedback
from the operator to translate the operator's utterances into network configurations. Our refinement
process uses a sequence-to-sequence learning model to extract intents from natural language and
the feedback from the operator to improve learning. The key insight of our process is an intermediate
representation that resembles natural language that is suitable to collect feedback from the operator
but is structured enough to facilitate precise translations. Our prototype interacts with a network
operator using natural language and translates the operator input to the intermediate representation
before translating to SDN rules. Our experimental results show that our process achieves a correlation
coefficient squared (i.e., R-squared) of 0.99 for a dataset with 5000 entries and the operator feedback
significantly improves the accuracy of our model.
