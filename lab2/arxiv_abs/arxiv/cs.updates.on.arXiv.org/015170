Background:The electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in medicine
and healthcare. Deep learning methods have achieved promising results on predictive healthcare
tasks using ECG signals. Objective:This paper presents a systematic review of deep learning methods
for ECG data from both modeling and application perspectives. Methods:We extracted papers that
applied deep learning (deep neural network) models to ECG data that were published between Jan.
1st of 2010 and Feb. 29th of 2020 from Google Scholar, PubMed, and the DBLP. We then analyzed each article
according to three factors: tasks, models, and data. Finally, we discuss open challenges and unsolved
problems in this area. Results: The total number of papers extracted was 191. Among these papers,
108 were published after 2019. Different deep learning architectures have been used in various
ECG analytics tasks, such as disease detection/classification, annotation/localization, sleep
staging, biometric human identification, and denoising. Conclusion: The number of works on deep
learning for ECG data has grown explosively in recent years. Such works have achieved accuracy comparable
to that of traditional feature-based approaches and ensembles of multiple approaches can achieve
even better results. Specifically, we found that a hybrid architecture of a convolutional neural
network and recurrent neural network ensemble using expert features yields the best results. However,
there are some new challenges and problems related to interpretability, scalability, and efficiency
that must be addressed. Furthermore, it is also worth investigating new applications from the perspectives
of datasets and methods. Significance: This paper summarizes existing deep learning research
using ECG data from multiple perspectives and highlights existing challenges and problems to identify
potential future research directions.
