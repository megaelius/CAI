Context: Autonomous Systems (ASs) are becoming increasingly pervasive in today's society. One
reason lies in the emergence of sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions that boost
the ability of ASs to self-adapt in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. Companies dealing
with AI models in ASs face several problems, such as users' lack of trust in adverse or unknown conditions,
and gaps between systems engineering and AI model development and evolution in a continuously changing
operational environment. Objective: This vision paper aims to close the gap between the development
and operation of trustworthy AI-based ASs by defining a process that coordinates both activities.
Method: We synthesize the main challenges of AI-based ASs in industrial settings. To overcome such
challenges, we propose a novel, holistic DevOps approach and reflect on the research efforts required
to put it into practice. Results: The approach sets up five critical research directions: (a) a trustworthiness
score to monitor operational AI-based ASs and identify self-adaptation needs in critical situations;
(b) an integrated agile process for the development and continuous evolution of AI models; (c) an
infrastructure for gathering key feedback required to address the trustworthiness of AI models
at operation time; (d) continuous and seamless deployment of different context-specific instances
of AI models in a distributed setting of ASs; and (e) a holistic and effective DevOps-based lifecycle
for AI-based ASs. Conclusions: An approach supporting the continuous delivery of evolving AI models
and their operation in ASs under adverse conditions would support companies in increasing users'
trust in their products.
