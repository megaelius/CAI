With the proliferation of ultra-high-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices,
along with the rise of artificial intelligence, the world is generating exponentially increasing
amounts of data-data that needs to be processed in a fast, efficient and 'smart' way. These developments
are pushing the limits of existing computing paradigms, and highly parallelized, fast and scalable
hardware concepts are becoming progressively more important. Here, we demonstrate a computational
specific integrated photonic tensor core-the optical analog of an ASIC-capable of operating at
Tera-Multiply-Accumulate per second (TMAC/s) speeds. The photonic core achieves parallelized
photonic in-memory computing using phase-change memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical
frequency combs (soliton microcombs). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission
of reconfigurable and non-resonant, i.e. broadband, passive components operating at a bandwidth
exceeding 14 GHz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances
in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates, ultra-low loss silicon nitride
waveguides, and high speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards
full CMOS wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. While we focus on convolution processing,
more generally our results indicate the major potential of integrated photonics for parallel,
fast, efficient and wafer-scale manufacturable computational hardware in demanding AI applications
such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next generation cloud computing services.
