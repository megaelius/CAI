We study the Ordered k-Median problem, in which the solution is evaluated by first sorting the client
connection costs and then multiplying them with a predefined non-increasing weight vector (higher
connection costs are taken with larger weights). Since the 1990s, this problem has been studied
extensively in the discrete optimization and operations research communities and has emerged
as a framework unifying many fundamental clustering and location problems such as k-Median and
k-Center. This generality, however, renders the problem intriguing from the algorithmic perspective
and obtaining non-trivial approximation algorithms was an open problem even for simple topologies
such as trees. Recently, Aouad and Segev were able to obtain an O(log n) approximation algorithm
for Ordered k-Median using a sophisticated local-search approach and the concept of surrogate
models thereby extending the result by Tamir (2001) for the case of a rectangular weight vector,
also known as k-Facility p-Centrum. In this paper, we provide an LP-rounding constant-factor approximation
algorithm for the Ordered k-Median problem. We first provide a new analysis of the rounding process
by Charikar and Li (2012) for k-Median, when applied to a fractional solution obtained from solving
an LP relaxation over a non-metric, truncated cost vector, resulting in an elegant 15-approximation
for the rectangular case. Then, we show that a simple weight bucketing can be applied to the general
case resulting in O(log n) rectangles and hence in a constant-factor approximation in quasi-polynomial
time. Finally, we show that also the clever distance bucketing by Aouad and Segev can be combined
with the objective-oblivious version of our LP-rounding for the rectangular case, and that it results
in a true, polynomial time, constant-factor approximation algorithm.
