Minimizing a convex risk function is the main step in many basic learning algorithms. We study protocols
for convex optimization which provably leak very little about the individual data points that constitute
the loss function. Specifically, we consider differentially private algorithms that operate
in the local model, where each data record is stored on a separate user device and randomization is
performed locally by those devices. We give new protocols for \emph{noninteractive} LDP convex
optimization---i.e., protocols that require only a single randomized report from each user to
an untrusted aggregator. We study our algorithms' performance with respect to expected loss---either
over the data set at hand (empirical risk) or a larger population from which our data set is assumed
to be drawn. Our error bounds depend on the form of individuals' contribution to the expected loss.
For the case of \emph{generalized linear losses} (such as hinge and logistic losses), we give an
LDP algorithm whose sample complexity is only linear in the dimensionality $p$ and quasipolynomial
in other terms (the privacy parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, and the desired excess risk $\alpha$).
This is the first algorithm for nonsmooth losses with sub-exponential dependence on $p$. For the
Euclidean median problem, where the loss is given by the Euclidean distance to a given data point,
we give a protocol whose sample complexity grows quasipolynomially in $p$. This is the first protocol
with sub-exponential dependence on $p$ for a loss that is not a generalized linear loss . Our result
for the hinge loss is based on a technique, dubbed polynomial of inner product approximation, which
may be applicable to other problems. Our results for generalized linear losses and the Euclidean
median are based on new reductions to the case of hinge loss.
