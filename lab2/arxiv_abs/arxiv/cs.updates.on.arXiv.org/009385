The emergence of data-driven demand analysis have led to the increased use of generative modelling
to learn the probabilistic dependencies between random variables. Although their apparent use
has largely been limited to image recognition and classification in recent years, generative machine
learning algorithms can be a powerful tool for travel behaviour research by replicating travel
behaviour by the underlying properties of data structures. In this paper, we examine the use of generative
machine learning approach for analyzing multiple discrete-continuous (MDC) travel behaviour
data. We provide a plausible perspective of how we can exploit the use of machine learning techniques
to interpret the underlying heterogeneities in the data. We show that generative models are conceptually
similar to choice selection behaviour process through information entropy and variational Bayesian
inference. Without loss of generality, we consider a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) based
algorithm with multiple discrete-continuous layer, formulated as a variational Bayesian inference
optimization problem. We systematically describe the proposed machine learning algorithm and
develop a process of analyzing travel behaviour data from a generative learning perspective. We
show parameter stability from model analysis and simulation tests on an open dataset with multiple
discrete-continuous dimensions from a data size of 293,330 observations. For interpretability,
we derive the conditional probabilities, elasticities and perform statistical analysis on the
latent variables. We show that our model can generate statistically similar data distributions
for travel forecasting and prediction and performs better than purely discriminative methods
in validation. Our results indicate that latent constructs in generative models can accurately
represent the joint distribution consistently on MDC data.
