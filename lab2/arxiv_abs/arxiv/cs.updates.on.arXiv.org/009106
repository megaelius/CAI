Non-malleable secret sharing was recently proposed by Goyal and Kumar in independent tampering
and joint tampering models for threshold secret sharing (STOC18) and secret sharing with general
access structure (CRYPTO18). The idea of making secret sharing non-malleable received great attention
and by now has generated many papers exploring new frontiers in this topic, such as multiple-time
tampering and adding leakage resiliency to the one-shot tampering model. Non-compartmentalized
tampering model was first studied by Agrawal et.al (CRYPTO15) for non-malleability against permutation
composed with bit-wise independent tampering, and shown useful in constructing non-malleable
string commitments. We initiate the study of leakage-resilient secret sharing in the non-compartmentalized
model. The leakage adversary can corrupt several players and obtain their shares, as in normal secret
sharing. The leakage adversary can apply arbitrary affine functions with bounded total output
length to the full share vector and obtain the outputs as leakage. These two processes can be both
non-adaptive and do not depend on each other, or both adaptive and depend on each other with arbitrary
ordering. We construct such leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes and achieve constant information
ratio (the scheme for non-adaptive adversary is near optimal). We then explore making the non-compartmentalized
leakage-resilient secret sharing also non-malleable against tampering. We consider a tampering
model, where the adversary can use the shares obtained from the corrupted players and the outputs
of the global leakage functions to choose a tampering function from a tampering family F. We give
two constructions of such leakage-resilient non-malleable secret sharing for the case F is the
bit-wise independent tampering and, respectively, for the case F is the affine tampering functions.
