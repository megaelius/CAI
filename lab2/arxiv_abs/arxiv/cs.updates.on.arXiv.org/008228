Information and communication technologies are permeating all aspects of industrial and manufacturing
systems, expediting the generation of large volumes of industrial data. This article surveys the
recent literature on data management as it applies to networked industrial environments and identifies
several open research challenges for the future. As a first step, we extract important data properties
(volume, variety, traffic, criticality) and identify the corresponding data enabling technologies
of diverse fundamental industrial use cases, based on practical applications. Secondly, we provide
a detailed outline of recent industrial architectural designs with respect to their data management
philosophy (data presence, data coordination, data computation) and the extent of their distributiveness.
Then, we conduct a holistic survey of the recent literature from which we derive a taxonomy of the
latest advances on industrial data enabling technologies and data centric services, spanning
all the way from the field level deep in the physical deployments, up to the cloud and applications
level. Finally, motivated by the rich conclusions of this critical analysis, we identify interesting
open challenges for future research. The concepts presented in this article thematically cover
the largest part of the industrial automation pyramid layers. Our approach is multidisciplinary,
as the selected publications were drawn from two fields; the communications, networking and computation
field as well as the industrial, manufacturing and automation field. The article can help the readers
to deeply understand how data management is currently applied in networked industrial environments,
and select interesting open research opportunities to pursue.
