We address the problem of influence maximization when the social network is accompanied by diffusion
cascades. In prior works, such information is used to compute influence probabilities, which is
utilized by stochastic diffusion models in influence maximization. Motivated by the recent criticism
on the effectiveness of diffusion models as well as the galloping advancements in influence learning,
we propose IMINFECTOR (Influence Maximization with INFluencer vECTORs), a unified approach that
uses representations learned from diffusion cascades to perform model-independent influence
maximization that scales in real-world datasets. The first part of our methodology is a multi-task
neural network that learns embeddings of nodes that initiate cascades (influencer vectors) and
embeddings of nodes that participate in them (susceptible vectors). The norm of an influencer vector
captures the ability of the node to create lengthy cascades and is used to estimate the expected influence
spread and reduce the number of candidate seeds. In addition, the combination of influencer and
susceptible vectors form the diffusion probabilities between nodes. These are used to reformulate
the network as a bipartite graph and propose a greedy solution to influence maximization that retains
the theoretical guarantees.We a pply our method in three sizable networks with diffusion cascades
and evaluate it using cascades from future time steps. IMINFECTOR is able to scale in all of them and
outperforms various competitive algorithms and metrics from the diverse landscape of influence
maximization in terms of efficiency and seed set quality.
