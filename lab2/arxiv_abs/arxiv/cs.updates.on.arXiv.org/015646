Negative reviews, the poor ratings in postpurchase evaluation, play an indispensable role in e-commerce,
especially in shaping future sales and firm equities. However, extant studies seldom examine their
potential value for sellers and producers in enhancing capabilities of providing better services
and products. For those who exploited the helpfulness of reviews in the view of e-commerce keepers,
the ranking approaches were developed for customers instead. To fill this gap, in terms of combining
description texts and emotion polarities, the aim of the ranking method in this study is to provide
the most helpful negative reviews under a certain product attribute for online sellers and producers.
By applying a more reasonable evaluating procedure, experts with related backgrounds are hired
to vote for the ranking approaches. Our ranking method turns out to be more reliable for ranking negative
reviews for sellers and producers, demonstrating a better performance than the baselines like
BM25 with a result of 8% higher. In this paper, we also enrich the previous understandings of emotions
in valuing reviews. Specifically, it is surprisingly found that positive emotions are more helpful
rather than negative emotions in ranking negative reviews. The unexpected strengthening from
positive emotions in ranking suggests that less polarized reviews on negative experience in fact
offer more rational feedbacks and thus more helpfulness to the sellers and producers. The presented
ranking method could provide e-commerce practitioners with an efficient and effective way to leverage
negative reviews from online consumers.
