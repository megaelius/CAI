The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked unprecedented mobilization of scientists, already generating
thousands of new papers that join a litany of previous biomedical work in related areas. This deluge
of information makes it hard for researchers to keep track of their own research area, let alone explore
new directions. Standard search engines are designed primarily for targeted search and are not
geared for discovery or making connections that are not obvious from reading individual papers.
In this paper, we present our ongoing work on SciSight, a novel framework for exploratory search
of COVID-19 research. Based on formative interviews with scientists and a review of existing tools,
we build and integrate two key capabilities: first, exploring interactions between biomedical
facets (e.g., proteins, genes, drugs, diseases, patient characteristics); and second, discovering
groups of researchers and how they are connected. We extract entities using a language model pre-trained
on several biomedical information extraction tasks, and enrich them with data from the Microsoft
Academic Graph (MAG). To find research groups automatically, we use hierarchical clustering with
overlap to allow authors, as they do, to belong to multiple groups. Finally, we introduce a novel
presentation of these groups based on both topical and social affinities, allowing users to drill
down from groups to papers to associations between entities, and update query suggestions on the
fly with the goal of facilitating exploratory navigation. SciSight has thus far served over 10K
users with over 30K page views and 13% returning users. Preliminary user interviews with biomedical
researchers suggest that SciSight complements current approaches and helps find new and relevant
knowledge.
