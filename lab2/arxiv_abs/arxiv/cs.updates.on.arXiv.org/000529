Gossip algorithms spread information by having nodes repeatedly forward information to a few random
contacts. By their very nature, gossip algorithms tend to be distributed and fault tolerant. If
done right, they can also be fast and message-efficient. A common model for gossip communication
is the random phone call model, in which in each synchronous round each node can PUSH or PULL information
to or from a random other node. For example, Karp et al. [FOCS 2000] gave algorithms in this model that
spread a message to all nodes in $\Theta(\log n)$ rounds while sending only $O(\log \log n)$ messages
per node on average. Recently, Avin and Els\"asser [DISC 2013], studied the random phone call model
with the natural and commonly used assumption of direct addressing. Direct addressing allows nodes
to directly contact nodes whose ID (e.g., IP address) was learned before. They show that in this setting,
one can "break the $\log n$ barrier" and achieve a gossip algorithm running in $O(\sqrt{\log n})$
rounds, albeit while using $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ messages per node. We study the same model and give
a simple gossip algorithm which spreads a message in only $O(\log \log n)$ rounds. We also prove a
matching $\Omega(\log \log n)$ lower bound which shows that this running time is best possible.
In particular we show that any gossip algorithm takes with high probability at least $0.99 \log \log
n$ rounds to terminate. Lastly, our algorithm can be tweaked to send only $O(1)$ messages per node
on average with only $O(\log n)$ bits per message. Our algorithm therefore simultaneously achieves
the optimal round-, message-, and bit-complexity for this setting. As all prior gossip algorithms,
our algorithm is also robust against failures. In particular, if in the beginning an oblivious adversary
fails any $F$ nodes our algorithm still, with high probability, informs all but $o(F)$ surviving
nodes.
