The anti-Ramsey numbers are a fundamental notion in graph theory, introduced in 1978, by Erd\" os,
Simonovits and S\' os. For given graphs $G$ and $H$ the anti-Ramsey number $\textrm{ar}(G,H)$ is
defined to be the maximum number $k$ such that there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to the edges
of $G$ in which every copy of $H$ in $G$ has at least two edges with the same color. Usually, combinatorists
study extremal values of anti-Ramsey numbers for various classes of graphs. There are works on computational
complexity of the problem when $H$ is a star. Along this line of research, we study the complexity
of computing the anti-Ramsey number $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$, where $P_k$ is a path of length $k$.
First we observe that when $k$ is close to $n$ the problem is hard; hence, the challenging part is the
computational complexity of the problem when $k$ is a fixed constant. We provide a deep characterization
of the problem for paths of constant length. Our first main contribution is to prove that computing
$\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$ for every integer $k>2$ is NP-hard. We obtain this by providing several structural
properties of such coloring in graphs. We investigate further and show that even approximating
$\textrm{ar}(G,P_3)$ to a factor of $n^{-1/2 - \epsilon}$ is hard already in $3$-partite graphs,
unless $NP{}={}ZPP$. Given the hardness of approximation and parametrization of the problem,
it is natural to study the problem on restricted graph families. Along this line, we first introduce
the notion of color connected coloring, and, employing this structural property, we obtain a linear
time algorithm to compute $\textrm{ar}(G,P_k)$, for every integer $k$, when the host graph, $G$,
is a tree. We have introduced several techniques in our algorithm that we believe might be helpful
in providing approximation algorithms for other restricted families of graphs.
