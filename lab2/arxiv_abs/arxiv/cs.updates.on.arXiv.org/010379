Objective The electrical characteristics of the EEG signals can be used for seizure detection.
Statistical independence between different brain regions is measured by functional brain connectivity
(FBC). Specific directional effects can't consider by FBC and thus effective brain connectivity
(EBC) is used to measure causal intervention between one neuronal region and the rest of the neuronal
regions. Our main purpose is to provide a reliable automatic seizure detection approach. Methods
In this study, three new methods are provided. Deep modular neural network (DMNN) is developed based
on a combination of various EBC classification results in the different frequencies. Another method
is named "modular effective neural networks (MENN)". This method combines the classification
results of the three different EBC in the specific frequency. "Modular frequency neural networks
(MFNN)" is another method that combines the classification results of the specific EBC in the seven
different frequencies. Results The mean accuracy of the MFNN are 97.14%, 98.53%, and 97.91% using
directed transfer function, directed coherence, and generalized partial directed coherence,
respectively. Using the MENN, the highest mean accuracy is 98.34%. Finally, DMNN has the highest
mean accuracy which is equal to 99.43. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is a new method that
provides the high accuracy in comparison to other studies which used MIT-CHB database. Conclusion
and significance The knowledge of structure-function relationships between different areas
of the brain is necessary for characterizing the underlying dynamics. Hence, features based on
EBC can provide a reliable automatic seizure detection approach.
