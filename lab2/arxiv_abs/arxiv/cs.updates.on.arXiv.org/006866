User-generated data is crucial to predictive modeling in many applications. With a web/mobile/wearable
interface, an online service provider (SP) can continuously record user-generated data and depend
on various predictive models learned from the data to improve their services and revenue. SPs owning
a large collection of user-generated data has raised privacy concerns. We present a privacy-preserving
framework, SecureBoost, which allows users to submit encrypted or randomly masked data to SPs that
want to learn predictive models but offload the responsibility of protecting sensitive data. Our
framework utilizes random linear classifiers (RLCs) as the base classifiers in the boosting framework
to simplify the design of the proposed privacy-preserving boosting protocols. A Cryptographic
Service Provider (CSP) is used to assist an SP's processing, reducing the complexity of the protocol
constructions while the leakage of information to the CSP is limited. We present two constructions
of SecureBoost: HE+GC and SecSh+GC, using combinations of homomorphic encryption, garbled circuits,
and random masking to achieve both security and efficiency. For a boosted model, the SP learns only
the base models (i.e., RLCs) and the CSP learns only the weights of the base models. This separated
parameter holding avoids any of the two parties from abusing the final model or conducting model-based
attacks. We have conducted extensive experiments to understand the quality of the RLC-based boosting
and the cost distribution of the constructions. Our results show that SecureBoost can efficiently
learn high-quality boosting models from protected user-generated data.
