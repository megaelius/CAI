Creating scientific publications is a complex process, typically composed of a number of different
activities, such as designing the experiments, data preparation, programming software and writing
and editing the manuscript. The information about the contributions of individual authors of a
paper is important in the context of assessing authors' scientific achievements. Some publications
in biomedical disciplines contain a description of authors' roles in the form of a short section
written in natural language, typically entitled "Authors' contributions". In this paper, we present
an analysis of roles commonly appearing in the content of these sections, and propose an algorithm
for automatic extraction of authors' roles from natural language text in scientific publications.
During the first part of the study, we used clustering techniques, as well as Open Information Extraction
(OpenIE), to semi-automatically discover the most popular roles within a corpus of 2,000 contributions
sections obtained from PubMed Central resources. The roles discovered by our approach include:
experimenting (1,743 instances, 17% of the entire role set within the corpus), analysis (1,343,
16%), study design (1,132, 13%), interpretation (879, 10%), conceptualization (865, 10%), paper
reading (823, 10%), paper writing (724, 8%), paper review (501, 6%), paper drafting (351, 4%), coordination
(319, 4%), data collection (76, 1%), paper review (41, 0.5%) and literature review (41, 0.5%). Discovered
roles were then used to automatically build a training set for the supervised role extractor, based
on Naive Bayes algorithm. According to the evaluation we performed, the proposed role extraction
algorithm is able to extract the roles from the text with precision 0.71, recall 0.49 and F1 0.58.
