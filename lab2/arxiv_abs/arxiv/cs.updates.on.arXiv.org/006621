This paper investigates lung nodule classification by using deep neural networks (DNNs). Hyperparameter
optimization in DNNs is a computationally expensive problem, where evaluating a hyperparameter
configuration may take several hours or even days. Bayesian optimization has been recently introduced
for the automatically searching of optimal hyperparameter configurations of DNNs. It applies
probabilistic surrogate models to approximate the validation error function of hyperparameter
configurations, such as Gaussian processes, and reduce the computational complexity to a large
extent. However, most existing surrogate models adopt stationary covariance functions to measure
the difference between hyperparameter points based on spatial distance without considering its
spatial locations. This distance-based assumption together with the condition of constant smoothness
throughout the whole hyperparameter search space clearly violates the property that the points
far away from optimal points usually get similarly poor performance even though each two of them
have huge spatial distance between them. In this paper, a non-stationary kernel is proposed which
allows the surrogate model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the spatial location
of inputs, and a multi-level convolutional neural network (ML-CNN) is built for lung nodule classification
whose hyperparameter configuration is optimized by using the proposed non-stationary kernel
based Gaussian surrogate model. Our algorithm searches the surrogate for optimal setting via hyperparameter
importance based evolutionary strategy, and the experiments demonstrate our algorithm outperforms
manual tuning and well-established hyperparameter optimization methods such as Random search,
Gaussian processes with stationary kernels, and recently proposed Hyperparameter Optimization
via RBF and Dynamic coordinate search.
