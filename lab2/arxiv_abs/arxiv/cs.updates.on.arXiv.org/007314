While machine learning (ML) methods have received a lot of attention in recent years, these methods
are primarily for prediction. Empirical researchers conducting policy evaluations are, on the
other hand, pre-occupied with causal problems, trying to answer counterfactual questions: what
would have happened in the absence of a policy? Because these counterfactuals can never be directly
observed (described as the "fundamental problem of causal inference") prediction tools from the
ML literature cannot be readily used for causal inference. In the last decade, major innovations
have taken place incorporating supervised ML tools into estimators for causal parameters such
as the average treatment effect (ATE). This holds the promise of attenuating model misspecification
issues, and increasing of transparency in model selection. One particularly mature strand of the
literature include approaches that incorporate supervised ML approaches in the estimation of
the ATE of a binary treatment, under the \textit{unconfoundedness} and positivity assumptions
(also known as exchangeability and overlap assumptions). This article reviews popular supervised
machine learning algorithms, including the Super Learner. Then, some specific uses of machine
learning for treatment effect estimation are introduced and illustrated, namely (1) to create
balance among treated and control groups, (2) to estimate so-called nuisance models (e.g. the propensity
score, or conditional expectations of the outcome) in semi-parametric estimators that target
causal parameters (e.g. targeted maximum likelihood estimation or the double ML estimator), and
(3) the use of machine learning for variable selection in situations with a high number of covariates.
