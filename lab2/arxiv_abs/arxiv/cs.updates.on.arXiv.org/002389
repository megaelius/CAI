Despite the great developments in information technology, particularly the Internet, computer
networks, global information exchange, and its positive impact in all areas of daily life, it has
also contributed to the development of penetration and intrusion which forms a high risk to the security
of information organizations, government agencies, and causes large economic losses. There are
many techniques designed for protection such as firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS).
IDS is a set of software and/or hardware techniques used to detect hacker's activities in computer
systems. Two types of anomalies are used in IDS to detect intrusive activities different from normal
user behavior. Misuse relies on the knowledge base that contains all known attack techniques and
intrusion is discovered through research in this knowledge base. Artificial intelligence techniques
have been introduced to improve the performance of these systems. The importance of IDS is to identify
unauthorized access attempting to compromise confidentiality, integrity or availability of
the computer network. This paper investigates the Intrusion Detection (ID) problem using three
machine learning algorithms namely, BayesNet algorithm, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support
Vector Machine (SVM). The algorithms are applied on a real, Management Information Based (MIB)
dataset that is collected from real life environment. To enhance the detection process accuracy,
a set of feature selection approaches is used; Infogain (IG), ReleifF (RF), and Genetic Search (GS).
Our experiments show that the three feature selection methods have enhanced the classification
performance. GS with bayesNet, MLP and SVM give high accuracy rates, more specifically the BayesNet
with the GS accuracy rate is 99.9%.
