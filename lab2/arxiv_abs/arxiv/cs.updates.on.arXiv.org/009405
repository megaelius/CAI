Knowledge base construction is crucial for summarising, understanding and inferring relationships
between biomedical entities. However, for many practical applications such as drug discovery,
the scarcity of relevant facts (e.g. gene X is therapeutic target for disease Y) severely limits
a domain expert's ability to create a usable knowledge base, either directly or by training a relation
extraction model. In this paper, we present a simple and effective method of extracting new facts
with a pre-specified binary relationship type from the biomedical literature, without requiring
any training data or hand-crafted rules. Our system discovers, ranks and presents the most salient
patterns to domain experts in an interpretable form. By marking patterns as compatible with the
desired relationship type, experts indirectly batch-annotate candidate pairs whose relationship
is expressed with such patterns in the literature. Even with a complete absence of seed data, experts
are able to discover thousands of high-quality pairs with the desired relationship within minutes.
When a small number of relevant pairs do exist - even when their relationship is more general (e.g.
gene X is biologically associated with disease Y) than the relationship of interest - our system
leverages them in order to i) learn a better ranking of the patterns to be annotated or ii) generate
weakly labelled pairs in a fully automated manner. We evaluate our method both intrinsically and
via a downstream knowledge base completion task, and show that it is an effective way of constructing
knowledge bases when few or no relevant facts are already available.
