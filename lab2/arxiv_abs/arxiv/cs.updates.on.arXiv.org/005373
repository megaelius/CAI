Even though many point processes have been scrutinized to describe the unique features of emerging
wireless networks, the performance of vehicular networks have been largely assessed using mostly
the Poisson Point Process (PPP) to model the locations of vehicles along a road. The PPP is not always
a realistic model, because it does not account for the physical dimensions of vehicles, and it does
not capture the fact that a driver maintains a safety distance from the vehicle ahead. In this paper,
we model the inter-vehicle distance equal to the sum of two components: A constant hardcore headway
distance, and a random distance following the exponential distribution. We would like to investigate
whether a PPP for the locations of interfering vehicles can be used to describe adequately the performance
of a link at the origin under the new deployment model. Unfortunately, the probability generating
functional (PGFL) of the hardcore point process is unknown. In order to approximate the Laplace
transform of interference, we devise simple approximations for the variance and the skewness of
interference, and we select suitable probability functions to approximate the interference distribution.
It turns out that the PPP (of equal intensity) gives a lower bound for the outage probability under
the hardcore point process. When the coefficient of variation and the skewness of interference
are high, the bound may become loose at the upper tail. Relevant scenarios are associated with urban
street microcells and highway macrocells with low intensity of vehicles. We also show that the performance
predictions using the PPP deteriorate with multi-antenna maximum ratio combining receiver and
temporal performance indicators related to the performance of retransmission schemes. Our approximations
generate good performance predictions in all considered cases.
