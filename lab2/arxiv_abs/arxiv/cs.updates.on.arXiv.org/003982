This paper presents a modular, extensible and highly efficient open source framework for registration
based tracking called Modular Tracking Framework (MTF). Targeted at robotics applications, it
is implemented entirely in C++ and designed from the ground up to easily integrate with systems that
support any of several major vision and robotics libraries including OpenCV, ROS, ViSP and Eigen.
It implements more methods, is faster, and more precise than other existing systems. Further, the
theoretical basis for its design is a new way to conceptualize registration based trackers that
decomposes them into three constituent sub modules - Search Method (SM), Appearance Model (AM)
and State Space Model (SSM). In the process, we integrate many important advances published after
Baker \& Matthews' landmark work in 2004. In addition to being a practical solution for fast and high
precision tracking, MTF can also serve as a useful research tool by allowing existing and new methods
for any of the sub modules to be studied better. When a new method is introduced for one of these, the
breakdown can help to experimentally find the combination of methods for the others that is optimum
for it. By extensive use of generic programming, MTF makes it easy to plug in a new method for any of
the sub modules so that it can not only be tested comprehensively with existing methods but also become
immediately available for deployment in any project that uses the framework. With 16 AMs, 11 SMs
and 13 SSMs implemented already, MTF provides over 2000 distinct single layer trackers. It also
allows two or more of these to be combined together in several ways to create a practically unlimited
variety of novel multi layer trackers.
