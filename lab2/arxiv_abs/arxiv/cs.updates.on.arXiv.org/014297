In the context of QoE management, network and service providers commonly rely on models that map
system QoS conditions (e.g., system response time, paket loss, etc.) to estimated end user QoE values.
Observable QoS conditions in the system may be assumed to follow a certain distribution, meaning
that different end users will experience different conditions. On the other hand, drawing from
the results of subjective user studies, we know that user diversity leads to distributions of user
scores for any given test conditions (in this case referring to the QoS parameters of interest).
Our previous studies have shown that to correctly derive various QoE metrics (e.g., Mean Opinion
Score (MOS), quantiles, probability of users rating "good or better", etc.) in a system under given
conditions, there is a need to consider rating distributions obtained from user studies, which
are often times not available. In this paper we extend these findings to show how to approximate user
rating distributions given a QoS-to-MOS mapping function and second order statistics. Such a user
rating distribution may then be combined with a QoS distribution observed in a system to finally
derive corresponding distributions of QoE scores. We provide two examples to illustrate this process:
1) analytical results using a Web QoE model relating waiting times to QoE, and 2) numerical results
using measurements relating packet losses to video stall pattern, which are in turn mapped to QoE
estimates. The results in this paper provide a solution to the problem of understanding the QoE distribution
in a system, in cases where the necessary data is not directly available in the form of models going
beyond the MOS, or where the full details of subjective experiments are not available.
