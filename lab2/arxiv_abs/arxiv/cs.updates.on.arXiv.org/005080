The wide availability of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronics that can withstand Low Earth
Orbit conditions has opened avenue for wide deployment of CubeSats and small-satellites. CubeSats
thanks to their low developmental and launch costs offer new opportunities for rapidly demonstrating
on-orbit surveillance capabilities. In our earlier work, we proposed development of SWIMSat (Space
based Wide-angle Imaging of Meteors) a 3U CubeSat demonstrator that is designed to observe illuminated
objects entering the Earth's atmosphere. The spacecraft would operate autonomously using a smart
camera with vision algorithms to detect, track and report of objects. Several CubeSats can track
an object in a coordinated fashion to pinpoint an object's trajectory. An extension of this smart
camera capability is to track unilluminated objects utilizing capabilities we have been developing
to track and navigate to Near Earth Objects (NEOs). This extension enables detecting and tracking
objects that can't readily be detected by humans. The system maintains a dense star map of the night
sky and performs round the clock observations. Standard optical flow algorithms are used to obtain
trajectories of all moving objects in the camera field of view. Through a process of elimination,
certain stars maybe occluded by a transiting unilluminated object which is then used to first detect
and obtain a trajectory of the object. Using multiple cameras observing the event from different
points of view, it may be possible then to triangulate the position of the object in space and obtain
its orbital trajectory. In this work, the performance of our space object detection algorithm coupled
with a spacecraft guidance, navigation, and control system is demonstrated.
