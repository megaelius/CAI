Abstract. Intra-voxel models of the diffusion signal are essential for interpreting organization
of the tissue environment at micrometer level with data at millimeter resolution. Recent advances
in data driven methods have enabled direct compari-son and optimization of methods for in-vivo
data with externally validated histological sections with both 2-D and 3-D histology. Yet, all
existing methods make limiting assumptions of either (1) model-based linkages between b-values
or (2) limited associations with single shell data. We generalize prior deep learning models that
used single shell spherical harmonic transforms to integrate the re-cently developed simple harmonic
oscillator reconstruction (SHORE) basis. To enable learning on the SHORE manifold, we present
an alternative formulation of the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) object using the SHORE
basis while rep-resenting the observed diffusion weighted data in the SHORE basis. To ensure consistency
of hyper-parameter optimization for SHORE, we present our Deep SHORE approach to learn on a data-optimized
manifold. Deep SHORE is evalu-ated with eight-fold cross-validation of a preclinical MRI-histology
data with four b-values. Generalizability of in-vivo human data is evaluated on two separate 3T
MRI scanners. Specificity in terms of angular correlation (ACC) with the preclinical data improved
on single shell: 0.78 relative to 0.73 and 0.73, multi-shell: 0.80 relative to 0.74 (p < 0.001). In
the in-vivo human data, Deep SHORE was more consistent across scanners with 0.63 relative to other
multi-shell methods 0.39, 0.52 and 0.57 in terms of ACC. In conclusion, Deep SHORE is a promising
method to enable data driven learning with DW-MRI under conditions with varying b-values, number
of diffusion shells, and gradient directions per shell.
