This chapter provides insight on how iris recognition, one of the leading biometric identification
technologies in the world, can be impacted by pathologies and illnesses present in the eye, what
are the possible repercussions of this influence, and what are the possible means for taking such
effects into account when matching iris samples. To make this study possible, a special database
of iris images has been used, representing more than 20 different medical conditions of the ocular
region (including cataract, glaucoma, rubeosis iridis, synechiae, iris defects, corneal pathologies
and other) and containing almost 3000 samples collected from 230 distinct irises. Then, with the
use of four different iris recognition methods, a series of experiments has been conducted, concluding
in several important observations. One of the most popular ocular disorders worldwide - the cataract
- is shown to worsen genuine comparison scores when results obtained from cataract-affected eyes
are compared to those coming from healthy irises. An analysis devoted to different types of impact
on eye structures caused by diseases is also carried out with significant results. The enrollment
process is highly sensitive to those eye conditions that make the iris obstructed or introduce geometrical
distortions. Disorders affecting iris geometry, or producing obstructions are exceptionally
capable of degrading the genuine comparison scores, so that the performance of the entire biometric
system can be influenced. Experiments also reveal that imperfect execution of the image segmentation
stage is the most prominent contributor to recognition errors.
