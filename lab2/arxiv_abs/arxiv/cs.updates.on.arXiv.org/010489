We aim at investigating the solvability/insolvability of nondeterministic logarithmic-space
(NL) decision, search, and optimization problems parameterized by size parameters using simultaneously
polynomial time and sub-linear space on multi-tape deterministic Turing machines. We are particularly
focused on a special NL-complete problem, 2SAT---the 2CNF Boolean formula satisfiability problem---parameterized
by the number of Boolean variables. It is shown that 2SAT with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses can be
solved simultaneously polynomial time and $(n/2^{c\sqrt{\log{n}}})\, polylog(m+n)$ space
for an absolute constant $c>0$. This fact inspires us to propose a new, practical working hypothesis,
called the linear space hypothesis (LSH), which states that 2SAT$_3$---a restricted variant of
2SAT in which each variable of a given 2CNF formula appears at most 3 times in the form of literals---cannot
be solved simultaneously in polynomial time using strictly "sub-linear" (i.e., $m(x)^{\varepsilon}\,
polylog(|x|)$ for a certain constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$) space on all instances $x$. An immediate
consequence of this working hypothesis is $\mathrm{L}\neq\mathrm{NL}$. Moreover, we use our
hypothesis as a plausible basis to lead to the insolvability of various NL search problems as well
as the nonapproximability of NL optimization problems. For our investigation, since standard
logarithmic-space reductions may no longer preserve polynomial-time sub-linear-space complexity,
we need to introduce a new, practical notion of "short reduction." It turns out that, parameterized
with the number of variables, $\overline{\mathrm{2SAT}_3}$ is complete for a syntactically restricted
version of NL, called Syntactic NL$_{\omega}$, under such short reductions. This fact supports
the legitimacy of our working hypothesis.
