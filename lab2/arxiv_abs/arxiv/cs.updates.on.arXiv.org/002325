Layout camouflaging (LC) is a promising technique to protect chip design intellectual property
(IP) from reverse engineers. Most prior art, however, cannot leverage the full potential of LC due
to excessive overheads and/or their limited scope on an FEOL-centric and accordingly customized
manufacturing process. If at all, most existing techniques can be reasonably applied only to selected
parts of a chip---we argue that such "small-scale or custom camouflaging" will eventually be circumvented,
irrespective of the underlying technique. In this work, we propose a novel LC scheme which is low-cost
and generic---full-chip LC can finally be realized without any reservation. Our scheme is based
on obfuscating the interconnects (BEOL); it can be readily applied to any design without modifications
in the device layer (FEOL). Applied with split manufacturing in conjunction, our approach is the
first in the literature to cope with both the FEOL fab and the end-user being untrustworthy. We implement
and evaluate our primitives at the (DRC-clean) layout level; our scheme incurs significantly lower
cost than most of the previous works. When comparing fully camouflaged to original layouts (i.e.,
for 100% LC), we observe on average power, performance, and area overheads of 12%, 30%, and 48%, respectively.
Here we also show empirically that most existing LC techniques (as well as ours) can only provide
proper resilience against powerful SAT attacks once at least 50% of the layout is camouflaged---only
large-scale LC is practically secure. As indicated, our approach can deliver even 100% LC at acceptable
cost. Finally, we also make our flow publicly available, enabling the community to protect their
sensitive designs.
