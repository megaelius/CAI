A novel framework for resolving discontinuous solutions of conservation laws, e.g., contact lines,
shock waves, and interfaces, using implicit tracking and a high-order discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) discretization was introduced in [38]. Central to the framework is an optimization problem
whose solution is a discontinuity-aligned mesh and the corresponding high-order approximation
to the flow that does not require explicit meshing of the unknown discontinuity surface. The method
was shown to deliver highly accurate solutions on coarse, high-order discretizations without
nonlinear stabilization and recover optimal convergence rates even for problems with discontinuous
solutions. This work extends the implicit tracking framework such that robustness is improved
and convergence accelerated. In particular, we introduce an improved formulation of the central
optimization problem and an associated sequential quadratic programming (SQP) solver. The new
error-based objective function penalizes violation of the DG residual in an enriched test space
and is shown to have excellent tracking properties. The SQP solver simultaneously converges the
nodal coordinates of the mesh and DG solution to their optimal values and is equipped with a number
of features to ensure robust, fast convergence: Levenberg-Marquardt approximation of the Hessian
with weighted elliptic regularization, backtracking line search, and rigorous convergence criteria.
We use the proposed method to solve a range of inviscid conservation laws of varying difficulty.
We show the method is able to deliver accurate solutions on coarse, high-order meshes and the SQP
solver is robust and usually able to drive the first-order optimality system to tight tolerances.
