In this paper, we investigate the performance of energy detection-based spectrum sensing over
F composite fading channels. To this end, an analytical expression for the average detection probability
is firstly derived. This expression is then extended to account for collaborative spectrum sensing,
square-law selection diversity reception and noise power uncertainty. The corresponding receiver
operating characteristics (ROC) are analyzed for different conditions of the average signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), noise power uncertainty, time-bandwidth product, multipath fading, shadowing,
number of diversity branches and number of collaborating users. It is shown that the energy detection
performance is sensitive to the severity of the multipath fading and amount of shadowing, whereby
even small variations in either of these physical phenomena can significantly impact the detection
probability. As a figure of merit to evaluate the detection performance, the area under the ROC curve
(AUC) is derived and evaluated for different multipath fading and shadowing conditions. Closed-form
expressions for the Shannon entropy and cross entropy are also formulated and assessed for different
average SNR, multipath fading and shadowing conditions. Then the relationship between the Shannon
entropy and ROC/AUC is examined where it is found that the average number of bits required for encoding
a signal becomes small (i.e., low Shannon entropy) when the detection probability is high or when
the AUC is large. The difference between composite and traditional small-scale fading is emphasized
by comparing the cross entropy for Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading. A validation of the analytical
results is provided through a careful comparison with the results of some simulations.
