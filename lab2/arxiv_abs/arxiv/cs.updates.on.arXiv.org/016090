Computer users are generally faced with difficulties in making correct security decisions. While
an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online
sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge
more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts can provide insights into the trending topics
and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn
can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing
different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by persisting the security
knowledge gained from different cybersecurity context. Prior studies neither systematically
analysed the wide-range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending
topics from recent security texts. Although LDA has been widely adopted in topic generation, its
generated topics cannot cover the cybersecurity concepts completely and considerably overlap.
To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive
security categories instead of LDA-generated topics. We further compare the identified 16 security
categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several
surprising findings. (1) The impact reflected from cyber-security texts strongly correlates
with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes. (2) For most categories, security blogs share the
largest popularity and largest absolute/relative impact over time. (3) Websites deliver security
information without caring about timeliness much, where one third of the articles do not specify
the date and the rest have a time lag in posting emerging security issues.
