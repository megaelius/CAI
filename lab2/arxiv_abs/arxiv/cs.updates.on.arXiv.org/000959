The construction and formal verification of dynamical models is important in engineering, biology
and other disciplines. We focus on non-linear models containing a set of parameters governing their
dynamics. The value of these parameters is often unknown and not directly observable through measurements,
which are themselves noisy. When treating parameters as random variables, one can constrain their
distribution by conditioning on observations and thereby constructing a posterior probability
distribution. We aim to perform model verification with respect to this posterior. The main difficulty
in performing verification on a model under the posterior distribution is that in general, it is
difficult to obtain \emph{independent} samples from the posterior, especially for non-linear
dynamical models. Standard statistical model checking methods require independent realizations
of the system and are therefore not applicable in this context. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo
based statistical model checking framework, which produces a sequence of dependent random realizations
of the model dynamics over the parameter posterior. Using this sequence of samples, we use statistical
hypothesis tests to verify whether the model satisfies a bounded temporal logic property with a
certain probability. We use sample size bounds tailored to the setting of dependent samples for
fixed sample size and sequential tests. We apply our method to a case-study from the domain of systems
biology, to a model of the JAK-STAT biochemical pathway. The pathway is modeled as a system of non-linear
ODEs containing a set of unknown parameters. Noisy, indirect observations of the system state are
available from an experiment. The results show that the proposed method enables probabilistic
verification with respect to the parameter posterior with specified error bounds.
