A recitation is a way of combining the words together so that they have a sense of rhythm and thus an
emotional content is imbibed within. In this study we envisaged to answer these questions in a scientific
manner taking into consideration 5 (five) well known Bengali recitations of different poets conveying
a variety of moods ranging from joy to sorrow. The clips were recited as well as read (in the form of
flat speech without any rhythm) by the same person to avoid any perceptual difference arising out
of timbre variation. Next, the emotional content from the 5 recitations were standardized with
the help of listening test conducted on a pool of 50 participants. The recitations as well as the speech
were analyzed with the help of a latest non linear technique called Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
(DFA) that gives a scaling exponent {\alpha}, which is essentially the measure of long range correlations
present in the signal. Similar pieces (the parts which have the exact lyrical content in speech as
well as in the recital) were extracted from the complete signal and analyzed with the help of DFA technique.
Our analysis shows that the scaling exponent for all parts of recitation were much higher in general
as compared to their counterparts in speech. We have also established a critical value from our analysis,
above which a mere speech may become a recitation. The case may be similar to the conventional phase
transition, wherein the measurement of external condition at which the transformation occurs
(generally temperature) is called phase transition. Further, we have also categorized the 5 recitations
on the basis of their emotional content with the help of the same DFA technique. Analysis with a greater
variety of recitations is being carried out to yield more interesting results.
