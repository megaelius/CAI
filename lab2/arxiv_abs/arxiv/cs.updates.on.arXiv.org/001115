To provide the possibility of developing objective image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms
for THz security images, we constructed the THz security image database (THSID) including a total
of 181 THz security images with the resolution of 127*380. The main distortion types in THz security
images were first analyzed for the design of subjective evaluation criteria to acquire the mean
opinion scores. Subsequently, the existing no-reference IQA algorithms, which were 5 opinion-aware
approaches viz., NFERM, GMLF, DIIVINE, BRISQUE and BLIINDS2, and 8 opinion-unaware approaches
viz., QAC, SISBLIM, NIQE, FISBLIM, CPBD, S3 and Fish_bb, were executed for the evaluation of the
THz security image quality. The statistical results demonstrated the superiority of Fish_bb over
the other testing IQA approaches for assessing the THz image quality with PLCC (SROCC) values of
0.8925 (-0.8706), and with RMSE value of 0.3993. The linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman
plot further verified that the Fish__bb could substitute for the subjective IQA. Nonetheless,
for the classification of THz security images, we tended to use S3 as a criterion for ranking THz security
image grades because of the relatively low false positive rate in classifying bad THz image quality
into acceptable category (24.69%). Interestingly, due to the specific property of THz image, the
average pixel intensity gave the best performance than the above complicated IQA algorithms, with
the PLCC, SROCC and RMSE of 0.9001, -0.8800 and 0.3857, respectively. This study will help the users
such as researchers or security staffs to obtain the THz security images of good quality. Currently,
our research group is attempting to make this research more comprehensive.
