Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly being adopted into practical applications such as security
systems, smart infrastructure, traffic management, weather systems, among others. While the
scale of these applications is enormous, device capabilities, particularly in terms of battery
life and energy efficiency are limited. Despite research being done to ameliorate these shortcomings,
wireless IoT networks still cannot guarantee satisfactory network lifetimes and prolonged sensing
coverage. Moreover, proposed schemes in literature are convoluted and cannot be easily implemented
in real-world scenarios. This necessitates the development of a simple yet energy efficient routing
scheme for wireless IoT sensor networks. This paper models the energy constraint problem of devices
in IoT applications as an optimization problem. To conserve the energy of device nodes, the routing
protocol first aggregates devices into clusters based on a number of different features such as
distance from base station, data/message length and data sensed from the environment in the current
epoch. Then, a cluster head is elected for each cluster and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is generated
with all the cluster heads as nodes. Edges represent communication intent from transmitter to receiver
and the edge weights are computed using a formulated equation. The minimum cost path to the base station
is computed to allow for efficient real-time routing. Sleep scheduling is also optionally used
to further boost network energy efficiency. The proposed routing protocol has been simulated and
outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of metrics such as number of active nodes, energy
dynamics and network coverage.
