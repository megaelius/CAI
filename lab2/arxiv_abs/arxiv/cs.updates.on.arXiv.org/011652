In this study, an automated three dimensional (3D) deep segmentation approach for detecting gliomas
in 3D pre-operative MRI scans is proposed. Then, a classi-fication algorithm based on random forests,
for survival prediction is presented. The objective is to segment the glioma area and produce segmentation
labels for its different sub-regions, i.e. necrotic and the non-enhancing tumor core, the peri-tumoral
edema, and enhancing tumor. The proposed deep architecture for the segmentation task encompasses
two parallel streamlines with two different reso-lutions. One deep convolutional neural network
is to learn local features of the input data while the other one is set to have a global observation
on whole image. Deemed to be complementary, the outputs of each stream are then merged to pro-vide
an ensemble complete learning of the input image. The proposed network takes the whole image as input
instead of patch-based approaches in order to con-sider the semantic features throughout the whole
volume. The algorithm is trained on BraTS 2019 which included 335 training cases, and validated
on 127 unseen cases from the validation dataset using a blind testing approach. The proposed method
was also evaluated on the BraTS 2019 challenge test dataset of 166 cases. The results show that the
proposed methods provide promising segmentations as well as survival prediction. The mean Dice
overlap measures of automatic brain tumor segmentation for validation set were 0.84, 0.74 and 0.71
for the whole tu-mor, core and enhancing tumor, respectively. The corresponding results for the
challenge test dataset were 0.82, 0.72, and 0.70, respectively. The overall accura-cy of the proposed
model for the survival prediction task is %52 for the valida-tion and %49 for the test dataset.
