Conjunctive query (CQ) evaluation is NP-complete, but becomes tractable for fragments of bounded
hypertreewidth. Approximating a hard CQ by a query from such a fragment can thus allow for an efficient
approximate evaluation. While underapproximations (i.e., approximations that return correct
answers only) are well-understood, the dual notion of overapproximations (i.e, approximations
that return complete - but not necessarily sound - answers), and also a more general notion of approximation
based on the symmetric difference of query results, are almost unexplored. In fact, the decidability
of the basic problems of evaluation, identification, and existence of those approximations has
been open. This article establishes a connection between overapproximations and existential
pebble games that allows for studying such problems systematically. Building on this connection,
it is shown that the evaluation and identification problem for overapproximations can be solved
in polynomial time. While the general existence problem remains open, the problem is shown to be
decidable in 2EXPTIME over the class of acyclic CQs and in PTIME for Boolean CQs over binary schemata.
Additionally we propose a more liberal notion of overapproximations to remedy the known shortcoming
that queries might not have an overapproximation, and study how queries can be overapproximated
in the presence of tuple generating and equality generating dependencies. The techniques are then
extended to symmetric difference approximations and used to provide several complexity results
for the identification, existence, and evaluation problem for this type of approximations.
