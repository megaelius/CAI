The adversarial model presented by trusted execution environments (TEEs) has prompted researchers
to investigate unusual attack vectors. One particularly powerful class of controlled-channel
attacks abuses page-table modifications to reliably track enclave memory accesses at a page-level
granularity. Crucially, in contrast to noisy microarchitectural timing leakages, this line of
deterministic controlled-channel attacks abuses indispensable architectural interfaces and
hence cannot be mitigated by tweaking microarchitectural resources. We propose an innovative
controlled-channel attack, named CopyCat, that deterministically counts the number of instructions
executed within a single enclave code page. We show that combining the instruction counts harvested
by CopyCat with traditional, coarse-grained page-level leakage allows to accurately reconstruct
enclave control flow at a maximal instruction-level granularity. CopyCat can identify intra-page
and intra-cache line branch decisions which may ultimately differ only in a single instruction,
highlighting that even extremely subtle control flow deviations can deterministically be leaked
from secure enclaves. We demonstrate the improved resolution and practicality of CopyCat on Intel
SGX platforms in an extensive study of single-trace and deterministic attacks against side-channel
hardened cryptographic libraries. As a result, we disclose multiple vulnerabilities in the the
latest version of widely-used cryptographic libraries: WolfSSL, Libgcrypt and OpenSSL, and propose
novel algorithmic attacks to perform single-trace key extraction. Our findings mark the importance
of stricter verification of cryptographic implementations, especially in the context of TEEs.
