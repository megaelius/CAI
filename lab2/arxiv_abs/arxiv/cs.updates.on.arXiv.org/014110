Modern product design in the engineering domain is increasingly driven by computational analysis
including finite-element based simulation, computational optimization, and modern data analysis
techniques such as machine learning. To apply these methods, suitable data representations for
components under development as well as for related design criteria have to be found. While a component's
geometry is typically represented by a polygon surface mesh, it is often not clear how to parametrize
critical design properties in order to enable efficient computational analysis. In the present
work, we propose a novel methodology to obtain a parameterization of a component's plastic deformation
behavior under stress, which is an important design criterion in many application domains, for
example, when optimizing the crash behavior in the automotive context. Existing parameterizations
limit computational analysis to relatively simple deformations and typically require extensive
input by an expert, making the design process time intensive and costly. Hence, we propose a way to
derive a compact descriptor of deformation behavior that is based on spectral mesh processing and
enables a low-dimensional representation of also complex deformations.We demonstrate the descriptor's
ability to represent relevant deformation behavior by applying it in a nearest-neighbor search
to identify similar simulation results in a filtering task. The proposed descriptor provides a
novel approach to the parametrization of geometric deformation behavior and enables the use of
state-of-the-art data analysis techniques such as machine learning to engineering tasks concerned
with plastic deformation behavior.
