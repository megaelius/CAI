Multiple random walks are the movement of several independent random walkers on a graph, and are
applied to various graph algorithms. In order to design an efficient graph algorithm based on multiple
random walks, it is essential to study multiple random walks theoretically for deeply understanding
their characteristics. The first meeting time is one of the important metrics for the multiple random
walks. The first meeting time on a graph is defined by the time it takes for multiple random walkers
to meet at the same node in graph. The first meeting time is closely related to the rendezvous problem,
which is are a fundamental problem in the field of computer science. In previous works, the first
meeting time of multiple random walks has been analyzed. However, many of these previous works focus
on regular graphs. In this paper, we analyze the first meeting time of multiple random walks in arbitrary
graphs, and clarify the effect of graph structures on its expected value. First, we derive the spectral
formula of the expected first meeting time on the basis of the spectral graph theory. Then, we examine
the principal component of the expected first meeting time using the derived spectral formula.
The clarified principal component reveals that (a)the expected first meeting time is almost dominated
by $n/(1+d_{\rm std}^2/d_{\rm avg}^2)$ and (b)the expected first meeting time is independent
of the starting nodes of random walkers where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. $d_{\rm avg}$
and $d_{\rm std}$ are the mean and the standard deviation of weighted node degrees, respectively.
The characteristics (a) is useful to understand the effect of the graph structure on the first meeting
time. According to the revealed effect of graph structures, the variance of coefficient $d_{\rm
std}/d_{\rm avg}$(degree heterogeneity) for weighted degrees facilitates quicker the meeting
of random walkers.
