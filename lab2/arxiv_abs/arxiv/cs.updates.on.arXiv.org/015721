The global pandemic of COVID-19 has infected millions of people since its first outbreak in last
December. A key challenge for preventing and controlling COVID-19 is how to quickly, widely, and
effectively implement the test for the disease, because testing is the first step to break the chains
of transmission. To assist the diagnosis of the disease, radiology imaging is used to complement
the screening process and triage patients into different risk levels. Deep learning methods have
taken a more active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images, as witnessed
in many recent works. Most of these works first train a CNN on an existing large-scale chest x-ray
image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much smaller scale. However, direct
transfer across datasets from different domains may lead to poor performance due to visual domain
shift. Also, the small scale of the COVID-19 dataset on the target domain can make the training fall
into the overfitting trap. To solve all these crucial problems and fully exploit the available large-scale
chest x-ray image dataset, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification
in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting, through which we are motivated to reduce
the domain shift and avoid overfitting when training on a very small dataset of COVID-19. In addressing
this formulated problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network
(SODA), which is able to align the data distributions across different domains in a general domain
space and also in a common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a
leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models, as well as
effectively separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.
