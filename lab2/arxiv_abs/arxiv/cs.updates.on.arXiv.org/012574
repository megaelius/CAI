Many important multi-component crystalline solids undergo mechanochemical spinodal decomposition:
a phase transformation in which the compositional redistribution is coupled with structural changes
of the crystal, resulting in dynamic and intricate microstructures. The ability to rapidly compute
the macroscopic behavior based on these detailed microstructures is of paramount importance for
accelerating material discovery and design. However, the evaluation of macroscopic, nonlinear
elastic properties purely based on direct numerical simulations (DNS) is computationally very
expensive, and hence impractical for material design when a large number of microstructures need
to be tested. A further complexity of a hierarchical nature arises if the elastic free energy and
its variation with strain is a small scale fluctuation on the dominant trajectory of the total free
energy driven by microstructural dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a data-driven
approach, which combines advanced neural network (NN) models with DNS to predict the mechanical
free energy and homogenized stress fields on microstructures in a family of two-dimensional multi-component
crystalline solids. The microstructres are numerically generated by solving a coupled, Cahn-Hilliard
and nonlinear strain gradient elasticity problem. The hierarchical structure of the free energy's
evolution induces a multi-resolution character to the machine learning paradigm: We construct
knowledge-based neural networks (KBNNs) with either pre-trained fully connected deep neural
networks (DNNs) or pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that describe the dominant
feature of the data to fully represent the hierarchichally evolving free energy. We demonstrate
multi-resolution learning of the materials physics of nonlinear elastic response for both fixed
and evolving microstructures.
