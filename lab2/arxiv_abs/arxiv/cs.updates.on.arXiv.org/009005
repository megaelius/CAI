A Coordination Blockchain is a blockchain with the task of coordinating activities of multiple
private blockchains. This paper discusses the pros and cons of using Ethereum MainNet, the public
Ethereum blockchain, as a Coordination Blockchain. The requirements Ethereum MainNet needs to
fulfil to perform this role are discussed within the context of Ethereum Private Sidechains, a private
blockchain technology which allows many blockchains to be operated in parallel, and allows atomic
crosschain transactions to execute across blockchains. Ethereum MainNet is a permissionless
network which aims to offer strong authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation properties,
that incentivises good behaviour using crypto economics. This paper demonstrates that Ethereum
MainNet does deliver these properties. It then provides a comprehensive review of the features
of Ethereum Private Sidechains, with a focus on the potential usage of Coordination Blockchains
for these features. Finally, the merits of using Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain
are assessed. For Ethereum Private Sidechains, we found that Ethereum MainNet is best suited to
storing long term static data that needs to be widely available, such as the Ethereum Registration
Authority information. However, due to Ethereum MainNet's probabilistic finality, it is not well
suited to information that needs to be available and acted upon immediately, such as the Sidechain
Public Keys and Atomic Crosschain Transaction state information that need to be accessible prior
to the first atomic crosschain transaction being issued on a sidechain. Although this paper examined
the use of Ethereum MainNet as a Coordination Blockchain within reference to Ethereum Private Sidechains,
the discussions and observations of the typical tasks a Coordination blockchain may be expected
to perform are applicable more widely to any multi-blockchain system.
