This article proposes a general approach to the simulation and design of a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) network on the basis of cross-bar arrays of metal-oxide memristive devices. The proposed
approach uses the ANNM theory, tolerance theory, simulation methodology and experiment design.
The tolerances analysis and synthesis process is performed for the ANNM hardware implementation
on the basis of two arrays of memristive microdevices in the original 16x16 cross-bar topology being
a component of bidirectional adaptive neural interface for automatic registration and stimulation
of bioelectrical activity of a living neuronal culture used in robotics control system. The ANNM
is trained for solving a nonlinear classification problem of stable information characteristics
registered in the culture grown on a multi-electrode array. Memristive devices are fabricated
on the basis of a newly engineered Au/Ta/ZrO2(Y)/Ta2O5/TiN/Ti multilayer structure, which contains
self-organized interface oxide layers, nanocrystals and is specially developed to obtain robust
resistive switching with low variation of parameters. An array of memristive devices is mounted
into a standard metal-ceramic package and can be easily integrated into the neurointerface circuit.
Memristive devices demonstrate bipolar switching of anionic type between the high-resistance
state and low-resistance state and can be programmed to set the intermediate resistive states with
a desired accuracy. The ANNM tuning, testing and control are implemented by the FPGA-based control
subsystem. All developed models and algorithms are implemented as Python-based software.
