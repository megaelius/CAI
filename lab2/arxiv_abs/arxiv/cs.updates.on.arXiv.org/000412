Internet of Things (IoT) grows quickly, and 50 billion of IoT devices will be interconnected by 2020.
For the huge number of IoT devices, a high scalable discovery architecture is required to provide
autonomous registration and look-up of IoT resources and services. The architecture should enable
dynamic updates when new IoT devices are incorporated into Internet, and changes are made to the
existing ones. Nowadays in Internet, the most used discovery architecture is the Domain Name System
(DNS). DNS offers a scalable solution through two distributed mechanisms: multicast DNS (mDNS)
and DNS Service Directory (DNS-SD). Both mechanisms have been applied to discover resources and
services in local IoT domains. However, a full architecture has not still been designed to support
global discovery, local directories and a search engine for ubiquitous IoT domains. Moreover,
the architecture should provide other transversal functionalities such as a common semantic for
describing services and resources, and a service layer for interconnecting with M2M platforms
and mobile clients. This paper presents an oriented-service architecture based on DNS to support
a global discovery, local directories and a distributed search engine to enable a scalable looking-up
of IoT resources and services. The architecture provides two lightweight discovery mechanisms
based on mDNS and DNS-SD that have been optimized for the constraints of IoT devices to allow autonomous
registration. Moreover, we analyse and provide other relevant elements such semantic description
and communications interfaces to support the heterogeneity of IoT devices and clients. All these
elements contribute to build a scalable architecture for the discovery and access of heterogeneous
and ubiquitous IoT domains.
