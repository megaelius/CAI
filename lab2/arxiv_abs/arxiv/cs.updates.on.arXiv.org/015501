A connected component of a vertex-coloured graph is said to be colourful if all its vertices have
different colours. By extension, a graph is colourful if all its connected components are colourful.
Given a vertex-coloured graph and an integer $p$, the Colourful Components problem asks whether
there exist at most $p$ edges whose removal makes the graph colourful, and the Colourful Partition
problem asks whether there exists a partition of the vertex set into at most $p$ parts such that each
part induces a colourful component. We study both problems on $k$-caterpillars (caterpillars
with hairs of length at most $k$) and explore the boundary between polynomial and NP-complete cases.
We answer two open questions of Bulteau et al. mentioned in [30th Annual Symposium on Combinatorial
Pattern Matching, 2019]. The first open question asked about the complexity of the problems on trees
with maximum degree at most $5$. We prove that both problems remain NP-complete on binary $4$-caterpillars,
ternary $3$-caterpillars and quaternary $2$-caterpillars, and thus almost settles the complexity
dichotomy on $k$-caterpillars with bounded maximum degree. On the positive side, we give a linear
time algorithm for $1$-caterpillars even if the backbone is a cycle and generalise this result to
a larger class of graphs. Finally, we answer the second open question regarding the complexity of
Colourful Components on graphs with maximum degree at most $5$ if the number of colours is bounded
by a constant. We show that the problem is NP-complete on $5$-coloured planar graphs with maximum
degree $4$, and on $12$-coloured planar graphs with maximum degree $3$.
