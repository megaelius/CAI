In recent years, increasingly augmentation of health data, such as patient Electronic Health Records
(EHR), are becoming readily available. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for knowledge
discovery and data mining algorithms to dig insights from them, which can, later on, be helpful to
the improvement of the quality of care delivery. Predictive modeling of clinical risk, including
in-hospital mortality, hospital readmission, chronic disease onset, condition exacerbation,
etc., from patient EHR, is one of the health data analytic problems that attract most of the interests.
The reason is not only because the problem is important in clinical settings, but also there are challenges
working with EHR such as sparsity, irregularity, temporality, etc. Different from applications
in other domains such as computer vision and natural language processing, the labeled data samples
in medicine (patients) are relatively limited, which creates lots of troubles for effective predictive
model learning, especially for complicated models such as deep learning. In this paper, we propose
MetaPred, a meta-learning for clinical risk prediction from longitudinal patient EHRs. In particular,
in order to predict the target risk where there are limited data samples, we train a meta-learner
from a set of related risk prediction tasks which learns how a good predictor is learned. The meta-learned
can then be directly used in target risk prediction, and the limited available samples can be used
for further fine-tuning the model performance. The effectiveness of MetaPred is tested on a real
patient EHR repository from Oregon Health & Science University. We are able to demonstrate that
with CNN and RNN as base predictors, MetaPred can achieve much better performance for predicting
target risk with low resources comparing with the predictor trained on the limited samples available
for this risk.
