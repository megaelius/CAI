Dissertations can be the single most important scholarly outputs of junior researchers. Whilst
sets of journal articles are often evaluated with the help of citation counts from the Web of Science
or Scopus, these do not index dissertations and so their impact is hard to assess. In response, this
article introduces a new multistage method to extract Google Scholar citation counts for large
collections of dissertations from repositories indexed by Google. The method was used to extract
Google Scholar citation counts for 77,884 American doctoral dissertations from 2013-2017 via
ProQuest, with a precision of over 95%. Some ProQuest dissertations that were dual indexed with
other repositories could not be retrieved with ProQuest-specific searches but could be found with
Google Scholar searches of the other repositories. The Google Scholar citation counts were then
compared with Mendeley reader counts, a known source of scholarly-like impact data. A fifth of the
dissertations had at least one citation recorded in Google Scholar and slightly fewer had at least
one Mendeley reader. Based on numerical comparisons, the Mendeley reader counts seem to be more
useful for impact assessment purposes for dissertations that are less than two years old, whilst
Google Scholar citations are more useful for older dissertations, especially in social sciences,
arts and humanities. Google Scholar citation counts may reflect a more scholarly type of impact
than that of Mendeley reader counts because dissertations attract a substantial minority of their
citations from other dissertations. In summary, the new method now makes it possible for research
funders, institutions and others to systematically evaluate the impact of dissertations, although
additional Google Scholar queries for other online repositories are needed to ensure comprehensive
coverage.
