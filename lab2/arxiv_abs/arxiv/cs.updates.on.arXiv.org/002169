Early detection of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is crucial to enable advanced treatment.
Due to the rapid growth of skin cancers, there is a growing need of computerized analysis for skin
lesions. These processes including detection, classification, and segmentation. There are three
main types of skin lesions in common that are benign nevi, melanoma, and seborrhoeic keratoses which
have huge intra-class variations in terms of color, size, place and appearance for each class and
high inter-class visual similarities in dermoscopic images. The majority of current research
is focusing on melanoma segmentation, but it is also very important to segment the seborrhoeic keratoses
and benign nevi lesions as these regions potentially indicate the pre-cancer stage. We propose
a multiclass semantic segmentation for these three classes from publicly available ISBI-2017
challenge dataset which consists of 2750 dermoscopic images. We propose an end-to-end solution
using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for multi-class semantic segmentation, which will
automatically segment the melanoma, keratoses and benign lesions. To overcome the issue of data
deficiency, we propose a transfer learning approach which uses both partial transfer learning
and full transfer learning to train FCNs for multi-class semantic segmentation of skin lesions.
The results are presented in Dice Similarity Coefficient (Dice) to compare the performance of the
deep learning segmentation methods on the dataset with 5-fold cross-validation. The results showed
that the two-tier level transfer learning FCN-8s achieved the overall best result with Dice score
of 0.785 in a benign category, 0.653 in melanoma segmentation, and 0.557 in seborrhoeic keratoses.
