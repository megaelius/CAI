Several reduced order models have been developed for nonlinear dynamical systems. To achieve a
considerable speed-up, a hyper-reduction step is needed to reduce the computational complexity
due to nonlinear terms. Many hyper-reduction techniques require the construction of nonlinear
term basis, which introduces a computationally expensive offline phase. A novel way of constructing
nonlinear term basis within the hyper-reduction process is introduced. In contrast to the traditional
hyper-reduction techniques where the collection of nonlinear term snapshots is required, the
SNS method avoids collecting the nonlinear term snapshots. Instead, it uses the solution snapshots
that are used for building a solution basis, which enables avoiding an extra data compression of
nonlinear term snapshots. As a result, the SNS method provides a more efficient offline strategy
than the traditional model order reduction techniques, such as the DEIM, GNAT, and ST-GNAT methods.
The SNS method is theoretically justified by the conforming subspace condition and the subspace
inclusion relation. It is useful for model order reduction of large-scale nonlinear dynamical
problems to reduce the offline cost. It is especially useful for ST-GNAT that has shown promising
results, such as a good accuracy with a considerable online speed-up for hyperbolic problems in
a recent paper by Choi and Carlberg in SISC 2019, because ST-GNAT involves an expensive offline cost
related to collecting nonlinear term snapshots. Numerical results support that the accuracy of
the solution from the SNS method is comparable to the traditional methods and a considerable speed-up
(i.e., a factor of two to a hundred) is achieved in the offline phase.
