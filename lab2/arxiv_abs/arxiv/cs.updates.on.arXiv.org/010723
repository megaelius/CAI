This work utilizes data-driven methods to morph a series of time-resolved experimental OH-PLIF
images into corresponding three-component planar PIV fields in the closed domain of a premixed
swirl combustor. The task is carried out with a fully convolutional network, which is a type of convolutional
neural network (CNN) used in many applications in machine learning, alongside an existing experimental
dataset which consists of simultaneous OH-PLIF and PIV measurements in both attached and detached
flame regimes. Two types of models are compared: 1) a global CNN which is trained using images from
the entire domain, and 2) a set of local CNNs, which are trained only on individual sections of the
domain. The locally trained models show improvement in creating mappings in the detached regime
over the global models. A comparison between model performance in attached and detached regimes
shows that the CNNs are much more accurate across the board in creating velocity fields for attached
flames. Inclusion of time history in the PLIF input resulted in small noticeable improvement on
average, which could imply a greater physical role of instantaneous spatial correlations in the
decoding process over temporal dependencies from the perspective of the CNN. Additionally, the
performance of local models trained to produce mappings in one section of the domain is tested on
other, unexplored sections of the domain. Interestingly, local CNN performance on unseen domain
regions revealed the models' ability to utilize symmetry and antisymmetry in the velocity field.
Ultimately, this work shows the powerful ability of the CNN to decode the three-dimensional PIV
fields from input OH-PLIF images, providing a potential groundwork for a very useful tool for experimental
configurations in which accessibility of forms of simultaneous measurements are limited.
