How do groups of individuals achieve consensus in movement decisions? Do individuals follow their
friends, the one predetermined leader, or whomever just happens to be nearby? To address these questions
computationally, we formalize "Coordination Strategy Inference Problem". In this setting, a
group of multiple individuals moves in a coordinated manner towards a target path. Each individual
uses a specific strategy to follow others (e.g. nearest neighbors, pre-defined leaders, preferred
friends). Given a set of time series that includes coordinated movement and a set of candidate strategies
as inputs, we provide the first methodology (to the best of our knowledge) to infer whether each individual
uses local-agreement-system or dictatorship-like strategy to achieve movement coordination
at the group level. We evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework by predicting
the direction of movement of an individual in a group in both simulated datasets as well as two real-world
datasets: a school of fish and a troop of baboons. Moreover, since there is no prior methodology for
inferring individual-level strategies, we compare our framework with the state-of-the-art approach
for the task of classification of group-level-coordination models. The results show that our approach
is highly accurate in inferring the correct strategy in simulated datasets even in complicated
mixed strategy settings, which no existing method can infer. In the task of classification of group-level-coordination
models, our framework performs better than the state-of-the-art approach in all datasets. Animal
data experiments show that fish, as expected, follow their neighbors, while baboons have a preference
to follow specific individuals. Our methodology generalizes to arbitrary time series data of real
numbers, beyond movement data.
