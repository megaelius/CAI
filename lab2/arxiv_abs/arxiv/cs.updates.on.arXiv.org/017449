This paper reviews 262 reports appearing between March 27 and July 4, 2020, in the press, social media,
and scientific literature describing 203 instances of actual use of 104 different models of ground
and aerial robots for the COVID19 response. The reports are organized by stakeholders and work domain
into a novel taxonomy of six application categories, reflecting major differences in work envelope,
adoption strategy, and human-robot interaction constraints. Each application category is further
divided into a total of 30 subcategories based on differences in mission. The largest number of reported
instances were for public safety (74 out of 203) and clinical care (46), though robots for quality
of life (27), continuity of work and education (22), laboratory and supply chain automation (21),
and non-clinical care (13) were notable. Ground robots were used more frequently (119) than aerial
systems (84), but unlike ground robots, aerial applications appeared to take advantage of existing
general purpose platforms that were used for multiple applications and missions. Of the 104 models
of robots, 82 were determined to be commercially available or already existed as a prototype, 11
were modifications to existing robots, 11 were built from scratch. Teleoperation dominated the
control style (105 instances), with the majority of those applications intentionally providing
remote presence and thus not amenable to full autonomy in the future. Automation accounted for 74
instances and taskable agency forms of autonomy, 24. The data suggests areas for further research
in autonomy, human-robot interaction, and adaptability.
