Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have become an intrinsic part of the 21st century world. Systems
like Smart Grids, Transportation, and Healthcare help us run our lives and businesses smoothly,
successfully and safely. Since malfunctions in these CPSs can have serious, expensive, sometimes
fatal consequences, System-Level Formal Verification (SLFV) tools are vital to minimise the likelihood
of errors occurring during the development process and beyond. Their applicability is supported
by the increasingly widespread use of Model Based Design (MBD) tools. MBD enables the simulation
of CPS models in order to check for their correct behaviour from the very initial design phase. The
disadvantage is that SLFV for complex CPSs is an extremely time-consuming process, which typically
requires several months of simulation. Current SLFV tools are aimed at accelerating the verification
process with multiple simulators that work simultaneously. To this end, they compute all the scenarios
in advance in such a way as to split and simulate them in parallel. Furthermore, they compute optimised
simulation campaigns in order to simulate common prefixes of these scenarios only once, thus avoiding
redundant simulation. Nevertheless, there are still limitations that prevent a more widespread
adoption of SLFV tools. Firstly, current tools cannot optimise simulation campaigns from existing
datasets with collected scenarios. Secondly, there are currently no methods to predict the time
required to complete the SLFV process. This lack of ability to predict the length of the process makes
scheduling verification activities highly problematic. In this thesis, we present how we are able
to overcome these limitations with the use of a data-intensive simulation campaign optimiser and
an accurate machine-independent execution time estimator.
