Two important optimization problems in the analysis of geometric data sets are clustering and sketching.
Here, clustering refers to the problem of partitioning some input metric measure space (mm-space)
into k clusters, minimizing some objective function f. Sketching, on the other hand, is the problem
of approximating some mm-space by a smaller one supported on a set of k points. Specifically, we define
the k-sketch of some mm-space M to be the nearest neighbor of M in the set of k-point mm-spaces, under
some distance function \rho on the set of mm-spaces. In this paper, we demonstrate a duality between
general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a general method for efficiently
transforming a solution for a clustering problem to a solution for a sketching problem, and vice
versa, with approximately equal cost. More specifically, we obtain the following results. 1. For
metric spaces, we consider the case where the clustering objective is minimizing the maximum cluster
diameter. We show that the ratio between the sketching and clustering objectives is constant over
compact metric spaces. 2. We extend these results to the setting of metric measure spaces where we
prove that the ratio of sketching to clustering objectives is bounded both above and below by some
universal constants. In this setting, the clustering objective involves minimizing various notions
of the l_p-diameters} of the clusters. 3. We consider two competing notions of sketching for mm-spaces,
with one of them being more demanding than the other. These notions arise from two different definitions
of p-Gromov-Wasserstein distance that have appeared in the literature. We then prove that whereas
the gap between these can be arbitrarily large, in the case of doubling metric spaces the resulting
sketching objectives are polynomially related.
