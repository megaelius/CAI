In this paper, the efficient deployment and mobility of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
used as aerial base stations to collect data from ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices, is investigated.
In particular, to enable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices with a minimum total transmit
power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) placement
and mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV association, and uplink power control. First, given the locations
of active IoT devices at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are determined.
Next, to dynamically serve the IoT devices in a time-varying network, the optimal mobility patterns
of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end, based on the activation process of the IoT devices, the time
instances at which the UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3D trajectory
of each UAV is obtained in a way that the total energy used for the mobility of the UAVs is minimized
while serving the IoT devices. Simulation results show that, using the proposed approach, the total
transmit power of the IoT devices is reduced by 45% compared to a case in which stationary aerial base
stations are deployed. In addition, the proposed approach can yield a maximum of 28% enhanced system
reliability compared to the stationary case. The results also reveal an inherent tradeoff between
the number of update times, the mobility of the UAVs, and the transmit power of the IoT devices. In
essence, a higher number of updates can lead to lower transmit powers for the IoT devices at the cost
of an increased mobility for the UAVs.
