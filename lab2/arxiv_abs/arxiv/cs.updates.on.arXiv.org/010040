We present a novel technique for the imposition of non-linear entropy conservative and entropy
stable solid wall boundary conditions for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence
of an adiabatic wall, or a wall with a prescribed heat entropy flow. The procedure relies on the formalism
and mimetic properties of diagonal-norm, summation-by-parts, and simultaneous-approximation-term
operators, and is a generalization of previous works on discontinuous interface coupling [1] and
solid wall boundary conditions [2]. Using the method of lines, a semi-discrete entropy estimate
for the entire domain is obtained when the proposed numerical imposition of boundary conditions
are coupled with an entropy-conservative or entropy-stable discrete interior operator. The resulting
estimate mimics the global entropy estimate obtained at the continuous level. The boundary data
at the wall are weakly imposed using a penalty flux approach and a simultaneous-approximation-term
technique for both the conservative variables and the gradient of the entropy variables. Discontinuous
spectral collocation operators (mass lumped nodal discontinuous Galerkin operators), on high-order
unstructured grids, are used for the purpose of demonstrating the robustness and efficacy of the
new procedure for weakly enforcing boundary conditions. Numerical simulations confirm the non-linear
stability of the proposed technique, with applications to three-dimensional subsonic and supersonic
flows. The procedure described is compatible with any diagonal-norm summation-by-parts spatial
operator, including finite element, finite difference, finite volume, discontinuous Galerkin,
and flux reconstruction schemes.
