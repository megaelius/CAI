Identifying the arrival times of seismic P-phases plays a significant role in real-time seismic
monitoring, which provides critical guidance for emergency response activities. While considerable
research has been conducted on this topic, efficiently capturing the arrival times of seismic P-phases
hidden within intensively distributed and noisy seismic waves, such as those generated by the aftershocks
of destructive earthquakes, remains a real challenge since existing methods rely on laborious
expert supervision. To this end, in this paper, we present a machine learning-enhanced framework,
ML-Picker, for the automatic identification of seismic P-phase arrivals on continuous and massive
waveforms. More specifically, ML-Picker consists of three modules, namely, Trigger, Classifier,
and Refiner, and an ensemble learning strategy is exploited to integrate several machine learning
classifiers. An evaluation of the aftershocks following the $M8.0$ Wenchuan earthquake demonstrates
that ML-Picker can not only achieve the best identification performance but also identify 120%
more seismic P-phase arrivals as complementary data. Meanwhile, experimental results also reveal
both the applicability of different machine learning models for waveforms collected from different
seismic stations and the regularities of seismic P-phase arrivals that might be neglected during
manual inspection. These findings clearly validate the effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility
and stability of ML-Picker. In particular, with the preliminary version of ML-Picker, we won the
championship in the First Season and were the runner-up in the Finals of the 2017 International Aftershock
Detection Contest hosted by the China Earthquake Administration, in which 1,143 teams participated
from around the world.
