Nowadays, web search becomes more and more popular all over the world. Many researchers and developers
have done lots of studies on behaviors of search users. In practice, the full understanding of these
behaviors can not only help to evaluate the usefulness of newly-developed ranking algorithms and
other changes of search engine, but also to guide the growth direction of search engine. As far as
we know, most of past work are mainly focused on single search evaluation, which do promote the rapid
development of search engine in early stage. However,these page-level behaviors are so limited
that can no longer give explicit feedbacks on minor changes of the search engine. We think that it
will be more accurate and sensitive when more information on search session are provided. In this
paper, a session level evaluation method is proposed. The session-level features are retrieved
and carefully analyzed. Some linear and non-linear features which can reflect the final degree
of satisfaction are chosen and adopted in evaluation models. A two-layer hybrid evaluation model
with different granularity, which can achieve good precision and recall, is designed and trained.
Lots of real experiments are evaluated by the model, the result shows it achieved a higher accuracy
performance than traditional page-level evaluation metrics. Furthermore, for practical application,
it is important to interpret the reason of each session's satisfaction judgement. In all, a session-level
evaluation model with improved performance and well capability on interpretation is proposed
and applied in real practice in search engine companies.
