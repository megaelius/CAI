Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission
of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in
particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical
ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by
identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or
admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning
and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance
of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort
of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients
that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity
of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with
0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care
with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). In addition, we determine which clinical features are predictive
to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks. Our results indicate that predictive
models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways
for COVID-19, and therefore help inform care and prioritise resources.
