In preoperative imaging, the demarcation of rectal cancer with magnetic resonance images provides
an important basis for cancer staging and treatment planning. Recently, deep learning has greatly
improved the state-of-the-art method in automatic segmentation. However, limitations in data
availability in the medical field can cause large variance and consequent overfitting to medical
image segmentation networks. In this study, we propose methods to reduce the model variance of a
rectal cancer segmentation network by adding a rectum segmentation task and performing data augmentation;
the geometric correlation between the rectum and rectal cancer motivated the former approach.
Moreover, we propose a method to perform a bias-variance analysis within an arbitrary region-of-interest
(ROI) of a segmentation network, which we applied to assess the efficacy of our approaches in reducing
model variance. As a result, adding a rectum segmentation task reduced the model variance of the
rectal cancer segmentation network within tumor regions by a factor of 0.90; data augmentation
further reduced the variance by a factor of 0.89. These approaches also reduced the training duration
by a factor of 0.96 and a further factor of 0.78, respectively. Our approaches will improve the quality
of rectal cancer staging by increasing the accuracy of its automatic demarcation and by providing
rectum boundary information since rectal cancer staging requires the demarcation of both rectum
and rectal cancer. Besides such clinical benefits, our method also enables segmentation networks
to be assessed with bias-variance analysis within an arbitrary ROI, such as a cancerous region.
