Consider a population of individuals that observe an underlying state of nature that evolves over
time. The population is classified into different levels depending on the hierarchical influence
that dictates how the individuals at each level form an opinion on the state. The population is sampled
sequentially by a pollster and the nodes (or individuals) respond to the questions asked by the pollster.
This paper considers the following problem: How should the pollster poll the hierarchical social
network to estimate the state while minimizing the polling cost (measurement cost and uncertainty
in the Bayesian state estimate)? This paper proposes adaptive versions of the following polling
methods: Intent Polling, Expectation Polling, and the recently proposed Neighbourhood Expectation
Polling to account for the time varying state of nature and the hierarchical influence in social
networks. The adaptive polling problem in a hierarchical social network is formulated as a partially
observed Markov decision process (POMDP). Our main results exploit the structure of the polling
problem, and determine novel conditions for Blackwell dominance to construct myopic policies
that provably upper bound the optimal policy of the adaptive polling POMDP. The LeCam deficiency
is used to determine approximate Blackwell dominance for general polling problems. These Blackwell
dominance conditions also facilitate the comparison of Renyi Divergence and Shannon capacity
of more general channel structures that arise in hierarchical social networks. Numerical examples
are provided to illustrate the adaptive polling policies with parameters estimated from YouTube
data.
