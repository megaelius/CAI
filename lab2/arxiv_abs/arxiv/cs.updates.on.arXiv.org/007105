Model-based design offers a promising approach for assisting developers to build reliable and
secure cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in a systematic manner. In this methodology, a designer first
constructs a model, with mathematically precise semantics, of the system under design, and performs
extensive analysis with respect to correctness requirements before generating the implementation
from the model. However, as new vulnerabilities are discovered, requirements evolve aimed at ensuring
resiliency. There is currently a shortage of an inexpensive, automated mechanism that can effectively
repair the initial design, and a model-based system developer regularly needs to redesign and reimplement
the system from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new methodology along with a Matlab toolkit called
REAFFIRM to facilitate the model-based repair for improving the resiliency of CPSs. REAFFIRM takes
the inputs including 1) an original hybrid system modeled as a Simulink/Stateflow diagram, 2) a
given resiliency pattern specified as a model transformation script, and 3) a safety requirement
expressed as a Signal Temporal Logic formula, and then outputs a repaired model which satisfies
the requirement. The overall structure of REAFFIRM contains two main modules, a model transformation,
and a model synthesizer built on top of the falsification tool Breach. We introduce a new model transformation
language for hybrid systems, which we call HATL to allow a designer to specify resiliency patterns.
To evaluate the proposed approach, we use REAFFIRM to automatically synthesize repaired models
for an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system under a GPS sensor spoofing attack, for a single-machine
infinite-bus (SMIB) system under a sliding-mode switching attack, and for a missile guidance system
under gyroscopes sensor attack.
