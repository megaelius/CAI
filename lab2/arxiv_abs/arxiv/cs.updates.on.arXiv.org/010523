Simulations of biological macromolecules play an important role in understanding the physical
basis of a number of complex processes such as protein folding. Even with increasing computational
power and evolution of specialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic
scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high dimensionality of protein
conformational landscapes, and the inability of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
to sufficiently sample these landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning
(ML/DL) techniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity to potentially
overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the dimensionality of MD simulations
to automatically build latent representations that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction
coordinates (RCs), and (2) driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational
states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD simulations can fold small
proteins effectively on supercomputers. In particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness
of scaling DL-coupled MD workflows by folding two prototypical systems, viz., Fs-peptide and the
fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate that a DL driven MD workflow
is able to effectively learn latent representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared
to traditional MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in sampling
the folded states by at least 2.3x. Our study provides a quantitative basis to understand how DL driven
MD simulations, can lead to effective performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing
resources.
