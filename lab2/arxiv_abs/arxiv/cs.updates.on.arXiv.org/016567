Virtual applications through mobile platforms are one of the most critical and ever-growing fields
in AI, where ubiquitous and real-time person authentication has become critical after the breakthrough
of all services provided via mobile devices. In this context, face verification technologies can
provide reliable and robust user authentication, given the availability of cameras in these devices,
as well as their widespread use in everyday applications. The rapid development of deep Convolutional
Neural Networks has resulted in many accurate face verification architectures. However, their
typical size (hundreds of megabytes) makes them infeasible to be incorporated in downloadable
mobile applications where the entire file typically may not exceed 100 Mb. Accordingly, we address
the challenge of developing a lightweight face recognition network of just a few megabytes that
can operate with sufficient accuracy in comparison to much larger models. The network also should
be able to operate under different poses, given the variability naturally observed in uncontrolled
environments where mobile devices are typically used. In this paper, we adapt the lightweight SqueezeNet
model, of just 4.4MB, to effectively provide cross-pose face recognition. After trained on the
MS-Celeb-1M and VGGFace2 databases, our model achieves an EER of 1.23% on the difficult frontal
vs. profile comparison, and0.54% on profile vs. profile images. Under less extreme variations
involving frontal images in any of the enrolment/query images pair, EER is pushed down to<0.3%,
and the FRR at FAR=0.1%to less than 1%. This makes our light model suitable for face recognition where
at least acquisition of the enrolment image can be controlled. At the cost of a slight degradation
in performance, we also test an even lighter model (of just 2.5MB) where regular convolutions are
replaced with depth-wise separable convolutions.
