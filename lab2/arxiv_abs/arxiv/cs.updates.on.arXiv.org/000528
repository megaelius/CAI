In this work we provide algorithmic solutions to five fundamental problems concerning the verification,
synthesis and correction of concurrent systems that can be modeled by bounded p/t-nets. We express
concurrency via partial orders and assume that behavioral specifications are given via monadic
second order logic. A c-partial-order is a partial order whose Hasse diagram can be covered by c paths.
For a finite set T of transitions, we let P(c,T,\phi) denote the set of all T-labelled c-partial-orders
satisfying \phi. If N=(P,T) is a p/t-net we let P(N,c) denote the set of all c-partially-ordered
runs of N. A (b, r)-bounded p/t-net is a b-bounded p/t-net in which each place appears repeated at
most r times. We solve the following problems: 1. Verification: given an MSO formula \phi and a bounded
p/t-net N determine whether P(N,c)\subseteq P(c,T,\phi), whether P(c,T,\phi)\subseteq P(N,c),
or whether P(N,c)\cap P(c,T,\phi)=\emptyset. 2. Synthesis from MSO Specifications: given an
MSO formula \phi, synthesize a semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N satisfying P(c,T,\phi)\subseteq
P(N, c). 3. Semantically Safest Subsystem: given an MSO formula \phi defining a set of safe partial
orders, and a b-bounded p/t-net N, possibly containing unsafe behaviors, synthesize the safest
(b,r)-bounded p/t-net N' whose behavior lies in between P(N,c)\cap P(c,T,\phi) and P(N,c). 4.
Behavioral Repair: given two MSO formulas \phi and \psi, and a b-bounded p/t-net N, synthesize a
semantically minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t net N' whose behavior lies in between P(N,c) \cap P(c,T,\phi)
and P(c,T,\psi). 5. Synthesis from Contracts: given an MSO formula \phi^yes specifying a set of
good behaviors and an MSO formula \phi^no specifying a set of bad behaviors, synthesize a semantically
minimal (b,r)-bounded p/t-net N such that P(c,T,\phi^yes) \subseteq P(N,c) but P(c,T,\phi^no
) \cap P(N,c)=\emptyset.
