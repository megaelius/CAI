This thesis takes inspiration from quantum physics to investigate mathematical structure that
lies at the interface of algebra and statistics. The starting point is a passage from classical probability
theory to quantum probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a density
operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called the partial trace, and the
quantum version of a marginal probability distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint
probability distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By applying
the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals recover classical marginal
probabilities. In general, these reduced densities will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues
and eigenvectors will contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed
by statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional probability, and then
investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture "concepts" inherent in the original joint
distribution. The theory is then illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning
to a more theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling entailment
and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing expressions in the language
as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this thesis comes from formal concept analysis,
which finds many striking parallels with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental,
and a common blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free (co)completions
and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise strongly suggest that in certain categorical
contexts, the "fixed points" of a morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.
