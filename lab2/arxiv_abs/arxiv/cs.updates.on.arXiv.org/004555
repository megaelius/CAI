We study the first order theory of structures over graphs i.e. structures of the form ($\mathcal{G},\tau$)
where $\mathcal{G}$ is the set of all (isomorphism types of) finite undirected graphs and $\tau$
some vocabulary. We define the notion of a recursive predicate over graphs using Turing Machine
recognizable string encodings of graphs. We also define the notion of an arithmetical relation
over graphs using a total order $\leq_t$ on the set $\mathcal{G}$ such that ($\mathcal{G},\leq_t$)
is isomorphic to ($\mathbb{N},\leq$). We introduce the notion of a \textit{capable} structure
over graphs, which is one satisfying the conditions : (1) definability of arithmetic, (2) definability
of cardinality of a graph, and (3) definability of two particular graph predicates related to vertex
labellings of graphs. We then show any capable structure can define every arithmetical predicate
over graphs. As a corollary, any capable structure also defines every recursive graph relation.
We identify capable structures which are expansions of graph orders, which are structures of the
form ($\mathcal{G},\leq$) where $\leq$ is a partial order. We show that the subgraph order i.e.
($\mathcal{G},\leq_s$), induced subgraph order with one constant $P_3$ i.e. ($\mathcal{G},\leq_i,P_3$)
and an expansion of the minor order for counting edges i.e. ($\mathcal{G},\leq_m,sameSize(x,y)$)
are capable structures. In the course of the proof, we show the definability of several natural graph
theoretic predicates in the subgraph order which may be of independent interest. We discuss the
implications of our results and connections to Descriptive Complexity.
