We study the effect of limiting the number of different messages a node can transmit simultaneously
on the verification complexity of proof-labeling schemes (PLS). In a PLS, each node is given a label,
and the goal is to verify, by exchanging messages over each link in each direction, that a certain
global predicate is satisfied by the system configuration. We consider a single parameter r that
bounds the number of distinct messages that can be sent concurrently by any node: in the case r=1,
each node may only send the same message to all its neighbors (the broadcast model), in the case r is
at least Delta, where Delta is the largest node degree in the system, each neighbor may be sent a distinct
message (the unicast model), and in general, for r between 1 and Delta, each of the r messages is destined
to a subset of the neighbors. We show that message compression linear in r is possible for verifying
fundamental problems such as the agreement between edge endpoints on the edge state. Some problems,
including verification of maximal matching, exhibit a large gap in complexity between r=1 and r>1.
For some other important predicates, the verification complexity is insensitive to r, e.g., the
question whether a subset of edges constitutes a spanning-tree. We also consider the congested
clique model. We show that the crossing technique for proving lower bounds on the verification complexity
can be applied in the case of congested clique only if r=1. Together with a new upper bound, this allows
us to determine the verification complexity of MST in the broadcast clique. Finally, we establish
a general connection between the deterministic and randomized verification complexity for any
given number r.
