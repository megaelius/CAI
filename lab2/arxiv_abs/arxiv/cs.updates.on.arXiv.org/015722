Conversational systems are of primary interest in the AI community. Chatbots are increasingly
being deployed to provide round-the-clock support and to increase customer engagement. Many of
the commercial bot building frameworks follow a standard approach that requires one to build and
train an intent model to recognize a user input. Intent models are trained in a supervised setting
with a collection of textual utterance and intent label pairs. Gathering a substantial and wide
coverage of training data for different intent is a bottleneck in the bot building process. Moreover,
the cost of labeling a hundred to thousands of conversations with intent is a time consuming and laborious
job. In this paper, we present an intent discovery framework that involves 4 primary steps: Extraction
of textual utterances from a conversation using a pre-trained domain agnostic Dialog Act Classifier
(Data Extraction), automatic clustering of similar user utterances (Clustering), manual annotation
of clusters with an intent label (Labeling) and propagation of intent labels to the utterances from
the previous step, which are not mapped to any cluster (Label Propagation); to generate intent training
data from raw conversations. We have introduced a novel density-based clustering algorithm ITER-DBSCAN
for unbalanced data clustering. Subject Matter Expert (Annotators with domain expertise) manually
looks into the clustered user utterances and provides an intent label for discovery. We conducted
user studies to validate the effectiveness of the trained intent model generated in terms of coverage
of intents, accuracy and time saving concerning manual annotation. Although the system is developed
for building an intent model for the conversational system, this framework can also be used for a
short text clustering or as a labeling framework.
