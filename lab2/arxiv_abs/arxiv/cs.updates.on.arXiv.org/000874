Kernel-based approaches for sequence classification have been successfully applied to a variety
of domains, including the text categorization, image classification, speech analysis, biological
sequence analysis, time series and music classification, where they show some of the most accurate
results. Typical kernel functions for sequences in these domains (e.g., bag-of-words, mismatch,
or subsequence kernels) are restricted to {\em discrete univariate} (i.e. one-dimensional) string
data, such as sequences of words in the text analysis, codeword sequences in the image analysis,
or nucleotide or amino acid sequences in the DNA and protein sequence analysis. However, original
sequence data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and discrete
as required by typical $k$-mer based sequence kernel functions. In this work, we consider the problem
of the {\em multivariate} sequence classification such as classification of multivariate music
sequences, or multidimensional protein sequence representations. To this end, we extend {\em
univariate} kernel functions typically used in sequence analysis and propose efficient {\em multivariate}
similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence
dimension in the original {\em real-valued} multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate
discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence representations to more
accurately capture similarity relationships among sequences and improve classification performance.
Experiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent classification performance
on three challenging music classification tasks as well as protein sequence classification with
significant 25-40% improvements over univariate kernel methods and existing state-of-the-art
sequence classification methods.
