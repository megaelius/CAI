This paper focus on three inherent demerits of adaptive feedback RBFNN control with lattice distribution
of hidden nodes: 1) The approximation area of adaptive RBFNN is difficult to be obtained in priori;
2) Only partial persistence of excitation (PE) can be guaranteed; 3) The number of hidden nodes is
the exponential growth with the increase of the dimension of the input vectors and the polynomial
growth with the increase of the number of the hidden nodes in each channel which is huge especially
for the high dimension of inputs of the RBFNN. Adaptive feedforward RBFNN control with lattice distribution
of hidden node can improve solve the demerits 1) but just improve demerits 2) and 3) slightly. This
paper proposes an adaptive feedforward RBFNN control strategy with an optimal distribution of
hidden nodes. It solves the demerits 2) and 3) that the standard PE can be guaranteed and the number
of hidden nodes is linear increase with the complexity of the desired state trajectory rather than
the exponential growth with the increase of the dimension of the input vectors. In addition, we articulate
that PID is the special case of adaptive feedforward RBFNN control for the set points tracking problem
and we named the controller is enhanced PID. It is very easy tuning our algorithm which just more complex
than PID slightly and the tuning experience of PID can be easily transferred to our scheme. In the
case of the controller implemented by digital equipment, the control performance can equal or even
better than it in model-based schemes such as computed torque control and feedforward nonlinear
control after enough time to learn. Simulations results demonstrate the excellent performance
of our scheme. The paper is a significant extension of deterministic learning theory.
