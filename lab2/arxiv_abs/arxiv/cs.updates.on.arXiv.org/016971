Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health control strategies have
been proposed and tested against SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we study three specific COVID-19 epidemic
control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination
control, the SEIR model with shield immunity control, and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected,
quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the
control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas and develop methods for synthesizing
control inputs based on three specific COVID-19 epidemic models with MTL specifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to provide automatically-synthesized and fine-tuned
control synthesis for the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation
results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model
parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic
with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19
epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed
synthesis approach can generate control inputs within a relatively short time (within 5 seconds)
such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune)
satisfy the MTL specifications. The results are also consistent with the claim that control in the
early phases of COVID-19 is the most effective in the mitigation.
