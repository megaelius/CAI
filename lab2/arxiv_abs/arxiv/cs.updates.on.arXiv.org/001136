The goal of this paper is to assess the utility of Reduced-Order Models (ROMs) developed from 3D physics-based
models for predicting transient thermal power output for an enhanced geothermal reservoir while
explicitly accounting for uncertainties in the subsurface system and site-specific details.
Numerical simulations are performed based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of model inputs drawn
from uniform probability distributions. Key sensitive parameters are identified from these simulations,
which are fracture zone permeability, well/skin factor, bottom hole pressure, and injection flow
rate. The inputs for ROMs are based on these key sensitive parameters. The ROMs are then used to evaluate
the influence of subsurface attributes on thermal power production curves. The resulting ROMs
are compared with field-data and the detailed physics-based numerical simulations. We propose
three different ROMs with different levels of model parsimony, each describing key and essential
features of the power production curves. ROM-1 is able to accurately reproduce the power output
of numerical simulations for low values of permeabilities and certain features of the field-scale
data, and is relatively parsimonious. ROM-2 is a more complex model than ROM-1 but it accurately
describes the field-data. At higher permeabilities, ROM-2 reproduces numerical results better
than ROM-1, however, there is a considerable deviation at low fracture zone permeabilities. ROM-3
is developed by taking the best aspects of ROM-1 and ROM-2 and provides a middle ground for model parsimony.
It is able to describe various features of numerical simulations and field-data. From the proposed
workflow, we demonstrate that the proposed simple ROMs are able to capture various complex features
of the power production curves of Fenton Hill HDR system. For typical EGS applications, ROM-2 and
ROM-3 outperform ROM-1.
