In wireless communications, the cooperative communication (CC) technology promises performance
gains compared to traditional Single-Input Single Output (SISO) techniques. Therefore, the CC
technique is one of the nominees for 5G networks. In the Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying scheme
which is one of the CC techniques, determination of the threshold value at the relay has a key role
for the system performance and power usage. In this paper, we propose prediction of the optimal threshold
values for the best relay selection scheme in cooperative communications, based on Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs) for the first time in literature. The average link qualities and number of
relays have been used as inputs in the prediction of optimal threshold values using Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs): Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. The MLP
network has better performance from the RBF network on the prediction of optimal threshold value
when the same number of neurons is used at the hidden layer for both networks. Besides, the optimal
threshold values obtained using ANNs are verified by the optimal threshold values obtained numerically
using the closed form expression derived for the system. The results show that the optimal threshold
values obtained by ANNs on the best relay selection scheme provide a minimum Bit-Error-Rate (BER)
because of the reduction of the probability that error propagation may occur. Also, for the same
BER performance goal, prediction of optimal threshold values provides 2dB less power usage, which
is great gain in terms of green communicationBER performance goal, prediction of optimal threshold
values provides 2dB less power usage, which is great gain in terms of green communication.
