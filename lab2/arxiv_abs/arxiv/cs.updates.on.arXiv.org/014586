In machine learning and other fields, suggesting a good solution to a problem is usually a harder
task than evaluating the quality of such a solution. This asymmetry is the basis for a large number
of selection oriented methods that use a generator system to guess a set of solutions and an evaluator
system to rank and select the best solutions. This work examines the use of this approach to the problem
of panoptic image segmentation and class agnostic parts segmentation. The generator/evaluator
approach for this case consists of two independent convolutional neural nets: a generator net that
suggests variety segments corresponding to objects, stuff and parts regions in the image, and an
evaluator net that chooses the best segments to be merged into the segmentation map. The result is
a trial and error evolutionary approach in which a generator that guesses segments with low average
accuracy, but with wide variability, can still produce good results when coupled with an accurate
evaluator. The generator consists of a Pointer net that receives an image and a point in the image,
and predicts the region of the segment containing the point. Generating and evaluating each segment
separately is essential in this case since it demands exponentially fewer guesses compared to a
system that guesses and evaluates the full segmentation map in each try. The classification of the
selected segments is done by an independent region-specific classification net. This allows the
segmentation to be class agnostic and hence, capable of segmenting unfamiliar categories that
were not part of the training set. The method was examined on the COCO Panoptic segmentation benchmark
and gave results comparable to those of the basic semantic segmentation and Mask-RCNN methods.
In addition, the system was used for the task of splitting objects of unseen classes (that did not
appear in the training set) into parts.
