We propose a fast and accurate method of 6D object pose estimation for bin-picking of mechanical
parts by a robot manipulator. We extend the single-shot approach to stereo vision by application
of attention architecture. Our convolutional neural network model regresses to object locations
and rotations from either a left image or a right image without depth information. Then, a stereo
feature matching module, designated as Stereo Grid Attention, generates stereo grid matching
maps. The important point of our method is only to calculate disparity of the objects found by the
attention from stereo images, instead of calculating a point cloud over the entire image. The disparity
value is then used to calculate the depth to the objects by the principle of triangulation. Our method
also achieves a rapid processing speed of pose estimation by the single-shot architecture and it
is possible to process a 1024 x 1024 pixels image in 75 milliseconds on the Jetson AGX Xavier implemented
with half-float model. Weakly textured mechanical parts are used to exemplify the method. First,
we create original synthetic datasets for training and evaluating of the proposed model. This dataset
is created by capturing and rendering numerous 3D models of several types of mechanical parts in
virtual space. Finally, we use a robotic manipulator with an electromagnetic gripper to pick up
the mechanical parts in a cluttered state to verify the validity of our method in an actual scene.
When a raw stereo image is used by the proposed method from our stereo camera to detect black steel
screws, stainless screws, and DC motor parts, i.e., cases, rotor cores and commutator caps, the
bin-picking tasks are successful with 76.3%, 64.0%, 50.5%, 89.1% and 64.2% probability, respectively.
