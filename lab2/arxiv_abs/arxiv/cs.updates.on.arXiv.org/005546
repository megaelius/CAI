This paper presents the framework for a novel Unified Socially-Aware Navigation (USAN) architecture
and explains its need in Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) applications. Our approach emphasizes
interpersonal distance and how spatial communication can be used to build a unified planner for
a human-robot collaborative environment. Socially-Aware Navigation (SAN) is vital for helping
humans to feel comfortable and safe around robots; HRI studies have shown the importance of SAN transcends
safety and comfort. SAN plays a crucial role in perceived intelligence, sociability and social
capacity of the robot, thereby increasing the acceptance of the robots in public places. Human environments
are very dynamic and pose serious social challenges to robots intended for interactions with people.
For the robots to cope with the changing dynamics of a situation, there is a need to infer intent and
detect changes in the interaction context. SAN has gained immense interest in the social robotics
community; to the best of our knowledge, however, there is no planner that can adapt to different
interaction contexts spontaneously after autonomously sensing the context. Most of the recent
efforts involve social path planning for a single context. In this work, we propose a novel approach
for a unified architecture to SAN that can plan and execute trajectories for an autonomously sensed
interaction context that are human-friendly. Our approach augments the navigation stack of the
Robot Operating System (ROS) utilizing machine learning and optimization tools. We modified the
ROS navigation stack using a machine learning-based context classifier and a PaCcET based local
planner for us to achieve the goals of USAN. We discuss our preliminary results and concrete plans
on putting the pieces together in achieving USAN.
