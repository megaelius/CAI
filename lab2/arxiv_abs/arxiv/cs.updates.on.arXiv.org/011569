Large-scale trends in urban crime and global terrorism are well-predicted by socio-economic drivers,
but focused, event-level predictions have had limited success. Standard machine learning approaches
are promising, but lack interpretability, are generally interpolative, and ineffective for precise
future interventions with costly and wasteful false positives. Here, we are introducing Granger
Network inference as a new forecasting approach for individual infractions with demonstrated
performance far surpassing past results, yet transparent enough to validate and extend social
theory. Considering the problem of predicting crime in the City of Chicago, we achieve an average
AUC of ~90\% for events predicted a week in advance within spatial tiles approximately $1000$ ft
across. Instead of pre-supposing that crimes unfold across contiguous spaces akin to diffusive
systems, we learn the local transport rules from data. As our key insights, we uncover indications
of suburban bias -- how law-enforcement response is modulated by socio-economic contexts with
disproportionately negative impacts in the inner city -- and how the dynamics of violent and property
crimes co-evolve and constrain each other -- lending quantitative support to controversial pro-active
policing policies. To demonstrate broad applicability to spatio-temporal phenomena, we analyze
terror attacks in the middle-east in the recent past, and achieve an AUC of ~80% for predictions made
a week in advance, and within spatial tiles measuring approximately 120 miles across. We conclude
that while crime operates near an equilibrium quickly dissipating perturbations, terrorism does
not. Indeed terrorism aims to destabilize social order, as shown by its dynamics being susceptible
to run-away increases in event rates under small perturbations.
