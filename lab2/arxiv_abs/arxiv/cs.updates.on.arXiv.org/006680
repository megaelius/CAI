We study a Compressed Sensing (CS) problem known as Multiple Measurement Vectors (MMV) problem,
which arises in joint estimation of multiple signal realizations when the signal samples have a
common (joint) sparse support over a fixed known dictionary. Although there is a vast literature
on the analysis of MMV, it is not yet fully known how the number of signal samples and their statistical
correlations affects the performance of the joint estimation in MMV. Moreover, in many instances
of MMV the underlying sparsifying dictionary may not be precisely known, and it is still an open problem
to quantify how the dictionary mismatch may affect the estimation performance. In this paper, we
focus on $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularized least squares ($\ell_{2,1}$-LS) as a well-known and widely-used
MMV algorithm in the literature. We prove an interesting decoupling property for $\ell_{2,1}$-LS,
where we show that it can be decomposed into two phases: i) use all the signal samples to estimate the
signal covariance matrix (coupled phase), ii) plug in the resulting covariance estimate as the
true covariance matrix into the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) estimator to reconstruct each
signal sample individually (decoupled phase). As a consequence of this decomposition, we are able
to provide further insights on the performance of $\ell_{2,1}$-LS for MMV. In particular, we address
how the signal correlations and dictionary mismatch affects its performance. Moreover, we show
that by using the decoupling property one can obtain a variety of MMV algorithms with performances
even better than that of $\ell_{2,1}$-LS. We also provide numerical simulations to validate our
theoretical results.
