Common sense and social interaction related to daily-life environments are considerably important
for autonomous robots, which support human activities. One of the practical approaches for acquiring
such social interaction skills and semantic information as common sense in human activity is the
application of recent machine learning techniques. Although recent machine learning techniques
have been successful in realizing automatic manipulation and driving tasks, it is difficult to
use these techniques in applications that require human-robot interaction experience. Humans
have to perform several times over a long term to show embodied and social interaction behaviors
to robots or learning systems. To address this problem, we propose a cloud-based immersive virtual
reality (VR) platform which enables virtual human-robot interaction to collect the social and
embodied knowledge of human activities in a variety of situations. To realize the flexible and reusable
system, we develop a real-time bridging mechanism between ROS and Unity, which is one of the standard
platforms for developing VR applications. We apply the proposed system to a robot competition field
named RoboCup@Home to confirm the feasibility of the system in a realistic human-robot interaction
scenario. Through demonstration experiments at the competition, we show the usefulness and potential
of the system for the development and evaluation of social intelligence through human-robot interaction.
The proposed VR platform enables robot systems to collect social experiences with several users
in a short time. The platform also contributes in providing a dataset of social behaviors, which
would be a key aspect for intelligent service robots to acquire social interaction skills based
on machine learning techniques.
