We propose Internames, an architectural framework in which names are used to identify all entities
involved in communication: contents, users, devices, logical as well as physical points involved
in the communication, and services. By not having a static binding between the name of a communication
entity and its current location, we allow entities to be mobile, enable them to be reached by any of
a number of basic communication primitives, enable communication to span networks with different
technologies and allow for disconnected operation. Furthermore, with the ability to communicate
between names, the communication path can be dynamically bound to any of a number of end-points,
and the end-points themselves could change as needed. A key benefit of our architecture is its ability
to accommodate gradual migration from the current IP infrastructure to a future that may be a ubiquitous
Information Centric Network. Basic building blocks of Internames are: i) a name-based Application
Programming Interface; ii) a separation of identifiers (names) and locators; iii) a powerful Name
Resolution Service (NRS) that dynamically maps names to locators, as a function of time/location/context/service;
iv) a built-in capacity of evolution, allowing a transparent migration from current networks and
the ability to include as particular cases current specific architectures. To achieve this vision,
shared by many other researchers, we exploit and expand on Information Centric Networking principles,
extending ICN functionality beyond content retrieval, easing send-to-name and push services,
and allowing to use names also to route data in the return path. A key role in this architecture is played
by the NRS, which allows for the co-existence of multiple network "realms", including current IP
and non-IP networks, glued together by a name-to-name overarching communication primitive.
