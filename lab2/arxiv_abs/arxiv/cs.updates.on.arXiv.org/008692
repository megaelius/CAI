One of the fundamental open problems in the area of distributed graph algorithms is the question
of whether randomization is needed for efficient symmetry breaking. While there are fast, $\text{poly}\log
n$-time randomized distributed algorithms for all of the classic symmetry breaking problems,
for many of them, the best deterministic algorithms are almost exponentially slower. The following
basic local splitting problem, which is known as the \emph{weak splitting} problem takes a central
role in this context: Each node of a graph $G=(V,E)$ has to be colored red or blue such that each node
of sufficiently large degree has at least one node of each color among its neighbors. Ghaffari, Kuhn,
and Maus [STOC '17] showed that this seemingly simple problem is complete w.r.t. the above fundamental
open question in the following sense: If there is an efficient $\text{poly}\log n$-time determinstic
distributed algorithm for weak splitting, then there is such an algorithm for all locally checkable
graph problems for which an efficient randomized algorithm exists. In this paper, we investigate
the distributed complexity of weak splitting and some closely related problems. E.g., we obtain
efficient algorithms for special cases of weak splitting, where the graph is nearly regular. In
particular, we show that if $\delta$ and $\Delta$ are the minimum and maximum degrees of $G$ and if
$\delta=\Omega(\log n)$, weak splitting can be solved deterministically in time $O\big(\frac{\Delta}{\delta}\cdot\text{poly}(\log
n)\big)$. Further, if $\delta = \Omega(\log\log n)$ and $\Delta\leq 2^{\varepsilon\delta}$,
there is a randomized algorithm with time complexity $O\big(\frac{\Delta}{\delta}\cdot\text{poly}(\log\log
n)\big)$.
