Predictive analytics is increasingly used to guide decision-making in many applications. However,
in practice, we often have limited data on the true predictive task of interest, but copious data
on a closely-related proxy predictive task. Practitioners often train predictive models on proxies
since it achieves more accurate predictions. For example, e-commerce platforms use abundant customer
click data (proxy) to make product recommendations rather than the relatively sparse customer
purchase data (true outcome of interest); alternatively, hospitals often rely on medical risk
scores trained on a different patient population (proxy) rather than their own patient population
(true cohort of interest) to assign interventions. However, not accounting for the bias in the proxy
can lead to sub-optimal decisions. Using real datasets, we find that this bias can often be captured
by a sparse function of the features. Thus, we propose a novel two-step estimator that uses techniques
from high-dimensional statistics to efficiently combine a large amount of proxy data and a small
amount of true data. We prove upper bounds on the error of our proposed estimator and lower bounds
on several heuristics commonly used by data scientists; in particular, our proposed estimator
can achieve the same accuracy with exponentially less true data (in the number of features $d$).
Our proof relies on a new tail inequality on the convergence of LASSO for approximately sparse vectors.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on e-commerce and healthcare datasets;
in both cases, we achieve significantly better predictive accuracy as well as managerial insights
into the nature of the bias in the proxy data.
