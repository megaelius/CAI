In a world where ideas are free to flow uncontrolled between people, we often find ourselves relying
on others' information without the possibility to establish whether those opinions are accurate.
The present study tests a "confidence hypothesis" of advice perception, namely the hypothesis
that internal metacognitive processes like decision confidence play an important functional
role in the perception and use of social information - such as peers' advice - and can be used, computationally,
to estimate advisors' trustworthiness and advice reliability. Specifically, these processes
are hypothesized to be particularly important in situations where objective feedback is difficult
to acquire, which are abundant in our everyday life (e.g., political, educational and health related
matters). Whether and how reliably so people are able to discriminate good from bad advice in these
situations is a matter of debate. Here, we use a judge-advisor system paradigm \citep{Bonaccio2006}
to precisely manipulate participants independent information and advice profile. We find that
when advisors' and participants' judgments are independent, people are able to discriminate subtle
advice features, like confidence calibration, even in the absence of objective feedback. When
observers' judgments (and judgments' errors) are correlated - as it is the case in many social contexts
- predictable distortions can be observed between feedback and feedback-free scenarios. A simple
model of advice reliability estimation, endowed with metacognitive insight, is able to explain
characteristic patterns of results observed in the human data.
