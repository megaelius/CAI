Dual camera systems have assisted in the proliferation of various applications, such as optical
zoom, low-light imaging and High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging. In this work, we explore an optimal
method for capturing the scene HDR and disparity map using dual camera setups. Hasinoff et al. (2010)
have developed a noise optimal framework for HDR capture from a single camera. We generalize this
to the dual camera set-up for estimating both HDR and disparity map. It may seem that dual camera systems
can capture HDR in a shorter time. However, disparity estimation is a necessary step, which requires
overlap among the images captured by the two cameras. This may lead to an increase in the capture time.
To address this conflicting requirement, we propose a novel framework to find the optimal exposure
and ISO sequence by minimizing the capture time under the constraints of an upper bound on the disparity
error and a lower bound on the per-exposure SNR. We show that the resulting optimization problem
is non-convex in general and propose an appropriate initialization technique. To obtain the HDR
and disparity map from the optimal capture sequence, we propose a pipeline which alternates between
estimating the camera ICRFs and the scene disparity map. We demonstrate that our optimal capture
sequence leads to better results than other possible capture sequences. Our results are also close
to those obtained by capturing the full stereo stack spanning the entire dynamic range. Finally,
we present for the first time a stereo HDR dataset consisting of dense ISO and exposure stack captured
from a smartphone dual camera. The dataset consists of 6 scenes, with an average of 142 exposure-ISO
image sequence per scene.
