With the rapid growth of large online social networks, the ability to analyze large-scale social
structure and behavior has become critically important, and this has led to the development of several
scalable graph processing systems. In reality, however, social interaction takes place not only
between pairs of individuals as in the graph model, but rather in the context of multi-user groups.
Research has shown that such group dynamics can be better modeled through a more general hypergraph
model, resulting in the need to build scalable hypergraph processing systems. In this paper, we
present MESH, a flexible distributed framework for scalable hypergraph processing. MESH provides
an easy-to-use and expressive application programming interface that naturally extends the think
like a vertex model common to many popular graph processing systems. Our framework provides a flexible
implementation based on an underlying graph processing system, and enables different design choices
for the key implementation issues of partitioning a hypergraph representation. We implement MESH
on top of the popular GraphX graph processing framework in Apache Spark. Using a variety of real datasets
and experiments conducted on a local 8-node cluster as well as a 65-node Amazon AWS testbed, we demonstrate
that MESH provides flexibility based on data and application characteristics, as well as scalability
with cluster size. We further show that it is competitive in performance to HyperX, another hypergraph
processing system based on Spark, while providing a much simpler implementation (requiring about
5X fewer lines of code), thus showing that simplicity and flexibility need not come at the cost of
performance.
