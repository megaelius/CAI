We consider the complexity of deciding membership of a given finite semigroup to a fixed pseudovariety.
While it is known that there exist pseudovarieties with NP-complete or even undecidable membership
problems, for many well-known pseudovarieties the problem is known to be decidable in polynomial
time. We show that for many of these pseudovarieties, the membership problem is actually in AC^0.
To this end, we show that these pseudovarieties can be characterized by first-order sentences with
multiplication as the only predicate. We prove closure properties of the class of pseudovarieties
with such first-order descriptions under various well-known operations; in particular, if V can
be described by a first-order sentence, then DV, LV, and the Mal'cev products of K, D, N, LI, and LG
with V are first-order definable as well. Moreover, if H is a first-order definable pseudovariety
of finite groups, then the pseudovariety of all finite semigroups whose subgroups are in H is first-order
definable. Our logical formalism can be extended by a predicate corresponding to the omega-operator
in semigroups. The extended logic is powerful enough to capture all finitely based pseudovarieties,
i.e., pseudovarieties characterized by some finite set of pseudoidentities, and yields decidability
of membership in L, in FOLL (polynomial-size Boolean circuits of O(log log n) depth) and in qAC^0
(Boolean circuits of constant depth and quasi-polynomial size). In view of lower bounds from circuit
complexity, we obtain a new technique to prove that a pseudovariety V is not finitely based: if membership
in V is hard for PARITY, it cannot be defined in this extended logic and thus does not admit a finite
basis. We show that membership to EA is L-complete, thereby improving previous complexity results
and obtaining a new proof that the pseudovariety is not finitely based at the same time.
