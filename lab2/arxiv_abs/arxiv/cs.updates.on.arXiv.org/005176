Automating classification and segmentation process of abnormal regions in different body organs
has a crucial role in most of medical imaging applications such as funduscopy, endoscopy, and dermoscopy.
Detecting multiple abnormalities in each type of images is necessary for better and more accurate
diagnosis procedure and medical decisions. In recent years portable medical imaging devices such
as capsule endoscopy and digital dermatoscope have been introduced and made the diagnosis procedure
easier and more efficient. However, these portable devices have constrained power resources and
limited computational capability. To address this problem, we propose a bifurcated structure
for convolutional neural networks performing both classification and segmentation of multiple
abnormalities simultaneously. The proposed network is first trained by each abnormality separately.
Then the network is trained using all abnormalities. In order to reduce the computational complexity,
the network is redesigned to share some features which are common among all abnormalities. Later,
these shared features are used in different settings (directions) to segment and classify the abnormal
region of the image. Finally, results of the classification and segmentation directions are fused
to obtain the classified segmentation map. Proposed framework is simulated using four frequent
gastrointestinal abnormalities as well as three dermoscopic lesions and for evaluation of the
proposed framework the results are compared with the corresponding ground truth map. Properties
of the bifurcated network like low complexity and resource sharing make it suitable to be implemented
as a part of portable medical imaging devices.
