Users of cloud computing are increasingly overwhelmed with the wide range of providers and services
offered by each provider. As such, many users select cloud services based on description alone.
An emerging alternative is to use a decision support system (DSS), which typically relies on gaining
insights from observational data in order to assist a customer in making decisions regarding optimal
deployment or redeployment of cloud applications. The primary activity of such systems is the generation
of a prediction model (e.g. using machine learning), which requires a significantly large amount
of training data. However, considering the varying architectures of applications, cloud providers,
and cloud offerings, this activity is not sustainable as it incurs additional time and cost to collect
training data and subsequently train the models. We overcome this through developing a Transfer
Learning (TL) approach where the knowledge (in the form of the prediction model and associated data
set) gained from running an application on a particular cloud infrastructure is transferred in
order to substantially reduce the overhead of building new models for the performance of new applications
and/or cloud infrastructures. In this paper, we present our approach and evaluate it through extensive
experimentation involving three real world applications over two major public cloud providers,
namely Amazon and Google. Our evaluation shows that our novel two-mode TL scheme increases overall
efficiency with a factor of 60\% reduction in the time and cost of generating a new prediction model.
We test this under a number of cross-application and cross-cloud scenarios.
