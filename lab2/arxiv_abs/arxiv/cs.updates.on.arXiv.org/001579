The extreme learning machine (ELM) is a novel and effective machine learning method. It has been
successfully applied to many pattern recognition problems. However, the classification results
are not good enough when it is applied to the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. This is because
the ELM suffers from some drawbacks. One is the randomness of input weights and bias can result in
ill-posed problems, then this would result in the optimal output weight of ELM can not obtain. Another
one is this method fails to extract the spatial information. To overcome these two difficulties,
this paper proposes a new framework for applying the ELM to perform the hyperspectral image (HSI)
classification. First, the ELM is represented by a probabilistic model under the maximum a posteriori
(MAP). Then it was represented by a concave logarithmic likelihood function. Second, the sparse
representation is adopted to the Laplacian prior in order to find a logarithmic posterior with a
unique maximum. This can improve the speed of the proposed algorithm. Besides, the variable splitting
and the augmented Lagrangian are subsequently used. It can also significantly reduce the computation
complexity of the proposed algorithm. Third, the spatial information is utilized to construct
the spectral-spatial framework for performing the HSI classification based on the weighted composite
features (WCFs) method. This can further improve the performance of the proposed algorithms. The
lower bound of the proposed methods is also derived by a rigorous mathematical proof. Experimental
results on the real HSI data sets such as the Indian Pines data set and the Pavia University data set
demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms many state of the art methods.
