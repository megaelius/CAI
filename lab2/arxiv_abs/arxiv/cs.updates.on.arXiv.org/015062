Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects the brain connectivity at different levels. Nonetheless,
non-invasively distinguishing such effects using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains very
challenging to machine learning diagnostic frameworks due to ASD heterogeneity. So far, existing
network neuroscience works mainly focused on functional (derived from functional MRI) and structural
(derived from diffusion MRI) brain connectivity, which might not capture relational morphological
changes between brain regions. Indeed, machine learning (ML) studies for ASD diagnosis using morphological
brain networks derived from conventional T1-weighted MRI are very scarce. To fill this gap, we leverage
crowdsourcing by organizing a Kaggle competition to build a pool of machine learning pipelines
for neurological disorder diagnosis with application to ASD diagnosis using cortical morphological
networks derived from T1-weighted MRI. During the competition, participants were provided with
a training dataset and only allowed to check their performance on a public test data. The final evaluation
was performed on both public and hidden test datasets based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
metrics. Teams were ranked using each performance metric separately and the final ranking was determined
based on the mean of all rankings. The first-ranked team achieved 70% accuracy, 72.5% sensitivity,
and 67.5% specificity, while the second-ranked team achieved 63.8%, 62.5%, 65% respectively.
Leveraging participants to design ML diagnostic methods within a competitive machine learning
setting has allowed the exploration and benchmarking of wide spectrum of ML methods for ASD diagnosis
using cortical morphological networks.
