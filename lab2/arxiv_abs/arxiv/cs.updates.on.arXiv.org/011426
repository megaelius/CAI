Various methods are proposed in the literature to mitigate the failures in an infrastructure network.
Failure mitigation can be carried out in an active or passive manner. In active manner, live backups
provide the required reliability. Due to the high cost of active backups, failures can be mitigated
in a reactive manner where mitigation starts when a function fails. In this paper, network functions
are divided into two classes of essential (i.e., core) functions and additive (i.e., service) functions.
Core functions need active backups and cannot tolerate any failure. However, additive functions
do not require backups and their absence is tolerable in short periods. Maximum tolerable (function)
absence time (TAT) is a measure used for their reliability level. In our model and within the mitigation
process, first, the backup host to migrate the failed function is selected. Then, the state of the
function is migrated. The process should be carried out in less than TAT. An optimization problem
is formulated investigating cost-effective failure mitigation of additive functions. The problem
is of mixed integer non convex form. To tackle the computational complexity, it is bisected into
two back-to-back leader-follower parts. The leader selects the migration destinations and the
follower divides network resources among functions for migration. These problems are both NP-hard.
For the leader problem, a central heuristic based on the Viterbi algorithm suggested. The follower
problem is converted into two convex sub-problems. The validity of the proposed algorithms is proved
via extensive numerical results.
