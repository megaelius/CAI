In this paper we consider a general problem set-up for a wide class of convex and robust distributed
optimization problems in peer-to-peer networks. In this set-up convex constraint sets are distributed
to the network processors who have to compute the optimizer of a linear cost function subject to the
constraints. We propose a novel fully distributed algorithm, named cutting-plane consensus,
to solve the problem, based on an outer polyhedral approximation of the constraint sets. Processors
running the algorithm compute and exchange linear approximations of their locally feasible sets.
Independently of the number of processors in the network, each processor stores only a small number
of linear constraints, making the algorithm scalable to large networks. The cutting-plane consensus
algorithm is presented and analyzed for the general framework. Specifically, we prove that all
processors running the algorithm agree on an optimizer of the global problem, and that the algorithm
is tolerant to node and link failures as long as network connectivity is preserved. Then, the cutting
plane consensus algorithm is specified to three different classes of distributed optimization
problems, namely (i) inequality constrained problems, (ii) robust optimization problems, and
(iii) almost separable optimization problems with separable objective functions and coupling
constraints. For each one of these problem classes we solve a concrete problem that can be expressed
in that framework and present computational results. That is, we show how to solve: position estimation
in wireless sensor networks, a distributed robust linear program and, a distributed microgrid
control problem.
