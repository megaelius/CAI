A small subset of combinatorial sequences have coefficients that can be represented as moments
of a nonnegative measure on $[0, \infty)$. Such sequences are known as Stieltjes moment sequences.
This article focuses on some classical sequences in enumerative combinatorics, denoted $Av(\mathcal{P})$,
and counting permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n \}$ that avoid some given pattern $\mathcal{P}$.
For increasing patterns $\mathcal{P}=(12\ldots k)$, we recall that the corresponding sequences,
$Av(123\ldots k)$, are Stieltjes moment sequences, and we explicitly find the underlying density
function, either exactly or numerically, by using the Stieltjes inversion formula as a fundamental
tool. We show that the generating functions of the sequences $\, Av(1234)$ and $\, Av(12345)$ correspond,
up to simple rational functions, to an order-one linear differential operator acting on a classical
modular form given as a pullback of a Gaussian $\, _2F_1$ hypergeometric function, respectively
to an order-two linear differential operator acting on the square of a classical modular form given
as a pullback of a $\, _2F_1$ hypergeometric function. We demonstrate that the density function
for the Stieltjes moment sequence $Av(123\ldots k)$ is closely, but non-trivially, related to
the density attached to the distance traveled by a walk in the plane with $k-1$ unit steps in random
directions. Finally, we study the challenging case of the $Av(1324)$ sequence and give compelling
numerical evidence that this too is a Stieltjes moment sequence. Accepting this, we show how rigorous
lower bounds on the growth constant of this sequence can be constructed, which are stronger than
existing bounds. A further unproven assumption leads to even better bounds, which can be extrapolated
to give an estimate of the (unknown) growth constant.
