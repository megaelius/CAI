Taxi demand prediction has recently attracted increasing research interest due to its huge potential
application in large-scale intelligent transportation systems. However, most of the previous
methods only considered the taxi demand prediction in origin regions, but neglected the modeling
of the specific situation of the destination passengers. We believe it is suboptimal to preallocate
the taxi into each region based solely on the taxi origin demand. In this paper, we present a challenging
and worth-exploring task, called taxi origin-destination demand prediction, which aims at predicting
the taxi demand between all region pairs in a future time interval. Its main challenges come from
how to effectively capture the diverse contextual information to learn the demand patterns. We
address this problem with a novel Contextualized Spatial-Temporal Network (CSTN), which consists
of three components for the modeling of local spatial context (LSC), temporal evolution context
(TEC) and global correlation context (GCC) respectively. Firstly, an LSC module utilizes two convolution
neural networks to learn the local spatial dependencies of taxi demand respectively from the origin
view and the destination view. Secondly, a TEC module incorporates both the local spatial features
of taxi demand and the meteorological information to a Convolutional Long Short-term Memory Network
(ConvLSTM) for the analysis of taxi demand evolution. Finally, a GCC module is applied to model the
correlation between all regions by computing a global correlation feature as a weighted sum of all
regional features, with the weights being calculated as the similarity between the corresponding
region pairs. Extensive experiments and evaluations on a large-scale dataset well demonstrate
the superiority of our CSTN over other compared methods for taxi origin-destination demand prediction.
