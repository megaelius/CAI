Agent Based Models are very popular in a number of different areas. For example, they have been used
in a range of domains ranging from modeling of tumor growth, immune systems, molecules to models
of social networks, crowds and computer and mobile self-organizing networks. One reason for their
success is their intuitiveness and similarity to human cognition. However, with this power of abstraction,
in spite of being easily applicable to such a wide number of domains, it is hard to validate agent-based
models. In addition, building valid and credible simulations is not just a challenging task but
also a crucial exercise to ensure that what we are modeling is, at some level of abstraction, a model
of our conceptual system; the system that we have in mind. In this paper, we address this important
area of validation of agent based models by presenting a novel technique which has broad applicability
and can be applied to all kinds of agent-based models. We present a framework, where a virtual overlay
multi-agent system can be used to validate simulation models. In addition, since agent-based models
have been typically growing, in parallel, in multiple domains, to cater for all of these, we present
a new single validation technique applicable to all agent based models. Our technique, which allows
for the validation of agent based simulations uses VOMAS: a Virtual Overlay Multi-agent System.
This overlay multi-agent system can comprise various types of agents, which form an overlay on top
of the agent based simulation model that needs to be validated. Other than being able to watch and
log, each of these agents contains clearly defined constraints, which, if violated, can be logged
in real time. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we show its broad applicability in a wide variety
of simulation models ranging from social sciences to computer networks in spatial and non-spatial
conceptual models.
