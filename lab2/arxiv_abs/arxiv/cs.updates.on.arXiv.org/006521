Social network and publishing platforms, such as Twitter, support the concept of verification.
Verified accounts are deemed worthy of platform-wide public interest and are separately authenticated
by the platform itself. There have been repeated assertions by these platforms about verification
not being tantamount to endorsement. However, a significant body of prior work suggests that possessing
a verified status symbolizes enhanced credibility in the eyes of the platform audience. As a result,
such a status is highly coveted among public figures and influencers. Hence, we attempt to characterize
the network of verified users on Twitter and compare the results to similar analysis performed for
the entire Twitter network. We extracted the entire network of verified users on Twitter (as of July
2018) and obtained 231,246 user profiles and 79,213,811 connections. Subsequently in the network
analysis, we found that the sub-graph of verified users mirrors the full Twitter users graph in some
aspects such as possessing a short diameter. However, our findings contrast with earlier findings
on multiple aspects, such as the possession of a power law out-degree distribution, slight dissortativity
and a significantly higher reciprocity rate, as elucidated in the paper. Moreover, we attempt to
gauge the presence of salient components within this sub-graph and detect the absence of homophily
with respect to popularity, which again is in stark contrast to the full Twitter graph. Finally,
we demonstrate stationarity in the time series of verified user activity levels. To the best of our
knowledge, this work represents the first quantitative attempt at characterizing verified users
on Twitter.
