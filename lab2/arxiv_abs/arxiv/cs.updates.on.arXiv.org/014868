Proactive management of an Infodemic that grows faster than the underlying epidemic is a modern-day
challenge. This requires raising awareness and sensitization with the correct information in
order to prevent and contain outbreaks such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, there
is a fine balance between continuous awareness-raising by providing new information and the risk
of misinformation. In this work, we address this gap by creating a life-long learning application
that delivers authentic information to users in Hindi and English, the most widely used languages
in India. It does this by matching sources of verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports
against daily news by using machine learning and natural language processing. It delivers the narrated
content in Hindi by using state-of-the-art text to speech engines. Finally, the approach allows
user input for continuous improvement of news feed relevance daily. We demonstrate this approach
for Water, Sanitation, Hygiene information for containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirteen
combinations of pre-processing strategies, word-embeddings, and similarity metrics were evaluated
by eight human users via calculation of agreement statistics. The best performing combination
achieved a Cohen's Kappa of 0.54 and was deployed as On AIr, WashKaro's AI-powered back-end. We introduced
a novel way of contact tracing, deploying the Bluetooth sensors of an individual's smartphone and
automatic recording of physical interactions with other users. Additionally, the application
also features a symptom self-assessment tool based on WHO-approved guidelines, human-curated
and vetted information to reach out to the community as audio-visual content in local languages.
