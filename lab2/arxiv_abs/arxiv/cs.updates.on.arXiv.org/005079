There is ever growing demand for satellite constellations that perform global positioning, remote
sensing, earth-imaging and relay communication. In these highly prized orbits, there are many
obsolete and abandoned satellites and components strewn posing ever-growing logistical challenges.
This increased demand for satellite constellations pose challenges for space traffic management,
where there is growing need to identify the risks probabilities and if possible mitigate them. These
abandoned satellites and space debris maybe economically valuable orbital real-estate and resources
that can be reused, repaired or upgraded for future use. On-orbit capture and servicing of a satellite
requires satellite rendezvous, docking and repair, removal and replacement of components. Launching
a big spacecraft that perform satellites servicing is one credible approach for servicing and maintaining
next-generation constellations. By accessing abandoned satellites and space debris, there is
an inherent heightened risk of damage to a servicing spacecraft. Under these scenarios, sending
multiple, small-robots with each robot specialized in a specific task is a credible alternative,
as the system is simple and cost-effective and where loss of one or more of robot does not end the mission.
Eliminating the need for a large spacecraft or positioning the large spacecraft at safe distance
to provide position, navigation and tracking support simplifies the system and enable the approach
to be extensible with the latest ground-based sensing technology. In this work, we analyze the feasibility
of sending multiple, decentralized robots that can work cooperatively to perform capture of the
target satellite as first steps to on-orbit satellite servicing.
