Patients initially diagnosed with early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) are known to be a clinically
heterogeneous group with very subtle patterns of brain atrophy. To examine the boarders between
normal controls (NC) and eMCI, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was extensively used as a non-invasive
imaging modality to pin-down subtle changes in brain images of MCI patients. However, eMCI research
remains limited by the number of available MRI acquisition timepoints. Ideally, one would learn
how to diagnose MCI patients in an early stage from MRI data acquired at a single timepoint, while
leveraging 'non-existing' follow-up observations. To this aim, we propose novel supervised and
unsupervised frameworks that learn how to jointly predict and label the evolution trajectory of
intensity patches, each seeded at a specific brain landmark, from a baseline intensity patch. Specifically,
both strategies aim to identify the best training atlas patches at baseline timepoint to predict
and classify the evolution trajectory of a given testing baseline patch. The supervised technique
learns how to select the best atlas patches by training bidirectional mappings from the space of
pairwise patch similarities to their corresponding prediction errors -when one patch was used
to predict the other. On the other hand, the unsupervised technique learns a manifold of baseline
atlas and testing patches using multiple kernels to well capture patch distributions at multiple
scales. Once the best baseline atlas patches are selected, we retrieve their evolution trajectories
and average them to predict the evolution trajectory of the testing baseline patch. Next, we input
the predicted trajectories to an ensemble of linear classifiers, each trained at a specific landmark.
Our classification accuracy increased by up to 10% points in comparison to single timepoint-based
classification methods.
