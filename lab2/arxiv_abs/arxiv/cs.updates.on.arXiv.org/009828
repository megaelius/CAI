It has become increasingly difficult to understand the complex interaction between modern applications
and main memory, composed of DRAM chips. Manufacturers are now selling and proposing many different
types of DRAM, with each DRAM type catering to different needs (e.g., high throughput, low power,
high memory density). At the same time, the memory access patterns of prevalent and emerging workloads
are rapidly diverging, as these applications manipulate larger data sets in very different ways.
As a result, the combined DRAM-workload behavior is often difficult to intuitively determine today,
which can hinder memory optimizations in both hardware and software. In this work, we identify important
families of workloads, as well as prevalent types of DRAM chips, and rigorously analyze the combined
DRAM--workload behavior. To this end, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of the interaction
between nine different DRAM types and 115 modern applications and multiprogrammed workloads.
We draw 12 key observations from our characterization, enabled in part by our development of new
metrics that take into account contention between memory requests due to hardware design. Notably,
we find that (1) newer DRAM types such as DDR4 and HMC often do not outperform older types such as DDR3,
due to higher access latencies and, in the case of HMC, poor exploitation of locality; (2) there is
no single DRAM type that can cater to all components of a heterogeneous system (e.g., GDDR5 significantly
outperforms other memories for multimedia acceleration, while HMC significantly outperforms
other memories for network acceleration); and (3) there is still a strong need to lower DRAM latency,
but unfortunately the current design trend of commodity DRAM is toward higher latencies to obtain
other benefits. We hope that the trends we identify can drive optimizations in both hardware and
software design.
