Conventional seismic techniques for detecting the subsurface geologic features are challenged
by limited data coverage, computational inefficiency, and subjective human factors. We developed
a novel data-driven geological feature detection approach based on pre-stack seismic measurements.
Our detection method employs an efficient and accurate machine-learning detection approach to
extract useful subsurface geologic features automatically. Specifically, our method is based
on kernel ridge regression model. The conventional kernel ridge regression can be computationally
prohibited because of the large volume of seismic measurements. We employ a data reduction technique
in combination with the conventional kernel ridge regression method to improve the computational
efficiency and reduce memory usage. In particular, we utilize a randomized numerical linear algebra
technique, named Nystr\"om method, to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature space
without compromising the information content required for accurate detection. We provide thorough
computational cost analysis to show efficiency of our new geological feature detection methods.
We further validate the performance of our new subsurface geologic feature detection method using
synthetic surface seismic data for 2D acoustic and elastic velocity models. Our numerical examples
demonstrate that our new detection method significantly improves the computational efficiency
while maintaining comparable accuracy. Interestingly, we show that our method yields a speed-up
ratio on the order of $\sim10^2$ to $\sim 10^3$ in a multi-core computational environment.
