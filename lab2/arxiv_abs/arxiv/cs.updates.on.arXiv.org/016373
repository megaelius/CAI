Nowadays, there are many applications of text mining over corpus from different languages, such
as using supervised machine learning in order to predict labels associated to a text using as predictors
features derived from the text itself. However, most of these applications are based on texts in
prose, with a lack of applications that work with poetry texts. An example of application of text
mining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual word in order to capture the
lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer the General Affective Meaning (GAM) of
the text. However, though this proposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there
is a lack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic compositions such
as sonnets. This article presents a study over a labeled corpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse
if it is possible to build features from their individual words in order to predict their GAM. The
purpose of this is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the relationship
between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this, we consider the content from a psychological
perspective, identifying with tags when a sonnet is related to a specific term (p.e, when the sonnet's
content is related to "daydream"). Then, we study how the GAM changes according to each of those psychological
terms. The corpus contains 230 Spanish sonnets from authors of different centuries, from 15th to
19th. This corpus was annotated by different domain experts. The experts annotated the poems with
affective features, as well as with domain concepts that belong to psychology. Thanks to this, the
corpora of sonnets can be used in different applications, such as poetry recommender systems, personality
text mining studies of the authors, or the usage of poetry for therapeutic purposes.
