Directed Steiner Tree (DST) is a central problem in combinatorial optimization and theoretical
computer science. Recently, Grandoni, Laekhanukit and Li and independently Ghuge and Nagarajan
gave quasi-polynomial time $O(\log^2k/\log \log k)$-approximation algorithms for the problem,
which is tight under popular complexity assumptions. In this paper, we show a general framework
that achieves $O(\log n \log k)$-approximation for many variants of DST. We show that if the problem
has the property that the validity of the tree and its cost can be checked and computed using a bottom-to-top
procedure, then the general framework can be used to produce a small-cost {multi-tree}: a tree that
may contain multiple copies of a vertex or an edge. Using the framework, we show that two prominent
variants of DST, namely Length-Bounded DST (LB-DST) and Buy-at-Bulk DST with Concave Cost Functions
(BaB-DST-Concave), admit $O(\log n \log k)$-approximation algorithms. In the Length-Bounded
Directed Steiner Tree (LB-DST) problem, there are bounds on lengths of paths from the root to vertices
in the output tree. In the Buy-at-Bulk DST problem with Concave Functions (BaB-DST-Concave), each
terminal needs to receive a flow from the root and the cost of each edge is a concave function on the
total amount of flow that it carries. Our results almost match the best known $O(\log ^2k/\log \log
k)$ algorithm that have recently been discovered by Ghuge and Nagarajan. Another variant that fits
into the framework is the Degree-Bounded DST (DB-DST) problem. In this problem, we are additionally
given a degree bound $d_v$ on each vertex $v \in V$, which imposes the constraint that $v$ is allowed
to have at most $d_v$ children in the output tree. In this case, our framework gives an $O(\log^3n
\log k, \log n\log k)$-bicritiera approximation, which is the first non-trivial result for the
problem.
