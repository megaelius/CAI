Monte Carlo simulations of quantum field theories on a lattice become increasingly expensive as
the continuum limit is approached since the cost per independent sample grows with a high power of
the inverse lattice spacing. Simulations on fine lattices suffer from critical slowdown, the rapid
growth of autocorrelations in the Markov chain with decreasing lattice spacing. This causes a strong
increase in the number of lattice configurations that have to be generated to obtain statistically
significant results. This paper discusses hierarchical sampling methods to tame this growth in
autocorrelations. Combined with multilevel variance reduction, this significantly reduces
the computational cost of simulations for given tolerances $\epsilon_{\text{disc}}$ on the discretisation
error and $\epsilon_{\text{stat}}$ on the statistical error. For an observable with lattice errors
of order $\alpha$ and an integrated autocorrelation time that grows like $\tau_{\mathrm{int}}\propto
a^{-z}$, multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) can reduce the cost from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-(1+z)/\alpha})$
to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\vert\log \epsilon_{\text{disc}} \vert^2+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$.
Even higher performance gains are expected for simulations of quantum field theories in $D$ dimensions.
The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on two model systems, including a topological oscillator
that is badly affected by critical slowdown due to freezing of the topological charge. On fine lattices,
the new methods are orders of magnitude faster than standard sampling based on Hybrid Monte Carlo.
For high resolutions, MLMC can be used to accelerate even the cluster algorithm for the topological
oscillator. Performance is further improved through perturbative matching which guarantees
efficient coupling of theories on the multilevel hierarchy.
