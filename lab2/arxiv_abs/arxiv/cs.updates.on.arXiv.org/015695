Contact tracing is an important measure to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. In the early phase, many
countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the rate of disease spread, however it has
many issues. The manual approach is cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation
of a large number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital contact tracing
has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact tracing application on people's
mobile devices which can track their movements and close social interactions. While studies suggest
that digital contact tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed
that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better controlled epidemic.
This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the collected data and the subsequent analytics.
One key reason for low adoption rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual
privacy. In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in multiple
countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for mass surveillance by the concerned
governments. Hence, privacy respecting contact tracing application is the need of the hour that
can lead to highly effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on various
cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set Intersection problem which
lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact tracing. We analyze the computation and communication
complexities of these techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact
tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication complexity expressions
for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic techniques that can be more suitably deployed
there.
