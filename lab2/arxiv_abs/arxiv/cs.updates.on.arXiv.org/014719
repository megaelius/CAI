Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against a new invisible enemy:
Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading
of the virus. War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics
and diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of war-related metaphors
too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass
communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus
of 200k tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze
the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used
to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of
social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame
to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as
control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal frame covers a wider portion of
the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the
most conventional one. However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around
many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions,
a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu, may facilitate the communication of various aspects
involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the
expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current pandemic.
