Fast computation of three-dimensional gravity and magnetic forward models is considered. Measurement
data is assumed to be obtained on a uniform grid which is staggered with respect to the discretization
of the parameter volume. Then, the resulting kernel sensitivity matrices exhibit block-Toeplitz
Toeplitz-block (BTTB) structure. These matrices are symmetric for the gravity problem but non-symmetric
for the magnetic problem. In each case, the structure facilitates fast forward computation using
two-dimensional fast Fourier transforms. The construction of the kernel matrices and the application
of the transform for fast forward multiplication, for each problem, is carefully described. But,
for purposes of comparison with the transform approach, the generation of the unique entries that
define a given kernel matrix is also explained. It is also demonstrated how the matrices, and hence
transforms, are adjusted when padding around the volume domain is introduced. The transform algorithms
for fast forward matrix multiplication with the sensitivity matrix and its transpose, without
the direct construction of the relevant matrices, are presented. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the significant reduction in computation time that is achieved using the transform implementation.
Moreover, it becomes feasible, both in terms of reduced memory requirements and computational
time, to implement the transform algorithms for large three-dimensional volumes. All presented
algorithms, including with variable padding, are coded for optimal memory, storage and computation
as an open source MATLAB code which can be adapted for any convolution kernel which generates a BTTB
matrix. This work, therefore, provides a general tool for the efficient simulation of gravity and
magnetic field data, as well as any formulation which admits a sensitivity matrix with the required
structure.
