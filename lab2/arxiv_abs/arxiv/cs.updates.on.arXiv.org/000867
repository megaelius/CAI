Motivated by Internet targeted advertising, we address several ad allocation problems. Prior
work has established these problems admit no randomized online algorithm better than $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-competitive
(\cite{karp1990optimal,mehta2007adwords}), yet simple heuristics have been observed to perform
much better in practice. We explain this phenomenon by studying a generalization of the bounded-degree
inputs considered by Buchbinder et al.~\cite{buchbinder2007online}, graphs which we call $(k,d)-bounded$.
In such graphs the maximal degree on the online side is at most $d$ and the minimal degree on the offline
side is at least $k$. We prove that for such graphs, these problems' natural greedy algorithms attain
competitive ratio $1-\frac{d-1}{k+d-1}$, tending to \emph{one} as $d/k$ tends to zero. We prove
this bound is tight for these algorithms. Next, we develop deterministic primal-dual algorithms
for the above problems achieving competitive ratio $1-(1-\frac{1}{d})^k>1-\frac{1}{e^{k/d}}$,
or \emph{exponentially} better loss as a function of $k/d$, and strictly better than $1-\frac{1}{e}$
whenever $k\geq d$. We complement our lower bounds with matching upper bounds for the vertex-weighted
problem. Finally, we use our deterministic algorithms to prove by dual-fitting that simple randomized
algorithms achieve the same bounds in expectation. Our algorithms and analysis differ from previous
ad allocation algorithms, which largely scale bids based on the spent fraction of their bidder's
budget, whereas we scale bids according to the number of times the bidder could have spent as much
as her current bid. Our algorithms differ from previous online primal-dual algorithms, as they
do not maintain dual feasibility, but only primal-to-dual ratio, and only attain dual feasibility
upon termination. We believe our techniques could find applications to other well-behaved online
packing problems.
