This paper presents an automated peer-to-peer negotiation strategy for settling energy contracts
among prosumers in a Residential Energy Cooperative considering heterogeneity prosumer preferences.
The heterogeneity arises from prosumers' evaluation of energy contracts through multiple societal
and environmental criteria and the prosumers' private preferences over those criteria. The prosumers
engage in bilateral negotiations with peers to mutually agree on periodical energy contracts/loans
consisting of the energy volume to be exchanged at that period and the return time of the exchanged
energy. The negotiating prosumers navigate through a common negotiation domain consisting of
potential energy contracts and evaluate those contracts from their valuations on the entailed
criteria against a utility function that is robust against generation and demand uncertainty.
From the repeated interactions, a prosumer gradually learns about the compatibility of its peers
in reaching energy contracts that are closer to Nash solutions. Empirical evaluation on real demand,
generation and storage profiles -- in multiple system scales -- illustrates that the proposed negotiation
based strategy can increase the system efficiency (measured by utilitarian social welfare) and
fairness (measured by Nash social welfare) over a baseline strategy and an individual flexibility
control strategy representing the status quo strategy. We thus elicit system benefits from peer-to-peer
flexibility exchange already without any central coordination and market operator, providing
a simple yet flexible and effective paradigm that complements existing markets.
