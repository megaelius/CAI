It is widely believed that one's peers influence product adoption behaviors. This relationship
has been linked to the number of signals a decision-maker receives in a social network. But it is unclear
if these same principles hold when the pattern by which it receives these signals vary and when peer
influence is directed towards choices which are not optimal. To investigate that, we manipulate
social signal exposure in an online controlled experiment using a game with human participants.
Each participant in the game makes a decision among choices with differing utilities. We observe
the following: (1) even in the presence of monetary risks and previously acquired knowledge of the
choices, decision-makers tend to deviate from the obvious optimal decision when their peers make
similar decision which we call the influence decision, (2) when the quantity of social signals vary
over time, the forwarding probability of the influence decision and therefore being responsive
to social influence does not necessarily correlate proportionally to the absolute quantity of
signals. To better understand how these rules of peer influence could be used in modeling applications
of real world diffusion and in networked environments, we use our behavioral findings to simulate
spreading dynamics in real world case studies. We specifically try to see how cumulative influence
plays out in the presence of user uncertainty and measure its outcome on rumor diffusion, which we
model as an example of sub-optimal choice diffusion. Together, our simulation results indicate
that sequential peer effects from the influence decision overcomes individual uncertainty to
guide faster rumor diffusion over time. However, when the rate of diffusion is slow in the beginning,
user uncertainty can have a substantial role compared to peer influence in deciding the adoption
trajectory of a piece of questionable information.
