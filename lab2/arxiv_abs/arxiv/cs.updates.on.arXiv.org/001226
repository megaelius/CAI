Interactive proofs (IP) model a world where a verifier delegates computation to an untrustworthy
prover, verifying the prover's claims before accepting them. IP protocols have applications in
areas such as verifiable computation outsourcing, computation delegation, cloud computing.
In these applications, the verifier may pay the prover based on the quality of his work. Rational
interactive proofs (RIP), introduced by Azar and Micali (2012), are an interactive-proof system
with payments, in which the prover is rational rather than untrustworthy---he may lie, but only
to increase his payment. Rational proofs leverage the provers' rationality to obtain simple and
efficient protocols. Azar and Micali show that RIP=IP(=PSAPCE). They leave the question of whether
multiple provers are more powerful than a single prover for rational and classical proofs as an open
problem. In this paper, we introduce multi-prover rational interactive proofs (MRIP). Here, a
verifier cross-checks the provers' answers with each other and pays them according to the messages
exchanged. The provers are cooperative and maximize their total expected payment if and only if
the verifier learns the correct answer to the problem. We further refine the model of MRIP to incorporate
utility gap, which is the loss in payment suffered by provers who mislead the verifier to the wrong
answer. We define the class of MRIP protocols with constant, noticeable and negligible utility
gaps. We give tight characterization for all three MRIP classes. On the way, we resolve Azar and Micali's
open problem---under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, MRIP is not only more powerful
than RIP, but also more powerful than MIP; and this is true even the utility gap is required to be constant.
We further show that the full power of each MRIP class can be achieved using only two provers and three
rounds.
