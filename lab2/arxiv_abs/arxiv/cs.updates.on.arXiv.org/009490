Treatment recommendations within Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are largely based on findings
from clinical trials and case studies, referred to here as research studies, that are often based
on highly selective clinical populations, referred to here as study cohorts. When medical practitioners
apply CPG recommendations, they need to understand how well their patient population matches the
characteristics of those in the study cohort, and thus are confronted with the challenges of locating
the study cohort information and making an analytic comparison. To address these challenges, we
develop an ontology-enabled prototype system, which exposes the population descriptions in research
studies in a declarative manner, with the ultimate goal of allowing medical practitioners to better
understand the applicability and generalizability of treatment recommendations. We build a Study
Cohort Ontology (SCO) to encode the vocabulary of study population descriptions, that are often
reported in the first table in the published work, thus they are often referred to as Table 1. We leverage
the well-used Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) for defining property associations
between classes. Further, we model the key components of Table 1s, i.e., collections of study subjects,
subject characteristics, and statistical measures in RDF knowledge graphs. We design scenarios
for medical practitioners to perform population analysis, and generate cohort similarity visualizations
to determine the applicability of a study population to the clinical population of interest. Our
semantic approach to make study populations visible, by standardized representations of Table
1s, allows users to quickly derive clinically relevant inferences about study populations.
