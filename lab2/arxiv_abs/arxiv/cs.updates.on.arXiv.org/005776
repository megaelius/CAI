With the advent of modern data collection and storage technologies, data-driven approaches have
been developed for discovering the governing partial differential equations (PDE) of physical
problems. However, in the extant works the model parameters in the equations are either assumed
to be known or have a linear dependency. Therefore, most of the realistic physical processes cannot
be identified with the current data-driven PDE discovery approaches. In this study, an innovative
framework is developed that combines data-driven and data-assimilation methods for simultaneously
identifying physical processes and inferring model parameters. Spatiotemporal measurement
data are first divided into a training data set and a testing data set. Using the training data set,
a data-driven method is developed to learn the governing equation of the considered physical problem
by identifying the occurred (or dominated) processes and selecting the proper empirical model.
Through introducing a prediction error of the learned governing equation for the testing data set,
a data-assimilation method is devised to estimate the uncertain model parameters of the selected
empirical model. For the contaminant transport problem investigated, the results demonstrate
that the proposed method can adequately identify the considered physical processes via concurrently
discovering the corresponding governing equations and inferring uncertain parameters of nonlinear
models, even in the presence of measurement errors. This work helps to broaden the applicable area
of the research of data driven discovery of governing equations of physical problems.
