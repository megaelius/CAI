We examine volume computation of general-dimensional polytopes and more general convex bodies,
defined as the intersection of a simplex by a family of parallel hyperplanes, and another family
of parallel hyperplanes or a family of concentric ellipsoids. Such convex bodies appear in modeling
and predicting financial crises. The impact of crises on the economy (labor, income, etc.) makes
its detection of prime interest. Certain features of dependencies in the markets clearly identify
times of turmoil. We describe the relationship between asset characteristics by means of a copula;
each characteristic is either a linear or quadratic form of the portfolio components, hence the
copula can be constructed by computing volumes of convex bodies. We design and implement practical
algorithms in the exact and approximate setting, we experimentally juxtapose them and study the
tradeoff of exactness and accuracy for speed. We analyze the following methods in order of increasing
generality: rejection sampling relying on uniformly sampling the simplex, which is the fastest
approach, but inaccurate for small volumes; exact formulae based on the computation of integrals
of probability distribution functions; an optimized Lawrence sign decomposition method, since
the polytopes at hand are shown to be simple; Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms using random walks
based on the hit-and-run paradigm generalized to nonlinear convex bodies and relying on new methods
for computing a ball enclosed; the latter is experimentally extended to non-convex bodies with
very encouraging results. Our C++ software, based on CGAL and Eigen and available on github, is shown
to be very effective in up to 100 dimensions. Our results offer novel, effective means of computing
portfolio dependencies and an indicator of financial crises, which is shown to correctly identify
past crises.
