Efficient user revocation is a necessary but challenging problem in many multi-user cryptosystems.
Among known approaches, server-aided revocation yields a promising solution, because it allows
to outsource the major workloads of system users to a computationally powerful third party, called
the server, whose only requirement is to carry out the computations correctly. Such a revocation
mechanism was considered in the settings of identity-based encryption and attribute-based encryption
by Qin et al. (ESORICS 2015) and Cui et al. (ESORICS 2016), respectively. In this work, we consider
the server-aided revocation mechanism in the more elaborate setting of predicate encryption (PE).
The latter, introduced by Katz, Sahai, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2008), provides fine-grained and
role-based access to encrypted data and can be viewed as a generalization of identity-based and
attribute-based encryption. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we formalize the model of server-aided
revocable predicate encryption (SR-PE), with rigorous definitions and security notions. Our
model can be seen as a non-trivial adaptation of Cui et al.'s work into the PE context. Second, we put
forward a lattice-based instantiation of SR-PE. The scheme employs the PE scheme of Agrawal, Freeman
and Vaikuntanathan (ASIACRYPT 2011) and the complete subtree method of Naor, Naor, and Lotspiech
(CRYPTO 2001) as the two main ingredients, which work smoothly together thanks to a few additional
techniques. Our scheme is proven secure in the standard model (in a selective manner), based on the
hardness of the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem.
