A mathematical topology with matrix is a natural representation of a coding relational structure
that is found in many fields of the world. Matrices are very important in computation of real applications,
s ce matrices are easy saved in computer and run quickly, as well as matrices are convenient to deal
with communities of current networks, such as Laplacian matrices, adjacent matrices in graph theory.
Motivated from convenient, useful and powerful matrices used in computation and investigation
of today's networks, we have introduced Topcode-matrices, which are matrices of order $3\times
q$ and differ from popular matrices applied in linear algebra and computer science. Topcode-matrices
can use numbers, letters, Chinese characters, sets, graphs, algebraic groups \emph{etc.} as their
elements. One important thing is that Topcode-matrices of numbers can derive easily number strings,
since number strings are text-based passwords used in information security. Topcode-matrices
can be used to describe topological graphic passwords (Topsnut-gpws) used in information security
and graph connected properties for solving some problems coming in the investigation of Graph Networks
and Graph Neural Networks proposed by GoogleBrain and DeepMind. Our topics, in this article, are:
Topsnut-matrices, Topcode-matrices, Hanzi-matrices, adjacency ve-value matrices and pan-Topcode-matrices,
and some connections between these Topcode-matrices will be proven. We will discuss algebraic
groups obtained from the above matrices, graph groups, graph networking groups and number string
groups for encrypting different communities of dynamic networks. The operations and results on
our matrices help us to set up our overall security mechanism to protect networks.
