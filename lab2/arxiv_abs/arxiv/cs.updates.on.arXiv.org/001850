In this paper, we propose a novel method for efficient implementation of a massive Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (massive MIMO) system with Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) operation. Our
main objective is to reduce the large overhead incurred by Downlink (DL) common training and Uplink
(UL) feedback needed to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Our proposed
scheme relies on the fact that the underlying angular distribution of a channel vector, also known
as the angular scattering function, is a frequency-invariant entity yielding a UL-DL reciprocity
and has a limited angular support. We estimate this support from UL CSI and interpolate it to obtain
the corresponding angular support of the DL channel. Finally we exploit the estimated support of
the DL channel of all the users to design an efficient channel probing and feedback scheme that maximizes
the total spectral efficiency of the system. Our method is different from the existing compressed-sensing
(CS) based techniques in the literature. Using support information helps reduce the feedback overhead
from O(s*log M) in CS techniques to O(s) in our proposed method, with $s$ and $M$ being sparsity order
of the channel vectors and the number of base station antennas, respectively. Furthermore, in order
to control the channel sparsity and therefore the DL common training and UL feedback overhead, we
introduce the novel concept of active channel sparsification. In brief, when the fixed pilot dimension
is less than the required amount for reliable channel estimation, we introduce a pre-beamforming
matrix that artificially reduces the effective channel dimension of each user to be not larger than
the DL pilot dimension, while maximizing both the number of served users and the number of probed
angles. We provide numerical experiments to compare our method with the state-of-the-art CS technique.
