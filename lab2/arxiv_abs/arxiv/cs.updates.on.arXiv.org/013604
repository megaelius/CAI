A multifield asymptotic homogenization technique for periodic thermo-diffusive elastic materials
is provided in the present study. Field equations for the first-order equivalent medium are derived
and overall constitutive tensors are obtained in closed form. These lasts depend upon the micro
constitutive properties of the different phases composing the composite material and upon periodic
perturbation functions, which allow taking into account the effects of microstructural heterogeneities.
Perturbation functions are determined as solutions of recursive non homogeneous cell problems
emanated from the substitution of asymptotic expansions of the micro fields in powers of the microstructural
characteristic size into local balance equations. Average field equations of infinite order are
also provided, whose formal solution can be obtained through asymptotic expansions of the macrofields.
With the aim of investigating dispersion properties of waves propagating inside the medium, proper
integral transforms are applied to governing field equations of the homogenized medium. A quadratic
generalized eigenvalue problem is thus obtained, whose solution characterizes the complex valued
frequency band structure of the first-order equivalent material. The validity of the proposed
technique has been confirmed by the very good matching obtained between dispersion curves of the
homogenized medium and the lowest frequency ones relative to the heterogeneous material. These
lasts are computed from the resolution of a quadratic generalized eigenvalue problem over the periodic
cell subjected to Floquet-Bloch boundary conditions. An illustrative benchmark is conducted
referring to a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC)-like material, whose microstructure can be modeled
through the spatial tessellation of the domain with a periodic cell subjected to thermo-diffusive
phenomena.
