Arabic handwriting is a consonantal and cursive writing. The analysis of Arabic script is further
complicated due to obligatory dots/strokes that are placed above or below most letters and usually
written delayed in order. Due to ambiguities and diversities of the different writing styles, recognition
systems are generally based on a set of possible words called lexicon (vocabulary). When the lexicon
is small, recognition accuracy is more important as the recognition time is minimal. On the other
hand, recognition speed as well as the accuracy are critical issues when handling large lexicons.
Arabic language is rich in morphology and syntax which makes its lexicon large. Therefore, a practical
online handwriting recognition system should be able to handle the large lexicon of the Arabic language
with reasonable performance in terms of both accuracy and time. In this paper, we introduce a fully-fledged
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based system for Arabic online handwriting recognition that provides
solutions for most of the difficulties inherent in recognizing the Arabic script. A new preprocessing
technique for handling the delayed strokes is introduced. We use advanced modeling techniques
for building our recognition system from the training data to provide more detailed representation
for the differences between the writing units, minimize the variances between writers in the training
data, enhance the models discrimination power and have a better representation for the features
space. The system results are enhanced using an additional post-processing step using a higher
order language model. The system performance is evaluated using two databases covering small and
large lexicons. Our proposed system outperforms state-of-art systems for the small lexicon database
and shows promising results (accuracy and time) when supporting large vocabulary.
