Recently, wireless caching techniques have been studied to satisfy lower delay requirements and
offload traffic from peak periods. By storing parts of the popular files at the mobile users, users
can locate some of their requested files in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the
latter case, when a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device(D2D) communication
is performed. D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks is also a new paradigm for the
upcoming wireless systems. By allowing a pair of adjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D
communication can achieve higher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay.
In this work, we propose an efficient learning-based caching algorithm operating together with
a non-parametric estimator to minimize the average transmission delay in D2D-enabled cellular
networks. It is assumed that the system does not have any prior information regarding the popularity
of the files, and the non-parametric estimator is aimed at learning the intensity function of the
file requests. An algorithm is devised to determine the best <file,user> pairs that provide the
best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy with very low transmission delay and
high throughput. This algorithm is also extended to address a more general scenario, in which the
distributions of fading coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over
time. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing
it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply cache their favorite files, and by comparing
with a probabilistic algorithm, in which the users cache a file with a probability that is proportional
to its popularity.
