V2V technologies bridge two infrastructures: the communications infrastructure and the transportation
infrastructure. These infrastructures are interconnected and interdependent. On the one hand,
the communications network enables V2V interactions, while, on the other hand, the density of vehicles
on the roadway enabled with V2V and the level of congestion on the roadway determine the speed and
quality of communications between vehicles and infrastructure. The V2V technology is expected
to contribute significantly to the growth of shared mobility, in turn, receives a significant boost
from the deployment of a large number of connected vehicles in shared mobility services, provided
challenges towards the deployment can be overcome. Vehicle mobility patterns and communication
conditions are not only heterogeneous, but they also evolve constantly, leading to dynamic coupling
between the communication and the transportation infrastructure. We consider the communication
of messages amongst the vehicles in a transportation network, and estimate how quickly messages
spread under different conditions of traffic density (traffic congestion, the presence of an accident,
and time of day such as morning and evening rush hour) and communication conditions. We developed
a continuous-time Markov chain to describe the information propagation process through enabled
vehicles. Our models converge to a solution of a set of clustered epidemiological differential
equations which lend itself to fast computation. We then demonstrate the applicability of this
model in various scenarios: both real-world scenarios and hypothesized scenarios of outages and
system perturbations. We find that our models match actual trajectory data with very little error,
demonstrating the applicability of our models to study the spread of information through a network
of connected vehicles.
