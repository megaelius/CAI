This paper considers the problems of modeling and predicting a long-term and "blurry" relapse that
occurs after a medical act, such as a surgery. We do not consider a short-term complication related
to the act itself, but a long-term relapse that clinicians cannot explain easily, since it depends
on unknown sets or sequences of past events that occurred before the act. The relapse is observed
only indirectly, in a "blurry" fashion, through longitudinal prescriptions of drugs over a long
period of time after the medical act. We introduce a new model, called ZiMM (Zero-inflated Mixture
of Multinomial distributions) in order to capture long-term and blurry relapses. On top of it, we
build an end-to-end deep-learning architecture called ZiMM Encoder-Decoder (ZiMM ED) that can
learn from the complex, irregular, highly heterogeneous and sparse patterns of health events that
are observed through a claims-only database. ZiMM ED is applied on a "non-clinical" claims database,
that contains only timestamped reimbursement codes for drug purchases, medical procedures and
hospital diagnoses, the only available clinical feature being the age of the patient. This setting
is more challenging than a setting where bedside clinical signals are available. Indeed, we consider
a dataset containing the claims of almost all French citizens who had surgery for prostatic problems,
with a history between 1.5 and 5 years. We consider a long-term (18 months) relapse (urination problems
still occur despite surgery), which is blurry since it is observed only through the reimbursement
of a specific set of drugs for urination problems. Our experiments show that ZiMM ED improves several
baselines, including non-deep learning and deep-learning approaches, and that it allows working
on such a dataset with minimal preprocessing work.
