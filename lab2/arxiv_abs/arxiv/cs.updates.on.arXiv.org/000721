We consider a wireless Device-to-Device (D2D) network where communication is restricted to be
single-hop. Users make arbitrary requests from a finite library of files and have pre-cached information
on their devices, subject to a per-node storage capacity constraint. A similar problem has already
been considered in an ``infrastructure'' setting, where all users receive a common multicast (coded)
message from a single omniscient server (e.g., a base station having all the files in the library)
through a shared bottleneck link. In this work, we consider a D2D ``infrastructure-less'' version
of the problem. We propose a caching strategy based on deterministic assignment of subpackets of
the library files, and a coded delivery strategy where the users send linearly coded messages to
each other in order to collectively satisfy their demands. We also consider a random caching strategy,
which is more suitable to a fully decentralized implementation. Under certain conditions, both
approaches can achieve the information theoretic outer bound within a constant multiplicative
factor. In our previous work, we showed that a caching D2D wireless network with one-hop communication,
random caching, and uncoded delivery, achieves the same throughput scaling law of the infrastructure-based
coded multicasting scheme, in the regime of large number of users and files in the library. This shows
that the spatial reuse gain of the D2D network is order-equivalent to the coded multicasting gain
of single base station transmission. It is therefore natural to ask whether these two gains are cumulative,
i.e.,if a D2D network with both local communication (spatial reuse) and coded multicasting can
provide an improved scaling law. Somewhat counterintuitively, we show that these gains do not cumulate
(in terms of throughput scaling law).
