Several researchers have proposed solutions for secure data outsourcing on the public clouds based
on encryption, secret-sharing, and trusted hardware. Existing approaches, however, exhibit
many limitations including high computational complexity, imperfect security, and information
leakage. This chapter describes an emerging trend in secure data processing that recognizes that
an entire dataset may not be sensitive, and hence, non-sensitivity of data can be exploited to overcome
some of the limitations of existing encryption-based approaches. In particular, data and computation
can be partitioned into sensitive or non-sensitive datasets - sensitive data can either be encrypted
prior to outsourcing or stored/processed locally on trusted servers. The non-sensitive dataset,
on the other hand, can be outsourced and processed in the cleartext. While partitioned computing
can bring new efficiencies since it does not incur (expensive) encrypted data processing costs
on non-sensitive data, it can lead to information leakage. We study partitioned computing in two
contexts - first, in the context of the hybrid cloud where local resources are integrated with public
cloud resources to form an effective and secure storage and computational platform for enterprise
data. In the hybrid cloud, sensitive data is stored on the private cloud to prevent leakage and a computation
is partitioned between private and public clouds. Care must be taken that the public cloud cannot
infer any information about sensitive data from inter-cloud data access during query processing.
We then consider partitioned computing in a public cloud only setting, where sensitive data is encrypted
before outsourcing. We formally define a partitioned security criterion that any approach to partitioned
computing on public clouds must ensure in order to not introduce any new vulnerabilities to the existing
secure solution.
