To protect the systems exposed to the Internet against attacks, a security system with the capability
to engage with the attacker is needed. There have been attempts to model the engagement/interactions
between users, both benign and malicious, and network administrators as games. Building on such
works, we present a game model which is generic enough to capture various modes of such interactions.
The model facilitates stochastic games with imperfect information. The information is imperfect
due to erroneous sensors leading to incorrect perception of the current state by the players. To
model this error in perception distributed over other multiple states, we use Euclidean distances
between the outputs of the sensors. We build a 5-state game to represent the interaction of the administrator
with the user. The states correspond to 1) the user being out of the system in the Internet, and after
logging in to the system; 2) having low privileges; 3) having high privileges; 4) when he successfully
attacks and 5) gets trapped in a honeypot by the administrator. Each state has its own action set.
We present the game with a distinct perceived action set corresponding to each distinct information
set of these states. The model facilitates stochastic games with imperfect information. The imperfect
information is due to erroneous sensors leading to incorrect perception of the current state by
the players. To model this error in perception distributed over the states, we use Euclidean distances
between outputs of the sensors. A numerical simulation of an example game is presented to show the
evaluation of rewards to the players and the preferred strategies. We also present the conditions
for formulating the strategies when dealing with more than one attacker and making collaborations.
