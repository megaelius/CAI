Together with the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics(KIP) the Fraunhofer IZM has developed a full
wafer redistribution and embedding technology as base for a large-scale neuromorphic hardware
system. The paper will give an overview of the neuromorphic computing platform at the KIP and the
associated hardware requirements which drove the described technological developments. In the
first phase of the project standard redistribution technologies from wafer level packaging were
adapted to enable a high density reticle-to-reticle routing on 200mm CMOS wafers. Neighboring
reticles were interconnected across the scribe lines with an 8{\mu}m pitch routing based on semi-additive
copper metallization. Passivation by photo sensitive benzocyclobutene was used to enable a second
intra-reticle routing layer. Final IO pads with flash gold were generated on top of each reticle.
With that concept neuromorphic systems based on full wafers could be assembled and tested. The fabricated
high density inter-reticle routing revealed a very high yield of larger than 99.9%. In order to allow
an upscaling of the system size to a large number of wafers with feasible effort a full wafer embedding
concept for printed circuit boards was developed and proven in the second phase of the project. The
wafers were thinned to 250{\mu}m and laminated with additional prepreg layers and copper foils
into a core material. After lamination of the PCB panel the reticle IOs of the embedded wafer were
accessed by micro via drilling, copper electroplating, lithography and subtractive etching of
the PCB wiring structure. The created wiring with 50um line width enabled an access of the reticle
IOs on the embedded wafer as well as a board level routing. The panels with the embedded wafers were
subsequently stressed with up to 1000 thermal cycles between 0C and 100C and have shown no severe
failure formation over the cycle time.
