Services hosted in multi-tenant cloud platforms often encounter performance interference due
to contention for non-partitionable resources, which in turn causes unpredictable behavior and
degradation in application performance. To grapple with these problems and to define effective
resource management solutions for their services, providers often must expend significant efforts
and incur prohibitive costs in developing performance models of their services under a variety
of interference scenarios on different hardware. This is a hard problem due to the wide range of possible
co-located services and their workloads, and the growing heterogeneity in the runtime platforms
including the use of fog and edge-based resources, not to mention the accidental complexity in performing
application profiling under a variety of scenarios. To address these challenges, we present FECBench,
a framework to guide providers in building performance interference prediction models for their
services without incurring undue costs and efforts. The contributions of the paper are as follows.
First, we developed a technique to build resource stressors that can stress multiple system resources
all at once in a controlled manner to gain insights about the interference on an application's performance.
Second, to overcome the need for exhaustive application profiling, FECBench intelligently uses
the design of experiments (DoE) approach to enable users to build surrogate performance models
of their services. Third, FECBench maintains an extensible knowledge base of application combinations
that create resource stresses across the multi-dimensional resource design space. Empirical
results using real-world scenarios to validate the efficacy of FECBench show that the predicted
application performance has a median error of only 7.6% across all test cases, with 5.4% in the best
case and 13.5% in the worst case.
