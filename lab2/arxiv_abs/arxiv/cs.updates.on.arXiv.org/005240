Analog coding is a low-complexity method to combat erasures, based on linear redundancy in the signal
space domain. Previous work examined "band-limited discrete Fourier transform (DFT)" codes for
Gaussian channels with erasures or impulses. We extend this concept to source coding with "erasure
side-information" at the encoder and show that the performance of band-limited DFT can be significantly
improved using irregular spectrum, and more generally, using equiangular tight frames (ETF).
Frames are overcomplete bases and are widely used in mathematics, computer science, engineering,
and statistics since they provide a stable and robust decomposition. Design of frames with favorable
properties of random subframes is motivated in variety of applications, including code-devision
multiple access (CDMA), compressed sensing and analog coding. We present a novel relation between
deterministic frames and random matrix theory. We show empirically that the MANOVA ensemble offers
a universal description of the spectra of randomly selected subframes with constant aspect ratios,
taken from deterministic near-ETFs. Moreover, we derive an analytic framework and bring a formal
validation for some of the empirical results, specifically that the asymptotic form for the moments
of high orders of subsets of ETF agree with that of MANOVA. Finally, when exploring over-complete
bases, the Welch bound is a lower bound on the root mean square cross correlation between vectors.
We extend the Welch bound to an erasure setting, in which a reduced frame, composed of a random subset
of Bernoulli selected vectors, is of interest. The lower bound involves moment of the reduced frame,
and it is tight for ETFs and asymptotically coincides with the MANOVA moments. This result offers
a novel perspective on the superiority of ETFs over other frames.
