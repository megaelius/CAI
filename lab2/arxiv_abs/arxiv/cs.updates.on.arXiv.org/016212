Segmenting anatomical structures in medical images has been successfully addressed with deep
learning methods for a range of applications. However, this success is heavily dependent on the
quality of the image that is being segmented. A commonly neglected point in the medical image analysis
community is the vast amount of clinical images that have severe image artefacts due to organ motion,
movement of the patient and/or image acquisition related issues. In this paper, we discuss the implications
of image motion artefacts on cardiac MR segmentation and compare a variety of approaches for jointly
correcting for artefacts and segmenting the cardiac cavity. The method is based on our recently
developed joint artefact detection and reconstruction method, which reconstructs high quality
MR images from k-space using a joint loss function and essentially converts the artefact correction
task to an under-sampled image reconstruction task by enforcing a data consistency term. In this
paper, we propose to use a segmentation network coupled with this in an end-to-end framework. Our
training optimises three different tasks: 1) image artefact detection, 2) artefact correction
and 3) image segmentation. We train the reconstruction network to automatically correct for motion-related
artefacts using synthetically corrupted cardiac MR k-space data and uncorrected reconstructed
images. Using a test set of 500 2D+time cine MR acquisitions from the UK Biobank data set, we achieve
demonstrably good image quality and high segmentation accuracy in the presence of synthetic motion
artefacts. We showcase better performance compared to various image correction architectures.
