Rescue robots are expected to carry out reconnaissance and dexterity operations in unknown environments
comprising unstructured obstacles. Although a wide variety of designs and implementations have
been presented within the field of rescue robotics, embedding all mobility, dexterity, and reconnaissance
capabilities in a single robot remains a challenging problem. This paper explains the design and
implementation of Karo, a mobile robot that exhibits a high degree of mobility at the side of maintaining
required dexterity and exploration capabilities for urban search and rescue (USAR) missions.
We first elicit the system requirements of a standard rescue robot from the frameworks of Rescue
Robot League (RRL) of RoboCup and then, propose the conceptual design of Karo by drafting a locomotion
and manipulation system. Considering that, this work presents comprehensive design processes
along with detail mechanical design of the robot's platform and its 7-DOF manipulator. Further,
we present the design and implementation of the command and control system by discussing the robot's
power system, sensors, and hardware systems. In conjunction with this, we elucidate the way that
Karo's software system and human-robot interface are implemented and employed. Furthermore,
we undertake extensive evaluations of Karo's field performance to investigate whether the principal
objective of this work has been satisfied. We demonstrate that Karo has effectively accomplished
assigned standardized rescue operations by evaluating all aspects of its capabilities in both
RRL's test suites and training suites of a fire department. Finally, the comprehensiveness of Karo's
capabilities has been verified by drawing quantitative comparisons between Karo's performance
and other leading robots participating in RRL.
