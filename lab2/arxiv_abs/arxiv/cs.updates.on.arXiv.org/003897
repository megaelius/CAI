The latest developments in digital have provided large data sets that can increasingly easily be
accessed and used. These data sets often contain indirect localisation information, such as historical
addresses. Historical geocoding is the process of transforming the indirect localisation information
to direct localisation that can be placed on a map, which enables spatial analysis and cross-referencing.
Many efficient geocoders exist for current addresses, but they do not deal with the temporal aspect
and are based on a strict hierarchy (..., city, street, house number) that is hard or impossible to
use with historical data. Indeed historical data are full of uncertainties (temporal aspect, semantic
aspect, spatial precision, confidence in historical source, ...) that can not be resolved, as there
is no way to go back in time to check. We propose an open source, open data, extensible solution for
geocoding that is based on the building of gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects extracted
from historical topographical maps. Once the gazetteers are available, geocoding an historical
address is a matter of finding the geohistorical object in the gazetteers that is the best match to
the historical address. The matching criteriae are customisable and include several dimensions
(fuzzy semantic, fuzzy temporal, scale, spatial precision ...). As the goal is to facilitate historical
work, we also propose web-based user interfaces that help geocode (one address or batch mode) and
display over current or historical topographical maps, so that they can be checked and collaboratively
edited. The system is tested on Paris city for the 19-20th centuries, shows high returns rate and
is fast enough to be used interactively.
