Internet security can be compromised not only through the threat of Malware, fraud, system intrusion
or damage, but also via the tracking of internet activity. Criminals are using numerous methods
to access data in the highly lucrative cybercrime business. Organized crime, as well as individual
users, are benefiting from the protection of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and private browsers,
such as Tor, Epic Privacy, to carry out illegal activity such as money laundering, drug dealing and
the trade of child pornography. News articles advising on internet privacy assisted in educating
the public and a new era of private browsing arose. Although these measures were designed to protect
legitimate browsing privacy, they also provided a means to conceal illegal activity. One such tool
released for private browsing was Epic Privacy Browser. It is currently used in approximately 180
countries worldwide. Epic Privacy Browser is promoted as a chromium powered browser, specifically
engineered to protect users' privacy. It only operates in private browser mode and, upon close of
the browsing session, deletes all browsing data. The Epic Privacy Browser claims that all traces
of user activity will be cleared upon close of the application and will establish if the introduction
of Windows 10 has had an adverse effect on this claim. However, there is no forensic acquisition and
analysis of Epic Privacy Browser in literature. In this paper, we aim to contribute towards the goal
of assisting forensic examiners with the locations and types of evidence available through live
and post-mortem state analysis of the Epic Privacy Browser on Windows 10 and Windows 7, identify
how the browser functions during use, where data can be recovered once the browser is closed and the
necessary tools that will assist in the forensics discovery and effective presentation of the material.
