The communication complexity of many fundamental problems reduces greatly when the communicating
parties share randomness that is independent of the inputs to the communication task. Natural communication
processes (say between humans) however often involve large amounts of shared correlations among
the communicating players, but rarely allow for perfect sharing of randomness. Can the communication
complexity benefit from shared correlations as well as it does from shared randomness? This question
was considered mainly in the context of simultaneous communication by Bavarian et al. (ICALP 2014).
In this work we study this problem in the standard interactive setting and give some general results.
In particular, we show that every problem with communication complexity of $k$ bits with perfectly
shared randomness has a protocol using imperfectly shared randomness with complexity $\exp(k)$
bits. We also show that this is best possible by exhibiting a promise problem with complexity $k$
bits with perfectly shared randomness which requires $\exp(k)$ bits when the randomness is imperfectly
shared. Along the way we also highlight some other basic problems such as compression, and agreement
distillation, where shared randomness plays a central role and analyze the complexity of these
problems in the imperfectly shared randomness model. The technical highlight of this work is the
lower bound that goes into the result showing the tightness of our general connection. This result
builds on the intuition that communication with imperfectly shared randomness needs to be less
sensitive to its random inputs than communication with perfectly shared randomness. The formal
proof invokes results about the small-set expansion of the noisy hypercube and an invariance principle
to convert this intuition to a proof, thus giving a new application domain for these fundamental
results.
