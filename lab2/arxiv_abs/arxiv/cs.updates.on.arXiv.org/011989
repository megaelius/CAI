In this article, we focus on the analysis of the potential factors driving the spread of influenza,
and possible policies to mitigate the adverse effects of the disease. To be precise, we first invoke
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to conclude a yearly periodic regional structure in the influenza
activity, thus safely restricting ourselves to the analysis of the yearly influenza behavior.
Then we collect a massive number of possible region-wise indicators contributing to the influenza
mortality, such as consumption, immunization, sanitation, water quality, and other indicators
from external data, with $1170$ dimensions in total. We extract significant features from the high
dimensional indicators using a combination of data analysis techniques, including matrix completion,
support vector machines (SVM), autoencoders, and principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore,
we model the international flow of migration and trade as a convolution on regional influenza activity,
and solve the deconvolution problem as higher-order perturbations to the linear regression, thus
separating regional and international factors related to the influenza mortality. Finally, both
the original model and the perturbed model are tested on regional examples, as validations of our
models. Pertaining to the policy, we make a proposal based on the connectivity data along with the
previously extracted significant features to alleviate the impact of influenza, as well as efficiently
propagate and carry out the policies. We conclude that environmental features and economic features
are of significance to the influenza mortality. The model can be easily adapted to model other types
of infectious diseases.
