Data augmentation is a critical component of training deep learning models. Although data augmentation
has been shown to significantly improve image classification, its potential has not been thoroughly
investigated for object detection. Given the additional cost for annotating images for object
detection, data augmentation may be of even greater importance for this computer vision task. In
this work, we study the impact of data augmentation on object detection. We first demonstrate that
data augmentation operations borrowed from image classification may be helpful for training detection
models, but the improvement is limited. Thus, we investigate how learned, specialized data augmentation
policies improve generalization performance for detection models. Importantly, these augmentation
policies only affect training and leave a trained model unchanged during evaluation. Experiments
on the COCO dataset indicate that an optimized data augmentation policy improves detection accuracy
by more than +2.3 mAP, and allow a single inference model to achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy
of 50.7 mAP. Importantly, the best policy found on COCO may be transferred unchanged to other detection
datasets and models to improve predictive accuracy. For example, the best augmentation policy
identified with COCO improves a strong baseline on PASCAL-VOC by +2.7 mAP. Our results also reveal
that a learned augmentation policy is superior to state-of-the-art architecture regularization
methods for object detection, even when considering strong baselines. Code for training with the
learned policy is available online at https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/detection
