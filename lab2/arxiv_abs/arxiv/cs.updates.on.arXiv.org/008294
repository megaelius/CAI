Objective: This work addresses two key problems of skin lesion classification. The first problem
is the effective use of high-resolution images with pretrained standard architectures for image
classification. The second problem is the high class imbalance encountered in real-world multi-class
datasets. Methods: To use high-resolution images, we propose a novel patch-based attention architecture
that provides global context between small, high-resolution patches. We modify three pretrained
architectures and study the performance of patch-based attention. To counter class imbalance
problems, we compare oversampling, balanced batch sampling, and class-specific loss weighting.
Additionally, we propose a novel diagnosis-guided loss weighting method which takes the method
used for ground-truth annotation into account. Results: Our patch-based attention mechanism
outperforms previous methods and improves the mean sensitivity by 7%. Class balancing significantly
improves the mean sensitivity and we show that our diagnosis-guided loss weighting method improves
the mean sensitivity by 3% over normal loss balancing. Conclusion: The novel patch-based attention
mechanism can be integrated into pretrained architectures and provides global context between
local patches while outperforming other patch-based methods. Hence, pretrained architectures
can be readily used with high-resolution images without downsampling. The new diagnosis-guided
loss weighting method outperforms other methods and allows for effective training when facing
class imbalance. Significance: The proposed methods improve automatic skin lesion classification.
They can be extended to other clinical applications where high-resolution image data and class
imbalance are relevant.
