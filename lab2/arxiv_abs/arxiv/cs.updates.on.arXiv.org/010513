Both radiographic (Rad) imaging, such as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging, and digital
pathology (Path) images captured from tissue samples are currently acquired as standard clinical
practice for glioblastoma tumors. Both these data streams have been separately used for diagnosis
and treatment planning, despite the fact that they provide complementary information. In this
research work, we aimed to assess the potential of both Rad and Path images in combination and comparison.
An extensive set of engineered features was extracted from delineated tumor regions in Rad images,
comprising T1, T1-Gd, T2, T2-FLAIR, and 100 random patches extracted from Path images. Specifically,
the features comprised descriptors of intensity, histogram, and texture, mainly quantified via
gray-level-co-occurrence matrix and gray-level-run-length matrices. Features extracted from
images of 107 glioblastoma patients, downloaded from The Cancer Imaging Archive, were run through
support vector machine for classification using leave-one-out cross-validation mechanism,
and through support vector regression for prediction of continuous survival outcome. The Pearson
correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.75, 0.74, and 0.78 for Rad, Path and RadPath data.
The area-under the receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated to be 0.74, 0.76 and 0.80
for Rad, Path and RadPath data, when patients were discretized into long- and short-survival groups
based on average survival cutoff. Our results support the notion that synergistically using Rad
and Path images may lead to better prognosis at the initial presentation of the disease, thereby
facilitating the targeted enrollment of patients into clinical trials.
