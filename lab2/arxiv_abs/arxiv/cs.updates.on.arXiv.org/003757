In this thesis we aim to analyze and quantify the energetic and information contents that can be extracted
from a dynamical system subject to the external environment. The latter is usually assumed to be
deleterious for the feasibility of specific control tasks, since it can be responsible for uncontrolled
time-dependent changes of the system. However, if the effects of the random interaction with a noisy
environment are properly modeled by the introduction of a given stochasticity within the dynamics
of the system, then even noise contributions might be seen as control knobs. As a matter of fact, even
a partial knowledge of the environment can allow to set the system in a dynamical condition in which
the response is optimized by the presence of noise sources. In particular, we have investigated
what kind of measurement devices can work better in noisy dynamical regimes and studied how to maximize
the resultant information via the adoption of estimation algorithms. Moreover, we have shown the
optimal interplay between quantum dynamics, environmental noise and complex network topology
in maximizing the energy transport efficiency. Then, foundational scientific aspects, such as
the occurrence of an ergodic property for the system-environment interaction modes of a randomly
perturbed quantum system or the characterization of the stochastic quantum Zeno phenomena, have
been analyzed by using the predictions of the large deviation theory. Finally, the energy cost in
maintaining the system in the non-equilibrium regime due to the presence of the environment is evaluated
by reconstructing the corresponding thermodynamics entropy production. In conclusion, the present
thesis can constitute the basis for an effective resource theory of noise, which is given by properly
engineering the interaction between a dynamical system and its external environment.
