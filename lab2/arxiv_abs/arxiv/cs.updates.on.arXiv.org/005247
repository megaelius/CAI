In this work, we employ the concept of {\em composite representation} of Boolean functions, which
represents an arbitrary Boolean function as a composition of one Boolean function and one vectorial
function, for the purpose of specifying new secondary constructions of bent/plateaued functions.
This representation gives a better understanding of the existing secondary constructions and
it also allows us to provide a general construction framework of these objects. This framework essentially
gives rise to an {\em infinite number} of possibilities to specify such secondary construction
methods (with some induced sufficient conditions imposed on initial functions) and in particular
we solve several open problems in this context. We provide several explicit methods for specifying
new classes of bent/plateaued functions and demonstrate through examples that the imposed initial
conditions can be easily satisfied. Our approach is especially efficient when defining new bent/plateaued
functions on larger variable spaces than initial functions. For instance, it is shown that the indirect
sum methods and Rothaus' construction are just special cases of this general framework and some
explicit extensions of these methods are given. In particular, similarly to the basic indirect
sum method of Carlet, we show that it is possible to derive (many) secondary constructions of bent
functions without any additional condition on initial functions apart from the requirement that
these are bent functions. In another direction, a few construction methods that generalize the
secondary constructions which do not extend the variable space of the employed initial functions
are also proposed.
