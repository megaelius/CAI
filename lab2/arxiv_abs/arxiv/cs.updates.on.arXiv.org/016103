We propose a new method to tackle the mapping challenge from time-series data to spatial image in
the field of seismic exploration, i.e., reconstructing the velocity model directly from seismic
data by deep neural networks (DNNs). The conventional way of addressing this ill-posed inversion
problem is through iterative algorithms, which suffer from poor nonlinear mapping and strong nonuniqueness.
Other attempts may either import human intervention errors or underuse seismic data. The challenge
for DNNs mainly lies in the weak spatial correspondence, the uncertain reflection-reception relationship
between seismic data and velocity model, as well as the time-varying property of seismic data. To
tackle these challenges, we propose end-to-end seismic inversion networks (SeisInvNets) with
novel components to make the best use of all seismic data. Specifically, we start with every seismic
trace and enhance it with its neighborhood information, its observation setup, and the global context
of its corresponding seismic profile. From the enhanced seismic traces, the spatially aligned
feature maps can be learned and further concatenated to reconstruct a velocity model. In general,
we let every seismic trace contribute to the reconstruction of the whole velocity model by finding
spatial correspondence. The proposed SeisInvNet consistently produces improvements over the
baselines and achieves promising performance on our synthesized and proposed SeisInv data set
according to various evaluation metrics. The inversion results are more consistent with the target
from the aspects of velocity values, subsurface structures, and geological interfaces. Moreover,
the mechanism and the generalization of the proposed method are discussed and verified. Nevertheless,
the generalization of deep-learning-based inversion methods on real data is still challenging
and considering physics may be one potential solution.
