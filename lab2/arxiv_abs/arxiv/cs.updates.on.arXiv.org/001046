In the modern era, each Internet user leaves enormous amounts of auxiliary digital residuals (footprints)
by using a variety of on-line services. All this data is already collected and stored for many years.
In recent works, it was demonstrated that it's possible to apply simple machine learning methods
to analyze collected digital footprints and to create psycho-demographic profiles of individuals.
However, while these works clearly demonstrated the applicability of machine learning methods
for such an analysis, created simple prediction models still lacks accuracy necessary to be successfully
applied for practical needs. We have assumed that using advanced deep machine learning methods
may considerably increase the accuracy of predictions. We started with simple machine learning
methods to estimate basic prediction performance and moved further by applying advanced methods
based on shallow and deep neural networks. Then we compared prediction power of studied models and
made conclusions about its performance. Finally, we made hypotheses how prediction accuracy can
be further improved. As result of this work, we provide full source code used in the experiments for
all interested researchers and practitioners in corresponding GitHub repository. We believe
that applying deep machine learning for psycho-demographic profiling may have an enormous impact
on the society (for good or worse) and provides means for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to
better understand humans by creating their psychological profiles. Thus AI agents may achieve
the human-like ability to participate in conversation (communication) flow by anticipating human
opponents' reactions, expectations, and behavior.
