In electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing, finding the appropriate information from a
dataset has been a big challenge for successful signal classification. The feature selection methods
make it possible to solve this problem; however, the method selection is still under investigation
to find out which feature can perform the best to extract the most proper features of the signal to
improve the classification performance. In this study, we use the genetic algorithm (GA), a heuristic
searching algorithm, to find the optimum combination of the feature extraction methods and the
classifiers, in the brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. A BCI system can be practical
if and only if it performs with high accuracy and high speed alongside each other. In the proposed
method, GA performs as a searching engine to find the best combination of the features and classifications.
The features used here are Katz, Higuchi, Petrosian, Sevcik, and box-counting dimension (BCD)
feature extraction methods. These features are applied to the wavelet subbands and are classified
with four classifiers such as adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), fuzzy k-nearest
neighbors (FKNN), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Due to
the huge number of features, the GA optimization is used to find the features with the optimum fitness
value (FV). Results reveal that Katz fractal feature estimation method with LDA classification
has the best FV. Consequently, due to the low computation time of the first Daubechies wavelet transformation
in comparison to the original signal, the final selected methods contain the fractal features of
the first coefficient of the detail subbands.
