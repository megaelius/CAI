Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been an important approach to recommender systems. However,
existing CF methods are mostly designed based on the idea of matching, i.e., by learning user and
item embeddings from data using shallow or deep models, they try to capture the relevance patterns
in data, so that a user embedding can be matched with appropriate item embeddings using designed
or learned similarity functions. We argue that as a cognition rather than a perception intelligent
task, recommendation requires not only the ability of pattern recognition and matching from data,
but also the ability of logical reasoning in the data. Inspired by recent progress on neural-symbolic
machine learning, we propose a framework to integrate the power of embedding learning and logical
reasoning, where the embeddings capture similarity patterns in data from perceptual perspectives,
and the logic facilitates cognitive reasoning for informed decision making. An important challenge,
however, is to bridge differentiable neural networks and symbolic reasoning in a shared architecture
for optimization and inference. To solve the problem, we propose a Modularized Logical Neural Network
architecture, which learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT as neural modules based
on logical regularizer, and learns logic variables as vector embeddings. In this way, each logic
expression can be equivalently organized as a neural network, so that logical reasoning and prediction
can be conducted in a continuous space. Experiments on several real-world datasets verified the
advantages of our framework compared with both traditional shallow and deep models.
