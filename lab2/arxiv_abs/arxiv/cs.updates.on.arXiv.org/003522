A significant challenge in the development of control systems for diesel airpath applications
is to tune the controller parameters to achieve satisfactory output performance, especially whilst
adhering to input and safety constraints in the presence of unknown system disturbances. Model-based
control techniques, such as model predictive control (MPC), have been successfully applied to
multivariable and highly nonlinear systems, such as diesel engines, while considering operational
constraints. However, efficient calibration of typical implementations of MPC is hindered by
the high number of tuning parameters and their non-intuitive correlation with the output response.
In this paper, the number of effective tuning parameters is reduced through suitable structural
modifications to the controller formulation and an appropriate redesign of the MPC cost function
to aid rapid calibration. Furthermore, a constraint tightening-like approach is augmented to
the control architecture to provide robustness guarantees in the face of uncertainties. A switched
linear time-varying MPC strategy with recursive feasibility guarantees during controller switching
is proposed to handle transient operation of the engine. The robust controller is first implemented
on a high fidelity simulation environment, with a comprehensive investigation of its calibration
to achieve desired transient response under step changes in the fuelling rate. An experimental
study then validates and highlights the performance of the proposed controller architecture for
selected tunings of the calibration parameters for fuelling steps and over drive cycles.
