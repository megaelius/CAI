Many diseases cause significant changes to the concentrations of small molecules (aka metabolites)
that appear in a person's biofluids, which means such diseases can often be readily detected from
a person's "metabolic profile". This information can be extracted from a biofluid's NMR spectrum.
Today, this is often done manually by trained human experts, which means this process is relatively
slow, expensive and error-prone. This paper presents a tool, Bayesil, that can quickly, accurately
and autonomously produce a complex biofluid's (e.g., serum or CSF) metabolic profile from a 1D1H
NMR spectrum. This requires first performing several spectral processing steps then matching
the resulting spectrum against a reference compound library, which contains the "signatures"
of each relevant metabolite. Many of these steps are novel algorithms and our matching step views
spectral matching as an inference problem within a probabilistic graphical model that rapidly
approximates the most probable metabolic profile. Our extensive studies on a diverse set of complex
mixtures, show that Bayesil can autonomously find the concentration of all NMR-detectable metabolites
accurately (~90% correct identification and ~10% quantification error), in <5minutes on a
single CPU. These results demonstrate that Bayesil is the first fully-automatic publicly-accessible
system that provides quantitative NMR spectral profiling effectively -- with an accuracy that
meets or exceeds the performance of trained experts. We anticipate this tool will usher in high-throughput
metabolomics and enable a wealth of new applications of NMR in clinical settings. Available at this
