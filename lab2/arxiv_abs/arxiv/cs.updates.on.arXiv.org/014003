The analog nature of computing in Memristive crossbars poses significant issues due to various
non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear I-V characteristics of the device
etc. The non-idealities can have a detrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational
accuracy of crossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using analytical
techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent behavior. This can not be captured
using analytical (non data-dependent) models thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting
application accuracy. To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality
in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately captures the data-dependent
nature of non-idealities. We perform extensive HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different
voltage and conductance combinations. Following that, we train a neural network to learn the transfer
characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional simulator which includes
key architectural facets such as \textit{tiling}, and \textit{bit-slicing} to analyze the impact
of non-idealities on the classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that
GENIEx achieves \textit{low} root mean square errors (RMSE) of $0.25$ and $0.7$ for low and high
voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the GENIEx errors are $7\times$ and
$12.8\times$ better than an analytical model which can only capture the linear non-idealities.
Further, using the functional simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can
overestimate the degradation in classification accuracy by $\ge 10\%$ on CIFAR-100 and $3.7\%$
on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.
