Inability to test at scale has become Achille's heel in humanity's ongoing war against COVID-19
pandemic. An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act
as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our
prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale
through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings
of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns
a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen
non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an
extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator
centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our
AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs
with over 90% accuracy. AI4COVID-19's performance is likely to improve as more and better data becomes
available. This paper presents a proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves
as a call for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical testing. Instead,
it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing
and treatment can be channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.
