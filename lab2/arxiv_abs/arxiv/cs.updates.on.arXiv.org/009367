We study finite paths in the Collatz graph, a directed graph with natural number nodes and where there
is an edge from node $x$ to node $T(x) = T_0(x) = x/2$ if $x$ is even, or to node $T(x) = T_1(x) = (3x+1)/2$
if $x$ is odd. Our first result is an algorithm that, when given a sequence of $n$ parity bits $p = b_0
b_1 \cdots b_{n-1} \in \{ 0,1 \}^n$, called a parity vector, finds the occurrences of this parity
vector in the Collatz graph which are all the paths $o$, of length $n+1$, where the first $n$ nodes
of $o$ have exactly the parities given by $p$. In particular, our algorithm can be used to find the
first occurrence of such parity vectors $p$ (has smallest integer nodes out of all paths $o$), or
indeed the $i^\text{th}$ for any $i \in\mathbb{N}$. In order to give this algorithm, we introduce
$\mathcal{E}(p)$, the "Collatz encoding" of a parity vector $p$, and the $(\alpha_{0,-1})$-tree,
a binary tree which dictates the structure of first occurrence of parity vectors in the Collatz graph
by using modular arithmetic in $\mathbb{Z}/{3^k}\mathbb{Z}$. Our main result, which generalizes
Colussi [TCS 2011], exploits the properties of first occurrence of parity vectors via their encoding
$\mathcal{E}(p)$ and the symmetries of the $(\alpha_{0,-1})$-tree in order to highlight some
regular structure in the Collatz graph. We show that the $k$-span predecessor set of $x\in\mathbb{N}$
in the Collatz graph, which contains any ancestor $y$ of $x$ that uses exactly $k$ times the map $T_1$
(and any number of times the map $T_0$) in order to reach $x$, can be defined, in binary, by a regular
expression $\texttt{reg}_k(x)$. Hence, we exhibit a general regular structure in the Collatz
graph. Finally, throughout this work, we state three conjectures that are equivalent to the Collatz
conjecture and are related to the objects we have introduced in this paper.
