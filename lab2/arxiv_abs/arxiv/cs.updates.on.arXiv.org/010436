We present a study of deep learning applied to the domain of network traffic data forecasting. This
is a very important ingredient for network traffic engineering, e.g., intelligent routing, which
can optimize network performance, especially in large networks. In a nutshell, we wish to predict,
in advance, the bit rate for a transmission, based on low-dimensional connection metadata ("flows")
that is available whenever a communication is initiated. Our study has several genuinely new points:
First, it is performed on a large dataset (~50 million flows), which requires a new training scheme
that operates on successive blocks of data since the whole dataset is too large for in-memory processing.
Additionally, we are the first to propose and perform a more fine-grained prediction that distinguishes
between low, medium and high bit rates instead of just "mice" and "elephant" flows. Lastly, we apply
state-of-the-art visualization and clustering techniques to flow data and show that visualizations
are insightful despite the heterogeneous and non-metric nature of the data. We developed a processing
pipeline to handle the highly non-trivial acquisition process and allow for proper data preprocessing
to be able to apply DNNs to network traffic data. We conduct DNN hyper-parameter optimization as
well as feature selection experiments, which clearly show that fine-grained network traffic forecasting
is feasible, and that domain-dependent data enrichment and augmentation strategies can improve
results. An outlook about the fundamental challenges presented by network traffic analysis (high
data throughput, unbalanced and dynamic classes, changing statistics, outlier detection) concludes
the article.
