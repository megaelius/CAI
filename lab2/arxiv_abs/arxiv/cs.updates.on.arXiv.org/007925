Filtered back projection (FBP) is the most widely used method for image reconstruction in X-ray
computed tomography (CT) scanners. The presence of hyper-dense materials in a scene, such as metals,
can strongly attenuate X-rays, producing severe streaking artifacts in the reconstruction. These
metal artifacts can greatly limit subsequent object delineation and information extraction from
the images, restricting their diagnostic value. This problem is particularly acute in the security
domain, where there is great heterogeneity in the objects that can appear in a scene, highly accurate
decisions must be made quickly. The standard practical approaches to reducing metal artifacts
in CT imagery are either simplistic non-adaptive interpolation-based projection data completion
methods or direct image post-processing methods. These standard approaches have had limited success.
Motivated primarily by security applications, we present a new deep-learning-based metal artifact
reduction (MAR) approach that tackles the problem in the projection data domain. We treat the projection
data corresponding to metal objects as missing data and train an adversarial deep network to complete
the missing data in the projection domain. The subsequent complete projection data is then used
with FBP to reconstruct image intended to be free of artifacts. This new approach results in an end-to-end
MAR algorithm that is computationally efficient so practical and fits well into existing CT workflows
allowing easy adoption in existing scanners. Training deep networks can be challenging, and another
contribution of our work is to demonstrate that training data generated using an accurate X-ray
simulation can be used to successfully train the deep network when combined with transfer learning
using limited real data sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our algorithm on
simulated and real examples.
