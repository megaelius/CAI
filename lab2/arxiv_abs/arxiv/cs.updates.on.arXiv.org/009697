The brachial plexus is a complex network of peripheral nerves that enables sensing from and control
of the movements of the arms and hand. Nowadays, the coordination between the muscles to generate
simple movements is still not well understood, hindering the knowledge of how to best treat patients
with this type of peripheral nerve injury. To acquire enough information for medical data analysis,
physicians conduct motion analysis assessments with patients to produce a rich dataset of electromyographic
signals from multiple muscles recorded with joint movements during real-world tasks. However,
tools for the analysis and visualization of the data in a succinct and interpretable manner are currently
not available. Without the ability to integrate, compare, and compute multiple data sources in
one platform, physicians can only compute simple statistical values to describe patient's behavior
vaguely, which limits the possibility to answer clinical questions and generate hypotheses for
research. To address this challenge, we have developed \systemname, an interactive visual analytics
system which provides an efficient framework to extract and compare muscle activity patterns from
the patient's limbs and coordinated views to help users analyze muscle signals, motion data, and
video information to address different tasks. The system was developed as a result of a collaborative
endeavor between computer scientists and orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation physicians.
We present case studies showing physicians can utilize the information displayed to understand
how individuals coordinate their muscles to initiate appropriate treatment and generate new hypotheses
for future research.
