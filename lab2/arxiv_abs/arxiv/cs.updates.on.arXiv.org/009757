This work provides a framework for nonlinear model-free control of systems with unknown input-output
dynamics, but outputs that can be controlled by the inputs. This framework leads to real-time control
of the system such that a feasible output trajectory can be tracked by the inputs. Unlike existing
model-free or data-driven control approaches, this framework guarantees nonlinear stability.
The controller and observer designs in the proposed framework are nonlinearly stable and robust
to the unknown dynamics as well as unknown measurement noise. For ease of computer implementation,
the framework is developed in discrete time. Nonlinear stability analyses of the discrete-time
observers and controllers are carried out using discrete Lyapunov analysis. The unknown input-output
dynamics is learnt in real time using a nonlinearly stable observer from prior input-output history.
This observer ensures finite-time stable convergence of model estimation errors to zero if the
unknown model is constant, and model estimation errors converge to a bounded neighborhood of the
zero vector if the model has bounded change in discrete time. Measured outputs are filtered by a finite-time
stable observer before use in feedback tracking of a desired output trajectory. Finite-time stable
observer design in this framework also ensures that a nonlinear separation principle is in effect
for separate controller and observer design. A model-free nonlinearly stable control scheme is
then designed to ensure convergence of observed outputs to a desired output trajectory. This control
scheme ensures nonlinear finite-time stable convergence of tracking errors to a manifold where
the tracking errors decay asymptotically. A numerical experiment on a nonlinear second-order
system demonstrates the performance of this nonlinear model-free control framework.
