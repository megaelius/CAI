Deep Interest Network (DIN) is a state-of-the-art model which uses attention mechanism to capture
user interests from historical behaviors. User interests intuitively follow a hierarchical pattern
such that users generally show interests from a higher-level then to a lower-level abstraction.
Modeling such an interest hierarchy in an attention network can fundamentally improve the representation
of user behaviors. We, therefore, propose an improvement over DIN to model arbitrary interest hierarchy:
Deep Interest with Hierarchical Attention Network (DHAN). In this model, a multi-dimensional
hierarchical structure is introduced on the first attention layer which attends to an individual
item, and the subsequent attention layers in the same dimension attend to higher-level hierarchy
built on top of the lower corresponding layers. To enable modeling of multiple dimensional hierarchies,
an expanding mechanism is introduced to capture one to many hierarchies. This design enables DHAN
to attend different importance to different hierarchical abstractions thus can fully capture
user interests at different dimensions (e.g. category, price, or brand).To validate our model,
a simplified DHAN has applied to Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction and our experimental results
on three public datasets with two levels of the one-dimensional hierarchy only by category. It shows
the superiority of DHAN with significant AUC uplift from 12% to 21% over DIN. DHAN is also compared
with another state-of-the-art model Deep Interest Evolution Network (DIEN), which models temporal
interest. The simplified DHAN also gets slight AUC uplift from 1.0% to 1.7% over DIEN. A potential
future work can be a combination of DHAN and DIEN to model both temporal and hierarchical interests.
