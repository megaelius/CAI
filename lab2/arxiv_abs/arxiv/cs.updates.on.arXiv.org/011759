In the list colouring problem for two matroids, we are given matroids $M_1=(S,\mathcal{I}_1)$
and $M_2=(S,\mathcal{I}_2)$ on the same ground set $S$, and the goal is to determine the smallest
number $k$ such that given arbitrary lists $L_s$ of $k$ colours for $s\in S$, it is possible to choose
a colour from each list so that every monochromatic set is independent in both $M_1$ and $M_2$. When
both $M_1$ and $M_2$ are partition matroids, Galvin's celebrated list colouring theorem for bipartite
graphs gives the answer. One of the main open questions is to decide if there exists a constant $c$
such that if the colouring number is $k$ (i.e., the ground set can be partitioned into $k$ independent
sets), then the list colouring number is at most $c\cdot k$. In the present paper, we consider matroid
classes that appear naturally in combinatorial and graph optimization problems, namely graphic
matroids, paving matroids and gammoids. We show that if both matroids are from these fundamental
classes, then the list colouring number is at most twice the colouring number. The proof is based
on a novel approach that reduces a matroid to a partition matroid, and might be of independent combinatorial
interest. In particular, we show that if $M=(S,\mathcal{I})$ is a matroid in which $S$ can be partitioned
into $k$ independent sets, then there exists a partition matroid $N=(S,\mathcal{J})$ with $\mathcal{J}\subseteq\mathcal{I}$
in which $S$ can be partitioned into (A) $\lceil kr/(r-1)\rceil$ independent sets if $M$ is a paving
matroid of rank $r$, (B) $2k-1$ independent sets if $M$ is a graphic matroid, (C) $k$ independent
sets if $M$ is a transversal matroid, and (D) $2k-2$ independent sets if $M$ is a gammoid. We also show
how the reduction technique can be extended to strongly base orderable matroids that might serve
as a useful tool in problems related to packing bases of two matroids.
