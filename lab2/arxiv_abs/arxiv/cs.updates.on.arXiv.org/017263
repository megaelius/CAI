Unsupervised feature learning has made great strides with invariant mapping and instance-level
discrimination, as benchmarked by classification on common datasets. However, these datasets
are curated to be distinctive and class-balanced, whereas naturally collected data could be highly
correlated within the class (with repeats at the extreme) and long-tail distributed across classes.
The natural grouping of instances conflicts with the fundamental assumption of instance-level
discrimination. Contrastive feature learning is thus unstable without grouping, whereas grouping
without contrastive feature learning is easily trapped into degeneracy. We propose to integrate
grouping into instance-level discrimination, not by imposing group-level discrimination, but
by imposing cross-level discrimination between instances and groups. Our key insight is that attraction
and repulsion between instances work at different ranges. In order to discover the most discriminative
feature that also respects natural grouping, we ask each instance to repel groups of instances that
are far from it. By pushing against common groups, this cross-level repulsion actively binds similar
instances together. To further avoid the clash between grouping and discrimination objectives,
we also impose them on separate features derived from the common feature. Our extensive experimentation
demonstrates not only significant gain on datasets with high correlation and long-tail distributions,
but also leading performance on multiple self-supervision benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100
and ImageNet, bringing unsupervised feature learning closer to real data applications.
