Segmentation partitions an image into different regions containing pixels with similar attributes.
A standard non-contextual variant of Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM), considering its
simplicity is generally used in image segmentation. Using FCM has its disadvantages like it is dependent
on the initial guess of the number of clusters and highly sensitive to noise. Satisfactory visual
segments cannot be obtained using FCM. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) belongs to the class of
evolutionary algorithms and has good convergence speed and fewer parameters compared to Genetic
Algorithms (GAs). An optimized version of PSO can be combined with FCM to act as a proper initializer
for the algorithm thereby reducing its sensitivity to initial guess. A hybrid PSO algorithm named
Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) which improves in the calculation of various hyper
parameters like inertia weight, learning factors over standard PSO, using insights from swarm
behaviour, leading to improvement in cluster quality can be used. This paper presents a new image
segmentation algorithm called Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization and Fuzzy C-means Clustering
Algorithm (APSOF), which is based on Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Fuzzy C-means
clustering. Experimental results show that APSOF algorithm has edge over FCM in correctly identifying
the optimum cluster centers, there by leading to accurate classification of the image pixels. Hence,
APSOF algorithm has superior performance in comparison with classic Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) and Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM) for image segmentation.
