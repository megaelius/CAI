This paper develops the high-order accurate entropy stable (ES) finite difference schemes for
the shallow water magnetohydrodynamic (SWMHD) equations. They are built on the numerical approximation
of the modified symmetrizable SWMHD equations with a particularly adding source term. First, the
second-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete entropy conservative (EC) schemes are constructed,
satisfying the entropy identity for the given convex entropy function and preserving the steady
states of the lake at rest (with zero magnetic field). The key is to match both discretizations for
the fluxes and the source terms (related to the non-flat river bed bottom and symmetrization), and
to find the affordable EC fluxes of the second-order EC schemes. Next, by using the second-order
EC schemes as building block, high-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete EC schemes are
proposed. Then, the high-order accurate well-balanced semi-discrete ES schemes are derived by
adding a suitable dissipation term to the EC scheme with the WENO reconstruction of the scaled entropy
variables in order to suppress the numerical oscillations of the EC schemes. After that, the semi-discrete
schemes are integrated in time by using the high-order strong stability-preserving explicit Runge-Kutta
schemes to obtain the fully-discrete high-order well-balanced schemes. The ES property of the
Lax-Friedrichs flux is also proved and then the positivity preserving ES schemes are studied by
using the positivity-preserving flux limiter. Finally, extensive numerical tests are conducted
to validate the accuracy, the well-balance, ES and positivity properties, and the ability to capture
discontinuities of our schemes.
