Spiking Neural Networks offer an event-driven and biologically realistic alternative to standard
Artificial Neural Networks based on analog information processing which make them more suitable
for energy-efficient hardware implementations of the functional units of the brain, namely, neurons
and synapses. Despite extensive efforts to replicate the energy efficiency of the brain in standard
von-Neumann architecture, the massive parallelism has remained elusive. This has led researchers
to venture towards beyond von-Neumann computing or `in-memory' computing paradigms based on CMOS
and post-CMOS technologies. However, implementations of such platforms in the electrical domain
faces potential limitations of switching speed and interconnect losses. Integrated Photonics
offers an welcome alternative to standard `microelectronic' platforms and have recently shown
promise as a viable technology for spike-based neural processing systems. However, non-volatility
has been identified as an important component of large-scale neuromorphic systems. Although the
recent demonstrations of ultra-fast computing with phase-change materials (PCMs) show promise,
the jump from standalone computing devices to parallel computing architecture is challenging.
In this work, we utilize the optical properties of the PCM, Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST), to propose
an all-Photonic Spiking Neural Network, comprising of a non-volatile synaptic array integrated
seamlessly with previously explored `integrate-and-fire' neurons to realize an `in-memory'
computing platform leveraging the inherent parallelism of wavelength-division-multiplexing
(WDM). The proposed design not only bridges the gap between isolated computing devices and parallel
large-scale implementation, but also paves the way for ultra-fast computing and localized on-chip
learning.
