With widespread applications of artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of the perception,
understanding, decision-making and control for autonomous systems have improved significantly
in the past years. When autonomous systems consider the performance of accuracy and transferability,
several AI methods, like adversarial learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and meta-learning,
show their powerful performance. Here, we review the learning-based approaches in autonomous
systems from the perspectives of accuracy and transferability. Accuracy means that a well-trained
model shows good results during the testing phase, in which the testing set shares a same task or a
data distribution with the training set. Transferability means that when a well-trained model
is transferred to other testing domains, the accuracy is still good. Firstly, we introduce some
basic concepts of transfer learning and then present some preliminaries of adversarial learning,
RL and meta-learning. Secondly, we focus on reviewing the accuracy or transferability or both of
them to show the advantages of adversarial learning, like generative adversarial networks (GANs),
in typical computer vision tasks in autonomous systems, including image style transfer, image
superresolution, image deblurring/dehazing/rain removal, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
pedestrian detection and person re-identification (re-ID). Then, we further review the performance
of RL and meta-learning from the aspects of accuracy or transferability or both of them in autonomous
systems, involving pedestrian tracking, robot navigation and robotic manipulation. Finally,
we discuss several challenges and future topics for using adversarial learning, RL and meta-learning
in autonomous systems.
