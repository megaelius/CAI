While the centralization of SDN brought advantages such as a faster pace of innovation, it also disrupted
some of the natural defenses of traditional architectures against different threats. The literature
on SDN has mostly been concerned with the functional side, despite some specific works concerning
non-functional properties like 'security' or 'dependability'. Though addressing the latter
in an ad-hoc, piecemeal way, may work, it will most likely lead to efficiency and effectiveness problems.
We claim that the enforcement of non-functional properties as a pillar of SDN robustness calls for
a systemic approach. As a general concept, we propose ANCHOR, a subsystem architecture that promotes
the logical centralization of non-functional properties. To show the effectiveness of the concept,
we focus on 'security' in this paper: we identify the current security gaps in SDNs and we populate
the architecture middleware with the appropriate security mechanisms, in a global and consistent
manner. Essential security mechanisms provided by anchor include reliable entropy and resilient
pseudo-random generators, and protocols for secure registration and association of SDN devices.
We claim and justify in the paper that centralizing such mechanisms is key for their effectiveness,
by allowing us to: define and enforce global policies for those properties; reduce the complexity
of controllers and forwarding devices; ensure higher levels of robustness for critical services;
foster interoperability of the non-functional property enforcement mechanisms; and promote
the security and resilience of the architecture itself. We discuss design and implementation aspects,
and we prove and evaluate our algorithms and mechanisms, including the formalisation of the main
protocols and the verification of their core security properties using the Tamarin prover.
