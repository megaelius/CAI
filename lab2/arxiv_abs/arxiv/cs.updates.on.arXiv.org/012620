Modern vehicles have electrical architectures whose complexity grows year after year due to feature
growth corresponding to customer expectations. The latest of the expectations, automation of
the dynamic driving task however, is poised to bring about some of the largest changes seen so far.
In one fell swoop, not only does required functionality for automated driving drastically increase
the system complexity, it also removes the fall-back of the human driver who is usually relied upon
to handle unanticipated failures after the fact. The need to architect thus requires a greater rigour
than ever before, to maintain the level of safety that has been associated with the automotive industry.
The work that is part of this thesis has been conducted, in close collaboration with our industrial
partner Scania CV AB, within the Vinnova FFI funded project ARCHER. This thesis aims to provide a
methodology for architecting during the concept phase of development, using industrial practices
and principles including those from safety standards such as ISO 26262. The main contributions
of the thesis are in two areas. The first area i.e. Part A contributes, (i) an analysis of the challenges
of architecting automated driving, and serves as a motivation for the approach taken in the rest
of this thesis, i.e. Part B where the contributions include, (ii) a definition of a viewpoint for
functional safety according to the definitions of ISO 42010, (iii) a method to systematically extract
information from legacy components and (iv) a process to use legacy information and architect in
the presence of uncertainty to provide a work product, the Preliminary Architectural Assumptions
(PAA), as required by ISO 26262. The contributions of Part B together comprise a methodology to architect
the PAA. <read full abstract in pdf>
