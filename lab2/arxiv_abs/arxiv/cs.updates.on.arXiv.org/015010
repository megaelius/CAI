In this paper, we consider a discrete-time portfolio with $m \geq 2$ assets optimization problem
which includes the rebalancing~frequency as an additional parameter in the maximization. The
so-called Kelly Criterion is used as the performance metric; i.e., maximizing the expected logarithmic
growth of a trader's account, and the portfolio obtained is called the frequency-based Kelly optimal
portfolio. The focal point of this paper is to extend upon the results of our previous work to obtain
various optimality characterizations on the portfolio. To be more specific, using Kelly's criterion
in our frequency-based formulation, we first prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the
frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. With the aid of these conditions, we then show several
new optimality characterizations such as expected ratio optimality and asymptotic relative optimality,
and a result which we call the Extended Dominant Asset Theorem. That is, we prove that the $i$th asset
is dominant in the portfolio if and only if the Kelly optimal portfolio consists of that asset only.
The word "extended" on the theorem comes from the fact that it was only a sufficiency result that was
proved in our previous work. Hence, in this paper, we improve it to involve a proof of the necessity
part. In addition, the trader's survivability issue (no bankruptcy consideration) is also studied
in detail in our frequency-based trading framework. Finally, to bridge the theory and practice,
we propose a simple trading algorithm using the notion called dominant asset condition to decide
when should one triggers a trade. The corresponding trading performance using historical price
data is reported as supporting evidence.
