We introduce and study the problem Ordered Level Planarity which asks for a planar drawing of a graph
such that vertices are placed at prescribed positions in the plane and such that every edge is realized
as a y-monotone curve. This can be interpreted as a variant of Level Planarity in which the vertices
on each level appear in a prescribed total order. We establish a complexity dichotomy with respect
to both the maximum degree and the level-width, that is, the maximum number of vertices that share
a level. Our study of Ordered Level Planarity is motivated by connections to several other graph
drawing problems. Geodesic Planarity asks for a planar drawing of a graph such that vertices are
placed at prescribed positions in the plane and such that every edge is realized as a polygonal path
composed of line segments with two adjacent directions from a given set $S$ of directions symmetric
with respect to the origin. Our results on Ordered Level Planarity imply $NP$-hardness for any $S$
with $|S|\ge 4$ even if the given graph is a matching. Katz, Krug, Rutter and Wolff claimed that for
matchings Manhattan Geodesic Planarity, the case where $S$ contains precisely the horizontal
and vertical directions, can be solved in polynomial time [GD'09]. Our results imply that this is
incorrect unless $P=NP$. Our reduction extends to settle the complexity of the Bi-Monotonicity
problem, which was proposed by Fulek, Pelsmajer, Schaefer and \v{S}tefankovi\v{c}. Ordered Level
Planarity turns out to be a special case of T-Level Planarity, Clustered Level Planarity and Constrained
Level Planarity. Thus, our results strengthen previous hardness results. In particular, our reduction
to Clustered Level Planarity generates instances with only two non-trivial clusters. This answers
a question posed by Angelini, Da Lozzo, Di Battista, Frati and Roselli.
