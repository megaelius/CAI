Multicasting for disseminating popular data in cellular networks is a natural solution for improving
the energy and spectral efficiencies. However, the achievable throughput in a multicast enabled
network may be dictated by the user with the worst channel conditions. To improve the achievable
throughput of such networks, underlay device-to-device (D2D) multicast communication offers
a practical solution. However, despite having significant potential for providing higher throughput
and lower delay, implementing underlay D2D multicast communication poses several challenges.
For example, mutual interference among cellular users (CUs) and D2D multicast groups (MGs), and
overhead signaling to provide channel state information may limit potential gains. In this work,
we study a scenario where multiple D2D multicast groups may share a CU's uplink channel. We formulate
an optimization problem to maximize the achievable system throughput while fulfilling quality
of service (QoS) requirements of every CU and D2D MGs, subject to the corresponding maximum transmit
power constraints. The formulated optimization problem is an instance of mixed integer non-linear
programming (MINLP) problem, which is computationally intractable, in general. Therefore, to
find a feasible solution, we propose a pragmatic two-step process of channel allocation and power
allocation. In the first-step, we propose a channel allocation algorithm, which determines the
subset of MGs that may share a channel subject to criteria based on two different parameters: interference
and outage probabilities. Then, we propose an algorithm to allocate power to these MGs subsets that
maximizes the system throughput, while satisfying transmit power constraint. Numerical results
show the efficacy of proposed model in terms of higher achievable sum throughput and better spectrum
efficiency with respect to various existing schemes.
