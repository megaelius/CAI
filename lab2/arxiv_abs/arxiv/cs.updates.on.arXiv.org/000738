This paper provides the first comprehensive description of the Z1, the mechanical computer built
by the German inventor Konrad Zuse in Berlin from 1936 to 1938. The paper describes the main structural
elements of the machine, the high-level architecture, and the dataflow between components. The
computer could perform the four basic arithmetic operations using floating-point numbers. Instructions
were read from punched tape. A program consisted of a sequence of arithmetical operations, intermixed
with memory store and load instructions, interrupted possibly by input and output operations.
Numbers were stored in a mechanical memory. The machine did not include conditional branching in
the instruction set. While the architecture of the Z1 is similar to the relay computer Zuse finished
in 1941 (the Z3) there are some significant differences. The Z1 implements operations as sequences
of microinstructions, as in the Z3, but does not use rotary switches as micro-steppers. The Z1 uses
a digital incrementer and a set of conditions which are translated into microinstructions for the
exponent and mantissa units, as well as for the memory blocks. Microinstructions select one out
of 12 layers in a machine with a 3D mechanical structure of binary mechanical elements. The exception
circuits for mantissa zero, necessary for normalized floating-point, were lacking; they were
first implemented in the Z3. The information for this article was extracted from careful study of
the blueprints drawn by Zuse for the reconstruction of the Z1 for the German Technology Museum in
Berlin, from some letters, and from sketches in notebooks. Although the machine has been in exhibition
since 1989 (non-operational), no detailed high-level description of the machine's architecture
had been available. This paper fills that gap.
