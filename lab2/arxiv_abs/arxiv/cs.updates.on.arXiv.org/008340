In two-player games on graphs, the players move a token through a graph to produce an infinite path,
which determines the winner or payoff of the game. We study {\em bidding games} in which the players
bid for the right to move the token. Several bidding rules were studied previously. In {\em Richman}
bidding, in each round, the players simultaneously submit bids, and the higher bidder moves the
token and pays the other player. {\em Poorman} bidding is similar except that the winner of the bidding
pays the "bank" rather than the other player. {\em Taxman} bidding spans the spectrum between Richman
and poorman bidding. They are parameterized by a constant $\tau \in [0,1]$: portion $\tau$ of the
winning bid is paid to the other player, and portion $1-\tau$ to the bank. We present, for the first
time, results on {\em infinite-duration} taxman games. Our most interesting results concern quantitative
taxman games, namely {\em mean-payoff} games, where poorman and Richman bidding differ. A central
quantity in these games is the {\em ratio} between the two players' initial budgets. While in poorman
mean-payoff games, the optimal payoff a player can guarantee depends on the initial ratio, in Richman
bidding, the payoff depends only on the structure of the game. In both games the optimal payoffs can
be found using (different) probabilistic connections with {\em random-turn based} games in which
in each turn, a coin is tossed to determine which player moves. The payoff with Richman bidding equals
the payoff of a random-turn based game with an un-biased coin, and with poorman bidding, the coin
is biased according to the initial budget ratio. We give a complete classification of mean-payoff
taxman games using a probabilistic connection. Our results show that Richman bidding is the exception;
namely, for every $\tau <1$, the value of the game depends on the initial ratio.
