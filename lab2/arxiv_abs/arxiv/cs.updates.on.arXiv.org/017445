Experimental studies support the notion of spike-based neuronal information processing in the
brain, with neural circuits exhibiting a wide range of temporally-based coding strategies to rapidly
and efficiently represent sensory stimuli. Accordingly, it would be desirable to apply spike-based
computation to tackling real-world challenges, and in particular transferring such theory to
neuromorphic systems for low-power embedded applications. Motivated by this, we propose a new
supervised learning method that can train multilayer spiking neural networks to solve classification
problems based on a rapid, first-to-spike decoding strategy. The proposed learning rule supports
multiple spikes fired by stochastic hidden neurons, and yet is stable by relying on first-spike
responses generated by a deterministic output layer. In addition to this, we also explore several
distinct, spike-based encoding strategies in order to form compact representations of presented
input data. We demonstrate the classification performance of the learning rule as applied to several
benchmark datasets, including MNIST. The learning rule is capable of generalising from the data,
and is successful even when used with constrained network architectures containing few input and
hidden layer neurons. Furthermore, we highlight a novel encoding strategy, termed `scanline encoding',
that can transform image data into compact spatiotemporal patterns for subsequent network processing.
Designing constrained, but optimised, network structures and performing input dimensionality
reduction has strong implications for neuromorphic applications.
