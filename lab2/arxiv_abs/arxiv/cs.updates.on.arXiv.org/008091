Big data systems development is full of challenges in view of the variety of application areas and
domains that this technology promises to serve. Typically, fundamental design decisions involved
in big data systems design include choosing appropriate storage and computing infrastructures.
In this age of heterogeneous systems that integrate different technologies for optimized solution
to a specific real world problem, big data system are not an exception to any such rule. As far as the
storage aspect of any big data system is concerned, the primary facet in this regard is a storage infrastructure
and NoSQL seems to be the right technology that fulfills its requirements. However, every big data
application has variable data characteristics and thus, the corresponding data fits into a different
data model. This paper presents feature and use case analysis and comparison of the four main data
models namely document oriented, key value, graph and wide column. Moreover, a feature analysis
of 80 NoSQL solutions has been provided, elaborating on the criteria and points that a developer
must consider while making a possible choice. Typically, big data storage needs to communicate
with the execution engine and other processing and visualization technologies to create a comprehensive
solution. This brings forth second facet of big data storage, big data file formats, into picture.
The second half of the research paper compares the advantages, shortcomings and possible use cases
of available big data file formats for Hadoop, which is the foundation for most big data computing
technologies. Decentralized storage and blockchain are seen as the next generation of big data
storage and its challenges and future prospects have also been discussed.
