Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in the assessment of the performance of researchers,
research groups, universities and even countries. The assessment of productivity is an instrument
to select and promote personnel, assign research grants and measure the results of research projects.
One particular assessment approach is bibliometrics i.e., the quantitative analysis of scientific
publications through citation and content analysis. However, there is little consensus today
on how research evaluation should be performed, and it is commonly acknowledged that the quantitative
metrics available today are largely unsatisfactory. A number of different scientific data sources
available on the Web (e.g., DBLP, Google Scholar) that are used for such analysis purposes. Taking
data from these diverse sources, performing the analysis and visualizing results in different
ways is not a trivial and straight forward task. Moreover, people involved in such evaluation processes
are not always IT experts and hence not capable to crawl data sources, merge them and compute the needed
evaluation procedures. The recent emergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end-user
development, i.e., on enabling end-users without programming skills to produce their own applications.
We believe that the heart of the problem is that it is impractical to design tools that are generic
enough to cover a wide range of application domains, powerful enough to enable the specification
of non-trivial logic, and simple enough to be actually accessible to non-programmers. This thesis
presents a novel approach for an effective end-user development, specifically for non-programmers.
That is, we introduce a domain-specific approach to mashups that "speaks the language of users".,
i.e., that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is
comfortable with.
