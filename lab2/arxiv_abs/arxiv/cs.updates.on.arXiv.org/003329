We present many new results related to reliable (interactive) communication over insertion-deletion
channels. Synchronization errors, such as insertions and deletions, strictly generalize the
usual symbol corruption errors and are much harder to protect against. We show how to hide the complications
of synchronization errors in many applications by introducing very general channel simulations
which efficiently transform an insertion-deletion channel into a regular symbol corruption channel
with an error rate larger by a constant factor and a slightly smaller alphabet. We generalize synchronization
string based methods which were recently introduced as a tool to design essentially optimal error
correcting codes for insertion-deletion channels. Our channel simulations depend on the fact
that, at the cost of increasing the error rate by a constant factor, synchronization strings can
be decoded in a streaming manner that preserves linearity of time. We also provide a lower bound showing
that this constant factor cannot be improved to $1+\epsilon$, in contrast to what is achievable
for error correcting codes. Our channel simulations drastically generalize the applicability
of synchronization strings. We provide new interactive coding schemes which simulate any interactive
two-party protocol over an insertion-deletion channel. Our results improve over the interactive
coding schemes of Braverman et al. [TransInf 2017] and Sherstov and Wu [FOCS 2017], which achieve
a small constant rate and require exponential time computations, with respect to computational
and communication complexities. We provide the first computationally efficient interactive
coding schemes for synchronization errors, the first coding scheme with a rate approaching one
for small noise rates, and also the first coding scheme that works over arbitrarily small alphabet
sizes.
