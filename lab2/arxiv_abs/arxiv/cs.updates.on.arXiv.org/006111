Today's most successful facial image analysis systems are based on deep neural networks. However,
a major limitation of such deep learning approaches is that their performance depends strongly
on the availability of large annotated datasets. In this work, we prime deep neural networks by pre-training
them with synthetic face images for specific facial analysis tasks. We demonstrate that this approach
enhances both the generalization performance as well as the dataset efficiency of deep neural networks.
Using a 3D morphable face model, we generate arbitrary amounts of annotated data with full control
over image characteristics such as facial shape and color, pose, illumination, and background.
With a series of experiments, we extensively test the effect of priming deep neural networks with
synthetic face examples for two popular facial image analysis tasks: face recognition and facial
landmark detection. We observed the following positive effects for both tasks: 1) Priming with
synthetic face images improves the generalization performance consistently across all benchmark
datasets. 2) The amount of real-world data needed to achieve competitive performance is reduced
by 75% for face recognition and by 50% for facial landmark detection. 3) Priming with synthetic faces
is consistently superior at enhancing the performance of deep neural networks than data augmentation
and transfer learning techniques. Furthermore, our experiments provide evidence that priming
with synthetic faces is able to enhance performance because it reduces the negative effects of biases
present in real-world training data. The proposed synthetic face image generator, as well as the
software used for our experiments, have been made publicly available.
