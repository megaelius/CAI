Image enhancement plays an important role in several application in the field of computer vision
and image processing. Histogram specification (HS) is one of the most widely used techniques for
contrast enhancement of an image, which requires an appropriate probability density function
for the transformation. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy method to find a suitable PDF automatically
for histogram specification using interval type - 2 (IT2) fuzzy approach, based on the fuzzy membership
values obtained from the histogram of input image. The proposed algorithm works in 5 stages which
includes - symmetric Gaussian fitting on the histogram, extraction of IT2 fuzzy membership functions
(MFs) and therefore, footprint of uncertainty (FOU), obtaining membership value (MV), generating
PDF and application of HS. We have proposed 4 different methods to find membership values - point-wise
method, center of weight method, area method, and karnik-mendel (KM) method. The framework is sensitive
to local variations in the histogram and chooses the best PDF so as to improve contrast enhancement.
Experimental validity of the methods used is illustrated by qualitative and quantitative analysis
on several images using the image quality index - Average Information Content (AIC) or Entropy,
and by comparison with the commonly used algorithms such as Histogram Equalization (HE), Recursive
Mean-Separate Histogram Equalization (RMSHE) and Brightness Preserving Fuzzy Histogram Equalization
(BPFHE). It has been found out that on an average, our algorithm improves the AIC index by 11.5% as
compared to the index obtained by histogram equalisation.
