Future 5G systems will need to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications scenarios.
From a latency-reliability viewpoint, it is inefficient to rely on average utility-based system
design. Therefore, we introduce the notion of guaranteeable delay which is the average delay plus
three standard deviations of the mean. We investigate the trade-off between guaranteeable delay
and throughput for point-to-point wireless erasure links with unreliable and delayed feedback,
by bringing together signal flow techniques to the area of coding. We use tiny codes, i.e. sliding
window by coding with just 2 packets, and design three variations of selective-repeat ARQ protocols,
by building on the baseline scheme, i.e. uncoded ARQ, developed by Ausavapattanakun and Nosratinia:
(i) Hybrid ARQ with soft combining at the receiver; (ii) cumulative feedback-based ARQ without
rate adaptation; and (iii) Coded ARQ with rate adaptation based on the cumulative feedback. Contrasting
the performance of these protocols with uncoded ARQ, we demonstrate that HARQ performs only slightly
better, cumulative feedback-based ARQ does not provide significant throughput while it has better
average delay, and Coded ARQ can provide gains up to about 40% in terms of throughput. Coded ARQ also
provides delay guarantees, and is robust to various challenges such as imperfect and delayed feedback,
burst erasures, and round-trip time fluctuations. This feature may be preferable for meeting the
strict end-to-end latency and reliability requirements of future use cases of ultra-reliable
low-latency communications in 5G, such as mission-critical communications and industrial control
for critical control messaging.
