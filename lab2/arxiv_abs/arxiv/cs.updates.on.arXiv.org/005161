The implementation of smart building technology in the form of smart infrastructure applications
has great potential to improve sustainability and energy efficiency by leveraging humans-in-the-loop
strategy. However, human preference in regard to living conditions is usually unknown and heterogeneous
in its manifestation as control inputs to a building. Furthermore, the occupants of a building typically
lack the independent motivation necessary to contribute to and play a key role in the control of smart
building infrastructure. Moreover, true human actions and their integration with sensing/actuation
platforms remains unknown to the decision maker tasked with improving operational efficiency.
By modeling user interaction as a sequential discrete game between non-cooperative players, we
introduce a gamification approach for supporting user engagement and integration in a human-centric
cyber-physical system. We propose the design and implementation of a large-scale network game
with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of a building through the utilization of cutting-edge
Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and cyber-physical systems sensing/actuation platforms. A benchmark
utility learning framework that employs robust estimations for classical discrete choice models
provided for the derived high dimensional imbalanced data. To improve forecasting performance,
we extend the benchmark utility learning scheme by leveraging Deep Learning end-to-end training
with Deep bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks. We apply the proposed methods to high dimensional
data from a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavior among smart
building occupants in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) residential housing. Using occupant-retrieved
actions for resources such as lighting and A/C, we simulate the game defined by the estimated utility
functions.
