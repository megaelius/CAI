We report on a verification of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra in ACL2(r). The proof consists
of four parts. First, continuity for both complex-valued and real-valued functions of complex
numbers is defined, and it is shown that continuous functions from the complex to the real numbers
achieve a minimum value over a closed square region. An important case of continuous real-valued,
complex functions results from taking the traditional complex norm of a continuous complex function.
We think of these continuous functions as having only one (complex) argument, but in ACL2(r) they
appear as functions of two arguments. The extra argument is a "context", which is uninterpreted.
For example, it could be other arguments that are held fixed, as in an exponential function which
has a base and an exponent, either of which could be held fixed. Second, it is shown that complex polynomials
are continuous, so the norm of a complex polynomial is a continuous real-valued function and it achieves
its minimum over an arbitrary square region centered at the origin. This part of the proof benefits
from the introduction of the "context" argument, and it illustrates an innovation that simplifies
the proofs of classical properties with unbound parameters. Third, we derive lower and upper bounds
on the norm of non-constant polynomials for inputs that are sufficiently far away from the origin.
This means that a sufficiently large square can be found to guarantee that it contains the global
minimum of the norm of the polynomial. Fourth, it is shown that if a given number is not a root of a non-constant
polynomial, then it cannot be the global minimum. Finally, these results are combined to show that
the global minimum must be a root of the polynomial. This result is part of a larger effort in the formalization
of complex polynomials in ACL2(r).
