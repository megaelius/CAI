Ages in ocean sediment cores are often inferred using either benthic ${\delta}^{18}{\rm{O}}$
or planktonic ${}^{14}{\rm{C}}$ of foraminiferal calcite. Existing probabilistic dating methods
infer ages in two distinct approaches: ages are either inferred directly using radionuclides,
e.g. Bacon [Blaauw and Christen (2011)]; or indirectly based on the alignment of records, e.g. HMM-Match
[Lin et al. (2014)]. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for integrating these two approaches
by constructing Dual Proxy Gaussian Process (DPGP) stacks, which represent a probabilistic model
of benthic ${\delta}^{18}{\rm{O}}$ change (and its timing) based on a set of cores. While a previous
stack construction algorithm, HMM-Match, uses a discrete age inference model based on Hidden Markov
models (HMMs) [Durbin et al. (1998)] and requires a number of records enough to sufficiently cover
all its ages, DPGP stacks with time-varying variances are constructed with continuous ages obtained
by particle smoothing [Doucet et al. (2001); Klaas et al. (2006)] and Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[Peters (2008)] algorithms, and can be derived from a small number of records by applying the Gaussian
process regression [Rasmussen and Williams (2005)]. As an example of the stacking method, we construct
a local stack from 6 cores in the deep northeastern Atlantic Ocean and compare it to a deterministically
constructed ${\delta}^{18}{\rm{O}}$ stack of 58 cores from the deep North Atlantic [Lisiecki
and Stern (2016)]. We also provide two examples of how dual proxy alignment ages can be inferred by
aligning additional cores to the stack.
