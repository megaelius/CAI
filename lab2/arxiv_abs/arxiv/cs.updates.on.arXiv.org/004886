In many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, resources like CPU, memory, and battery power are
limited and cannot afford the classic cryptographic security solutions. Silicon Physical Unclonable
Function (PUF) is a lightweight security primitive that exploits manufacturing variations during
the chip fabrication process for key generation and/or device authentication. Ring Oscillator
(RO) PUF as one of the most popular silicon weak PUFs can generate secret bits by comparing the frequency
difference between any two ROs. Previous RO PUFs improve flexibility and reliability through adding
redundant ROs, which incurs unacceptable hardware overheads. In addition, traditional weak PUFs
such as RO PUF generate chip-unique key for each device, which restricts their application in security
protocols where the same key is required to be shared in resource-constrained devices. In order
to address these shortcomings, we propose a crossover RO PUF (CRO PUF) that improves flexibility,
reliability and reduces hardware overheads. It is the first PUF that can generate the shared key
in physically. The basic idea is to implement one-to-one input-output mapping with Lookup Table
(LUT)-based interstage crossing structures in each level of inverters. Individual customization
on configuration bits of interstage crossing structure and different RO selections with challenges
bring high flexibility. Therefore, with the flexible configuration of interstage crossing structures
and challenges, CRO PUF can generate the same shared key for resource-constrained devices, which
enables a new application for lightweight key sharing protocols. Experimental results show that
our proposed PUF structure has much lower hardware overheads, better uniqueness and reliability
than the previous configurable RO PUFs.
