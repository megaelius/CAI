Advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are ushering in a new age of
automation, as machines match or outperform human performance. Machine intelligence can enable
businesses to improve performance by reducing errors, improving sensitivity, quality and speed,
and in some cases achieving outcomes that go beyond current resource capabilities. Relevant applications
include new product architecture design, rapid material characterization, and life-cycle management
tied with a digital strategy that will enable efficient development of products from cradle to grave.
In addition, there are also challenges to overcome that must be addressed through a major, sustained
research effort that is based solidly on both inferential and computational principles applied
to design tailoring of functionally optimized structures. Current applications of structural
materials in the aerospace industry demand the highest quality control of material microstructure,
especially for advanced rotational turbomachinery in aircraft engines in order to have the best
tailored material property. In this paper, deep convolutional neural networks were developed
to accurately predict processing-structure-property relations from materials microstructures
images, surpassing current best practices and modeling efforts. The models automatically learn
critical features, without the need for manual specification and/or subjective and expensive
image analysis. Further, in combination with generative deep learning models, a framework is proposed
to enable rapid material design space exploration and property identification and optimization.
The implementation must take account of real-time decision cycles and the trade-offs between speed
and accuracy.
