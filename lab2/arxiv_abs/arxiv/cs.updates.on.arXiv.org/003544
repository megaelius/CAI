Current State-of-the-Art High Throughput Satellite systems provide wide-area connectivity
through multi-beam architectures. Due to the tremendous system throughput requirements that
next generation Satellite Communications (SatCom) expect to achieve, traditional 4-colour frequency
reuse schemes are not sufficient anymore and more aggressive solutions as full frequency reuse
are being considered for multi-beam SatCom. These approaches require advanced interference management
techniques to cope with the significantly increased inter-beam interference both at the transmitter,
e.g., precoding, and at the receiver, e.g., Multi User Detection (MUD). With respect to the former,
several peculiar challenges arise when designed for SatCom systems. In particular, multiple users
are multiplexed in the same transmission radio frame, thus imposing to consider multiple channel
matrices when computing the precoding coefficients. In previous works, the main focus has been
on the users' clustering and precoding design. However, even though achieving significant throughput
gains, no analysis has been performed on the impact of the system scheduling algorithm on multicast
precoding, which is typically assumed random. In this paper, we focus on this aspect by showing that,
although the overall system performance is improved, a random scheduler does not properly tackle
specific scenarios in which the precoding algorithm can poorly perform. Based on these considerations,
we design a Geographical Scheduling Algorithm (GSA) aimed at improving the precoding performance
in these critical scenarios and, consequently, the performance at system level as well. Through
extensive numerical simulations, we show that the proposed GSA provides a significant performance
improvement with respect to the legacy random scheduling.
