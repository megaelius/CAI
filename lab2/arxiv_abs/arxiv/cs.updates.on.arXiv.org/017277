Computer-aided early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal form mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) based on structure Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) has provided a cost-effective
and objective way for early prevention and treatment of disease progression, leading to improved
patient care. In this work, we have proposed a novel computer-aided approach for early diagnosis
of AD by introducing an explainable 3D Residual Attention Deep Neural Network (3D ResAttNet) for
end-to-end learning from sMRI scans. Different from the existing approaches, the novelty of our
approach is three-fold: 1) A Residual Self-Attention Deep Neural Network has been proposed to capture
local, global and spatial information of MR images to improve diagnostic performance; 2) An explainable
method using Gradient-based Localization Class Activation mapping (Grad-CAM) has been introduced
to improve the explainable of the proposed method; 3) This work has provided a full end-to-end learning
solution for automated disease diagnosis. Our proposed 3D ResAttNet method has been evaluated
on a large cohort of subjects from real dataset for two changeling classification tasks (i.e. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) vs. Normal cohort (NC) and progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable MCI (sMCI)). The experimental
results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models with significant
performance improvement. The accuracy for AD vs. NC and sMCI vs. pMCI task are 97.1% and 84.1% respectively.
The explainable mechanism in our approach regions is able to identify and highlight the contribution
of the important brain parts (hippocampus, lateral ventricle and most parts of the cortex) for transparent
decisions.
