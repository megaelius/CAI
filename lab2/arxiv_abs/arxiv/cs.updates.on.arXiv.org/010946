In Online Social Networks (OSNs), interpersonal communication and information sharing are happening
all the time, and it is real-time. When a user initiates an activity in OSNs, immediately, he/she
will have a certain influence in his/her friendship circle automatically. Then, some users in the
initiator's friendship circle will be attracted to participate in this activity. Based on such
a fact, we design a k-hop Collaborate Game Model, which means that an activity initiated by a user
can only influence those users whose distance are within k-hop from the initiator in OSNs. Besides,
we introduce the problem of Revenue Maximization under k-hop Collaborate Game (RMKCG), which identifies
a limited number of initiators in order to obtain benefits as much as possible. Collaborate Game
Model describes in detail how to quantify benefit and the logic behind it. We do not know how many followers
would be generated for an activity in advance, thus, we need to adopt an adaptive strategy, where
the decision who is the next potential initiator depends on the results of past decisions. Adaptive
RMKCG problem can be considered as a new stochastic optimization problem, and we prove it is NP-hard,
adaptive monotone, but not adaptive submodular. But in some special cases, we prove it is adaptive
submodular and an adaptive greedy strategy can obtain a $(1-1/e)$-approximation by adaptive submodularity
theory. Due to the complexity of our model, it is hard to compute the marginal gain for each candidate
user, then, we propose a convenient and efficient computational method. The effectiveness and
correctness of our algorithms are validated by heavy simulation on real-world social networks
eventually.
