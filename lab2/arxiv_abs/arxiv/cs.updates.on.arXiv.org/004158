The control and sensing of large-scale systems results in combinatorial problems not only for sensor
and actuator placement but also for scheduling or observability/controllability. Such combinatorial
constraints in system design and implementation can be captured using a structure known as matroids.
In particular, the algebraic structure of matroids can be exploited to develop scalable algorithms
for sensor and actuator selection, along with quantifiable approximation bounds. However, in
large-scale systems, sensors and actuators may fail or may be (cyber-)attacked. The objective
of this paper is to focus on resilient matroid-constrained problems arising in control and sensing
but in the presence of sensor and actuator failures. In general, resilient matroid-constrained
problems are computationally hard. Contrary to the non-resilient case (with no failures), even
though they often involve objective functions that are monotone or submodular, no scalable approximation
algorithms are known for their solution. In this paper, we provide the first algorithm, that also
has the following properties: First, it achieves system-wide resiliency, i.e., the algorithm
is valid for any number of denial-of-service attacks or failures. Second, it is scalable, as our
algorithm terminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient)
matroid-constrained optimization. Third, it provides provable approximation bounds on the system
performance, since for monotone objective functions our algorithm guarantees a solution close
to the optimal. We quantify our algorithm's approximation performance using a notion of curvature
for monotone (not necessarily submodular) set functions. Finally, we support our theoretical
analyses with numerical experiments, by considering a control-aware sensor selection scenario,
namely, sensing-constrained robot navigation.
