This work explores different particle-based approaches to the simulation of one-dimensional
fractional subdiffusion equations in unbounded domains. We rely on smooth particle approximations,
and consider four methods for estimating the fractional diffusion term. The first method is based
on direct differentiation of the particle representation, it follows the Riesz definition of the
fractional derivative and results in a non-conservative scheme. The other three methods follow
the particle strength exchange (PSE) methodology and are by construction conservative, in the
sense that the total particle strength is time invariant. The first PSE algorithm is based on using
direct differentiation to estimate the fractional diffusion flux, and exploiting the resulting
estimates in an integral representation of the divergence operator. Meanwhile, the second one
relies on the regularized Riesz representation of the fractional diffusion term to derive a suitable
interaction formula acting directly on the particle representation of the diffusing field. A third
PSE construction is considered that exploits the Green's function of the fractional diffusion
equation. The performance of all four approaches is assessed for the case of a one-dimensional diffusion
equation with constant diffusivity. This enables us to take advantage of known analytical solutions,
and consequently conduct a detailed analysis of the performance of the methods. This includes a
quantitative study of the various sources of error, namely filtering, quadrature, domain truncation,
and time integration, as well as a space and time self-convergence analysis. These analyses are
conducted for different values of the order of the fractional derivatives, and computational experiences
are used to gain insight that can be used for generalization of the present constructions.
