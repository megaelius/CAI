Information Retrieval (IR) is the task of obtaining pieces of data (such as documents) that are relevant
to a particular query or need from a large repository of information. IR is a valuable component of
several downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Practically, IR is at the heart of
many widely-used technologies like search engines. While probabilistic ranking functions like
the Okapi BM25 function have been utilized in IR systems since the 1970's, modern neural approaches
pose certain advantages compared to their classical counterparts. In particular, the release
of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has had a significant impact
in the NLP community by demonstrating how the use of a Masked Language Model trained on a large corpus
of data can improve a variety of downstream NLP tasks, including sentence classification and passage
re-ranking. IR Systems are also important in the biomedical and clinical domains. Given the increasing
amount of scientific literature across biomedical domain, the ability find answers to specific
clinical queries from a repository of millions of articles is a matter of practical value to medical
professionals. Moreover, there are domain-specific challenges present, including handling
clinical jargon and evaluating the similarity or relatedness of various medical symptoms when
determining the relevance between a query and a sentence. This work presents contributions to several
aspects of the Biomedical Semantic Information Retrieval domain. First, it introduces Multi-Perspective
Sentence Relevance, a novel methodology of utilizing BERT-based models for contextual IR. The
system is evaluated using the BioASQ Biomedical IR Challenge. Finally, practical contributions
in the form of a live IR system for medics and a proposed challenge on the Living Systematic Review
clinical task are provided.
