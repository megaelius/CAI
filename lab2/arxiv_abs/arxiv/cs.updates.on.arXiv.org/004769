In this paper, we combine ideas from machine learning (ML) and operations research and management
science (OR/MS) in developing a framework, along with specific methods, for using data to prescribe
optimal decisions in OR/MS problems. In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization
and reflecting our practical experience with the data available in applications of OR/MS, we consider
data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues,
such as demand or returns, but predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities.
The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect
observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown.
We demonstrate that our proposed solution methods, which are inspired by ML methods such as local
regression, CART, and random forests, are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems.
We prove that they are tractable and asymptotically optimal even when data is not iid and may be censored.
We extend this to the case where decision variables may directly affect uncertainty in unknown ways,
such as pricing's effect on demand. As an analogue to R^2, we develop a metric P termed the coefficient
of prescriptiveness to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from
an operations perspective. To demonstrate the power of our approach in a real-world setting we study
an inventory management problem faced by the distribution arm of an international media conglomerate,
which ships an average of 1bil units per year. We leverage internal data and public online data harvested
from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Google to prescribe operational decisions that outperform baseline
measures. Specifically, the data we collect, leveraged by our methods, accounts for an 88\% improvement
as measured by our P.
