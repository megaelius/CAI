The smooth operation of largely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) applications will depend on,
among other things, effective infrastructure failure detection. Access failures in wireless
network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called "sleeping cells", which can render a cell
catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making
them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework
based on the use of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) statistics from the BS under study, as well as
those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure.
A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose
a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose
the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real
location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification
problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of
the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees
and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve
(AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rate (FPR) under 5 %. The proposed
framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures,
that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced
by IoT applications.
