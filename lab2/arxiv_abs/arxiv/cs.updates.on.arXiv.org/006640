Real-time monitoring of various structural behaviors, particularly displacement and acceleration,
serves important and valuable information for people; for example, they can be used for active control
or damage warning. With recent advancement of the Internet of Things and client-side web technologies,
wireless integrated sensor devices nowadays can process real-time raw sensor signal data into
target measurements, such as displacement, and then send the results through a standard protocol
to the servers on the Internet. The monitoring results are further processed for visualization
purpose in the servers and the computed results are pushed to connected clients like browsers or
mobile applications in real-time. We build a real-time cloud-based system that can receive heterogeneous
IoT data, allow users to create a three-dimensional model online according to the real world structure,
and the monitoring results can be visualized in that model. In this paper, we illustrate the software
architecture of the proposed system and focus on the technologies that are used, like client-side
scripting, NoSql database, and socket communication. We also present the challenges of displaying
the overall movement and shape transformation of the 3D structural model. Thus, each internal-connected
element's rotations and translations are obtained by converting the monitoring results of each
sensor device measured in the global coordinate system. To overcome this, we create an inverted
movement calculation method. A simple 3D two-level structural model and simulated sensor displacements
are used to demonstrate system function and validate the inverted movement calculation method.
