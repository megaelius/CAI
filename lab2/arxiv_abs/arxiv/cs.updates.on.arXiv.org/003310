Device proximity verification has a wide range of security applications such as proximity authentication,
multi-factor authentication, group-membership management and many more. To achieve high ease-of-use,
a recently proposed class of solutions exploit contextual information captured by onboard sensors
including radio (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS receivers), ambient sounds (microphones), movement
(accelerometers) and physical environment (light, temperature and humidity) to facilitate the
verification process with minimal user involvement. Active acoustic methods have some advantages
over many others: they work indoors, they can take the shape of the enclosure and barriers into account,
they don't require pre-installed infrastructure and they are relatively fast. In this paper we
propose R-Prox, an approach for proximity (copresence) verification based on acoustic Room Impulse
Response (RIR). In R-Prox, one device actively emits a short, wide-band audible chirp and all participating
devices record reflections of the chirp from the surrounding environment. From this impulse response
signal, we extract features on different frequency bands and compare them for a copresence verdict.
We evaluate our method by collecting RIR data with various Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mobile
devices in different rooms. We then train a binary classification model to determine copresence
using RIR features. In our experiments we show R-Prox to be sensitive, with false negative verdicts
can be as low as 0.059 of the true copresence cases. Although R-Prox's false positive rate is not as
low (in case rooms are likely having similar acoustic RIR), we show that it can be effectively combined
with schemes like Sound-Proof (which suffers from high false positive rates in some adversarial
settings) so that the resulting system has high accuracy.
