The DDoS attack is a serious threat to Internet of Things (IoT). As a a new class of DDoS attack, Link-flooding
attack (LFA) disrupts connectivity between legitimate hosts and target servers (i.e., victims)
by flooding only a small number of links. Several mechanisms have been proposed to mitigate the sophisticated
attack. However, they can only reactively mitigate LFA after target links have been flooded by the
adversaries. In this paper, we propose an active LFA mitigation mechanism, called Linkbait, that
is a proactive and preventive defense to throttle LFA. The fact behind Linkbait is that adversaries
rely on the set of key links impacting the network connectivity (i.e., linkmap) to identify target
links that ensure network connectivity of victims. Linkbait mitigates the attacks by interfering
with linkmap discovery and providing a fake linkmap to adversaries. Inspired by moving target defense
(MTD), we propose a link obfuscation algorithm in Linkbait that selectively reroutes probing flows
to hide target links from adversaries and mislead them to identify bait links as target links. By
providing the faked linkmap to adversaries, Linkbait can actively mitigate LFA even without identifying
bots while not affecting flows from legitimate hosts. To block attack traffic and further reduce
the impact in networks, we propose a bot detection algorithm that extracts unique traffic patterns
of LFA and leverages support vector machine (SVM) to identify attack traffic. We evaluate the feasibility
of deploying Linkbait in real Internet, and evaluate its performance by using both real-world experiments
and large-scale simulations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Linkbait.
