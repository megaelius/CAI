In online communications, patterns of conduct of individual actors and use of emotions in the process
can lead to a complex social graph exhibiting multilayered structure and mesoscopic communities.
Using simplicial complexes representation of graphs, we investigate in-depth topology of online
social network which is based on MySpace dialogs. The network exhibits original community structure.
In addition, we simulate emotion spreading in this network that enables to identify two emotion-propagating
layers. The analysis resulting in three structure vectors quantifies the graph's architecture
at different topology levels. Notably, structures emerging through shared links, triangles and
tetrahedral faces, frequently occur and range from tree-like to maximal 5-cliques and their respective
complexes. On the other hand, the structures which spread only negative or only positive emotion
messages appear to have much simpler topology consisting of links and triangles. Furthermore,
we introduce the node's structure vector which represents the number of simplices at each topology
level in which the node resides. The total number of such simplices determines what we define as the
node's topological dimension. The presented results suggest that the node's topological dimension
provides a suitable measure of the social capital which measures the agent's ability to act as a broker
in compact communities, the so called Simmelian brokerage. We also generalize the results to a wider
class of computer-generated networks. Investigating components of the node's vector over network
layers reveals that same nodes develop different socio-emotional relations and that the influential
nodes build social capital by combining their connections in different layers.
