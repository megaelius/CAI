Shape is an important physical property of natural and manmade 3D objects that characterizes their
external appearances. Understanding differences between shapes and modeling the variability
within and across shape classes, hereinafter referred to as \emph{shape analysis}, are fundamental
problems to many applications, ranging from computer vision and computer graphics to biology and
medicine. This chapter provides an overview of some of the recent techniques that studied the shape
of 3D objects that undergo non-rigid deformations including bending and stretching. Recent surveys
that covered some aspects such classification, retrieval, recognition, and rigid or nonrigid
registration, focused on methods that use shape descriptors. Descriptors, however, provide abstract
representations that do not enable the exploration of shape variability. In this chapter, we focus
on recent techniques that treated the shape of 3D objects as points in some high dimensional space
where paths describe deformations. Equipping the space with a suitable metric enables the quantification
of the range of deformations of a given shape, which in turn enables (1) comparing and classifying
3D objects based on their shape, (2) computing smooth deformations, i.e. geodesics, between pairs
of objects, and (3) modeling and exploring continuous shape variability in a collection of 3D models.
This article surveys and classifies recent developments in this field, outlines fundamental issues,
discusses their potential applications in computer vision and graphics, and highlights opportunities
for future research. Our primary goal is to bridge the gap between various techniques that have been
often independently proposed by different communities including mathematics and statistics,
computer vision and graphics, and medical image analysis.
