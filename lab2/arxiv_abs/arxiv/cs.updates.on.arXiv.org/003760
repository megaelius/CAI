The repair problem in distributed storage addresses recovery of the data encoded using an erasure
code, for instance, a Reed-Solomon (RS) code. We consider the problem of repairing a single node
or multiple nodes in RS-coded storage systems using the smallest possible amount of inter-nodal
communication. According to the cut-set bound, communication cost of repairing $h\ge 1$ failed
nodes for an $(n,k=n-r)$ MDS code using $d$ helper nodes is at least $dhl/(d+h-k),$ where $l$ is the
size of the node. Guruswami and Wootters (2016) initiated the study of efficient repair of RS codes,
showing that they can be repaired using a smaller bandwidth than under the trivial approach. At the
same time, their work as well as follow-up papers stopped short of constructing RS codes (or any scalar
MDS codes) that meet the cut-set bound with equality. In this paper we construct families of RS codes
that achieve the cutset bound for repair of one or several nodes. In the single-node case, we present
RS codes of length $n$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_{q^l},l=\exp((1+o(1))n\log n)$ that meet the
cut-set bound. We also prove an almost matching lower bound on $l$, showing that super-exponential
scaling is both necessary and sufficient for scalar MDS codes to achieve the cut-set bound using
linear repair schemes. For the case of multiple nodes, we construct a family of RS codes that achieve
the cut-set bound universally for the repair of any $h=2,3,\dots$ failed nodes from any subset of
$d$ helper nodes, $k\le d\le n-h.$ For a fixed number of parities $r$ the node size of the constructed
codes is close to the smallest possible node size for codes with such properties.
