Study Objectives: Sleep stage scoring is performed manually by sleep experts and is prone to subjective
interpretation of scoring rules with low intra- and interscorer reliability. Many automatic systems
rely on few small-scale databases for developing models, and generalizability to new datasets
is thus unknown. We investigated a novel deep neural network to assess the generalizability of several
large-scale cohorts. Methods: A deep neural network model was developed using 15684 polysomnography
studies from five different cohorts. We applied four different scenarios: 1) impact of varying
time-scales in the model; 2) performance of a single cohort on other cohorts of smaller, greater
or equal size relative to the performance of other cohorts on a single cohort; 3) varying the fraction
of mixed-cohort training data compared to using single-origin data; and 4) comparing models trained
on combinations of data from 2, 3, and 4 cohorts. Results: Overall classification accuracy improved
with increasing fractions of training data (0.25$\%$: 0.782 $\pm$ 0.097, 95$\%$ CI [0.777-0.787];
100$\%$: 0.869 $\pm$ 0.064, 95$\%$ CI [0.864-0.872]), and with increasing number of data sources
(2: 0.788 $\pm$ 0.102, 95$\%$ CI [0.787-0.790]; 3: 0.808 $\pm$ 0.092, 95$\%$ CI [0.807-0.810];
4: 0.821 $\pm$ 0.085, 95$\%$ CI [0.819-0.823]). Different cohorts show varying levels of generalization
to other cohorts. Conclusions: Automatic sleep stage scoring systems based on deep learning algorithms
should consider as much data as possible from as many sources available to ensure proper generalization.
Public datasets for benchmarking should be made available for future research.
