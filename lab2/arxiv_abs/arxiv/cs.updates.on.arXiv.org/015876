In the k-median problem we are given sets of facilities and customers, and distances between them.
For a given set F of facilities, the cost of serving a customer u is the minimum distance between u and
a facility in F. The goal is to find a set F of k facilities that minimizes the sum, over all customers,
of their service costs. Following Mettu and Plaxton, we study the incremental medians problem,
where k is not known in advance, and the algorithm produces a nested sequence of facility sets where
the kth set has size k. The algorithm is c-cost-competitive if the cost of each set is at most c times
the cost of the optimum set of size k. We give improved incremental algorithms for the metric version:
an 8-cost-competitive deterministic algorithm, a 2e ~ 5.44-cost-competitive randomized algorithm,
a (24+epsilon)-cost-competitive, poly-time deterministic algorithm, and a (6e+epsilon ~ .31)-cost-competitive,
poly-time randomized algorithm. The algorithm is s-size-competitive if the cost of the kth set
is at most the minimum cost of any set of size k, and has size at most s k. The optimal size-competitive
ratios for this problem are 4 (deterministic) and e (randomized). We present the first poly-time
O(log m)-size-approximation algorithm for the offline problem and first poly-time O(log m)-size-competitive
algorithm for the incremental problem. Our proofs reduce incremental medians to the following
online bidding problem: faced with an unknown threshold T, an algorithm submits "bids" until it
submits a bid that is at least the threshold. It pays the sum of all its bids. We prove that folklore
algorithms for online bidding are optimally competitive.
