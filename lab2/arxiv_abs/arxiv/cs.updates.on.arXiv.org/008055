Homograph attack is a way that attackers deceive victims about which domain they are communicating
with by exploiting the fact that many characters look alike. The attack becomes serious and is raising
broad attention when recently many brand domains have been attacked such as Apple Inc., Adobe Inc.,
Lloyds Bank, etc. We first design a survey of human demographics, brand familiarity, and security
backgrounds and apply it to 2,067 participants. We build a regression model to study which actors
affect participants' ability in recognizing homograph domains. We then find that participants
exhibit different ability for different kinds of homographs. For instance, female participants
tend to be able to recognize homographs while male participants tend to be able to recognize non-homographs.
Furthermore, 16.59% of participants can recognize homographs whose visual similarity with the
target brand domains is under 99.9%; however, when the similarity increases to 99.9%, the number
of participants who can recognize homographs drops down significantly to merely 0.19%; and for
the homographs with 100% of visual similarity, there is no way for the participants to recognize.
We also find that people working or educated in computer science or computer engineering are the
ones who tend to exhibit the best ability to recognize all kinds of homographs and non-homographs.
Surprisingly to us, brand familiarity does not influcence the ability in either homographs or non-homographs.
Stated differently, people who frequently use the brand domains but do not have enough knowledge
are still easy to fall in vulnerabilities.
