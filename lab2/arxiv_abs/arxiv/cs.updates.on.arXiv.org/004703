Low rank matrix factorisation is often used in recommender systems as a way of extracting latent
features. When dealing with large and sparse datasets, traditional recommendation algorithms
face the problem of acquiring large, unrestrained, fluctuating values over predictions especially
for users/items with very few corresponding observations. Although the problem has been somewhat
solved by imposing bounding constraints over its objectives, and/or over all entries to be within
a fixed range, in terms of gaining better recommendations, these approaches have two major shortcomings
that we aim to mitigate in this work: one is they can only deal with one pair of fixed bounds for all entries,
and the other one is they are very time-consuming when applied on large scale recommender systems.
In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named Magnitude Bounded Matrix Factorisation (MBMF),
which allows different bounds for individual users/items and performs very fast on large scale
datasets. The key idea of our algorithm is to construct a model by constraining the magnitudes of
each individual user/item feature vector. We achieve this by converting from the Cartesian to Spherical
coordinate system with radii set as the corresponding magnitudes, which allows the above constrained
optimisation problem to become an unconstrained one. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method
is then applied to solve the unconstrained task efficiently. Experiments on synthetic and real
datasets demonstrate that in most cases the proposed MBMF is superior over all existing algorithms
in terms of accuracy and time complexity.
