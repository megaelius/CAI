Docker technology has been increasingly used among software developers in a multitude of projects.
This growing interest is due to the fact that Docker technology supports a convenient process for
creating and building containers, promoting close cooperation between developer and operations
teams, and enabling continuous software delivery. As a fast-growing technology, it is important
to identify the Docker-related topics that are most popular as well as existing challenges and difficulties
that developers face. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study identifying practitioners'
perspectives on Docker technology by mining posts from the Stack Overflow (SoF) community. Method:
A dataset of 113,922 Docker-related posts was created based on a set of relevant tags and contents.
The dataset was cleaned and prepared. Topic modelling was conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA), allowing the identification of dominant topics in the domain. Our results show that most
developers use SoF to ask about a broad spectrum of Docker topics including framework development,
application deployment, continuous integration, web-server configuration and many more. We
determined that 30 topics that developers discuss can be grouped into 13 main categories. Most of
the posts belong to categories of application development, configuration, and networking. On
the other hand, we find that the posts on monitoring status, transferring data, and authenticating
users are more popular among developers compared to the other topics. Specifically, developers
face challenges in web browser issues, networking error and memory management. Besides, there
is a lack of experts in this domain. Our research findings will guide future work on the development
of new tools and techniques, helping the community to focus efforts and understand existing trade-offs
on Docker topics.
