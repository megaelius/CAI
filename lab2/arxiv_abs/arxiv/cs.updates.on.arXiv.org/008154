Using joint actuators to drive the skeletal movements is a common practice in character animation,
but the resultant torque patterns are often unnatural or infeasible for real humans to achieve.
On the other hand, physiologically-based models explicitly simulate muscles and tendons and thus
produce more human-like movements and torque patterns. This paper introduces a technique to transform
an optimal control problem formulated in the muscle-actuation space to an equivalent problem in
the joint-actuation space, such that the solutions to both problems have the same optimal value.
By solving the equivalent problem in the joint-actuation space, we can generate human-like motions
comparable to those generated by musculotendon models, while retaining the benefit of simple modeling
and fast computation offered by joint-actuation models. Our method transforms constant bounds
on muscle activations to nonlinear, state-dependent torque limits in the joint-actuation space.
In addition, the metabolic energy function on muscle activations is transformed to a nonlinear
function of joint torques, joint configuration and joint velocity. Our technique can also benefit
policy optimization using deep reinforcement learning approach, by providing a more anatomically
realistic action space for the agent to explore during the learning process. We take the advantage
of the physiologically-based simulator, OpenSim, to provide training data for learning the torque
limits and the metabolic energy function. Once trained, the same torque limits and the energy function
can be applied to drastically different motor tasks formulated as either trajectory optimization
or policy learning.
