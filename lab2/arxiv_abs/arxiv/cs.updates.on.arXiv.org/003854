Data stream has been the underlying challenge in the age of big data because it calls for real-time
data processing with the absence of a retraining process and/or an iterative learning approach.
In realm of fuzzy system community, data stream is handled by algorithmic development of self-adaptive
neurofuzzy systems (SANFS) characterized by the single-pass learning mode and the open structure
property which enables effective handling of fast and rapidly changing natures of data streams.
The underlying bottleneck of SANFSs lies in its design principle which involves a high number of
free parameters (rule premise and rule consequent) to be adapted in the training process. This figure
can even double in the case of type-2 fuzzy system. In this work, a novel SANFS, namely parsimonious
learning machine (PALM), is proposed. PALM features utilization of a new type of fuzzy rule based
on the concept of hyperplane clustering which significantly reduces the number of network parameters
because it has no rule premise parameters. PALM is proposed in both type-1 and type-2 fuzzy systems
where all of which characterize a fully dynamic rule-based system. That is, it is capable of automatically
generating, merging and tuning the hyperplane based fuzzy rule in the single pass manner. The efficacy
of PALM has been evaluated through numerical study with six real-world and synthetic data streams
from public database and our own real-world project of autonomous vehicles. The proposed model
showcases significant improvements in terms of computational complexity and number of required
parameters against several renowned SANFSs, while attaining comparable and often better predictive
accuracy.
