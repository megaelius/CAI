Classic network utility maximization problems are usually solved assuming all information is
available, implying that information not locally available is always truthfully reported. This
may not be practical in all scenarios, especially in distributed/semi-distributed networks.
In this paper, incentive for truthful reporting in network optimizations with local information
is studied. A novel general model for extending network utility maximization (NUM) problems to
incorporate local information is proposed, which allows each user to choose its own objective locally
and/or privately. Two specific problems, i.e., a user-centric problem (UCP) and a network-centric
problem (NCP), are studied. In the UCP, a network center aims to maximize the collective benefit
of all users, and truthful reporting from the users regarding their local information is necessary
for finding the solution. We show that the widely-adopted dual pricing cannot guarantee truthful
information reporting from a user unless the resource is over-supplied or the price is too high for
this user to afford. In the NCP, the network center has its own objective and preferred solution,
and incentive needs to be provided for the users to adopt the solution it prefers. Truthful reporting
from users is necessary for the center to determine the incentives and achieve its solution. For
two-user and multiuser cases, we propose two mechanisms to motivate truthful reporting from users
while guaranteeing nonnegative utility gains for both the users and the center. A case study on underlay
D2D communication illustrates the application of the UCP and NCP. Simulations are conducted for
the D2D application to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the proposed mechanisms.
