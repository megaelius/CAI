This paper proposes a method to compute crossfields based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The Ginzburg-Landau
functional has two terms: the Dirichlet energy of the distribution and a term penalizing the mismatch
between the fixed and actual norm of the distribution. Directional fields on surfaces are known
to have a number of critical points, which are properly identified with the Ginzburg-Landau approach:
the asymptotic behavior of Ginzburg-Landau problem provides well-distributed critical points
over the 2-manifold, whose indices are as low as possible. The central idea in this paper is to exploit
this theoretical background for crossfield computation on arbitrary surfaces. Such crossfields
are instrumental in the generation of meshes with quadrangular elements. The relation between
the topological properties of quadrangular meshes and crossfields are hence first recalled. It
is then shown that a crossfield on a surface can be represented by a complex function of unit norm with
a number of critical points, i.e., a nearly everywhere smooth function taking its values in the unit
circle of the complex plane. As maximal smoothness of the crossfield is equivalent with minimal
energy, the crossfield problem is equivalent to an optimization problem based on Ginzburg-Landau
functional. A discretization scheme with Crouzeix-Raviart elements is applied and the correctness
of the resulting finite element formulation is validated on the unit disk by comparison with an analytical
solution. The method is also applied to the 2-sphere where, surprisingly but rightly, the computed
critical points are not located at the vertices of a cube, but at those of an anticube.
