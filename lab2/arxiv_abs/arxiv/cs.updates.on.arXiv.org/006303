Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) represent a rich resource for conducting observational
studies, supporting clinical trials, and more. However, much of the relevant information is stored
in an unstructured format that makes it difficult to use. Natural language processing approaches
that attempt to automatically classify the data depend on vectorization algorithms that impose
structure on the text, but these algorithms were not designed for the unique characteristics of
EHR. Here, we propose a new algorithm for structuring so-called free-text that may help researchers
make better use of EHR. We call this method Relevant Word Order Vectorization (RWOV). Materials
and Methods: As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to classify the hormone receptor status of breast
cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center during a recent year, from the
unstructured text of pathology reports. Our approach attempts to account for the semi-structured
way that healthcare providers often enter information. We compared this approach to the ngrams
and word2vec methods. Results: Our approach resulted in the most consistently high accuracy, as
measured by F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Discussion:
Our results suggest that methods of structuring free text that take into account its context may
show better performance, and that our approach is promising. Conclusion: By using a method that
accounts for the fact that healthcare providers tend to use certain key words repetitively and that
the order of these key words is important, we showed improved performance over methods that do not.
