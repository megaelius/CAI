Data-parallel problems, commonly found in data analytics, machine learning, and scientific computing
demand ever growing floating-point operations per second under tight area- and energy-efficiency
constraints. Application-specific architectures and accelerators, while efficient at a given
task, are hard to adjust to algorithmic changes. In this work, we present Manticore, a general-purpose,
ultra-efficient, RISC-V, chiplet-based architecture for data-parallel floating-point workloads.
We have manufactured a 9$\text{mm}^2$ prototype of the chiplet's computational core in Globalfoundries
22nm FD-SOI process and demonstrate more than 2.5$\times$ improvement in energy efficiency on
floating-point intensive workloads compared to high performance compute engines (CPUs and GPUs),
despite their more advanced FinFET process. The prototype contains two 64-bit, application-class
RISC-V Ariane management cores that run a full-fledged Linux OS. The compute capability at high
energy and area efficiency is provided by Snitch clusters. Each cluster contains eight small (20kGE)
32-bit integer RISC-V cores, each controlling a large double-precision floating-point unit (120kGE).
Each core supports two custom RISC-V ISA extensions: FREP and SSR. The SSR extension elides explicit
load and store instructions by encoding them as register reads and writes. The FREP extension mostly
decouples the integer core from the FPU by allowing a sequence buffer to issue instructions to the
FPU independently. Both extensions allow the tiny, single-issue, integer core to saturate the
instruction bandwidth of the FPU and achieve FPU utilization above 90%, with more than 80% of core
area dedicated to the FPU.
