Fourier ptychography is a recently developed imaging approach for large field-of-view and high-resolution
microscopy. Here we model the Fourier ptychographic forward imaging process using a convolution
neural network (CNN) and recover the complex object information in the network training process.
In this approach, the input of the network is the point spread function in the spatial domain or the
coherent transfer function in the Fourier domain. The object is treated as 2D learnable weights
of a convolution or a multiplication layer. The output of the network is modeled as the loss function
we aim to minimize. The batch size of the network corresponds to the number of captured low-resolution
images in one forward / backward pass. We use a popular open-source machine learning library, TensorFlow,
for setting up the network and conducting the optimization process. We analyze the performance
of different learning rates, different solvers, and different batch sizes. It is shown that a large
batch size with the Adam optimizer achieves the best performance in general. To accelerate the phase
retrieval process, we also discuss a strategy to implement Fourier-magnitude projection using
a multiplication neural network model. Since convolution and multiplication are the two most-common
operations in imaging modeling, the reported approach may provide a new perspective to examine
many coherent and incoherent systems. As a demonstration, we discuss the extensions of the reported
networks for modeling single-pixel imaging and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). 4-frame
resolution doubling is demonstrated using a neural network for SIM. We have made our implementation
code open-source for the broad research community.
