Whole brain segmentation on a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential in non-invasive
investigation for neuroanatomy. Historically, multi-atlas segmentation (MAS) has been regarded
as the de facto standard method for whole brain segmentation. Recently, deep neural network approaches
have been applied to whole brain segmentation by learning random patches or 2D slices. Yet, few previous
efforts have been made on detailed whole brain segmentation using 3D networks due to the following
challenges: (1) fitting entire whole brain volume into 3D networks is restricted by the current
GPU memory, and (2) the large number of targeting labels (e.g., > 100 labels) with limited number
of training 3D volumes (e.g., < 50 scans). In this paper, we propose the spatially localized atlas
network tiles (SLANT) method to distribute multiple independent 3D fully convolutional networks
to cover overlapped sub-spaces in a standard atlas space. This strategy simplifies the whole brain
learning task to localized sub-tasks, which was enabled by combing canonical registration and
label fusion techniques with deep learning. To address the second challenge, auxiliary labels
on 5111 initially unlabeled scans were created by MAS for pre-training. From empirical validation,
the state-of-the-art MAS method achieved mean Dice value of 0.76, 0.71, and 0.68, while the proposed
method achieved 0.78, 0.73, and 0.71 on three validation cohorts. Moreover, the computational
time reduced from > 30 hours using MAS to ~15 minutes using the proposed method. The source code is
