We study dynamic matching in an infinite-horizon stochastic market. While all agents are potentially
compatible with each other, some are hard-to-match and others are easy-to-match. Agents prefer
to be matched as soon as possible and matches are formed either bilaterally or indirectly through
chains. We adopt an asymptotic approach and compute tight bounds on the limit of waiting time of agents
under myopic policies that differ in matching technology and prioritization. We find that the market
composition is a key factor in the desired matching technology and prioritization level. When hard-to-match
agents arrive less frequently than easy-to-match ones (i) bilateral matching is almost as efficient
as chains (waiting times scale similarly under both, though chains always outperform bilateral
matching by a constant factor), and (ii) assigning priorities to hard-to-match agents improves
their waiting times. When hard-to-match agents arrive more frequently, chains are much more efficient
than bilateral matching and prioritization has no impact. We further conduct comparative statics
on arrival rates. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that in a heterogeneous market and under bilateral
matching, increasing arrival rate has a non-monotone effect on waiting times, due to the fact that,
under some market compositions, there is an adverse effect of competition. Our comparative statics
shed light on the impact of merging markets and attracting altruistic agents (that initiate chains)
or easy-to-match agents. This work uncovers fundamental differences between heterogeneous and
homogeneous dynamic markets, and potentially helps policy makers to generate insights on the operations
of matching markets such as kidney exchange programs.
