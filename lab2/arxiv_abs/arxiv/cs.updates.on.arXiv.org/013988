There has recently been a surge of interest in the computational and complexity properties of the
population model, which assumes $n$ anonymous, computationally-bounded nodes, interacting
at random, and attempting to jointly compute global predicates. In particular, a significant amount
of work, has gone towards investigating majority and consensus dynamics in this model: assuming
that each node is initially in one of two states $X$ or $Y$, determine which state had higher initial
count. In this paper, we consider a natural generalization of majority/consensus, which we call
comparison. We are given two baseline states, $X_0$ and $Y_0$, present in any initial configuration
in fixed, possibly small counts. Importantly, one of these states has higher count than the other:
we will assume $|X_0| \ge C |Y_0|$ for some constant $C$. The challenge is to design a protocol which
can quickly and reliably decide on which of the baseline states $X_0$ and $Y_0$ has higher initial
count. We propose a simple algorithm solving comparison: the baseline algorithm uses $O(\log n)$
states per node, and converges in $O(\log n)$ (parallel) time, with high probability, to a state
where whole population votes on opinions $X$ or $Y$ at rates proportional to initial $|X_0|$ vs.
$|Y_0|$ concentrations. We then describe how such output can be then used to solve comparison. The
algorithm is self-stabilizing, in the sense that it converges to the correct decision even if the
relative counts of baseline states $X_0$ and $Y_0$ change dynamically during the execution, and
leak-robust, in the sense that it can withstand spurious faulty reactions. Our analysis relies
on a new martingale concentration result which relates the evolution of a population protocol to
its expected (steady-state) analysis, which should be broadly applicable in the context of population
protocols and opinion dynamics.
