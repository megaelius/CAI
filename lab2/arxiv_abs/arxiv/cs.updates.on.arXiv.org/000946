Molecular communication is a new field of communication where molecules are used to transfer information.
Among the proposed methods, molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective.
One of the main challenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits communication
at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy efficiency becomes an essential problem.
Before addressing these problems, a pre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated
to make a decision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the optimum threshold,
whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally calculated empirically. Since the main
goal of this paper is to build an MCvD system suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing
quality, new modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of ISI and
enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a modulation technique for MCvD,
molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is proposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing
the ISI. Furthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes the residual
molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a new energy efficient decision
feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute for the decoders such as minimum mean squared error
(MMSE) and decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers
are compared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more advantageous when
energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower computational complexity.
