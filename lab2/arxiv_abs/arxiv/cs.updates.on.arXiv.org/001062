We introduce a new setting where a population of agents, each modelled by a finite-state system,
are controlled uniformly: the controller applies the same action to every agent. The framework
is largely inspired by the control of a biological system, namely a population of yeasts, where the
controller may only change the environment common to all cells. We study a synchronisation problem
for such populations: no matter how individual agents react to the actions of the controller , the
controller aims at driving all agents synchronously to a target state. The agents are naturally
represented by a non-deterministic finite state automaton (NFA), the same for every agent, and
the whole system is encoded as a 2-player game. The first player (Controller) chooses actions, and
the second player (Agents) resolves non-determinism for each agent. The game with m agents is called
the m-population game. This gives rise to a parameterized control problem (where control refers
to 2 player games), namely the population control problem: can Controller control the m-population
game for all $m $\in$ N$ whatever Agents does? In this paper, we prove that the population control
problem is decidable, and it is a EXPTIME-complete problem. As far as we know, this is one of the first
results on parameterized control. Our algorithm, not based on cutoff techniques, produces winning
strategies which are symbolic, that is, they do not need to count precisely how the population is
spread between states. We also show that if there is no winning strategy, then there is a population
size M such that Controller wins the m-population game if and only if $m $\le$ M$. Surprisingly, M
can be doubly exponential in the number of states of the NFA, with tight upper and lower bounds.
