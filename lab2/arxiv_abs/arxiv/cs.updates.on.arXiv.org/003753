The recently proposed relaxed binaural beamforming (RBB) optimization problem provides a flexible
trade-off between noise suppression and binaural-cue preservation of the sound sources in the
acoustic scene. It minimizes the output noise power, under the constraints which guarantee that
the target remains unchanged after processing and the binaural-cue distortions of the acoustic
sources will be less than a user-defined threshold. However, the RBB problem is a computationally
demanding non-convex optimization problem. The only existing suboptimal method which approximately
solves the RBB is a successive convex optimization (SCO) method which, typically, requires to solve
multiple convex optimization problems per frequency bin, in order to converge. Convergence is
achieved when all constraints of the RBB optimization problem are satisfied. In this paper, we propose
a semi-definite convex relaxation (SDCR) of the RBB optimization problem. The proposed suboptimal
SDCR method solves a single convex optimization problem per frequency bin, resulting in a much lower
computational complexity than the SCO method. Unlike the SCO method, the SDCR method does not guarantee
user-controlled upper-bounded binaural-cue distortions. To tackle this problem we also propose
a suboptimal hybrid method which combines the SDCR and SCO methods. Instrumental measures combined
with a listening test show that the SDCR and hybrid methods achieve significantly lower computational
complexity than the SCO method, and in most cases better trade-off between predicted intelligibility
and binaural-cue preservation than the SCO method.
