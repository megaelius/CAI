The notion of comparison between system runs is fundamental in formal verification. This concept
is implicitly present in the verification of qualitative systems, and is more pronounced in the
verification of quantitative systems. In this work, we identify a novel mode of comparison in quantitative
systems: the online comparison of the aggregate values of two sequences of quantitative weights.
This notion is embodied by {\em comparator automata} ({\em comparators}, in short), a new class
of automata that read two infinite sequences of weights synchronously and relate their aggregate
values. We show that {aggregate functions} that can be represented with B\"uchi automaton result
in comparators that are finite-state and accept by the B\"uchi condition as well. Such {\em $\omega$-regular
comparators} further lead to generic algorithms for a number of well-studied problems, including
the quantitative inclusion and winning strategies in quantitative graph games with incomplete
information, as well as related non-decision problems, such as obtaining a finite representation
of all counterexamples in the quantitative inclusion problem. We study comparators for two aggregate
functions: discounted-sum and limit-average. We prove that the discounted-sum comparator is
$\omega$-regular iff the discount-factor is an integer. Not every aggregate function, however,
has an $\omega$-regular comparator. Specifically, we show that the language of sequence-pairs
for which limit-average aggregates exist is neither $\omega$-regular nor $\omega$-context-free.
Given this result, we introduce the notion of {\em prefix-average} as a relaxation of limit-average
aggregation, and show that it admits $\omega$-context-free comparators.
