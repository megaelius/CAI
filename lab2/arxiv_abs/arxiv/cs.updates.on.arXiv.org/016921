For many years, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component
analysis (ICA) has been used for blind source separation (BSS). However, it remains unclear why
these linear methods work well with real-world data that involve nonlinear source mixtures. This
work theoretically validates that a cascade of linear PCA and ICA can solve a nonlinear BSS problem
accurately---when the sensory inputs are generated from hidden sources via the nonlinear mapping
with sufficient dimensionality. Our proposed theorem, termed the asymptotic linearization theorem,
theoretically guarantees that applying linear PCA to the inputs can reliably extract a subspace
spanned by the linear projections from every hidden source as the major components---and thus projecting
the inputs onto their major eigenspace can effectively recover a linear transformation of the hidden
sources. Then, subsequent application of linear ICA can separate all the true independent hidden
sources accurately. Zero-element-wise-error nonlinear BSS is asymptotically attained when
the source dimensionality is large and the input dimensionality is larger than the source dimensionality.
Our proposed theorem is validated analytically and numerically. Moreover, the same computation
can be performed by using Hebbian-like plasticity rules, implying the biological plausibility
of this nonlinear BSS strategy. Our results highlight the utility of linear PCA and ICA for accurately
and reliably recovering nonlinearly mixed sources---and further suggest the importance of employing
sensors with sufficient dimensionality to identify true hidden sources of real-world data.
