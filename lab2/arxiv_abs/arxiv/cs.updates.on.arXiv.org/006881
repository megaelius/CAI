In wireless OFDM communications systems, pilot tones, due to their publicly known and deterministic
characteristic, suffer significant jamming/nulling/spoofing risks. Thus, the convectional
channel training protocol using pilot tones could be attacked and paralyzed, which raises the issue
of anti-attack channel training authentication (CTA), i.e., verifying the claims of identities
of pilot tones and channel estimation samples. In this paper, we consider one-ring scattering scenarios
with large-scale uniform linear arrays (ULA) and develop an independence-checking coding (ICC)
theory to build a secure and stable CTA protocol, namely, ICC-based CTA (ICC-CTA) protocol. In this
protocol, the pilot tones are not only merely randomized and inserted into subcarriers but also
encoded as diversified subcarrier activation patterns (SAPs) simultaneously. Those encoded
SAPs, though camouflaged by malicious signals, can be identified and decoded into original pilots
for high-accuracy channel impulse response (CIR) estimation. The CTA security is first characterized
by the error probability of identifying legitimate CIR estimation samples. The CTA instability
is formulated as the function of probability of stably estimating CIR against all available diversified
SAPs. A realistic tradeoff between the CTA security and instability under the discretely distributed
AoA is identified and an optimally stable tradeoff problem is formulated, with the objective of
optimizing the code rate to maximize security while maintaining maximum stability for ever. Solving
this, we derive the closed-form expression of optimal code rate. Numerical results finally validate
the resilience of proposed ICC-CTA protocol.
