Recent work on neural network pruning indicates that, at training time, neural networks need to
be significantly larger in size than is necessary to represent the eventual functions that they
learn. This paper articulates a new hypothesis to explain this phenomenon. This conjecture, which
we term the "lottery ticket hypothesis," proposes that successful training depends on lucky random
initialization of a smaller subcomponent of the network. Larger networks have more of these "lottery
tickets," meaning they are more likely to luck out with a subcomponent initialized in a configuration
amenable to successful optimization. This paper conducts a series of experiments with XOR and MNIST
that support the lottery ticket hypothesis. In particular, we identify these fortuitously-initialized
subcomponents by pruning low-magnitude weights from trained networks. We then demonstrate that
these subcomponents can be successfully retrained in isolation so long as the subnetworks are given
the same initializations as they had at the beginning of the training process. Initialized as such,
these small networks reliably converge successfully, often faster than the original network at
the same level of accuracy. However, when these subcomponents are randomly reinitialized or rearranged,
they perform worse than the original network. In other words, large networks that train successfully
contain small subnetworks with initializations conducive to optimization. The lottery ticket
hypothesis and its connection to pruning are a step toward developing architectures, initializations,
and training strategies that make it possible to solve the same problems with much smaller networks.
