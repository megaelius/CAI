Cancer is one of the most feared diseases in the world it has increased disturbingly and breast cancer
occurs in one out of eight women, the prediction of malignancies plays essential roles not only in
revealing human genome, but also in discovering effective prevention and treatment of cancers.
Generally cancer disease driven by somatic mutations in an individual DNA sequence, or genome that
accumulates during the lifetime of person. This paper is proposed a novel method can predict the
disease by mutations despite The presence in gene sequence is not necessary it are malignant, so
will be compare the protein of patient with the gene's protein of disease if there is difference between
these two proteins then can say there is malignant mutations. This method will use bioinformatics
techniques like FASTA, CLUSTALW, etc which shows whether malignant mutations or not, then training
the backpropagation algorithm using all expected malignant mutations for a certain genes (e.g.
BRCA1 and BRCA2) of disease, and using it to test whether patient is holder the disease or not. Implementing
this novel method as the first way to predict the disease based on mutations in the sequence of the
gene that causes the disease shows two decisions are achieved successfully, the first diagnose
whether the patient has mutations of cancer or not using bioinformatics techniques the second classifying
these mutations are related to breast cancer (e.g. BRCA1 and BRCA2) using backpropagation with
mean square rate 0.0000001. Keywords-Gene sequence; Protein; Deoxyribonucleic Acid DNA; Malignant
