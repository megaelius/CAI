In networked communications nodes choose among available actions and benefit from exchanging
information through edges, while continuous technological progress fosters system functionings
that increasingly often rely on cooperation. Growing attention is being placed on coalition formation,
where each node chooses what coalition to join, while the surplus generated by cooperation is an
amount of TU (transferable utility) quantified by a real-valued function defined on partitions
-or even embedded coalitions- of nodes. A TU-sharing rule is thus essential, as how players are rewarded
determines their behavior. This work offers a new option for distributing partition function-based
surpluses, dealing with cooperative game theory in terms of both global games and games in partition
function form, namely lattice functions, while the sharing rule is a point-valued solution or value.
The novelty is grounded on the combinatorial definition of such solutions as lattice functions
whose M\"obius inversion lives only on atoms, i.e. on the first level of the lattice. While simply
rephrasing the traditional solution concept for standard coalitional games, this leads to distribute
the surplus generated by partitions across the edges of the network, as the atoms among partitions
are unordered pairs of players. These shares of edges are further divided between nodes, but the
corresponding Shapley value is very different from the traditional one and leads to two alternative
forms, obtained by focusing either on marginal contributions along maximal chains, or else on the
uniform division of Harsanyi dividends. The core is also addressed, and supermodularity is no longer
sufficient for its non-emptiness.
