With the fast development of various positioning techniques such as Global Position System (GPS),
mobile devices and remote sensing, spatio-temporal data has become increasingly available nowadays.
Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important to many real world
applications including human mobility understanding, smart transportation, urban planning,
public safety, health care and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution
of spatio-temporal datasets increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics
based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently, with the advances
of deep learning techniques, deep leaning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and
recurrent neural network (RNN) have enjoyed considerable success in various machine learning
tasks due to their powerful hierarchical feature learning ability in both spatial and temporal
domains, and have been widely applied in various spatio-temporal data mining (STDM) tasks such
as predictive learning, representation learning, anomaly detection and classification. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress in applying deep learning techniques
for STDM. We first categorize the types of spatio-temporal data and briefly introduce the popular
deep learning models that are used in STDM. Then a framework is introduced to show a general pipeline
of the utilization of deep learning models for STDM. Next we classify existing literatures based
on the types of ST data, the data mining tasks, and the deep learning models, followed by the applications
of deep learning for STDM in different domains including transportation, climate science, human
mobility, location based social network, crime analysis, and neuroscience. Finally, we conclude
the limitations of current research and point out future research directions.
