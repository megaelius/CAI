Instead of directly utilizing an observed image including some outliers, noise or intensity inhomogeneity,
the use of its ideal value (e.g. noise-free image) has a favorable impact on clustering. Hence, the
accurate estimation of the residual (e.g. unknown noise) between the observed image and its ideal
value is an important task. To do so, we propose an $\ell_0$ regularization-based Fuzzy $C$-Means
(FCM) algorithm incorporating a morphological reconstruction operation and a tight wavelet frame
transform. To achieve a sound trade-off between detail preservation and noise suppression, morphological
reconstruction is used to filter an observed image. By combining the observed and filtered images,
a weighted sum image is generated. Since a tight wavelet frame system has sparse representations
of an image, it is employed to decompose the weighted sum image, thus forming its corresponding feature
set. Taking it as data for clustering, we present an improved FCM algorithm by imposing an $\ell_0$
regularization term on the residual between the feature set and its ideal value, which implies that
the favorable estimation of the residual is obtained and the ideal value participates in clustering.
Spatial information is also introduced into clustering since it is naturally encountered in image
segmentation. Furthermore, it makes the estimation of the residual more reliable. To further enhance
the segmentation effects of the improved FCM algorithm, we also employ the morphological reconstruction
to smoothen the labels generated by clustering. Finally, based on the prototypes and smoothed labels,
the segmented image is reconstructed by using a tight wavelet frame reconstruction operation.
Experimental results reported for synthetic, medical, and color images show that the proposed
algorithm is effective and efficient, and outperforms other algorithms.
