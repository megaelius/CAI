Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several decades, such that
virtually all contemporary research in the biosciences utilizes computer programs. The computational
advances have come on many fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software,
and algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal array of bioscience
fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics; genome-, proteome-, transcriptome-
and metabolome-wide experimental studies; structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of
cellular-scale molecular assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of
post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology. The ability to
design and write computer programs is among the most indispensable skills that a modern researcher
can cultivate. Python has become a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because
(i) its straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first language;
(ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming, as well as other modern paradigms;
and (iii) the many available libraries and third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the
core language into virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses, phylogenomics,
workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic introduction to coding, via Python,
and it includes concrete examples and exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities;
the main text culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of Supplemental
Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as that of a 'variable', the Chapters
methodically advance the reader to the point of writing a graphical user interface to compute the
Hamming distance between two DNA sequences.
