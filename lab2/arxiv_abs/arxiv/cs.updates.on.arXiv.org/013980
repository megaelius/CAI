Technology-assisted platforms provide reliable solutions in almost every field these days. One
such important application in the medical field is the skin cancer classification in preliminary
stages that need sensitive and precise data analysis. For the proposed study the Kaggle skin cancer
dataset is utilized. The proposed study consists of two main phases. In the first phase, the images
are preprocessed to remove the clutters thus producing a refined version of training images. To
achieve that, a sharpening filter is applied followed by a hair removal algorithm. Different image
quality measurement metrics including Peak Signal to Noise (PSNR), Mean Square Error (MSE), Maximum
Absolute Squared Deviation (MXERR) and Energy Ratio/ Ratio of Squared Norms (L2RAT) are used to
compare the overall image quality before and after applying preprocessing operations. The results
from the aforementioned image quality metrics prove that image quality is not compromised however
it is upgraded by applying the preprocessing operations. The second phase of the proposed research
work incorporates deep learning methodologies that play an imperative role in accurate, precise
and robust classification of the lesion mole. This has been reflected by using two state of the art
deep learning models: Inception-v3 and MobileNet. The experimental results demonstrate notable
improvement in train and validation accuracy by using the refined version of images of both the networks,
however, the Inception-v3 network was able to achieve better validation accuracy thus it was finally
selected to evaluate it on test data. The final test accuracy using state of art Inception-v3 network
was 86%.
