A simple prior free factorization algorithm \cite{dai2014simple} is quite often cited work in
the field of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM). The benefit of this work lies in its simplicity
of implementation, strong theoretical justification to the motion and structure estimation,
and its invincible originality. Despite this, the prevailing view is, that it performs exceedingly
inferior to other methods on several benchmark datasets \cite{jensen2018benchmark,akhter2009nonrigid}.
However, our subtle investigation provides some empirical statistics which made us think against
such views. The statistical results we obtained supersedes Dai {\it{et al.}}\cite{dai2014simple}
originally reported results on the benchmark datasets by a significant margin under some elementary
changes in their core algorithmic idea \cite{dai2014simple}. Now, these results not only exposes
some unrevealed areas for research in NRSfM but also give rise to new mathematical challenges for
NRSfM researchers. We argue that by \textbf{properly} utilizing the well-established assumptions
about a non-rigidly deforming shape i.e, it deforms smoothly over frames and it spans a low-rank
space, the simple prior-free idea can provide results which is comparable to the best available
algorithms. In this paper, we explore some of the hidden intricacies missed by Dai {\it{et. al.}}
work \cite{dai2014simple} and how some elementary measures and modifications can enhance its
performance, as high as 18\% on the benchmark dataset. The improved performance is justified and
empirically verified by extensive experiments on several datasets. We believe our work has both
practical and theoretical importance for the development of better NRSfM algorithms.
