Rate splitting (RS) is a potentially powerful and flexible technique for multi-antenna downlink
transmission. In this paper, we address several technical challenges towards its practical implementation
for beyond 5G systems. To this end, we focus on a single-cell system with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) and K single-antenna receivers. We consider RS in its most general form, and joint decoding
to fully exploit the potential of RS. First, we investigate the achievable rates under joint decoding
and formulate the precoder design problems to maximize a general utility function, or to minimize
the transmit power under pre-defined rate targets. Building upon the concave-convex procedure
(CCCP), we propose precoder design algorithms for an arbitrary number of users. Our proposed algorithms
approximate the intractable non-convex problems with a number of successively refined convex
problems, and provably converge to stationary points of the original problems. Then, to reduce
the decoding complexity, we consider the optimization of the precoder and the decoding order under
successive decoding. Further, we propose a stream selection algorithm to reduce the number of precoded
signals. With a reduced number of streams and successive decoding at the receivers, our proposed
algorithm can even be implemented when the number of users is relatively large, whereas the complexity
was previously considered as prohibitively high in the same setting. Finally, we propose a simple
adaptation of our algorithms to account for the imperfection of the channel state information at
the transmitter. Numerical results demonstrate that the general RS scheme provides a substantial
performance gain as compared to state-of-the-art linear precoding schemes, especially with a
moderately large number of users.
