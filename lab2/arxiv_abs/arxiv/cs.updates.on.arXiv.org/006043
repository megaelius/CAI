Recent research has shown that each apnea episode results in a significant rise in the beat-to-beat
blood pressure and by a drop to the pre-episode levels when patient resumes normal breathing. While
the physiological implications of these repetitive and significant oscillations are still unknown,
it is of interest to quantify them. Since current array of instruments deployed for polysomnography
studies does not include beat-to-beat measurement of blood pressure, but includes oximetry, it
is both of clinical interest to estimate the magnitude of BP oscillations from the photoplethysmography
(PPG) signal that is readily available from sleep lab oximeters. We have investigated a new method
for continuous estimation of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) blood pressure waveforms
from PPG. Peaks and troughs of PPG waveform are used as input to a 5th order autoregressive moving
average model to construct estimates of SBP, DBP, and MBP waveforms. Since breath hold maneuvers
are shown to simulate apnea episodes faithfully, we evaluated the performance of the proposed method
in 7 subjects (4 F; 32+-4 yrs., BMI 24.57+-3.87 kg/m2) in supine position doing 5 breath maneuvers
with 90s of normal breathing between them. The modeling error ranges were (all units are in mmHg)
-0.88+-4.87 to -2.19+-5.73 (SBP); 0.29+-2.39 to -0.97+-3.83 (DBP); and -0.42+-2.64 to -1.17+-3.82
(MBP). The cross validation error ranges were 0.28+-6.45 to -1.74+-6.55 (SBP); 0.09+-3.37 to -0.97+-3.67
(DBP); and 0.33+-4.34 to -0.87+-4.42 (MBP). The level of estimation error in, as measured by the
root mean squared of the model residuals, was less than 7 mmHg
