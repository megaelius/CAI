Seasonal influenza is a sometimes surprisingly impactful disease, causing thousands of deaths
per year along with much additional morbidity. Timely knowledge of the outbreak state is valuable
for managing an effective response. The current state of the art is to gather this knowledge using
in-person patient contact. While accurate, this is time-consuming and expensive. This has motivated
inquiry into new approaches using internet activity traces, based on the theory that lay observations
of health status lead to informative features in internet data. These approaches risk being deceived
by activity traces having a coincidental, rather than informative, relationship to disease incidence;
to our knowledge, this risk has not yet been quantitatively explored. We evaluated both simulated
and real activity traces of varying deceptiveness for influenza incidence estimation using linear
regression. We found that deceptiveness knowledge does reduce error in such estimates, that it
may help automatically-selected features perform as well or better than features that require
human curation, and that a semantic distance measure derived from the Wikipedia article category
tree serves as a useful proxy for deceptiveness. This suggests that disease incidence estimation
models should incorporate not only data about how internet features map to incidence but also additional
data to estimate feature deceptiveness. By doing so, we may gain one more step along the path to accurate,
reliable disease incidence estimation using internet data. This capability would improve public
health by decreasing the cost and increasing the timeliness of such estimates.
