The wide variety of motions performed by the human arm during daily tasks makes it desirable to find
representative subsets to reduce the dimensionality of these movements for a variety of applications,
including the design and control of robotic and prosthetic devices. This paper presents a novel
method and the results of an extensive human subjects study to obtain representative arm joint angle
trajectories that span naturalistic motions during Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). In particular,
we seek to identify sets of useful motion trajectories of the upper limb that are functions of a single
variable, allowing, for instance, an entire prosthetic or robotic arm to be controlled with a single
input from a user, along with a means to select between motions for different tasks. Data driven approaches
are used to obtain clusters as well as representative motion averages for the full-arm 7 degree of
freedom (DOF), elbow-wrist 4 DOF, and wrist-only 3 DOF motions. The proposed method makes use of
well-known techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to obtain a divergence measure between
motion segments, DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) to obtain averages, Ward's distance criterion
to build hierarchical trees, batch-DTW to simultaneously align multiple motion data, and functional
principal component analysis (fPCA) to evaluate cluster variability. The clusters that emerge
associate various recorded motions into primarily hand start and end location for the full-arm
system, motion direction for the wrist-only system, and an intermediate between the two qualities
for the elbow-wrist system. The proposed clustering methodology is justified by comparing results
against alternative approaches.
