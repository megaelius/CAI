In cryptography, attacks that utilize a Gr\"{o}bner basis have broken several cryptosystems.
The complexity of computing a Gr\"{o}bner basis dominates the overall computing and its estimation
is important for such cryptanalysis. The complexity is given by using the solving degree, but it
is hard to decide this value of a large scale system arisen from cryptography. Thus the degree of regularity
and the first fall degree are used as proxies for the solving degree based on a wealth of experiments.
If a given system is semi-regular, the complexity is estimated by using the degree of regularity
derived from a certain power series, otherwise, by using the first fall degree derived from a construction
of a syzygy. The degree of regularity is also defined on a non-semi-regular system and is experimentally
larger than the first fall degree, but those relation is not clear theoretically. Moreover, in contrast
to the degree of regularity, the first fall degree has been investigated specifically for each cryptosystem
and its discussion on generic systems is not given. In this paper, we show an upper bound for the first
fall degree of a polynomial system over a sufficiently large field. In detail, we prove that this
upper bound for a non-semi-regular system is the degree of regularity. Moreover, we prove that the
upper bound for a multi-graded polynomial system is a certain value only decided by its multi-degree.
Furthermore, we show that the condition for the order of a field in our results is satisfied in attacks
against actual multivariate cryptosystems. Consequently, under a reasonable condition for the
order of a field, we clear a relation between the first fall degree and the degree of regularity and
provide a theoretical method using a multivariate power series for cryptanalysis.
