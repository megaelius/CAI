Mobile manipulation problems involving many objects are challenging to solve due to the high dimensionality
and multi-modality of their hybrid configuration spaces. Planners that perform a purely geometric
search are prohibitively slow for solving these problems because they are unable to factor the configuration
space. Symbolic task planners can efficiently construct plans involving many variables but cannot
represent the geometric and kinematic constraints required in manipulation. We present the FFRob
algorithm for solving task and motion planning problems. First, we introduce Extended Action Specification
(EAS) as a general purpose planning representation that supports arbitrary predicates as conditions.
We adapt existing heuristic search ideas for solving \proc{strips} planning problems, particularly
delete-relaxations, to solve EAS problem instances. We then apply the EAS representation and planners
to manipulation problems resulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion planning
problems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a multi-query roadmap structure
that can be conditionalized to evaluate reachability under different placements of movable objects.
This structure enables the EAS planner to efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate geometric
and kinematic planning constraints to give a tight estimate of the distance to the goal. Additionally,
we show FFRob is probabilistically complete and has finite expected runtime. Finally, we empirically
demonstrate FFRob's effectiveness on complex and diverse task and motion planning tasks including
rearrangement planning and navigation among movable objects.
