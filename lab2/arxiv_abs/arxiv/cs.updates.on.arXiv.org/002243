We start by asking an interesting yet challenging question, "If an eyewitness can only recall the
eye features of the suspect, such that the forensic artist can only produce a sketch of the eyes (e.g.,
the top-left sketch shown in Fig. 1), can advanced computer vision techniques help generate the
whole face image?" A more generalized question is that if a large proportion (e.g., more than 50%)
of the face/sketch is missing, can a realistic whole face sketch/image still be estimated. Existing
face completion and generation methods either do not conduct domain transfer learning or can not
handle large missing area. For example, the inpainting approach tends to blur the generated region
when the missing area is large (i.e., more than 50%). In this paper, we exploit the potential of deep
learning networks in filling large missing region (e.g., as high as 95% missing) and generating
realistic faces with high-fidelity in cross domains. We propose the recursive generation by bidirectional
transformation networks (r-BTN) that recursively generates a whole face/sketch from a small sketch/face
patch. The large missing area and the cross domain challenge make it difficult to generate satisfactory
results using a unidirectional cross-domain learning structure. On the other hand, a forward and
backward bidirectional learning between the face and sketch domains would enable recursive estimation
of the missing region in an incremental manner (Fig. 1) and yield appealing results. r-BTN also adopts
an adversarial constraint to encourage the generation of realistic faces/sketches. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance from r-BTN as compared
to existing potential solutions.
