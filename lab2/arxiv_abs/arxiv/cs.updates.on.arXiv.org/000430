We give a deterministic polynomial space construction for nearly optimal eps-nets with respect
to any input n-dimensional convex body K and norm |.|. More precisely, our algorithm can build and
iterate over an eps-net of K with respect to |.| in time 2^O(n) x (size of the optimal net) using only
poly(n)-space. This improves on previous constructions of Alon et al [STOC 2013] which achieve
either a 2^O(n) approximation or an n^O(n) approximation of the optimal net size using 2^n space
and poly(n)-space respectively. As in their work, our algorithm relies on the mathematically classical
approach of building thin lattice coverings of space, which reduces the task of constructing eps-nets
to the problem of enumerating lattice points. Our main technical contribution is a deterministic
2^O(n)-time and poly(n)-space construction of thin lattice coverings of space with respect to
any convex body, where enumeration in these lattices can be efficiently performed using poly(n)-space.
This also yields the first existential construction of poly(n)-space enumerable thin covering
lattices for general convex bodies, which we believe is of independent interest. Our construction
combines the use of the M-ellipsoid from convex geometry with lattice sparsification and densification
techniques. As an application, we give a 2^O(n)(1+1/eps)^n time and poly(n)-space deterministic
algorithm for computing a (1+\eps)^n approximation to the volume of a general convex body, which
nearly matches the lower bounds for volume estimation in the oracle model (the dependence on eps
is larger by a factor 2 in the exponent). This improves on the previous results of Dadush and Vempala
[PNAS 2013], which gave the above result only for symmetric bodies and achieved a dependence on eps
of (1+\log^{5/2}(1/eps)/eps^2)^n.
