Consider the following variant of the set cover problem. We are given a universe $U=\{1,...,n\}$
and a collection of subsets $\mathcal{C} = \{S_1,...,S_m\}$ where $S_i \subseteq U$. For every
element $u \in U$ we need to find a set $\phi(u) \in \mathcal C$ such that $u\in \phi(u)$. Once we construct
and fix the mapping $\phi:U \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ a subset $X \subseteq U$ of the universe is
revealed, and we need to cover all elements from $X$ with exactly $\phi(X):=\cup_{u\in X} \phi(u)$.
The goal is to find a mapping such that the cover $\phi(X)$ is as cheap as possible. This is an example
of a universal problem where the solution has to be created before the actual instance to deal with
is revealed. Such problems appear naturally in some settings when we need to optimize under uncertainty
and it may be actually too expensive to begin finding a good solution once the input starts being revealed.
A rich body of work was devoted to investigate the approximability of such problems under the regime
of worst case analysis or when the input instance is drawn randomly from some probability distribution.
Here one typically compares the quality of the produced solution with the optimal offline solution.
In this paper we consider a different viewpoint: What if we would compare our approximate universal
solution against an optimal universal solution that obeys the same rules as we do? We show that under
this viewpoint it is possible to achieve improved approximation algorithms for the stochastic
version of universal set cover. Our result is based on rounding a proper configuration IP that captures
the optimal universal solution, and using tools from submodular optimization. The same basic approach
leads to improved approximation algorithms also for other related problems.
