Consider a multi-user Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) system where multiple
users share multiple discrete subcarriers, but at most one user is allowed to transmit power on each
subcarrier. To adapt fast traffic and channel fluctuations and improve the spectrum efficiency,
the system should have the ability to dynamically allocate subcarriers and power resources to users.
Assuming perfect channel knowledge, two formulations for the joint subcarrier and power allocation
problem are considered in this paper: the first is to minimize the total transmission power subject
to quality of service constraints and the OFDMA constraint, and the second is to maximize some system
utility function (including the sum-rate utility, the proportional fairness utility, the harmonic
mean utility, and the min-rate utility) subject to the total transmission power constraint per
user and the OFDMA constraint. In spite of the existence of various heuristics approaches, little
is known about the computational complexity status of the above problem. This paper aims to fill
this theoretical gap, i.e., characterizing the complexity of the joint subcarrier and power allocation
problem for the multi-user OFDMA system. It is shown in this paper that both formulations of the joint
subcarrier and power allocation problem are strongly NP-hard. The proof is based on a polynomial
time transformation from the so-called 3-dimensional matching problem. Several subclasses of
the problem which can be solved to global optimality or $\epsilon$-global optimality in polynomial
time are also identified. These complexity results suggest that there are not polynomial time algorithms
which are able to solve the general joint subcarrier and power allocation problem to global optimality
(unless P$=$NP), and determining an approximately optimal subcarrier and power allocation strategy
is more realistic in practice.
