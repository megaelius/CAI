We study secure and undetectable communication in a world where governments can read all encrypted
communications of citizens. We consider a world where the only permitted communication method
is via a government-mandated encryption scheme, using government-mandated keys. Citizens caught
trying to communicate otherwise (e.g., by encrypting strings which do not appear to be natural language
plaintexts) will be arrested. The one guarantee we suppose is that the government-mandated encryption
scheme is semantically secure against outsiders: a perhaps advantageous feature to secure communication
against foreign entities. But what good is semantic security against an adversary that has the power
to decrypt? Even in this pessimistic scenario, we show citizens can communicate securely and undetectably.
Informally, there is a protocol between Alice and Bob where they exchange ciphertexts that look
innocuous even to someone who knows the secret keys and thus sees the corresponding plaintexts.
And yet, in the end, Alice will have transmitted her secret message to Bob. Our security definition
requires indistinguishability between unmodified use of the mandated encryption scheme, and
conversations using the mandated encryption scheme in a modified way for subliminal communication.
Our topics may be thought to fall broadly within the realm of steganography: the science of hiding
secret communication in innocent-looking messages, or cover objects. However, we deal with the
non-standard setting of adversarial cover object distributions (i.e., a stronger-than-usual
adversary). We leverage that our cover objects are ciphertexts of a secure encryption scheme to
bypass impossibility results which we show for broader classes of steganographic schemes. We give
several constructions of subliminal communication schemes based on any key exchange protocol
with random messages (e.g., Diffie-Hellman).
