Due to the irregular motion, similar appearance and diverse shape, accurate segmentation of kidney
tumor in CT images is a difficult and challenging task. To this end, we present a novel automatic segmentation
method, termed as Crossbar-Net, with the goal of accurate segmenting the kidney tumors. Firstly,
considering that the traditional learning-based segmentation methods normally employ either
whole images or squared patches as the training samples, we innovatively sample the orthogonal
non-squared patches (namely crossbar patches), to fully cover the whole kidney tumors in either
horizontal or vertical directions. These sampled crossbar patches could not only represent the
detailed local information of kidney tumor as the traditional patches, but also describe the global
appearance from either horizontal or vertical direction using contextual information. Secondly,
with the obtained crossbar patches, we trained a convolutional neural network with two sub-models
(i.e., horizontal sub-model and vertical sub-model) in a cascaded manner, to integrate the segmentation
results from two directions (i.e., horizontal and vertical). This cascaded training strategy
could effectively guarantee the consistency between sub-models, by feeding each other with the
most difficult samples, for a better segmentation. In the experiment, we evaluate our method on
a real CT kidney tumor dataset, collected from 94 different patients including 3,500 images. Compared
with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods, the results demonstrate the superior results
of our method on dice ratio score, true positive fraction, centroid distance and Hausdorff distance.
Moreover, we have extended our crossbar-net to a different task: cardiac segmentation, showing
the promising results for the better generalization.
