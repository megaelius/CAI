A Virtual Private Network (VPN) helps to mitigate security and privacy risks of data transmitting
on unsecured network such as public Wi-Fi. However, despite awareness of public Wi-Fi risks becoming
increasingly common, the use of VPN when using public Wi-Fi is low. To increase adoption, understanding
factors driving user decision to adopt a VPN app is an important first step. This study is the first
to achieve this objective using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to elicit individual preferences
of specific attributes of a VPN app. The experiments were run in the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan
(JP). We first interviewed participants (15 UK, 17 JP) to identify common attributes of a VPN app
which they considered important. The results were used to design and run a DCE in each country. Participants
(149 UK, 94 JP) were shown a series of two hypothetical VPN apps, varying in features, and were asked
to choose one which they preferred. Customer review rating, followed by price of a VPN app, significantly
affected the decision to choose which VPN app to download and install. A change from a rating of 3 to
4-5 stars increased the probability of choosing an app by 33% in the UK and 14% in Japan. Unsurprisingly,
price was a deterrent. Recommendations by friends, source of product reviews, and the presence
of in-app ads also played a role but to a lesser extent. To actually use a VPN app, participants considered
Internet speed, connection stability, battery level on mobile devices, and the presence of in-app
ads as key drivers. Participants in the UK and in Japan prioritized these attributes differently,
suggesting possible influences from cultural differences.
