We investigate a nonlinear version of coevolving voter models, in which node states and network
structure update as a coupled stochastic dynamical process. Most prior work on coevolving voter
models has focused on linear update rules with fixed and homogeneous rewiring and adopting probabilities.
By contrast, in our nonlinear version, the probability that a node rewires or adopts is a function
of how well it "fits in" within its neighborhood. To explore this idea, we incorporate a parameter
$\sigma$ that represents the fraction of neighbors of an updating node that share its opinion state.
In an update, with probability $\sigma^q$ (for some nonlinearity parameter $q$), the updating
node rewires; with complementary probability $1-\sigma^q$, the updating node adopts a new opinion
state. We study this mechanism using three rewiring schemes: after an updating node deletes a discordant
edge, it then either (1) "rewires-to-random" by choosing a new neighbor in a random process; (2)
"rewires-to-same" by choosing a new neighbor in a random process from nodes that share its state;
or (3) "rewires-to-none" by not rewiring at all (akin to "unfriending" on social media). We compare
our nonlinear coevolving model to several existing linear models, and we find in our model that initial
network topology plays a larger role in the dynamics and the choice of rewiring mechanism plays a
smaller role. A particularly interesting feature of our model is that, under certain conditions,
the opinion state that is held initially by a minority of the nodes can effectively spread to almost
every node in a network if the minority nodes view themselves as the majority. In light of this observation,
we relate our results to recent work on the majority illusion in social networks.
