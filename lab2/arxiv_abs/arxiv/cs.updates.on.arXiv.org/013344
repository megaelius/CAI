Wind power as a renewable source of energy, has numerous economic, environmental and social benefits.
In order to enhance and control renewable wind power, it is vital to utilize models that predict wind
speed with high accuracy. Due to neglecting of requirement and significance of data preprocessing
and disregarding the inadequacy of using a single predicting model, many traditional models have
poor performance in wind speed prediction. In the current study, for predicting wind speed at target
stations in the north of Iran, the combination of a multi-layer perceptron model (MLP) with the Whale
Optimization Algorithm (WOA) used to build new method (MLP-WOA) with a limited set of data (2004-2014).
Then, the MLP-WOA model was utilized at each of the ten target stations, with the nine stations for
training and tenth station for testing (namely: Astara, Bandar-E-Anzali, Rasht, Manjil, Jirandeh,
Talesh, Kiyashahr, Lahijan, Masuleh, and Deylaman) to increase the accuracy of the subsequent
hybrid model. The capability of the hybrid model in wind speed forecasting at each target station
was compared with the MLP model without the WOA optimizer. To determine definite results, numerous
statistical performances were utilized. For all ten target stations, the MLP-WOA model had precise
outcomes than the standalone MLP model. The hybrid model had acceptable performances with lower
amounts of the RMSE, SI and RE parameters and higher values of NSE, WI, and KGE parameters. It was concluded
that the WOA optimization algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of MLP model and may be recommended
for accurate wind speed prediction.
