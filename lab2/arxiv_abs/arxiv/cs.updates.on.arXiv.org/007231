Nowadays, the automatic detection of emotions is employed by many applications in different fields
like security informatics, e-learning, humor detection, targeted advertising, etc. Many of these
applications focus on social media and treat this problem as a classification problem, which requires
preparing training data. The typical method for annotating the training data by human experts is
considered time consuming, labor intensive and sometimes prone to error. Moreover, such an approach
is not easily extensible to new domains/languages since such extensions require annotating new
training data. In this study, we propose a distant supervised learning approach where the training
sentences are automatically annotated based on the emojis they have. Such training data would be
very cheap to produce compared with the manually created training data, thus, much larger training
data can be easily obtained. On the other hand, this training data would naturally have lower quality
as it may contain some errors in the annotation. Nonetheless, we experimentally show that training
classifiers on cheap, large and possibly erroneous data annotated using this approach leads to
more accurate results compared with training the same classifiers on the more expensive, much smaller
and error-free manually annotated training data. Our experiments are conducted on an in-house
dataset of emotional Arabic tweets and the classifiers we consider are: Support Vector Machine
(SVM), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Random Forest (RF). In addition to experimenting with
single classifiers, we also consider using an ensemble of classifiers. The results show that using
an automatically annotated training data that is only one order of magnitude larger the manually
annotated one gives better results in almost all settings considered.
