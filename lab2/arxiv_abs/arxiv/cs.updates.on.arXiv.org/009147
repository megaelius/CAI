In this study, we investigate the extent to that patent citations to papers can serve as early signs
for predicting delayed recognition using a comparative study with a control group, i.e., instant
recognition papers. We identify the two opposite groups of papers by the Bcp measure, a parameter-free
index for identifying papers which were recognized with delay (also called "sleeping beauties"
in science). Combined with a typical case study, it appears that papers with delayed recognition
show a stronger and longer technical impact than instant recognition papers. We provide indication
that in the more recent years papers with delayed recognition are awakened more often and more earlier
by a patent rather than by a scientific paper (also called "prince"). We also found that patent citations
seem to play an important role to avoid instant recognition papers to level off or to become a so called
"flash in the pan". It also appears that the sleeping beauties may firstly encounter negative citations
and then patent citations and finally get widely recognized. In contrast to the two focus fields
(biology and chemistry) for instant recognition papers, delayed recognition papers are rather
evenly distributed in biology, chemistry, psychology, geology, materials science, and physics.
We discovered several pairs of "science sleeping"-"technology inducing", such as biology-biotechnology/pharmaceuticals,
chemistry-chemical engineering, psychology-computer/control technology, and physics-computer
technology. We propose in further research to discover the potential ahead of time and transformative
research by using citation delay analysis, patent & NPL analysis, and citation context analysis.
