In this work, we explore the various Brain Neuron tracking techniques, which is one of the most significant
applications of Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Tractography provides us with a non-invasive method
to analyze underlying tissue micro-structure. Understanding the structure and organization
of the tissues facilitates us with a diagnosis method to identify any aberrations and provide acute
information on the occurrences of brain ischemia or stroke, the mutation of neurological diseases
such as Alzheimer, multiple sclerosis and so on. Time if of essence and accurate localization of
the aberrations can help save or change a diseased life. Following up with the limitations introduced
by the current Tractography techniques such as computational complexity, reconstruction errors
during tensor estimation and standardization, we aim to elucidate these limitations through our
research findings. We introduce an end to end Deep Learning framework which can accurately estimate
the most probable likelihood orientation at each voxel along a neuronal pathway. We use Probabilistic
Tractography as our baseline model to obtain the training data and which also serve as a Tractography
Gold Standard for our evaluations. Through experiments we show that our Deep Network can do a significant
improvement over current Tractography implementations by reducing the run-time complexity to
a significant new level. Our architecture also allows for variable sized input DWI signals eliminating
the need to worry about memory issues as seen with the traditional techniques. The advantage of this
architecture is that it is perfectly desirable to be processed on a cloud setup and utilize the existing
multi GPU frameworks to perform whole brain Tractography in minutes rather than hours. We evaluate
our network with Gold Standard and benchmark its performance across several parameters.
