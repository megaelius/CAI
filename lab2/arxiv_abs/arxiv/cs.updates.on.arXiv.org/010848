The High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is the de-facto standard for Audio/Video interfacing
between video-enabled devices. Today, almost tens of billions of HDMI devices exist worldwide
and are widely used to distribute A/V signals in smart homes, offices, concert halls, and sporting
events making HDMI one of the most highly deployed systems in the world. An important component in
HDMI is the Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) protocol, which allows for the interaction between
devices within an HDMI distribution network. Nonetheless, existing network security mechanisms
only protect traditional networking components, leaving CEC outside of their scope. In this work,
we identify and tap into CEC protocol vulnerabilities, using them to implement realistic proof-of-work
attacks on HDMI distribution networks. We study, how current insecure CEC protocol practices and
HDMI distributions may grant an adversary a novel attack surface for HDMI devices otherwise thought
to be unreachable. To introduce this novel attack surface, we present HDMI-Walk, which opens a realm
of remote and local CEC attacks to HDMI devices. Specifically, with HDMI-Walk, an attacker can perform
malicious analysis of devices, eavesdropping, Denial of Service attacks, targeted device attacks,
and even facilitate well-known existing attacks through HDMI. With HDMI-Walk, we prove it is feasible
for an attacker to gain arbitrary control of HDMI devices. We demonstrate the implementations of
both local and remote attacks with commodity HDMI devices. Finally, we discuss security mechanisms
to provide impactful and comprehensive security evaluation to these real-world systems while
guaranteeing deployability and providing minimal overhead considering the current limitations
of the CEC protocol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work solely investigating the
security of HDMI device distribution networks.
