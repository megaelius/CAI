Network slicing appears as a key enabler for the future 5G networks. Mobile Network Operators create
various slices for Service Providers (SP) to accommodate customized services. As network slices
are operated on a common network infrastructure owned by some Infrastructure Provider (InP), sharing
the resources across a set of network slices is important for future deployment. Moreover, in many
situations, slices have to be deployed over some geographical area: coverage as well as minimum
per-user rate constraints have then to be taken into account. Usually, the various Service Function
Chains (SFCs) belonging to a slice are deployed on a best-effort basis. Nothing ensures that the
InP will be able to allocate enough resources to cope with the increasing demands of some SP. This
paper takes the InP perspective and proposes a slice resource provisioning approach to cope with
multiple slice demands in terms of computing, storage, coverage, and rate constraints. The resource
requirements of the various Service Function Chains to be deployed within a slice are aggregated
within a graph of Slice Resource Demands (SRD). Coverage and rate constraints are also taken into
account in the SRD. Infrastructure nodes and links have then to be provisioned so as to satisfy all
types of resource demands. This problem leads to a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation.
A two-step deployment approach is considered, with several variants, depending on whether the
constraints of each slide to be deployed are taken into account sequentially or jointly. Once provisioning
has been performed, any slice deployment strategy may be considered on the reduced-size infrastructure
graph representing the nodes and links on which resources have been provisioned. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to a more classical direct slice
embedding approach.
