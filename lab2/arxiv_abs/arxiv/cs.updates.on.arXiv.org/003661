Motivated by applications in machine learning, such as subset selection and data summarization,
we consider the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function given mixed packing and covering
constraints. This problem captures numerous classical combinatorial optimization problems,
including maximum coverage and submodular knapsack. We present a tight approximation that for
any constant $\varepsilon >0$ achieves a guarantee of $1-1/\mathrm{e} - \varepsilon$ while violating
the covering constraints only by an $\varepsilon$ fraction. This generalizes the result of Kulik
et al. (SODA'09) for pure packing constraints. Our algorithm is based on a continuous approach that
is applied to a non down-monotone polytope along with a novel preprocessing enumeration technique
that allows for high concentration bounds in the presence of not only packing but also covering constraints.
Additionally, despite the presence of both packing and covering constraints we can still guarantee
only a one-sided violation of the covering constraints. We extend the above main result in several
directions. First, we consider the case where in addition to the mixed packing and covering constraints
a matroid independence constraint is also present. Second, we consider the case where multiple
submodular objectives are present and the goal is to find pareto set optimal solutions. Third, we
focus on the dependence of the running time of our main algorithm on $1/\varepsilon$. Whereas previous
work on the special case of only packing constraints, as well as our main algorithm, has a running
time of $n^{\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$, we show a novel purely combinatorial approach that
can be applied to several special cases of the problem and reduce the running time to depend polynomially
on $1/\varepsilon$. We believe this new combinatorial approach might be of independent interest.
