Localizing objects with weak supervision in an image is a key problem of the research in computer
vision community. Many existing Weakly-Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) approaches tackle
this problem by estimating the most discriminative regions with feature maps (activation maps)
obtained by Deep Convolutional Neural Network, that is, only the objects or parts of them with the
most discriminative response will be located. However, the activation maps often display different
local maximum responses or relatively weak response when one image contains multiple objects with
the same type or small objects. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-scale discriminative
region discovery method to localize not only more integral objects but also as many as possible with
only image-level class labels. The gradient weights flowing into different convolutional layers
of CNN are taken as the input of our method, which is different from previous methods only considering
that of the final convolutional layer. To mine more discriminative regions for the task of object
localization, the multiple local maximum from the gradient weight maps are leveraged to generate
the localization map with a parallel sliding window. Furthermore, multi-scale localization maps
from different convolutional layers are fused to produce the final result. We evaluate the proposed
method with the foundation of VGGnet on the ILSVRC 2016, CUB-200-2011 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.
On ILSVRC 2016, the proposed method yields the Top-1 localization error of 48.65\%, which outperforms
previous results by 2.75\%. On PASCAL VOC 2012, our approach achieve the highest localization accuracy
of 0.43. Even for CUB-200-2011 dataset, our method still achieves competitive results.
