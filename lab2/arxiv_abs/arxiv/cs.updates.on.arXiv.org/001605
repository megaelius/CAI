This paper presents two single channel speech dereverberation methods to enhance the quality of
speech signals that have been recorded in an enclosed space. For both methods, the room acoustics
are modeled using a nonnegative approximation of the convolutive transfer function (NCTF), and
to additionally exploit the spectral properties of the speech signal, such as the low rank nature
of the speech spectrogram, the speech spectrogram is modeled using nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF). Two methods are described to combine the NCTF and NMF models. In the first method, referred
to as the integrated method, a cost function is constructed by directly integrating the speech NMF
model into the NCTF model, while in the second method, referred to as the weighted method, the NCTF
and NMF based cost functions are weighted and summed. Efficient update rules are derived to solve
both optimization problems. In addition, an extension of the integrated method is presented, which
exploits the temporal dependencies of the speech signal. Several experiments are performed on
reverberant speech signals with and without background noise, where the integrated method yields
a considerably higher speech quality than the baseline NCTF method and a state of the art spectral
enhancement method. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that the weighted method can
even lead to a better performance in terms of instrumental quality measures, but that the optimal
weighting parameter depends on the room acoustics and the utilized NMF model. Modeling the temporal
dependencies in the integrated method was found to be useful only for highly reverberant conditions.
