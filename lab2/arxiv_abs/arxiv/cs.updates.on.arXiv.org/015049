Background: During the early stages of hospital admission, clinicians must use limited information
to make diagnostic and treatment decisions as patient acuity evolves. However, it is common that
the time series vital sign information from patients to be both sparse and irregularly collected,
which poses a significant challenge for machine / deep learning techniques to analyze and facilitate
the clinicians to improve the human health outcome. To deal with this problem, We propose a novel
deep interpolation network to extract latent representations from sparse and irregularly sampled
time-series vital signs measured within six hours of hospital admission. Methods: We created a
single-center longitudinal dataset of electronic health record data for all (n=75,762) adult
patient admissions to a tertiary care center lasting six hours or longer, using 55% of the dataset
for training, 23% for validation, and 22% for testing. All raw time series within six hours of hospital
admission were extracted for six vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,
heart rate, temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate). A deep interpolation
network is proposed to learn from such irregular and sparse multivariate time series data to extract
the fixed low-dimensional latent patterns. We use k-means clustering algorithm to clusters the
patient admissions resulting into 7 clusters. Findings: Training, validation, and testing cohorts
had similar age (55-57 years), sex (55% female), and admission vital signs. Seven distinct clusters
were identified. M Interpretation: In a heterogeneous cohort of hospitalized patients, a deep
interpolation network extracted representations from vital sign data measured within six hours
of hospital admission. This approach may have important implications for clinical decision-support
under time constraints and uncertainty.
