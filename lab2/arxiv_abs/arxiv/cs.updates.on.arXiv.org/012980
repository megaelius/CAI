In the dynamic Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP) problem, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ subject
to edge insertions and deletions and a source vertex $s\in V$, and the goal is to maintain the distance
$d(s,t)$ for all $t\in V$. Fine-grained complexity has provided strong lower bounds for exact partially
dynamic SSSP and approximate fully dynamic SSSP [ESA'04, FOCS'14, STOC'15]. Thus much focus has
been directed towards finding efficient partially dynamic $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate SSSP
algorithms [STOC'14, ICALP'15, SODA'14, FOCS'14, STOC'16, SODA'17, ICALP'17, ICALP'19, STOC'19,
SODA'20, SODA'20]. Despite this rich literature, for directed graphs there are no known deterministic
algorithms for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate dynamic SSSP that perform better than the classic
ES-tree [JACM'81]. We present the first such algorithm. We present a \emph{deterministic} data
structure for incremental SSSP in weighted digraphs with total update time $\tilde{O}(n^2 \log
W)$ which is near-optimal for very dense graphs; here $W$ is the ratio of the largest weight in the
graph to the smallest. Our algorithm also improves over the best known partially dynamic \emph{randomized}
algorithm for directed SSSP by Henzinger et al. [STOC'14, ICALP'15] if $m=\omega(n^{1.1})$. We
also provide improved conditional lower bounds. Henzinger et al. [STOC'15] showed that under the
OMv Hypothesis, the partially dynamic exact $s$-$t$ Shortest Path problem in undirected graphs
requires amortized update or query time $m^{1/2-o(1)}$, given polynomial preprocessing time.
Under a hypothesis about finding Cliques, we improve the update and query lower bound for algorithms
with polynomial preprocessing time to $m^{0.626-o(1)}$. Further, under the $k$-Cycle hypothesis,
we show that any partially dynamic SSSP algorithm with $O(m^{2-\epsilon})$ preprocessing time
requires amortized update or query time $m^{1-o(1)}$.
