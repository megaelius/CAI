Corpus preparation for low-resource languages and for development of human language technology
to analyze or computationally process them is a laborious task, primarily due to the unavailability
of expert linguists who are native speakers of these languages and also due to the time and resources
required. Bhojpuri, Magahi, and Maithili, languages of the Purvanchal region of India (in the north-eastern
parts), are low-resource languages belonging to the Indo-Aryan (or Indic) family. They are closely
related to Hindi, which is a relatively high-resource language, which is why we make our comparisons
with Hindi. We collected corpora for these three languages from various sources and cleaned them
to the extent possible, without changing the data in them. The text belongs to different domains
and genres. We calculated some basic statistical measures for these corpora at character, word,
syllable, and morpheme levels. These corpora were also annotated with parts-of-speech (POS) and
chunk tags. The basic statistical measures were both absolute and relative and were meant to give
an indication of linguistic properties such as morphological, lexical, phonological, and syntactic
complexities (or richness). The results were compared with a standard Hindi corpus. For most of
the measures, we tried to keep the size of the corpus the same across the languages so as to avoid the
effect of corpus size, but in some cases it turned out that using the full corpus was better, even if
sizes were very different. Although the results are not very clear, we try to draw some conclusions
about the languages and the corpora. For POS tagging and chunking, the BIS tagset was used to manually
annotate the data. The sizes of the POS tagged data are 16067, 14669 and 12310 sentences, respectively
for Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili. The sizes for chunking are 9695 and 1954 sentences for Bhojpuri
and Maithili, respect
