Background: Finding biomedical named entities is one of the most essential tasks in biomedical
text mining. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been applied to biomedical named entity
recognition (BioNER) and showed promising results. However, as deep learning approaches need
an abundant amount of training data, a lack of data can hinder performance. BioNER datasets are scarce
resources and each dataset covers only a small subset of entity types. Furthermore, many bio entities
are polysemous, which is one of the major obstacles in named entity recognition. Results: To address
the lack of data and the entity type misclassification problem, we propose CollaboNet which utilizes
a combination of multiple NER models. In CollaboNet, models trained on a different dataset are connected
to each other so that a target model obtains information from other collaborator models to reduce
false positives. Every model is an expert on their target entity type and takes turns serving as a
target and a collaborator model during training time. The experimental results show that CollaboNet
can be used to greatly reduce the number of false positives and misclassified entities including
polysemous words. CollaboNet achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision, recall
and F1 score. Conclusions: We demonstrated the benefits of combining multiple models for BioNER.
Our model has successfully reduced the number of misclassified entities and improved the performance
by leveraging multiple datasets annotated for different entity types. Given the state-of-the-art
performance of our model, we believe that CollaboNet can improve the accuracy of downstream biomedical
text mining applications such as bio-entity relation extraction.
