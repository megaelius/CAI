The problem of secret-key based authentication under privacy and storage constraints on the source
sequence is considered. The identifier measurement channels during authentication are assumed
to be controllable via a cost-constrained action sequence. Single-letter inner and outer bounds
for the key-leakage-storage-cost regions are derived for a generalization of a classic two-terminal
key agreement model with an eavesdropper that observes a sequence that is correlated with the sequences
observed by the legitimate terminals. The additions to the model are that the encoder observes a
noisy version of a remote source, and the noisy output and the remote source output together with
an action sequence are given as inputs to the measurement channel at the decoder. Thus, correlation
is introduced between the noise components on the encoder and decoder measurements. The model with
a secret key generated by an encoder is extended to the randomized models, where a secret-key is embedded
to the encoder. The results are relevant for several user and device authentication scenarios including
physical and biometric identifiers with multiple measurements that provide diversity and multiplexing
gains. To illustrate the behavior of the rate region, achievable (secret-key rate, storage-rate,
cost) tuples are given for binary identifiers and measurement channels that can be represented
as a mixture of binary symmetric subchannels. The gains from using an action sequence such as a large
secret-key rate at a significantly small hardware cost, are illustrated to motivate the use of low-complexity
transform-coding algorithms with cost-constrained actions.
