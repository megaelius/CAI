Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of using an attention-based neural network for predicting
the risk of readmission within 30 days of discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) based on longitudinal
electronic medical record (EMR) data and to leverage the interpretability of the model to describe
patients-at-risk. Methods: A "time-aware attention" model was trained using publicly available
EMR data (MIMIC-III) associated with 45,298 ICU stays for 33,150 patients. The analysed EMR data
included static (patient demographics) and timestamped variables (diagnoses, procedures, medications,
and vital signs). Bayesian inference was used to compute the posterior distribution of network
weights. The prediction accuracy of the proposed model was compared with several baseline models
and evaluated based on average precision, AUROC, and F1-Score. Odds ratios (ORs) associated with
an increased risk of readmission were computed for static variables. Diagnoses, procedures, and
medications were ranked according to the associated risk of readmission. The model was also used
to generate reports with predicted risk (and associated uncertainty) justified by specific diagnoses,
procedures, medications, and vital signs. Results: A Bayesian ensemble of 10 time-aware attention
models led to the highest predictive accuracy (average precision: 0.282, AUROC: 0.738, F1-Score:
0.353). Male gender, number of recent admissions, age, admission location, insurance type, and
ethnicity were all associated with risk of readmission. A longer length of stay in the ICU was found
to reduce the risk of readmission (OR: 0.909, 95% credible interval: 0.902, 0.916). Groups of patients
at risk included those requiring cardiovascular or ventilatory support, those with poor nutritional
state, and those for whom standard medical care was not suitable, e.g. due to contraindications
to surgery or medications.
