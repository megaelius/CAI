Software Defined Networking (SDN) offers a flexible and scalable architecture that abstracts
decision making away from individual devices and provides a programmable network platform. However,
implementing a centralized SDN architecture within the constraints of a low-power wireless network
faces considerable challenges. Not only is controller traffic subject to jitter due to unreliable
links and network contention, but the overhead generated by SDN can severely affect the performance
of other traffic. This paper addresses the challenge of bringing high-overhead SDN architecture
to IEEE 802.15.4 networks. We explore how traditional SDN needs to evolve in order to overcome the
constraints of low-power wireless networks, and discuss protocol and architectural optimizations
necessary to reduce SDN control overhead - the main barrier to successful implementation. We argue
that interoperability with the existing protocol stack is necessary to provide a platform for controller
discovery and coexistence with legacy networks. We consequently introduce {\mu}SDN, a lightweight
SDN framework for Contiki, with both IPv6 and underlying routing protocol interoperability, as
well as optimizing a number of elements within the SDN architecture to reduce control overhead to
practical levels. We evaluate {\mu}SDN in terms of latency, energy, and packet delivery. Through
this evaluation we show how the cost of SDN control overhead (both bootstrapping and management)
can be reduced to a point where comparable performance and scalability is achieved against an IEEE
802.15.4-2012 RPL-based network. Additionally, we demonstrate {\mu}SDN through simulation:
providing a use-case where the SDN configurability can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS)
for critical network flows experiencing interference, and we achieve considerable reductions
in delay and jitter in comparison to a scenario without SDN.
