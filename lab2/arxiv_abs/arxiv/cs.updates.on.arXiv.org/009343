Security researchers have recently discovered significant security and safety issues related
to home automation and developed approaches to address them. Such approaches often face design
and evaluation challenges which arise from their restricted perspective of home automation that
is bounded by the IoT apps they analyze. The challenges of past work can be overcome by relying on a
deeper understanding of realistic home automation usage. More specifically, the availability
of natural home automation scenarios, i.e., sequences of home automation events that may realistically
occur in an end-user's home, could help security researchers design better security/safety systems.
This paper presents Helion, a framework for building a natural perspective of home automation.
Helion identifies the regularities in user-driven home automation, i.e., from user-driven routines
that are increasingly being created by users through intuitive platform UIs. Our intuition for
designing Helion is that smart home event sequences created by users exhibit an inherent set of semantic
patterns, or naturalness that can be modeled and used to generate valid and useful scenarios. To
evaluate our approach, we first empirically demonstrate that this naturalness hypothesis holds,
with a corpus of 30,518 home automation events, constructed from 273 routines collected from 40
users. We then demonstrate that the scenarios generated by Helion are reasonable and valid from
an end-user perspective, through an evaluation with 16 external evaluators. We further show the
usefulness of Helion's scenarios by generating 17 home security/safety policies with significantly
less effort than existing approaches. We conclude by discussing key takeaways and future research
challenges enabled by Helion's natural perspective of home automation.
