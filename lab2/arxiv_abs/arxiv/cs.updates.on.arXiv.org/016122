The inverse design of metamaterials is difficult due to a high-dimensional topological design
space and presence of multiple local optima. Computational cost is even more demanding for design
of multiscale metamaterial systems with aperiodic microstructures and spatially-varying or
functionally gradient properties. Despite the growing interest in applying data-driven methods
to address this hurdle, current methods either only focus on microstructure generation or adopt
an unscalable framework for the multiscale design. In this study, we propose a novel data-driven
metamaterial design framework based on deep generative modeling. A deep neural network model consisting
of a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for property prediction is trained on a large
metamaterial database to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous and
organized latent space. Our study shows several advantages of the VAE based generative model. First,
the latent space of VAE provides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enabling interpolation
between microstructures and encoding meaningful patterns of variation in geometries and properties.
For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical properties and complex manipulations of microstructures
are easily achieved by simple vector operations in the latent space. Second, the vector operation
can be further extended to form metamaterial families with controlled gradation of mechanical
properties. Third, for multiscale metamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures
can be rapidly generated based on target properties at different locations and then assembled by
an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure compatibility between adjacent microstructures.
We demonstrate our framework by designing both functionally graded and heterogeneous metamaterial
systems that achieve desired distortion behaviors.
