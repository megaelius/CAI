Currently virtual reality (VR) usage in training processes is increasing due to their usefulness
in the learning processes based on visual information empowered. The information in virtual environments
is perceived by sight, sound and touch, but the relationship or impact that these stimuli can have
on the oscillatory activity of the brain such as the processing, propagation and synchronization
of information still needs to be established in relation to the cognitive load of attention. Therefore,
this study seeks to identify the suggested epistemological basis through literature review and
current research agendas in the relationship that exists between the immersive virtual environment
and the neurophysiology of learning processes by means of the analysis of visual information. The
suggested dimensional modeling of this research is composed by the theory of information processing
which allows the incorporation of learning through stimuli with the use of attention, perception
and storage by means of information management and the Kolb's learning model which defines the perception
and processing of information as dimensions of learning. Regarding to the neurophysiology of learning,
the literature has established he links between the prefrontal cortex and working memory within
the process of information management. The challenges and advances discussed in this research
are based in the relationship between the identified constructs (Income Stimuli, Information
Management and Cognitive Processing) and the establishment of a research agenda on how to identify
the necessary indicators to measure memory and attention in the virtual immersion environments.
