In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, edge computing can be initiated at anytime and anywhere.
However, in an IoT, edge computing sessions are often ephemeral, i.e., they last for a short period
of time and can often be discontinued once the current application usage is completed or the edge
devices leave the system due to factors such as mobility. Therefore, in this paper, the problem of
ephemeral edge computing in an IoT is studied by considering scenarios in which edge computing operates
within a limited time period. To this end, a novel online framework is proposed in which a source edge
node offloads its computing tasks from sensors within an area to neighboring edge nodes for distributed
task computing, within the limited period of time of an ephemeral edge computing system. The online
nature of the framework allows the edge nodes to optimize their task allocation and decide on which
neighbors to use for task processing, even when the tasks are revealed to the source edge node in an
online manner, and the information on future task arrivals is unknown. The proposed framework essentially
maximizes the number of computed tasks by jointly considering the communication and computation
latency. To solve the problem, an online greedy algorithm is proposed and solved by using the primal-dual
approach. Since the primal problem provides an upper bound of the original dual problem, the competitive
ratio of the online approach is analytically derived as a function of the task sizes and the data rates
of the edge nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed online algorithm can achieve a near-optimal
task allocation with an optimality gap that is no higher than 7.1% compared to the offline, optimal
solution with complete knowledge of all tasks.
