This paper introduces an extended notion of expansion suitable for radio networks. A graph $G=(V,E)$
is called an $(\alpha_w, \beta_w)$-{wireless expander} if for every subset $S \subseteq V$ s.t.
$|S|\leq \alpha_w \cdot |V|$, there exists a subset $S'\subseteq S$ s.t. there are at least $\beta_w
\cdot |S|$ vertices in $V\backslash S$ adjacent in $G$ to exactly one vertex in $S'$. The main question
we ask is the following: to what extent are ordinary expanders also good {wireless} expanders? We
answer this question in a nearly tight manner. On the positive side, we show that any $(\alpha, \beta)$-expander
with maximum degree $\Delta$ and $\beta\geq 1/\Delta$ is also a $(\alpha_w, \beta_w)$ wireless
expander for $\beta_w = \Omega(\beta / \log (2 \cdot \min\{\Delta / \beta, \Delta \cdot \beta\}))$.
Thus the wireless expansion is smaller than the ordinary expansion by at most a factor logarithmic
in $\min\{\Delta / \beta, \Delta \cdot \beta\}$, which depends on the graph \emph{average degree}
rather than maximum degree; e.g., for low arboricity graphs, the wireless expansion matches the
ordinary expansion up to a constant. We complement this positive result by presenting an explicit
construction of a "bad" $(\alpha, \beta)$-expander for which the wireless expansion is $\beta_w
= O(\beta / \log (2 \cdot \min\{\Delta / \beta, \Delta \cdot \beta\})$. We also analyze the theoretical
properties of wireless expanders and their connection to unique neighbor expanders, and demonstrate
their applicability: Our results yield improved bounds for the {spokesmen election problem} that
was introduced in the seminal paper of Chlamtac and Weinstein (1991) to devise efficient broadcasting
for multihop radio networks. Our negative result yields a significantly simpler proof than that
from the seminal paper of Kushilevitz and Mansour (1998) for a lower bound on the broadcast time in
radio networks.
