The increasing demands for highly individual products as well as for flexible production lines
represent new challenges. To address these demands, future plants must be highly flexible and dynamically
reconfigurable. Current systems are usually based on wired technologies for the connection of
sensors, actuators, and controlling or monitoring devices that allow only very limited dynamics.
New applications, such as the use of robots, drones, or reconfigurable production lines, require
the exploitation of wireless communication technologies. However, current technologies are
not able to meet the high requirements in terms of latency, robustness, resilience and data rate.
The introduction of the 5th generation (5G) cellular communication system will meet these requirements
for the first time. Besides the use of radio-based solutions in new plants - so-called greenfield
scenarios - deploying 5G also represents an efficient migration of existing plants - so-called
brownfield scenarios - to Industry 4.0. In order to ensure that the challenging requirements are
indeed meet in practical deployments of the new 5G technology, a tailor-made architecture is being
developed within the Tactile Internet 4.0 (TACNET 4.0) project. As a basis for the design of the architecture,
representative Industry 4.0 application scenarios, which are also be considered by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP), were analyzed and compliance with the latest developments in the relevant
standardization is also our target. The paper gives an overview of the considered use cases as well
as the relevant reference architectures and the design process of the TACNET 4.0 architecture.
