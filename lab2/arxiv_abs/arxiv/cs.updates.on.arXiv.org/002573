Bir\'{o} et al. (1992) introduced $H$-graphs, intersection graphs of connected subgraphs of a
subdivision of a graph $H$. They are related to many classes of geometric intersection graphs, e.g.,
interval graphs, circular-arc graphs, split graphs, and chordal graphs. We negatively answer
the 25-year-old question of Bir\'{o} et al. which asks if $H$-graphs can be recognized in polynomial
time, for a fixed graph $H$. We prove that it is NP-complete if $H$ contains the diamond graph as a minor.
We provide a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing $T$-graphs, for each fixed tree $T$. When $T$
is a star $S_d$ of degree $d$, we have an $O(n^{3.5})$-time algorithm. We give FPT- and XP-time algorithms
solving the minimum dominating set problem on $S_d$-graphs and $H$-graphs parametrized by $d$
and the size of $H$, respectively. The algorithm for $H$-graphs adapts to an XP-time algorithm for
the independent set and the independent dominating set problems on $H$-graphs. If $H$ contains
the double-triangle as a minor, we prove that $H$-graphs are GI-complete and that the clique problem
is APX-hard. The clique problem can be solved in polynomial time if $H$ is a cactus graph. When a graph
$G$ has a Helly $H$-representation, the clique problem can be solved in polynomial time. We show
that both the $k$-clique and the list $k$-coloring problems are solvable in FPT-time on $H$-graphs
(parameterized by $k$ and the treewidth of $H$). In fact, these results apply to classes of graphs
with treewidth bounded by a function of the clique number. We observe that $H$-graphs have at most
$n^{O(\|H\|)}$ minimal separators which allows us to apply the meta-algorithmic framework of
Fomin et al. (2015) to show that for each fixed $t$, finding a maximum induced subgraph of treewidth
$t$ can be done in polynomial time. When $H$ is a cactus, we improve the bound to $O(\|H\|n^2)$.
