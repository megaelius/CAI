We revisit the range sampling problem: the input is a set of points where each point is associated
with a real-valued weight. The goal is to store them in a structure such that given a query range and
an integer $k$, we can extract $k$ independent random samples from the points inside the query range,
where the probability of sampling a point is proportional to its weight. This line of work was initiated
in 2014 by Hu, Qiao, and Tao and it was later followed up by Afshani and Wei. The first line of work mostly
studied unweighted but dynamic version of the problem in one dimension whereas the second result
considered the static weighted problem in one dimension as well as the unweighted problem in 3D for
halfspace queries. We offer three main results and some interesting insights that were missed by
the previous work: We show that it is possible to build efficient data structures for range sampling
queries if we allow the query time to hold in expectation (the first result), or obtain efficient
worst-case query bounds by allowing the sampling probability to be approximately proportional
to the weight (the second result). The third result is a conditional lower bound that shows essentially
one of the previous two concessions is needed. For instance, for the 3D range sampling queries, the
first two results give efficient data structures with near-linear space and polylogarithmic query
time whereas the lower bound shows with near-linear space the worst-case query time must be close
to $n^{2/3}$, ignoring polylogarithmic factors. Up to our knowledge, this is the first such major
gap between the expected and worst-case query time of a range searching problem.
