Bayesian integral functional measure of entropy-uncertainty (EF) on trajectories of Markov multi-dimensional
diffusion process is cutting off by interactive impulses (controls). Each cutoff minimax of EF
superimposes and entangles conjugated fractions in microprocess, enclosing the captured entropy
fractions as source of an information unit. The impulse step-up action launches the unit formation
and step-down action finishes it and brings energy from the interactive jump. This finite jump transfers
the entangled entropy from uncertain Yes-logic to the certain-information No-logic information
unit whose measuring at end of the cut kills final entropy-uncertainty and limits unit. The Yes-No
logic holds Bit Participator creating elementary information observer without physical pre-law.
Cooperating two units in doublet and an opposite directional information unit in triplet forms
minimal stable structure. Information path functional (IPF) integrates multiple hidden information
contributions along the cutting process correlations in information units of cooperating doublets-triplets,
bound by free information, and enfolds the sequence of enclosing triplet structures in the information
network (IN) that sequentially decreases the entropy and maximizes information. The IN bound triplets
release free information rising information forces enable attracting new information unit and
ordering it. While IPF collects the information units, the IN performs logical computing using
doublet-triplet code. The IN different levels unite logic of quantum micro- and macro- information
processes, composing quantum and/or classical computation.
