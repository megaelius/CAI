We present fully dynamic approximation algorithms for the Maximum Independent Set problem on several
types of geometric objects: intervals on the real line, arbitrary axis-aligned squares in the plane
and axis-aligned $d$-dimensional hypercubes. It is known that a maximum independent set of a collection
of $n$ intervals can be found in $O(n\log n)$ time, while it is already \textsf{NP}-hard for a set
of unit squares. Moreover, the problem is inapproximable on many important graph families, but
admits a \textsf{PTAS} for a set of arbitrary pseudo-disks. Therefore, a fundamental question
in computational geometry is whether it is possible to maintain an approximate maximum independent
set in a set of dynamic geometric objects, in truly sublinear time per insertion or deletion. In this
work, we answer this question in the affirmative for intervals, squares and hypercubes. First,
we show that for intervals a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate maximum independent set can be maintained
with logarithmic worst-case update time. This is achieved by maintaining a locally optimal solution
using a constant number of constant-size exchanges per update. We then show how our interval structure
can be used to design a data structure for maintaining an expected constant factor approximate maximum
independent set of axis-aligned squares in the plane, with polylogarithmic amortized update time.
Our approach generalizes to $d$-dimensional hypercubes, providing a $O(4^d)$-approximation
with polylogarithmic update time. Those are the first approximation algorithms for any set of dynamic
arbitrary size geometric objects; previous results required bounded size ratios to obtain polylogarithmic
update time. Furthermore, it is known that our results for squares (and hypercubes) cannot be improved
to a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation with the same update time.
