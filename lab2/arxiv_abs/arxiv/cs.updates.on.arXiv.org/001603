We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to reconstruct the dynamics
of, steer, and manipulate systems based on their intrinsic algorithmic probability using the universal
principles of the theory of computability and algorithmic information. By applying sequences
of controlled interventions to systems and networks, we estimate how changes in their algorithmic
information content are reflected in positive/negative shifts towards and away from randomness.
The strong connection between approximations to algorithmic complexity (the size of the shortest
generating mechanism) and causality induces a sequence of perturbations ranking the network elements
by the steering capabilities that each of them is capable of. This new dimension unmasks a separation
between causal and non-causal components providing a suite of powerful parameter-free algorithms
of wide applicability ranging from optimal dimension reduction, maximal randomness analysis
and system control. We introduce methods for reprogramming systems that do not require the full
knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic equations or any probability distributions.
A causal interventional analysis of synthetic and regulatory biological networks reveals how
the algorithmic reprogramming qualitatively reshapes the system's dynamic landscape. For example,
during cellular differentiation we find a decrease in the number of elements corresponding to a
transition away from randomness and a combination of the system's intrinsic properties and its
intrinsic capabilities to be algorithmically reprogrammed can reconstruct an epigenetic landscape.
The interventional calculus is broadly applicable to predictive causal inference of systems such
as networks and of relevance to a variety of machine and causal learning techniques driving model-based
approaches to better understanding and manipulate complex systems.
