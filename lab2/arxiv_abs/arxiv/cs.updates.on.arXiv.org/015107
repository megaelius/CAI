A distributed binary hypothesis testing (HT) problem involving two parties, a remote observer
and a detector, is studied. The remote observer has access to a discrete memoryless source, and communicates
its observations to the detector via a rate-limited noiseless channel. The detector observes another
discrete memoryless source, and performs a binary hypothesis test on the joint distribution of
its own observations with those of the observer. While the goal of the observer is to maximize the
type II error exponent of the test for a given type I error probability constraint, it also wants to
keep a private part of its observations as oblivious to the detector as possible. Considering both
equivocation and average distortion under a causal disclosure assumption as possible measures
of privacy, the trade-off between the communication rate from the observer to the detector, the
type II error exponent, and privacy is studied. For the general HT problem, we establish single-letter
inner bounds on both the rate-error exponent-equivocation and rate-error exponent-distortion
trade-offs. Subsequently, single-letter characterizations for both trade-offs are obtained
(i) for testing against conditional independence of the observer's observations from those of
the detector, given some additional side-information at the detector; and (ii) when the communication
rate constraint over the channel is zero. Finally, we show by providing a counterexample that, the
strong converse which holds for distributed HT without a privacy constraint, does not hold when
a privacy constraint is imposed. This implies that, in general, the rate-error exponent-equivocation
and rate-error exponent-distortion trade-offs are not independent of the type I error probability
constraint.
