Cities across the United States are implementing information communication technologies in an
effort to improve government services. One such innovation in e-government is the creation of 311
systems, offering a centralized platform where citizens can request services, report non-emergency
concerns, and obtain information about the city via hotline, mobile, or web-based applications.
The NYC 311 service request system represents one of the most significant links between citizens
and city government, accounting for more than 8,000,000 requests annually. These systems are generating
massive amounts of data that, when properly managed, cleaned, and mined, can yield significant
insights into the real-time condition of the city. Increasingly, these data are being used to develop
predictive models of citizen concerns and problem conditions within the city. However, predictive
models trained on these data can suffer from biases in the propensity to make a request that can vary
based on socio-economic and demographic characteristics of an area, cultural differences that
can affect citizens' willingness to interact with their government, and differential access to
Internet connectivity. Using more than 20,000,000 311 requests - together with building violation
data from the NYC Department of Buildings and the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development;
property data from NYC Department of City Planning; and demographic and socioeconomic data from
the U.S. Census American Community Survey - we develop a two-step methodology to evaluate the propensity
to complain: (1) we predict, using a gradient boosting regression model, the likelihood of heating
and hot water violations for a given building, and (2) we then compare the actual complaint volume
for buildings with predicted violations to quantify discrepancies across the City.
