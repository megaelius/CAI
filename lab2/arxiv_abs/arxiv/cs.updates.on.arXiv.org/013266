Since IC fabrication is costly and time-consuming, it is highly desirable to develop virtual metrology
tools that can predict the properties of a wafer based on fabrication configurations without performing
physical measurements on a fabricated IC. We propose a deep learning-based data-driven framework
consisting of two convolutional neural networks: i) LithoNet that predicts the shape deformations
on a circuit due to IC fabrication, and ii) OPCNet that suggests IC layout corrections to compensate
for such shape deformations. By learning the shape correspondence between pairs of layout design
patterns and their SEM images of the product wafer thereof, given an IC layout pattern, LithoNet
can mimic the fabrication procedure to predict its fabricated circuit shape for virtual metrology.
Furthermore, LithoNet can take the wafer fabrication parameters as a latent vector to model the
parametric product variations that can be inspected on SEM images. In addition, traditional lithography
simulation methods used to suggest a correction on a lithographic photomask is computationally
expensive. Our proposed OPCNet mimics the optical proximity correction (OPC) procedure and efficiently
generates a corrected photomask by collaborating with LithoNet to examine if the shape of a fabricated
IC circuitry best matches its original layout design. As a result, the proposed LithoNet-OPCNet
framework cannot only predict the shape of a fabricated IC from its layout pattern, but also suggests
a layout correction according to the consistency between the predicted shape and the given layout.
Experimental results with several benchmark layout patterns demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.
