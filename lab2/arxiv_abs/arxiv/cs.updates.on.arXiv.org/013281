Semi-supervised learning methods are usually employed in the classification of data sets where
only a small subset of the data items is labeled. In these scenarios, label noise is a crucial issue,
since the noise may easily spread to a large portion or even the entire data set, leading to major degradation
in classification accuracy. Therefore, the development of new techniques to reduce the nasty effects
of label noise in semi-supervised learning is a vital issue. Recently, a graph-based semi-supervised
learning approach based on Particle competition and cooperation was developed. In this model,
particles walk in the graphs constructed from the data sets. Competition takes place among particles
representing different class labels, while the cooperation occurs among particles with the same
label. This paper presents a new particle competition and cooperation algorithm, specifically
designed to increase the robustness to the presence of label noise, improving its label noise tolerance.
Different from other methods, the proposed one does not require a separate technique to deal with
label noise. It performs classification of unlabeled nodes and reclassification of the nodes affected
by label noise in a unique process. Computer simulations show the classification accuracy of the
proposed method when applied to some artificial and real-world data sets, in which we introduce
increasing amounts of label noise. The classification accuracy is compared to those achieved by
previous particle competition and cooperation algorithms and other representative graph-based
semi-supervised learning methods using the same scenarios. Results show the effectiveness of
the proposed method.
