Similarity group-by (SGB, for short) has been proposed as a relational database operator to match
the needs of emerging database applications. Many SGB operators that extend SQL have been proposed
in the literature, e.g., similarity operators in the one-dimensional space. These operators have
various semantics. Depending on how these operators are implemented, some of the implementations
may lead to different groupings of the data. Hence, if SQL code is ported from one database system
to another, it is not guaranteed that the code will produce the same results. In this paper, we investigate
the various semantics for the relational similarity group-by operators in the multi-dimensional
space. We define the class of order-independent SGB operators that produce the same results regardless
of the order in which the input data is presented to them. Using the notion of interval graphs borrowed
from graph theory, we prove that, for certain SGB operators, there exist order-independent implementations.
For each of these operators, we provide a sample algorithm that is order-independent. Also, we prove
that for other SGB operators, there does not exist an order-independent implementation for them,
and hence these SGB operators are ill-defined and should not be adopted in extensions to SQL to realize
similarity group-by. In this paper, we introduce an SGB operator, namely SGB-All, for grouping
multi-dimensional data using similarity. SGB-All forms groups such that a data item, say O, belongs
to a group, say G, if and only if O is within a user-defined threshold from all other data items in G.
In other words, each group in SGB-All forms a clique of nearby data items in the multi-dimensional
space. We prove that SGB-All are order-independent, i.e., there is at least one algorithm for each
option that is independent of the presentation order of the input data.
