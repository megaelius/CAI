In this paper, we study a variant of hedonic games, called \textsc{Seat Arrangement}. The model
is defined by a bijection from agents with preferences to vertices in a graph. The utility of an agent
depends on the neighbors assigned in the graph. More precisely, it is the sum over all neighbors of
the preferences that the agent has towards the agent assigned to the neighbor. We first consider
the price of stability and fairness for different classes of preferences. In particular, we show
that there is an instance such that the price of fairness ({\sf PoF}) is unbounded in general. Moreover,
we show an upper bound $\tilde{d}(G)$ and an almost tight lower bound $\tilde{d}(G)-1/4$ of {\sf
PoF}, where $\tilde{d}(G)$ is the average degree of an input graph. Then we investigate the computational
complexity of problems to find certain ``good'' seat arrangements, say \textsc{Maximum Welfare
Arrangement}, \textsc{Maximin Utility Arrangement}, \textsc{Stable Arrangement}, and \textsc{Envy-free
Arrangement}. We give dichotomies of computational complexity of four \textsc{Seat Arrangement}
problems from the perspective of the maximum order of connected components in an input graph. For
the parameterized complexity, \textsc{Maximum Welfare Arrangement} can be solved in time $n^{O(\gamma)}$,
while it cannot be solved in time $f(\gamma)^{o(\gamma)}$ under ETH, where $\gamma$ is the vertex
cover number of an input graph. Moreover, we show that \textsc{Maximin Utility Arrangement} and
\textsc{Envy-free Arrangement} are weakly NP-hard even on graphs of bounded vertex cover number.
Finally, we prove that determining whether a stable arrangement can be obtained from a given arrangement
by $k$ swaps is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k+\gamma$, whereas it can be solved in time $n^{O(k)}$.
