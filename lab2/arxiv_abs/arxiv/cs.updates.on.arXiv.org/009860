Industrial automation has received a considerable attention in the last few years with the rise
of Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, industrial communication network technology such
as Profinet has proved to be a major game changer for such automation. However, industrial automation
devices often have to exhibit robustness to dynamically changing network conditions and thus,
demand a rigorous testing environment to avoid any safety-critical failures. Hence, in this paper,
we have proposed an FPGA-based novel framework called Profi-Load to generate Profinet traffic
with specific intensities for a specified duration of time. The proposed Profi-Load intends to
facilitate the performance testing of the industrial automated devices under various network
conditions. By using the advantage of inherent hardware parallelism and re-configurable features
of FPGA, Profi-Load is able to generate Profinet traffic efficiently. Moreover, it can be reconfigured
on the fly as per the specific requirements. We have developed our proposed Profi-Load framework
by employing the Xilinx-based NetJury device which belongs to Zynq-7000 FPGA family. A series of
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of Profi-Load and it has been observed
that Profi-Load is able to generate precise load at a constant rate for stringent timing requirements.
Furthermore, a suitable Human Machine Interface (HMI) has also been developed for quick access
to our framework. The HMI at the client side can directly communicate with the NetJury device and
parameters such as, required load amount, number of packet(s) to be sent or desired time duration
can be selected using the HMI.
