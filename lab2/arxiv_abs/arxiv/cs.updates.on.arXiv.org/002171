Security and privacy are major concerns in modern communication networks. In recent years, the
information theory of covert communications, where the very presence of the communication is undetectable
to a watchful and determined adversary, has been of great interest. This emerging body of work has
focused on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), and optical
channels. In contrast, our recent work introduced the information-theoretic limits for covert
communications over packet channels whose packet timings are governed by a Poisson point process.
However, actual network packet arrival times do not generally conform to the Poisson process assumption,
and thus here we consider the extension of our work to timing channels characterized by more general
renewal processes of rate $\lambda$. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, the source
of the packets on the channel cannot be authenticated by Willie, and therefore Alice can insert packets
into the channel. We show that if the total number of transmitted packets by Jack is $N$, Alice can
covertly insert $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$ packets and, if she transmits more, she
will be detected by Willie. In the second scenario, packets are authenticated by Willie but we assume
that Alice and Bob share a secret key; hence, Alice alters the timings of the packets according to
a pre-shared codebook with Bob to send information to him over a $G/M/1$ queue with service rate $\mu>\lambda$.
We show that Alice can covertly and reliably transmit $\mathcal{O}(N)$ bits to Bob when the total
number of packets sent from Jack to Steve is $N$.
