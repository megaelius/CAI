Computing a (shortest) path between two vertices in a graph is one of the most fundamental primitives
in graph algorithms. In recent years, the study of paths in temporal graphs, that is, graphs where
the vertex set is fixed but the edge set changes over time, gained more and more attention. Such a path
is time-respecting, or temporal, if it uses edges over non-decreasing times. In this paper, we investigate
a basic constraint for temporal paths, where the time spent at each vertex must not exceed a given
duration $\Delta$, referred to as $\Delta$-restless temporal paths. This constraint arises naturally
in the modeling of real-world processes like infectious diseases and packet routing in communication
networks. While the reachability problem for temporal paths in general is known to be polynomial-time
solvable, we show that the restless version of this problem becomes computationally hard even in
very restrictive settings. For example, it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by feedback vertex
number or pathwidth of the underlying graph. The main question thus becomes whether the problem
is tractable in some natural settings. As of today, no reference set of parameters exist for temporal
graphs. We explore several directions in this respect, presenting FPT algorithms for three kinds
of parameters: (1) output-related parameters (here, the maximum length of the path), (2) classical
parameters applied to the underlying graph (e.g., feedback edge number), and (3) a new parameter
called timed feedback vertex number, which captures finer-grained temporal features of the input
temporal graph, and which may be of interest beyond this work.
