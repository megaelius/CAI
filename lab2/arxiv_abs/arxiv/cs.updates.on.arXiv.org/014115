Locally Rotation Invariant (LRI) image analysis was shown to be fundamental in many applications
and in particular in medical imaging where local structures of tissues occur at arbitrary rotations.
LRI constituted the cornerstone of several breakthroughs in texture analysis, including Local
Binary Patterns (LBP), Maximum Response 8 (MR8) and steerable filterbanks. Whereas globally rotation
invariant Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were recently proposed, LRI was very little investigated
in the context of deep learning. LRI designs allow learning filters accounting for all orientations,
which enables a drastic reduction of trainable parameters and training data when compared to standard
3D CNNs. In this paper, we propose and compare several methods to obtain LRI CNNs with directional
sensitivity. Two methods use orientation channels (responses to rotated kernels), either by explicitly
rotating the kernels or using steerable filters. These orientation channels constitute a locally
rotation equivariant representation of the data. Local pooling across orientations yields LRI
image analysis. Steerable filters are used to achieve a fine and efficient sampling of 3D rotations
as well as a reduction of trainable parameters and operations, thanks to a parametric representations
involving solid Spherical Harmonics (SH), which are products of SH with associated learned radial
profiles.Finally, we investigate a third strategy to obtain LRI based on rotational invariants
calculated from responses to a learned set of solid SHs. The proposed methods are evaluated and compared
to standard CNNs on 3D datasets including synthetic textured volumes composed of rotated patterns,
and pulmonary nodule classification in CT. The results show the importance of LRI image analysis
while resulting in a drastic reduction of trainable parameters, outperforming standard 3D CNNs
trained with data augmentation.
