Thus far, limited research has been performed on resilient supplier selection - a problem that requires
simultaneous consideration of a set of numerical and linguistic evaluation criteria, which are
substantially different from traditional supplier selection problem. Essentially, resilient
supplier selection entails key sourcing decision for an organization to gain competitive advantage.
In the presence of multiple conflicting evaluation criteria, contradicting decision makers,
and imprecise decision relevant information (DRI), this problem becomes even more difficult to
solve with the classical optimization approaches. However, prior research focusing on MCDA based
supplier selection problem has been lacking in the ability to provide a seamless integration of
numerical and linguistic evaluation criteria along with the consideration of multiple decision
makers. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive decision-making framework for
ranking a set of suppliers from resiliency perspective. The proposed algorithm is capable of leveraging
imprecise and aggregated DRI obtained from crisp numerical assessments and reliability adjusted
linguistic appraisals from a group of decision makers. We adapt two popular tools - Single Valued
Neutrosophic Sets (SVNS) and Interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFS), and for the first time extend them
to incorporate both crisp and linguistic evaluations in a group decision making platform to obtain
aggregated SVNS and IVFS decision matrix. This information is then used to rank the resilient suppliers
by using TOPSIS method. We present a case study to illustrate the mechanism of the proposed algorithm.
