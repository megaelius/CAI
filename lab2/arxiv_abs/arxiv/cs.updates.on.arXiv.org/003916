Many computer graphics problems require computing geometric shapes subject to certain constraints.
This often results in non-linear and non-convex optimization problems with globally coupled variables,
which pose great challenge for interactive applications. Local-global solvers developed in recent
years can quickly compute an approximate solution to such problems, making them an attractive choice
for applications that prioritize efficiency over accuracy. However, these solvers suffer from
lower convergence rate, and may take a long time to compute an accurate result. In this paper, we propose
a simple and effective technique to accelerate the convergence of such solvers. By treating each
local-global step as a fixed-point iteration, we apply Anderson acceleration, a well-established
technique for fixed-point solvers, to speed up the convergence of a local-global solver. To address
the stability issue of classical Anderson acceleration, we propose a simple strategy to guarantee
the decrease of target energy and ensure its global convergence. In addition, we analyze the connection
between Anderson acceleration and quasi-Newton methods, and show that the canonical choice of
its mixing parameter is suitable for accelerating local-global solvers. Moreover, our technique
is effective beyond classical local-global solvers, and can be applied to iterative methods with
a common structure. We evaluate the performance of our technique on a variety of geometry optimization
and physics simulation problems. Our approach significantly reduces the number of iterations
required to compute an accurate result, with only a slight increase of computational cost per iteration.
Its simplicity and effectiveness makes it a promising tool for accelerating existing algorithms
as well as designing efficient new algorithms.
