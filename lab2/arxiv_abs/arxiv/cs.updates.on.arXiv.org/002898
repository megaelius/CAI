This article analyses the difference in timing between the online availability of articles and
their corresponding print publication and how it affects two bibliometric indicators: Journal
Impact Factor (JIF) and Immediacy Index. This research examined 18,526 articles, the complete
collection of articles and reviews published by a set of 61 journals on Urology and Nephrology in
2013 and 2014. The findings suggest that Advance Online Publication (AOP) accelerates the citation
of articles and affects the JIF and Immediacy Index values. Regarding the JIF values, the comparison
between journals with or without AOP showed statistically significant differences (P=0.001,
Mann-Whitney U test). The Spearman's correlation between the JIF and the median online-to-print
publication delay was not statistically significant. As to the Immediacy Index, a significant
Spearman's correlation (rs=0.280, P=0.029) was found regarding the median online-to-print publication
delays for journals published in 2014, although no statistically significant correlation was
found for those published in 2013. Most journals examined (n=52 out of 61) published their articles
in AOP. The analysis also showed different publisher practices: eight journals did not include
the online posting dates in the full-text and nine journals published articles showing two different
online posting dates--the date provided on the journal website and another provided by Elsevier's
Science Direct. These practices suggest the need for transparency and standardization of the AOP
dates of scientific articles for calculating bibliometric indicators for journals.
