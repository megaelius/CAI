Condition monitoring is central to the efficient operation of wind farms due to the challenging
operating conditions, rapid technology development and large number of aging wind turbines. In
particular, predictive maintenance planning requires the early detection of faults with few false
positives. Achieving this type of detection is a challenging problem due to the complex and weak
signatures of some faults, particularly the faults that occur in some of the drivetrain bearings.
Here, we investigate recently proposed condition monitoring methods based on unsupervised dictionary
learning using vibration data recorded over 46 months under typical industrial operations. Thus,
we contribute novel test results and real world data that are made publicly available. The results
of former studies addressing condition monitoring tasks using dictionary learning indicate that
unsupervised feature learning is useful for diagnosis and anomaly detection purposes. However,
these studies are based on small sets of labeled data from test rigs operating under controlled conditions
that focus on classification tasks, which are useful for quantitative method comparisons but gives
little insight into how useful these approaches are in practice. In this study, dictionaries are
learned from gearbox vibrations in six different turbines, and the dictionaries are subsequently
propagated over a few years of monitoring data when faults are known to occur. We perform the experiment
using two different sparse coding algorithms to investigate if the algorithm selected affects
the features of abnormal conditions. We calculate the dictionary distance between the initial
and propagated dictionaries and find the time periods of abnormal dictionary adaptation starting
six months before a drivetrain bearing replacement and one year before the resulting gearbox replacement.
