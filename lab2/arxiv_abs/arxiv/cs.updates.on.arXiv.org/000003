Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are known for its ability in tackling problems found to
be unyielding to traditional mathematical methods. A recent addition to these techniques are the
Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques which, in most cases, are nature or biologically inspired
techniques. Different CI techniques found their way to many control engineering applications,
including system identification, and the results obtained by many researchers were encouraging.
However, most control engineers and researchers used the basic CI models as is or slightly modified
them to match their needs. Henceforth, the merits of one model over the other was not clear, and full
potential of these models was not exploited. In this research, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, which are different CI techniques, are modified to best suit
the multimodal problem of system identification. In the first case of GA, an extension to the basic
algorithm, which is inspired from nature as well, was deployed by introducing redundant genetic
material. This extension, which come in handy in living organisms, did not result in significant
performance improvement to the basic algorithm. In the second case, the Clubs-based PSO (C-PSO)
dynamic neighborhood structure was introduced to replace the basic static structure used in canonical
PSO algorithms. This modification of the neighborhood structure resulted in significant performance
of the algorithm regarding convergence speed, and equipped it with a tool to handle multimodal problems.
To understand the suitability of different GA and PSO techniques in the problem of system identification,
they were used in an induction motor's parameter identification problem. The results enforced
previous conclusions and showed the superiority of PSO in general over the GA in such a multimodal
problem.
