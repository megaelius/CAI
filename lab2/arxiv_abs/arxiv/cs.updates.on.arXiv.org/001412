One leading question with respect to Bi-intuitionistic logic (BINT) is, what does BINT look like
across the three arcs -- logic, typed $\lambda$-calculi, and category theory -- of the Curry-Howard-Lambek
correspondence? Categorically, BINT can be seen as a mixing of two worlds: the first being intuitionistic
logic (IL), which is modeled by a cartesian closed category, and the second being the dual to intuitionistic
logic called cointuitionistic logic (coIL), which is modeled by a cocartesian coclosed category.
Crolard showed that combining these two categories into the same category results in it degenerating
to a poset. However, this degeneration does not occur when both logics are linear. We propose that
IL and coIL need to be separated, and then mixed in a controlled way using the modalities from linear
logic. This separation can be ultimately achieved by an adjoint formalization of bi-intuitionistic
logic. This formalization consists of three worlds instead of two: the first is intuitionistic
logic, the second is linear bi-intuitionistic (Bi-ILL), and the third is cointuitionistic logic.
They are then related via two adjunctions. The adjunction between IL and ILL is known as a Linear/Non-linear
model (LNL model) of ILL, and is due to Benton. However, the dual to LNL models which would amount to
the adjunction between coILL and coIL has yet to appear in the literature. In this paper we fill this
gap by studying the dual to LNL models which we call dual LNL models. We show that dual LNL models correspond
to dual linear categories, the dual to Bierman's linear categories proposed by Bellin. Then we give
the definition of bi-LNL models by combining our model with LNL models to obtain a new model of bi-intuitionistic
logic. Finally, we give a corresponding sequent calculus, natural deduction, and term assignment
for dual LNL models.
