Motivation: Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) visualizes structure and spatial organization
of macromolecules and their interactions with other subcellular components inside single cells
in the close-to-native state at sub-molecular resolution. Such information is critical for the
accurate understanding of cellular processes. However, subtomogram classification remains
one of the major challenges for the systematic recognition and recovery of the macromolecule structures
in cryo-ET because of imaging limits and data quantity. Recently, deep learning has significantly
improved the throughput and accuracy of large-scale subtomogram classification. However often
it is difficult to get enough high-quality annotated subtomogram data for supervised training
due to the enormous expense of labeling. To tackle this problem, it is beneficial to utilize another
already annotated dataset to assist the training process. However, due to the discrepancy of image
intensity distribution between source domain and target domain, the model trained on subtomograms
in source domainmay perform poorly in predicting subtomogram classes in the target domain. Results:
In this paper, we adapt a few shot domain adaptation method for deep learning based cross-domain
subtomogram classification. The essential idea of our method consists of two parts: 1) take full
advantage of the distribution of plentiful unlabeled target domain data, and 2) exploit the correlation
between the whole source domain dataset and few labeled target domain data. Experiments conducted
on simulated and real datasets show that our method achieves significant improvement on cross domain
subtomogram classification compared with baseline methods.
