We present an application of mosaic diagrams to the visualisation of set relations. Venn and Euler
diagrams are the best known visual representations of sets and their relationships (intersections,
containment or subsets, exclusion or disjointness). In recent years, alternative forms of visualisation
have been proposed. Among them, linear diagrams have been shown to compare favourably to Venn and
Euler diagrams, in supporting non-interactive assessment of set relationships. Recent studies
that compared several variants of linear diagrams have demonstrated that users perform best at
tasks involving identification of intersections, disjointness and subsets when using a horizontally
drawn linear diagram with thin lines representing sets, and employing vertical lines as guide lines.
The essential visual task the user needs to perform in order to interpret this kind of diagram is vertical
alignment of parallel lines and detection of overlaps. Space-filling mosaic diagrams which support
this same visual task have been used in other applications, such as the visualization of schedules
of activities, where they have been shown to be superior to linear Gantt charts. In this paper, we
present an application of mosaic diagrams for visualization of set relationships, and compare
it to linear diagrams in terms of accuracy, time-to-answer, and subjective ratings of perceived
task difficulty. The study participants exhibited similar performance on both visualisations,
suggesting that mosaic diagrams are a good alternative to Venn and Euler diagrams, and that the choice
between linear diagrams and mosaics may be solely guided by visual design considerations.
