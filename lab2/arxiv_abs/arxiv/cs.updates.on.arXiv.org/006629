We analyze a decentralized random walk-based algorithm for data collection at the sink in a multi-hop
sensor network. Our algorithm, Random-Collect, which involves data packets being passed to random
neighbors in the network according to a random walk mechanism, requires no configuration and incurs
no routing overhead. To analyze this method, we model the data generation process as independent
Bernoulli arrivals at the source nodes. We analyze both latency and throughput in this setting,
providing a theoretical lower bound for the throughput and a theoretical upper bound for the latency.
The main contribution of our paper, however, is the throughput result: we present a general lower
bound on the throughput achieved by our data collection method in terms of the underlying network
parameters. In particular, we show that the rate at which our algorithm can collect data depends
on the spectral gap of the given random walk's transition matrix and if the random walk is simple then
it also depends on the maximum and minimum degrees of the graph modeling the network. For latency,
we show that the time taken to collect data not only depends on the worst-case hitting time of the given
random walk but also depends on the data arrival rate. In fact, our latency bound reflects the data
rate-latency trade-off i.e., in order to achieve a higher data rate we need to compromise on latency
and vice-versa. We also discuss some examples that demonstrate that our lower bound on the data rate
is optimal up to constant factors, i.e., there exists a network topology and sink placement for which
the maximum stable data rate is just a constant factor above our lower bound.
