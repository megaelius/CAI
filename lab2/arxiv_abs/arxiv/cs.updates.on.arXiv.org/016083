Recent years have seen an increasing integration of distributed renewable energy resources into
existing electric power grids. Due to the uncertain nature of renewable energy resources, network
operators are faced with new challenges in balancing load and generation. In order to meet the new
requirements, intelligent distributed energy resource plants can be used which provide as virtual
power plants e.g. demand side management or flexible generation. However, the calculation of an
adequate schedule for the unit commitment of such distributed energy resources is a complex optimization
problem which is typically too complex for standard optimization algorithms if large numbers of
distributed energy resources are considered. For solving such complex optimization tasks, population-based
metaheuristics -- as e.g. evolutionary algorithms -- represent powerful alternatives. Admittedly,
evolutionary algorithms do require lots of computational power for solving such problems in a timely
manner. One promising solution for this performance problem is the parallelization of the usually
time-consuming evaluation of alternative solutions. In the present paper, a new generic and highly
scalable parallel method for unit commitment of distributed energy resources using metaheuristic
algorithms is presented. It is based on microservices, container virtualization and the publish/subscribe
messaging paradigm for scheduling distributed energy resources. Scalability and applicability
of the proposed solution are evaluated by performing parallelized optimizations in a big data environment
for three distinct distributed energy resource scheduling scenarios. The new method provides
cluster or cloud parallelizability and is able to deal with a comparably large number of distributed
energy resources. The application of the new proposed method results in very good performance for
scaling up optimization speed.
