In this work, we study the problem of index coding from graph homomorphism perspective. We show that
the minimum broadcast rate of an index coding problem for different variations of the problem such
as non-linear, scalar, and vector index code, can be upper bounded by the minimum broadcast rate
of another index coding problem when there exists a homomorphism from the complement of the side
information graph of the first problem to that of the second problem. As a result, we show that several
upper bounds on scalar and vector index code problem are special cases of one of our main theorems.
For the linear scalar index coding problem, it has been shown in [1] that the binary linear index of
a graph is equal to a graph theoretical parameter called minrank of the graph. For undirected graphs,
in [2] it is shown that $\mathrm{minrank}(G) = k$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $\bar{G}$
to a predefined graph $\bar{G}_k$. Combining these two results, it follows that for undirected
graphs, all the digraphs with linear index of at most k coincide with the graphs $G$ for which there
exists a homomorphism from $\bar{G}$ to $\bar{G}_k$. In this paper, we give a direct proof to this
result that works for digraphs as well. We show how to use this classification result to generate
lower bounds on scalar and vector index. In particular, we provide a lower bound for the scalar index
of a digraph in terms of the chromatic number of its complement. Using our framework, we show that
by changing the field size, linear index of a digraph can be at most increased by a factor that is independent
from the number of the nodes.
