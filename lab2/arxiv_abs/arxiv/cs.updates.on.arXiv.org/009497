This paper presents novel ultrareliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) techniques for
URLLC services, such as Tactile Internet services. Among typical use-cases of URLLC services are
tele-operation, immersive virtual reality, cooperative automated driving, and so on. In such
URLLC services, new kinds of traffic such as haptic information including kinesthetic information
and tactile information need to be delivered in addition to high-quality video and audio traffic
in traditional multimedia services. Further, such a variety of traffic has various characteristics
in terms of packet sizes and data rates with a variety of requirements of latency and reliability.
Furthermore, some traffic may occur in a sporadic manner but require reliable delivery of packets
of medium to large sizes within a low latency, which is not supported by current state-of-the-art
wireless communication systems and is very challenging for future wireless communication systems.
Thus, to meet such a variety of tight traffic requirements in a wireless communication system, novel
technologies from the physical layer to the network layer need to be devised. In this paper, some
novel physical layer technologies such as waveform multiplexing, multiple access scheme, channel
code design, synchronization, and full-duplex transmission for spectrally-efficient URLLC
are introduced. In addition, a novel performance evaluation approach, which combines a ray-tracing
tool and system-level simulation, is suggested for evaluating the performance of the proposed
schemes. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed schemes providing realistic
URLLC services in realistic geographical environments, which encourages further efforts to substantiate
the proposed work.
