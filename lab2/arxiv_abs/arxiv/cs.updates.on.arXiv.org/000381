The increasing availability of temporal network data is calling for more research on extracting
and characterizing mesoscopic structures in temporal networks and on relating such structure
to specific functions or properties of the system. An outstanding challenge is the extension of
the results achieved for static networks to time-varying networks, where the topological structure
of the system and the temporal activity patterns of its components are intertwined. Here we investigate
the use of a latent factor decomposition technique, non-negative tensor factorization, to extract
the community-activity structure of temporal networks. The method is intrinsically temporal
and allows to simultaneously identify communities and to track their activity over time. We represent
the time-varying adjacency matrix of a temporal network as a three-way tensor and approximate this
tensor as a sum of terms that can be interpreted as communities of nodes with an associated activity
time series. We summarize known computational techniques for tensor decomposition and discuss
some quality metrics that can be used to tune the complexity of the factorized representation. We
subsequently apply tensor factorization to a temporal network for which a ground truth is available
for both the community structure and the temporal activity patterns. The data we use describe the
social interactions of students in a school, the associations between students and school classes,
and the spatio-temporal trajectories of students over time. We show that non-negative tensor factorization
is capable of recovering the class structure with high accuracy. In particular, the extracted tensor
components can be validated either as known school classes, or in terms of correlated activity patterns,
i.e., of spatial and temporal coincidences that are determined by the known school activity schedule.
