Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been recently considered in millimeter-wave (mmWave)
massive MIMO systems to further enhance the spectrum efficiency. In addition, simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a promising solution to maximize the energy efficiency.
In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the integration of SWIPT in mmWave massive MIMO-NOMA
systems. As mmWave massive MIMO will likely use hybrid precoding (HP) to significantly reduce the
number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains without an obvious performance loss, where the
fully digital precoder is decomposed into a high-dimensional analog precoder and a low-dimensional
digital precoder, we propose to apply SWIPT in HP-based MIMO-NOMA systems, where each user can extract
both information and energy from the received RF signals by using a power splitting receiver. Specifically,
the cluster-head selection (CHS) algorithm is proposed to select one user for each beam at first,
and then the analog precoding is designed according to the selected cluster heads for all beams.
After that, user grouping is performed based on the correlation of users' equivalent channels.
Then, the digital precoding is designed by selecting users with the strongest equivalent channel
gain in each beam. Finally, the achievable sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing power allocation
for mmWave massive MIMO-NOMA and power splitting factors for SWIPT, and an iterative optimization
algorithm is developed to solve the non-convex problem. Simulation results show that the proposed
HP-based MIMO-NOMA with SWIPT can achieve higher spectrum and energy efficiency compared with
HP-based MIMO-OMA with SWIPT.
