Despite the effort put into the detection of academic plagiarism, it continues to be a ubiquitous
problem spanning all disciplines. Various tools have been developed to assist human inspectors
by automatically identifying suspicious documents. However, to our knowledge currently none
of these tools use mathematical content for their analysis. This is problematic, because mathematical
content potentially represents a significant amount of the scientific contribution in academic
documents. Hence, ignoring mathematical content limits the detection of plagiarism considerably,
especially in disciplines with frequent use of mathematics. This paper aims to help close this gap
by providing an overview of existing approaches in mathematical information retrieval and an analysis
of their applicability for different possible cases of mathematical plagiarism. I find that whereas
syntax-based approaches perform particularly well in detecting undisguised plagiarism, structure-based
and hybrid approaches promise to also detect forms of disguised mathematical plagiarism, such
as plagiarism with renamed identifiers. However, more research in this area is needed to enable
the detection of more complex mathematical plagiarism: the scope of current approaches is restricted
to the formula-level, an extension to the section-level is needed. Additionally, the general detection
of equivalence transformations is currently not feasible. Despite these remaining problems,
I conclude that the presented approaches could already be used for a basic automated detection system
targeting mathematical plagiarism and therefore enhance current plagiarism detection systems.
