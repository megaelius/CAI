In this thesis, the synthesis of correct-by-construction controllers for robots assisting in
Search and Rescue (SAR) is considered. In recent years, the development of robots assisting in disaster
mitigation in urban environments has been actively encouraged, since robots can be deployed in
dangerous and hazardous areas where human SAR operations would not be possible. In order to meet
the reliability requirements in SAR, the specifications of the robots are stated in Linear Temporal
Logic and synthesized into finite state machines that can be executed as controllers. The resulting
controllers are purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment by
changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from sensors or other robots.
Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks, the synthesis of controllers
that together achieve a common goal is considered. This distributed synthesis problem is provably
undecidable, hence it cannot be solved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced
in order to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular, communication
and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified standardized communication protocol and
preempting negotiations between robots. The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search
for stationary and moving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and robbers,
and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so that the number of robots required
is minimized. The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for robots
performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for moving targets. It is shown
that the controllers are guaranteed to achieve the common goal of finding and rescuing the targets.
