In this paper we introduce randomized branching as a tool for parameterized approximation and develop
the mathematical machinery for its analysis. Our algorithms improve the best known running times
of parameterized approximation algorithms for Vertex Cover and $3$-Hitting Set for a wide range
of approximation ratios. One notable example is a simple parameterized random $1.5$-approximation
algorithm for Vertex Cover, whose running time of $O^*(1.01657^k)$ substantially improves the
best known runnning time of $O^*(1.0883^k)$ [Brankovic and Fernau, 2013]. For $3$-Hitting Set
we present a parameterized random $2$-approximation algorithm with running time of $O^*(1.0659^k)$,
improving the best known $O^*(1.29^k)$ algorithm of [Brankovic and Fernau, 2012]. The running
times of our algorithms are derived from an asymptotic analysis of a wide class of two-variable recurrence
relations of the form: $$p(b,k) = \min_{1\leq j \leq N} \sum_{i=1}^{r_j} \bar{\gamma}_i^j \cdot
p(b-\bar{b}^j_i, k-\bar{k}_i^j),$$ where $\bar{b}^j$ and $\bar{k}^j$ are vectors of natural
numbers, and $\bar{\gamma}^j$ is a probability distribution over $r_j$ elements, for $1\leq j
\leq N$. Our main theorem asserts that for any $\alpha>0$, $$\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty } \frac{1}{k}
\log p(\alpha k,k) = -\max_{1\leq j \leq N} M_j,$$ where $M_j$ depends only on $\alpha$, $\bar{\gamma}^j$,
$\bar{b}^j$ and $\bar{k}^j$, and can be efficiently calculated by solving a simple numerical optimization
problem. To this end, we show an equivalence between the recurrence and a stochastic process. We
analyze this process using the Method of Types, by introducing an adaptation of Sanov's theorem
to our setting. We believe our novel analysis of recurrence relations which is of independent interest
is a main contribution of this paper.
