Multi-agent planning in dynamic domains is a challenging problem: the size of the configuration
space increases exponentially in the number of agents, and plans need to be re-evaluated periodically
to account for moving obstacles. However, we have two key insights that hold in several domains:
1) conflicts between multi-agent plans often have geometrically local resolutions within a small
repair window, even if such local resolutions are not globally optimal; and 2) the partial search
tree for such local resolutions can then be iteratively improved over successively larger windows
to eventually compute the global optimal plan. Building upon these two insights, we introduce a
sparse, anytime variant of the A* planner, which we call X* (Expanding A*). X* operates by planning
for each agent individually and forming local repair windows around collisions, repairing agents
within that window. If time allows, X* grows the window and repeats. X* implements two novel techniques
to reduce the computational cost compared to joint A*: 1) it preserves the partial X* search trees
and priority queues between iterations of window growth; and 2) it defers explicit joint state enumeration
until necessary. By preserving the search tree, X* significantly out-performs joint A* and a na\"ive
window-growing A* algorithm. By deferring explicit joint state enumeration, X* reduces the number
of priority queue operations by several orders of magnitude compared to a joint A* planner. We present
empirical results from several domains, showing that X* outperforms existing state-of-the-art
joint planners for sparse anytime multi-agent planning with optimality convergence.
