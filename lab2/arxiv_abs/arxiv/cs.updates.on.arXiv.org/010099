Research grants have played an important role in seeding and promoting fundamental research projects
worldwide. There is a growing demand for developing and delivering scientific influence analysis
as a service on research grant repositories. Such analysis can provide insight on how research grants
help foster new research collaborations, encourage cross-organizational collaborations, influence
new research trends, and identify technical leadership. This paper presents the design and development
of a grants-based scientific influence analysis service, coined as GImpact. It takes a graph-theoretic
approach to design and develop large scale scientific influence analysis over a large research-grant
repository with three original contributions. First, we mine the grant database to identify and
extract important features for grants influence analysis and represent such features using graph
theoretic models. For example, we extract an institution graph and multiple associated aspect-based
collaboration graphs, including a discipline graph and a keyword graph. Second, we introduce self-influence
and co-influence algorithms to compute two types of collaboration relationship scores based on
the number of grants and the types of grants for institutions. We compute the self-influence scores
to reflect the grant based research collaborations among institutions and compute multiple co-influence
scores to model the various types of cross-institution collaboration relationships in terms of
disciplines and subject areas. Third, we compute the overall scientific influence score for every
pair of institutions by introducing a weighted sum of the self-influence score and the multiple
co-influence scores and conduct an influence-based clustering analysis. We evaluate GImpact
using a real grant database, consisting of 2512 institutions and their grants received over a period
of 14 years...
