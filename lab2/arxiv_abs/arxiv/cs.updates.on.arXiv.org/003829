A robust-to-dynamics optimization (RDO) problem is an optimization problem specified by two pieces
of input: (i) a mathematical program (an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
and a feasible set $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$), and (ii) a dynamical system (a map $g:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$).
Its goal is to minimize $f$ over the set $\mathcal{S}\subseteq\Omega$ of initial conditions that
forever remain in $\Omega$ under $g$. The focus of this paper is on the case where the mathematical
program is a linear program and the dynamical system is either a known linear map, or an uncertain
linear map that can change over time. In both cases, we study a converging sequence of polyhedral
outer approximations and (lifted) spectrahedral inner approximations to $\mathcal{S}$. Our
inner approximations are optimized with respect to the objective function $f$ and their semidefinite
characterization---which has a semidefinite constraint of fixed size---is obtained by applying
polar duality to convex sets that are invariant under (multiple) linear maps. We characterize three
barriers that can stop convergence of the outer approximations from being finite. We prove that
once these barriers are removed, our inner and outer approximating procedures find an optimal solution
and a certificate of optimality for the RDO problem in a finite number of steps. Moreover, in the case
where the dynamics are linear, we show that this phenomenon occurs in a number of steps that can be
computed in time polynomial in the bit size of the input data. Our analysis also leads to a polynomial-time
algorithm for RDO instances where the spectral radius of the linear map is bounded above by any constant
less than one. Finally, in our concluding section, we propose a broader research agenda for studying
optimization problems with dynamical systems constraints, of which RDO is a special case.
