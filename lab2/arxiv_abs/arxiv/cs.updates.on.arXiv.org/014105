Existing traffic flow forecasting approaches by deep learning models achieve excellent success
based on a large volume of datasets gathered by governments and organizations. However, these datasets
may contain lots of user's private data, which is challenging the current prediction approaches
as user privacy is calling for the public concern in recent years. Therefore, how to develop accurate
traffic prediction while preserving privacy is a significant problem to be solved, and there is
a trade-off between these two objectives. To address this challenge, we introduce a privacy-preserving
machine learning technique named federated learning and propose a Federated Learning-based Gated
Recurrent Unit neural network algorithm (FedGRU) for traffic flow prediction. FedGRU differs
from current centralized learning methods and updates universal learning models through a secure
parameter aggregation mechanism rather than directly sharing raw data among organizations. In
the secure parameter aggregation mechanism, we adopt a Federated Averaging algorithm to reduce
the communication overhead during the model parameter transmission process. Furthermore, we
design a Joint Announcement Protocol to improve the scalability of FedGRU. We also propose an ensemble
clustering-based scheme for traffic flow prediction by grouping the organizations into clusters
before applying FedGRU algorithm. Through extensive case studies on a real-world dataset, it is
shown that FedGRU's prediction accuracy is 90.96% higher than the advanced deep learning models,
which confirm that FedGRU can achieve accurate and timely traffic prediction without compromising
the privacy and security of raw data.
