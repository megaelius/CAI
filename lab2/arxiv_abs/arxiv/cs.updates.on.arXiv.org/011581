Mobile and wearable interfaces and interaction paradigms are highly constrained by the available
screen real estate, and the computational and power resources. Although there exist many ways of
displaying information to mobile users, inputting data to a mobile device is, usually, limited
to a conventional touch based interaction, that distracts users from their ongoing activities.
Furthermore, emerging applications, like augmented, mixed and virtual reality (AR/MR/VR), require
new types of input methods in order to interact with complex virtual worlds, challenging the traditional
techniques of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Leveraging of Natural User Interfaces (NUIs),
as a paradigm of using natural intuitive actions to interact with computing systems, is one of many
ways to meet these challenges in mobile computing and its modern applications. Brain-Machine Interfaces
that enable thought-only hands-free interaction, Myoelectric input methods that track body gestures
and gaze-tracking input interfaces - are the examples of NUIs applicable to mobile and wearable
interactions. The wide adoption of wearable devices and the penetration of mobile technologies,
alongside with the growing market of AR/MR/VR, motivates the exploration and implementation of
new interaction paradigms. The concurrent development of bio-signal acquisition techniques
and accompanying ecosystems offers a useful toolbox to address open challenges. In this survey,
we present state-of-the-art bio-signal acquisition methods, summarize and evaluate recent developments
in the area of NUIs and outline potential application in mobile scenarios. The survey will provide
a bottoms-up overview starting from (i) underlying biological aspects and signal acquisition
techniques, (ii) portable NUI hardware solutions, (iii) NUI-enabled applications, as well as
(iv) research challenges and open problems.
