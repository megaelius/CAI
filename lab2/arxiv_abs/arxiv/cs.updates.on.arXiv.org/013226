In this paper, we investigate the downlink secure beamforming (BF) design problem of cloud radio
access networks (C-RANs) relying on multicast fronthaul, where millimeter-wave and microwave
carriers are used for the access links and fronthaul links, respectively. The base stations (BSs)
jointly serve users through cooperating hybrid analog/digital BF. We first develop an analog BF
for cooperating BSs. On this basis, we formulate a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem subject
both to a realistic limited fronthaul capacity and to the total BS transmit power constraint. Due
to the intractability of the non-convex problem formulated, advanced convex approximated techniques,
constrained concave convex procedures and semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation are applied
to transform it into a convex one. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm of jointly optimizing multicast
BF, cooperative digital BF and the artificial noise (AN) covariance is proposed. Next, we construct
the solution of the original problem by exploiting both the primal and the dual optimal solution
of the SDP-relaxed problem. Furthermore, a per-BS transmit power constraint is considered, necessitating
the reformulation of the SRM problem, which can be solved by an efficient iterative algorithm. We
then eliminate the idealized simplifying assumption of having perfect channel state information
(CSI) for the eavesdropper links and invoke realistic imperfect CSI. Furthermore, a worst-case
SRM problem is investigated. Finally, by combining the so-called $\mathcal{S}$-Procedure and
convex approximated techniques, we design an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. Simulation
results are presented to evaluate the secrecy rate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms.
