Systematic reviews, which summarize and synthesize all the current research in a specific topic,
are a crucial component to academia. They are especially important in the biomedical and health
sciences, where they synthesize the state of medical evidence and conclude the best course of action
for various diseases, pathologies, and treatments. Due to the immense amount of literature that
exists, as well as the output rate of research, reviewing abstracts can be a laborious process. Automation
may be able to significantly reduce this workload. Of course, such classifications are not easily
automated due to the peculiar nature of written language. Machine learning may be able to help. This
paper explored the viability and effectiveness of using machine learning modelling to classify
abstracts according to specific exclusion/inclusion criteria, as would be done in the first stage
of a systematic review. The specific task was performing the classification of deciding whether
an abstract is a randomized control trial (RCT) or not, a very common classification made in systematic
reviews in the healthcare field. Random training/testing splits of an n=2042 dataset of labelled
abstracts were repeatedly created (1000 times in total), with a model trained and tested on each
of these instances. A Bayes classifier as well as an SVM classifier were used, and compared to non-machine
learning, simplistic approaches to textual classification. An SVM classifier was seen to be highly
effective, yielding a 90% accuracy, as well as an F1 score of 0.84, and yielded a potential workload
reduction of 70%. This shows that machine learning has the potential to significantly revolutionize
the abstract screening process in healthcare systematic reviews.
