This paper considers massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems
and proposes an adaptive active user detection and channel estimation scheme based on compressive
sensing. By exploiting the sporadic traffic of massive connected user equipments and the virtual
angular domain sparsity of massive MIMO channels, the proposed scheme can support massive access
with dramatically reduced access latency. Specifically, we design non-orthogonal pseudo-random
pilots for uplink broadband massive access, and formulate the active user detection and channel
estimation problems as a generalized multiple measurement vector compressive sensing problem.
Furthermore, by leveraging the structured sparsity of the uplink channel matrix, we propose an
efficient generalized multiple measurement vector approximate message passing (GMMV-AMP) algorithm
to realize simultaneous active user detection and channel estimation based on a spatial domain
or an angular domain channel model. To jointly exploit the channel sparsity presented in both the
spatial and the angular domains for enhanced performance, a Turbo-GMMV-AMP algorithm is developed
for detecting the active users and estimating their channels in an alternating manner. Finally,
an adaptive access scheme is proposed, which adapts the access latency to guarantee reliable massive
access for practical systems with unknown channel sparsity level. Additionally, the state evolution
of the proposed GMMV-AMP algorithm is derived to predict its performance. Simulation results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed active user detection and channel estimation schemes compared
to several baseline schemes.
