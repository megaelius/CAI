At the last few years, multimedia communication has been developed and improved rapidly in order
to enable users to communicate between each other over the internet. Generally, multimedia communication
consists of audio and video communication. However, this research concentrates on audio conferencing
only. The audio translation between protocols is a very critical issue, because it solves the communication
problems between any two protocols. So, it enables people around the world to talk with each other
even they use different protocols. In this research, a real time audio translation module between
two protocols has been done. These two protocols are: InterAsterisk eXchange Protocol (IAX) and
Real-Time Switching Control Protocol (RSW), which they are widely used to provide two ways audio
transfer feature. The solution here is to provide inter-working between the two protocols which
they have different media transports, audio codecs, header formats and different transport protocols
for the audio transmission. This translation will help bridging the gap between the two protocols
by providing inter-working capability between the two audio streams of IAX and RSW. Some related
works have been done to provide translation between IAX and RSW control signalling messages. But,
this research paper concentrates on the translation that depends on the media transfer. The proposed
translation module was tested and evaluated in different scenarios in order to examine its performance.
The obtained results showed that the Real-Time Audio Translation Module produces lower rates of
packet delay and jitter than the acceptance values for each of the mentioned performance metrics.
