Age of Information is a newly introduced metric, getting vivid attention for measuring the freshness
of information in real-time networks. This parameter has evolved to guarantee the reception of
timely information from the latest status update, received by a user from any real-time application.
In this paper, we study a centralized, closed-loop, networked controlled industrial wireless
sensor-actuator network for cyber-physical production systems. Here, we jointly address the
problem of transmission scheduling of sensor updates and the restoration of an information flow-line
after any real-time update having hard-deadline drops from it, resulting a break in the loop. Unlike
existing real-time scheduling policies that only ensure timely updates, this work aims to accomplish
both the time-sensitivity and data freshness in new and regenerative real-time updates in terms
of the age of information. Here, the coexistence of both cyber and physical units and their individual
requirements for providing the quality of service to the system, as a whole, seems to be one of the
major challenges to handle. In this work, minimization of staleness of the time-critical updates
to extract maximum utilization out of its information content and its effects on other network performances
are thoroughly investigated. A greedy scheduling policy called Deadline-aware highest latency
first has been used to solve this problem; its performance optimality is proved analytically. Finally,
our claim is validated by comparing the results obtained by our algorithm with those of other popular
scheduling policies through extensive simulations.
