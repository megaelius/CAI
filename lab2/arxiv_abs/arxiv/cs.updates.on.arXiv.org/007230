Tuberculosis is a deadly infectious disease prevalent around the world. Due to the lack of proper
technology in place, the early detection of this disease is unattainable. Also, the available methods
to detect Tuberculosis is not up-to a commendable standards due to their dependency on unnecessary
features, this make such technology obsolete for a reliable health-care technology. In this paper,
I propose a deep-learning based system which diagnoses tuberculosis based on the important features
in Chest X-rays along with original chest X-rays. Employing our system will accelerate the process
of tuberculosis diagnosis by overcoming the need to perform the time-consuming sputum-based testing
method (Diagnostic Microbiology). In contrast to the previous methods \cite{kant2018towards,
melendez2016automated}, our work utilizes the state-of-the-art ResNet \cite{he2016deep} with
proper data augmentation using traditional robust features like Haar \cite{viola2005detecting,viola2001rapid}
and LBP \cite{ojala1994performance,ojala1996comparative}. I observed that such a procedure
enhances the rate of tuberculosis detection to a highly satisfactory level. Our work uses the publicly
available pulmonary chest X-ray dataset to train our network \cite{jaeger2014two}. Nevertheless,
the publicly available dataset is very small and is inadequate to achieve the best accuracy. To overcome
this issue I have devised an intuitive feature based data augmentation pipeline. Our approach shall
help the deep neural network \cite{lecun2015deep,he2016deep,krizhevsky2012imagenet} to focus
its training on tuberculosis affected regions making it more robust and accurate, when compared
to other conventional methods that use procedures like mirroring and rotation. By using our simple
yet powerful techniques, I observed a 10\% boost in performance accuracy.
