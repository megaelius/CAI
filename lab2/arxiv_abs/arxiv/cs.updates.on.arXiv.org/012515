Simon's problem played an important role in the history of quantum algorithms, as it inspired Shor
to discover the celebrated quantum algorithm solving integer factorization in polynomial time.
Besides, the quantum algorithm for Simon's problem has been recently applied to break symmetric
cryptosystems. Generalized Simon's problem, denoted by $\mathsf{GSP}(n,k)$, is a natural extension
of Simon's problem: Given a function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ and the promise that there exists
a subgroup $S \le \mathbb{Z}_2^n$ of rank $k<n$ such that for any $x, y \in \{0,1\}^n, f(x) = f(y)$
iff $x \oplus y \in S$, the goal is to find $S$. Here we consider the query complexity of the problem,
that is, the minimum number of queries to $f$ required to find $S$. It is not difficult to design a quantum
algorithm for solving the above problem exactly with query complexity of $O(n-k)$. However, so
far it is not clear what is the classical deterministic query complexity of the problem, and revealing
this complexity is necessary for clarifying the computational power gap between quantum and classical
computing on the problem. Also, the methods developed in this process may be helpful for other problems.
In this paper, we obtain an upper bound $O\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{k \cdot 2^{n-k}}\}\right)$ on the
classical deterministic query complexity of $\mathsf{GSP}(n,k)$, by constructing a subtle classical
algorithm based on group theory and the divide-and-conquer method. Moreover, we prove that any
classical deterministic algorithm for $\mathsf{GSP}(n,k)$ has to query at least $\Omega\left(\max\{k,
\sqrt{k \cdot 2^{n-k}}\}\right)$ values of $f$, by the double counting method and the adversary
method. Therefore, we have a full characterization on the classical deterministic query complexity
of generalized Simon's problem.
