Tumors often contain multiple, genetically distinct subpopulations of cancerous cells. These
so-called subclonal populations are defined by distinct somatic mutations that include point
mutations such as single nucleotide variants and small indels -- collectively called simple somatic
mutations (SSMs) -- as well as larger structural changes that result in copy number variations (CNVs).
In some cases, the genotype and prevalence of these subpopulations can be reconstructed based on
high-throughput, short-read sequencing of DNA in one or more tumor samples. To date, no automated
SSM-based subclonal reconstructions have been attempted on WGS data; and CNV-based reconstructions
are limited to tumors with two or fewer cancerous subclonal populations and with a small number of
CNVs. We describe a new automated method, PhyloWGS, that can be applied to WGS data from one or more
tumor samples to perform subclonal reconstruction based on both CNVs and SSMs. PhyloWGS successfully
recovers the composition of mixtures of a highly rearranged TGCA cell line when a CNV-based method
fails. On WGS data with average read depth of 40 from five time-series chronic lymphocytic leukemia
samples, PhyloWGS recovers the same tumor phylogeny previously reconstructed using deep targeted
resequencing. To further explore the limits of WGS-based subclonal reconstruction, we ran PhyloWGS
on simulated data: PhyloWGS can reliably reconstruct as many as three cancerous subpopulations
based on 30-50x coverage WGS data from a single tumor sample with 10's to 1000's of SSMs per subpopulation.
At least five cancerous subpopulations can be reconstructed if provided with read depths of 200
or more.
