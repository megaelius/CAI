Cellular bioelectricity describes the biological phenomenon in which cells in living tissue generate
and maintain patterns of voltage gradients induced by differing concentrations of charged ions.
A growing body of research suggests that bioelectric patterns represent an ancient system that
plays a key role in guiding many important developmental processes including tissue regeneration,
tumor suppression, and embryogenesis. Understanding the relationship between high-level bioelectric
patterns and low-level biochemical processes might also enable powerful new forms of synthetic
biology. A key open question in this area is understanding how a collection of cells, interacting
with each other and the extracellular environment only through simple ligand bindings and ion fluxes,
can compute non-trivial patterns and perform non-trivial information processing tasks. The standard
approach to this question is to model a given bioelectrical network as a system of differential equations
and then explore its behavior using simulation techniques. In this paper, we propose applying a
computational approach. In more detail, we present the cellular bioelectric model (CBM), a new
computational model that captures the primary capabilities and constraints of bioelectric interactions
between cells and their environment. We use this model to investigate several important topics
in cellular bioelectricity, including symmetry breaking and information processing. Among other
results, we describe and analyze a basic bioelectric strategy the efficiently stabilizes arbitrary
cell networks into maximal independent sets (a structure known to play a role in the nervous system
development of flys), and prove cells in our model are Turing complete in their ability to process
information encoded in their initial voltage potential.
