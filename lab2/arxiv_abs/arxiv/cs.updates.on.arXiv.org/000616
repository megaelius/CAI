The present paper extends the literature investigating key drivers leading certain patents to
exert a stronger influence on the subsequent technological developments (inventions) than other
ones. We investigated six key determinants, as (i) the use of scientific knowledge, (ii) the breadth
of the technological base, (iii) the existence of collaboration in patent development, (iv) the
number of claims, (v) the scope, and (vi) the novelty, and how the effect of these determinants varies
when patent influence - as measured by the number of forward citations the patent received - is distinguished
as within and across the industrial and organizational boundaries. We conducted an empirical analysis
on a sample of 5671 patents granted to 293 US biotechnology firms from 1976 to 2003. Results reveal
that the contribution of the determinants to patent influence differs across the domains that are
identified by the industrial and organizational boundaries. Findings, for example, show that
the use of scientific knowledge negatively affects patent influence outside the biotechnology
industry, while it positively contributes to make a patent more relevant for the assignee's subsequent
technological developments. In addition, the broader the scope of a patent the higher the number
of citations the patent receives from subsequent non-biotechnology patents. This relationship
is inverted-U shaped when considering the influence of a patent on inventions granted to other organizations
than the patent's assignee. Finally, the novelty of a patent is inverted-U related with the influence
the patent exerts on the subsequent inventions granted across the industrial and organizational
boundaries.
