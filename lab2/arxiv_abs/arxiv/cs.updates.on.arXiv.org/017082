Information technology has spread widely, and extraordinarily large amounts of data have been
made accessible to users, which has made it challenging to select data that are in accordance with
user needs. For the resolution of the above issue, recommender systems have emerged, which much
help users go through the process of decision-making and selecting relevant data. A recommender
system predicts users behavior to be capable of detecting their interests and needs, and it often
uses the classification technique for this purpose. It may not be sufficiently accurate to employ
individual classification, where not all cases can be examined, which makes the method inappropriate
to specific problems. In this research, group classification and the ensemble learning technique
were used for increasing prediction accuracy in recommender systems. Another issue that is raised
here concerns user analysis. Given the large size of the data and a large number of users, the process
of user needs analysis and prediction (using a graph in most cases, representing the relations between
users and their selected items) is complicated and cumbersome in recommender systems. Graph embedding
was also proposed for resolution of this issue, where all or part of user behavior can be simulated
through the generation of several vectors, resolving the problem of user behavior analysis to a
large extent while maintaining high efficiency. In this research, individuals most similar to
the target user were classified using ensemble learning, fuzzy rules, and the decision tree, and
relevant recommendations were then made to each user with a heterogeneous knowledge graph and embedding
vectors. This study was performed on the MovieLens datasets, and the obtained results indicated
the high efficiency of the presented method.
