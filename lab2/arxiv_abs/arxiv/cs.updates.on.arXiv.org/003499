This paper comments on "Asynchronous Logic Implementation Based on Factorized DIMS" [Journal
of Circuits, Systems, and Computers, vol. 26, no. 5, 1750087: 1-9, May 2017] with respect to two main
problematic issues: i) the gate orphan problem implicit in the factorized DIMS approach discussed
in the referenced article which affects its strong-indication, and ii) how the enumeration of product
terms to represent the synthesis cost is skewed in the referenced article because the logic expression
contains sum of products and also product of sums. It is observed that the referenced article has
not provided a general logic synthesis algorithm excepting only an example illustration involving
a 3-input AND logic function. The absence of a general logic synthesis algorithm would make it difficult
to reproduce the research described in the referenced article. Moreover, the example illustration
in the referenced article describes an unsafe logic decomposition which is not suitable for the
multi-level synthesis of strong-indication asynchronous circuits. Further, a logic synthesis
method which safely decomposes the DIMS solution to synthesize multi-level strong-indication
asynchronous circuits is available in the existing literature, which was neither cited nor taken
up for comparison in the referenced article, which is another drawback. Subsequently, it is concluded
that the referenced article has not advanced existing knowledge in the field but on the contrary,
has caused confusions. Hence, in the interest of readers, this paper additionally highlights some
important and relevant literature which provide valuable information about robust asynchronous
circuit synthesis techniques which employ delay-insensitive codes for data representation and
processing and the 4-phase return-to-zero handshake protocol for data communication.
