Algorand is a recent, open-source public or permissionless blockchain system that employs a novel
proof-of-stake byzantine consensus protocol to efficiently scale the distributed transaction
agreement problem to billions of users. In addition to being more democratic and energy-efficient,
compared to popular protocols such as Bitcoin, Algorand also touts a much high transaction throughput.
This paper is the first attempt in the literature to study and address this problem. By carefully
modeling the participation costs and rewards received within a strategic interaction scenario,
we first empirically show that even a small number of nodes defecting to participate in the protocol
tasks due to insufficiency of the available incentives can result in the Algorand network failing
to compute and add new blocks of transactions. We further show that this effect can be formalized
by means of a mathematical model of interaction in Algorand given its participation costs and the
current (or planned) reward distribution/sharing approach envisioned by the Algorand Foundation.
Specifically, on analyzing this game model we observed that mutual cooperation under the currently
proposed reward sharing approach is not a Nash equilibrium. This is a significant result which could
threaten the success of an otherwise robust distributed consensus mechanism. We propose a novel
reward sharing approach for Algorand and formally show that it is incentive-compatible, i.e.,
it can guarantee cooperation within a group of selfish Algorand users. Extensive numerical and
Algorand simulation results further confirm our analytical findings. Moreover, these results
show that for a given distribution of stakes in the network, our reward sharing approach can guarantee
cooperation with a significantly smaller reward per round.
