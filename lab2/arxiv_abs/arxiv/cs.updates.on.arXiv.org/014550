Here, we propose an unsupervised fuzzy rule-based dimensionality reduction method primarily
for data visualization. It considers the following important issues relevant to dimensionality
reduction-based data visualization: (i) preservation of neighborhood relationships, (ii) handling
data on a non-linear manifold, (iii) the capability of predicting projections for new test data
points, (iv) interpretability of the system, and (v) the ability to reject test points if required.
For this, we use a first-order Takagi-Sugeno type model. We generate rule antecedents using clusters
in the input data. In this context, we also propose a new variant of the Geodesic c-means clustering
algorithm. We estimate the rule parameters by minimizing an error function that preserves the inter-point
geodesic distances (distances over the manifold) as Euclidean distances on the projected space.
We apply the proposed method on three synthetic and three real-world data sets and visually compare
the results with four other standard data visualization methods. The obtained results show that
the proposed method behaves desirably and performs better than or comparable to the methods compared
with. The proposed method is found to be robust to the initial conditions. The predictability of
the proposed method for test points is validated by experiments. We also assess the ability of our
method to reject output points when it should. Then, we extend this concept to provide a general framework
for learning an unsupervised fuzzy model for data projection with different objective functions.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to manifold learning using unsupervised fuzzy
modeling.
