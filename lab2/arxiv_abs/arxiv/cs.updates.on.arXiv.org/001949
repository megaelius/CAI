Purpose: A new method for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging water-fat separation using a convolutional
neural network (ConvNet) and deep learning (DL) is presented. Feasibility of the method with complex
and magnitude images is demonstrated with a series of patient studies and accuracy of predicted
quantitative values is analyzed. Methods: Water-fat separation of 1200 gradient-echo acquisitions
from 90 imaging sessions (normal, acute and chronic myocardial infarction) was performed using
a conventional model based method with modeling of R2* and off-resonance and a multi-peak fat spectrum.
A U-Net convolutional neural network for calculation of water-only, fat-only, R2* and off-resonance
images was trained with 900 gradient-echo Multiple and single-echo complex and magnitude input
data algorithms were studied and compared to conventional extended echo modeling. Results: The
U-Net ConvNet was easily trained and provided water-fat separation results visually comparable
to conventional methods. Myocardial fat deposition in chronic myocardial infarction and intramyocardial
hemorrhage in acute myocardial infarction were well visualized in the DL results. Predicted values
for R2*, off-resonance, water and fat signal intensities were well correlated with conventional
model based water fat separation (R2>=0.97, p<0.001). DL images had a 14% higher signal-to-noise
ratio (p<0.001) when compared to the conventional method. Conclusion: Deep learning utilizing
ConvNets is a feasible method for MR water-fat separationimaging with complex, magnitude and single
echo image data. A trained U-Net can be efficiently used for MR water-fat separation, providing
results comparable to conventional model based methods.
