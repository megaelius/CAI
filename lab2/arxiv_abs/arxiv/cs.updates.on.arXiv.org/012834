Imagine when you line up in a store, the person in front of you can make you pay her bill by using a passive
wearable device that forces a scan of your credit card without your awareness. An important assumption
of today's Near-field Communication (NFC) enabled cards is the limited communication range between
the commercial reader and the NFC cards -- a distance below 5~cm. Previous approaches to attacking
this assumption effectively use mobile phones and active relays to enlarge the communication range,
in order to attack the NFC cards. However, these approaches require a power supply at the adversary
side, and can be easily localized when mobile phones or active relays transmit NFC signals. We propose
ReCoil, a system that uses wearable passive relays to attack NFC cards by expanding the communication
range to 49.6 centimeters, a ten-fold improvement over its intended commercial distance. ReCoil
is a magnetically coupled resonant wireless power transfer system, which optimizes the energy
transfer by searching the optimal geometry parameters. Specifically, we first narrow down the
feasible area reasonably and design the ReCoil-Ant Colony Algorithm such that the relays absorb
the maximum energy from the reader. In order to reroute the signal to pass over the surface of human
body, we then design a half waist band by carefully analyzing the impact of the distance and orientation
between two coils on the mutual inductance. Then, three more coils are added to the system to keep
enlarging the communication range. Finally, extensive experiment results validate our analysis,
showing that our passive relays composed of common copper wires and tunable capacitors expand the
range of NFC attacks to 49.6 centimeters.
