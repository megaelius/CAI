Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a powerful tool used to evaluate displacements and deformations
in a non-intrusive manner. By comparing two images, one of the undeformed reference state of a specimen
and another of the deformed target state, the relative displacement between those two states is
determined. DIC is well known and often used for post-processing analysis of in-plane displacements
and deformation of specimen. Increasing the analysis speed to enable real-time DIC analysis will
be beneficial and extend the field of use of this technique. Here we tested several combinations
of the most common DIC methods in combination with different parallelization approaches in MATLAB
and evaluated their performance to determine whether real-time analysis is possible with these
methods. To reflect improvements in computing technology different hardware settings were also
analysed. We found that implementation problems can reduce the efficiency of a theoretically superior
algorithm such that it becomes practically slower than a sub-optimal algorithm. The Newton-Raphson
algorithm in combination with a modified Particle Swarm algorithm in parallel image computation
was found to be most effective. This is contrary to theory, suggesting that the inverse-compositional
Gauss-Newton algorithm is superior. As expected, the Brute Force Search algorithm is the least
effective method. We also found that the correct choice of parallelization tasks is crucial to achieve
improvements in computing speed. A poorly chosen parallelisation approach with high parallel
overhead leads to inferior performance. Finally, irrespective of the computing mode the correct
choice of combinations of integer-pixel and sub-pixel search algorithms is decisive for an efficient
analysis. Using currently available hardware real-time analysis at high framerates remains an
aspiration.
