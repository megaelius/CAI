Tissue characterisation with CMR parametric mapping has the potential to detect and quantify both
focal and diffuse alterations in myocardial structure not assessable by late gadolinium enhancement.
Native T1 mapping in particular has shown promise as a useful biomarker to support diagnostic, therapeutic
and prognostic decision-making in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies. Convolutional
neural networks with Bayesian inference are a category of artificial neural networks which model
the uncertainty of the network output. This study presents an automated framework for tissue characterisation
from native ShMOLLI T1 mapping at 1.5T using a Probabilistic Hierarchical Segmentation (PHiSeg)
network. In addition, we use the uncertainty information provided by the PHiSeg network in a novel
automated quality control (QC) step to identify uncertain T1 values. The PHiSeg network and QC were
validated against manual analysis on a cohort of the UK Biobank containing healthy subjects and
chronic cardiomyopathy patients. We used the proposed method to obtain reference T1 ranges for
the left ventricular myocardium in healthy subjects as well as common clinical cardiac conditions.
T1 values computed from automatic and manual segmentations were highly correlated (r=0.97). Bland-Altman
analysis showed good agreement between the automated and manual measurements. The average Dice
metric was 0.84 for the left ventricular myocardium. The sensitivity of detection of erroneous
outputs was 91%. Finally, T1 values were automatically derived from 14,683 CMR exams from the UK
Biobank. The proposed pipeline allows for automatic analysis of myocardial native T1 mapping and
includes a QC process to detect potentially erroneous results. T1 reference values were presented
for healthy subjects and common clinical cardiac conditions from the largest cohort to date using
T1-mapping images.
