Through academic publications, the authors of these publications form a social network. Instead
of sharing casual thoughts and photos (as in Facebook), authors pick co-authors and reference papers
written by other authors. Thanks to various efforts (such as Microsoft Libra and DBLP), the data
necessary for analyzing the academic social network is becoming more available on the Internet.
What type of information and queries would be useful for users to find out, beyond the search queries
already available from services such as Google Scholar? In this paper, we explore this question
by defining a variety of ranking metrics on different entities -authors, publication venues and
institutions. We go beyond traditional metrics such as paper counts, citations and h-index. Specifically,
we define metrics such as influence, connections and exposure for authors. An author gains influence
by receiving more citations, but also citations from influential authors. An author increases
his/her connections by co-authoring with other authors, and specially from other authors with
high connections. An author receives exposure by publishing in selective venues where publications
received high citations in the past, and the selectivity of these venues also depends on the influence
of the authors who publish there. We discuss the computation aspects of these metrics, and similarity
between different metrics. With additional information of author-institution relationships,
we are able to study institution rankings based on the corresponding authors' rankings for each
type of metric as well as different domains. We are prepared to demonstrate these ideas with a web
site ( this http URL ) built from millions of publications and authors.
