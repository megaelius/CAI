Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in functional neuroimaging techniques have improved
in brain disorders, dysfunction studies via mapping the topology of the brain connections, i.e.
connectopic mapping. Since, there are the slight differences between healthy and unhealthy brain
regions and functions, investigation into the complex topology of functional and structural brain
networks in human is a complicated task with the growth of evaluation criteria. Irregular graph
deep learning applications have widely spread to understanding human cognitive functions that
are linked to gene expression and related distributed spatial patterns, because the neuronal networks
of the brain can hold dynamically a variety of brain solutions with different activity patterns
and functional connectivity, these applications might also be involved with both node-centric
and graph-centric tasks. In this paper, we performed a novel approach of individual generative
model and high order graph analysis for the region of interest recognition areas of the brain which
do not have a normal connection during applying certain tasks. Here, we proposed a high order framework
of Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) with a hypersphere distributer for functional data analysis in brain
imaging studies that is underlying non-Euclidean structure in the learning of strong non-rigid
graphs among large scale data. In addition, we distinguished the possible modes of correlations
in abnormal brain connections. Our finding will show the degree of correlation between the affected
regions and their simultaneous occurrence over time that can be used to diagnose brain diseases
or revealing the ability of the nervous system to modify in brain topology at all angles, brain plasticity,
according to input stimuli.
