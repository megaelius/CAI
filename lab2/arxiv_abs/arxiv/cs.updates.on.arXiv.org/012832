Climbing is a popular and growing sport, especially indoors, where climbers can train on man-made
routes using artificial holds. Both strength and good technique is required to successfully reach
the top of a climb, and often coaches work to improve technique so less strength is required, enabling
a climber to ascent more difficult climbs. Various aspects of adding computer-interaction to climbing
have been studied in recent years, but there is a large space for research into lightweight tools
to aid recreational intermediate climbers, both with trickier climbs and to improve their own technique.
In this CS Masters final project, I explored which form of data-capture and output-features could
improve a climber's training, and analysed how climbers responded to viewing their data throughout
a climbing session, then conducted a user-centred design to build a lightweight mobile application
for intermediate climbers. A variety of hardware and software solutions were explored, tested
and developed through series of surveys, discussions, wizard-of-oz studies and prototyping,
resulting in a system that most closely meets the needs of local indoor boulderers given the project's
time scope. This consists of an iteratively developed interactive mobile app that: can record,
graph, and score the acceleration of a climber, as both a training tool and gamification incentive
for good technique; can link a video recording to the acceleration graph, to enable frame-by-frame
inspection of weaknesses; is fully approved and distributed on the Google play Store and currently
being regularly used by 15 local climbers. Then I conducted a final usability study, comprising
a thematic analysis of forty minutes's worth of interview transcripts, to gain a deep understanding
of the app's impact on the climbers using it, along with its benefits and limitations.
