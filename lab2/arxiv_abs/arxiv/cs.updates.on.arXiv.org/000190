We investigate some basic questions about the interaction of regular and rational relations on
words. The primary motivation comes from the study of logics for querying graph topology, which
have recently found numerous applications. Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular
languages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational relations such as subword
or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended graph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness
of the intersection of rational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,
to the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a regular relation
have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation). We prove that for several basic and
commonly used rational relations, the intersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable
(e.g., for subword or su?x, and some generalizations), or decidable with non-primitive-recursive
complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its generalizations). These results are used to rule out
many classes of graph logics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to provide
the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that has non-primitive-recursive
complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for logics combining regular conditions on individual
paths and rational relations on paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classi?es
them into either e?ciently checkable or undecidable cases. We also give examples of rational relations
for which such logics are decidable even without syntactic restrictions.
