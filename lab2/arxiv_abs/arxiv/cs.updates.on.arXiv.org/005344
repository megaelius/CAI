Modular optical switch architectures combining wavelength routing based on arrayed waveguide
grating (AWG) devices and multicasting based on star couplers hold promise for flexibly addressing
the exponentially growing traffic demands in a cost- and power-efficient fashion. In a default
switching scenario, an input port of the AWG is connected to an output port via a single wavelength.
This can severely limit the capacity between broadcast domains, resulting in interdomain traffic
switching bottlenecks. In this paper, we examine the possibility of resolving capacity bottlenecks
by exploiting multiple AWG free spectral ranges (FSRs), i.e., setting up multiple parallel connections
between each pair of broadcast domains. To this end, we introduce a multi-FSR scheduling algorithm
for interconnecting broadcast domains by fairly distributing the wavelength resources among
them. We develop a general-purpose analytical framework to study the blocking probabilities in
a multistage switching scenario and compare our results with Monte Carlo simulations. Our study
points to significant improvements with a moderate increase in the number of FSRs. We show that an
FSR count beyond four results in diminishing returns. Furthermore, to investigate the trade-offs
between the network- and physical-layer effects, we conduct a cross-layer analysis, taking into
account pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and rate-adaptive forward error correction (FEC). We
illustrate how the effective bit rate per port increases with an increase in the number of FSRs. %We
also look at the advantages of an impairment-aware scheduling strategy in a multi-FSR switching
scenario.
