In this paper, we investigate the statistics of the free space optics (FSO) communication channel
between a hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a central unit. Two unique characteristics
make UAV-based FSO systems significantly different from conventional FSO systems with static
transceivers. First, for UAV-based FSO systems, the incident laser beam is not always orthogonal
to the receiver lens plane. Second, both position and orientation of the UAV fluctuate over time
due to dynamic wind load, inherent random air fluctuations in the atmosphere around the UAV, and
internal vibrations of the UAV. On the contrary, for conventional FSO systems, the laser beam is
always perpendicular to the receiver lens plane and the relative movement of the transceivers is
limited. In this paper, we develop a novel channel model for UAV-based FSO systems by quantifying
the corresponding geometric and misalignment losses (GML), while taking into account the non-orthogonality
of the laser beam and the random fluctuations of the position and orientation of the UAV. In particular,
for diverse weather conditions, we propose different fluctuation models for the position and orientation
of the UAV and derive corresponding statistical models for the GML. We further analyze the performance
of a UAV-based FSO link in terms of outage probability and ergodic rate and simplify the resulting
analytical expressions for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Finally, simulations
validate the accuracy of the presented analysis and provide important insights for system design.
For instance, we show that for a given variance of the fluctuations, the beam width should be properly
adjusted to minimize the outage probability.
