The adoption of Software Defined Networking (SDN) within traditional networks has provided operators
the ability to manage diverse resources and easily reconfigure or re-purpose networks as requirements
change. Recent research has extended this concept to IEEE 802.15.4 low-power wireless networks,
which form a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT). It is, however, difficult to apply the
high-overhead approach of SDN, which requires both regularly scheduled and reactive asynchronous
communication, to the low-bandwidth, unreliable environment present in IEEE 802.15.4. Although
recent research has attempted to address this issue through optimization, interoperability with
the low-power IPv6 stack inevitably results in trade-offs and contention with other protocols.
This paper introduces Atomic-SDN: a low-latency, reliable, and energy-efficient cross-layer
architecture for SDN control in low-power wireless networks. Atomic-SDN utilizes synchronous
flooding, which has recently been shown as a highly capable solution for fast and reliable communication
in low-power mesh networks. Additionally, Atomic-SDN introduces cross-layer architecture to
satisfy the different traffic patterns required by SDN, through configuration and scheduling
of multiple synchronous flooding protocols. Using this approach, controller communication is
facilitated at theoretical lower bounds of latency. We demonstrate the practicality of Atomic-SDN
through emulation, with extremely high reliability and minimal latency as the mesh scales; presenting
end-to-end delivery ratios of over 99.99% for SDN traffic, and controller association within milliseconds
as opposed to seconds. We evaluate the Atomic-SDN in comparison to other SDN architectural configurations
for IEEE 802.15.4, showing how Atomic-SDN improves SDN performance by orders-of-magnitude across
latency, reliability, and energy-efficiency metrics.
