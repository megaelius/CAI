We show that the uniform Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) parameterized by the size of the
solution is in W[1] (the problem is W[1]-hard and it is easy to place it in W[3]). Given a single "free"
element of the domain, denoted by $0$, we define the size of an assignment as the number of variables
that are mapped to a value other than $0$. Named by Kolaitis and Vardi (2000), uniform CSP means that
the input contains the domain and the list of tuples of each relation in the instance. Uniform CSP
is polynomial time equivalent to homomorphism problem and also to evaluation of conjunctive queries
on relational databases. It also has applications in artificial intelligence. We do not restrict
the problem to any (finite or infinite) family of relations. Uniform CSP restricted to some finite
family of relations (thus with a bound on the arity of relations) can easily be placed in W[1]. Marx
(2005) proved that any such problem over the Boolean domain is either W[1]-complete or fixed parameter
tractable. Together with Bulatov (2014) they extended this result to any finite domain. We then
study the weighted CSP over the Boolean Domain, where each variable is assigned a weight, and given
a target value, it should be decided if there is a satisfying assignment of size $k$ (the parameter)
such that the weight of its $1$-variables adds up to the target value. We prove that if the weights
are bounded by $n^k$, then the problem is in W[1]. For that, we first prove that parameterized Subset
Sum with weights bounded by $n^k$ is in W[1]. Abboud et al. (2014) have already proved the later, but
our proof is much shorter and arguably more intuitive. Our proofs give a nondeterministic RAM program
with special properties deciding the problem. First defined by Chen et al. (2005), such programs
characterize W[1].
