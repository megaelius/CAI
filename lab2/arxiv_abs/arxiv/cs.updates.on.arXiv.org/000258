We present an algorithm to generate application-specific, global reduced order quadratures (ROQ)
for multiple fast evaluations of weighted inner products between parameterized functions. If
a reduced basis (RB) or any other projection-based model reduction technique is applied, the dimensionality
of integrands is reduced dramatically; however, the cost of approximating the integrands by projection
still scales as the size of the original problem. In contrast, using discrete empirical interpolation
(DEIM) points as ROQ nodes leads to a computational cost which depends linearly on the dimension
of the reduced space. Generation of a reduced basis via a greedy procedure requires a training set,
which for products of functions can be very large. Since this direct approach can be impractical
in many applications, we propose instead a two-step greedy targeted towards approximation of such
products. We present numerical experiments demonstrating the accuracy and the efficiency of the
two-step approach. The presented ROQ are expected to display very fast convergence whenever there
is regularity with respect to parameter variation. We find that for the particular application
here considered, one driven by gravitational wave physics, the two-step approach speeds up the
offline computations to build the ROQ by more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the resulting
ROQ rule is found to converge exponentially with the number of nodes, and a factor of ~50 savings,
without loss of accuracy, is observed in evaluations of inner products when ROQ are used as a downsampling
strategy for equidistant samples using the trapezoidal rule. While the primary focus of this paper
is on quadrature rules for inner products of parameterized functions, our method can be easily adapted
to integrations of single parameterized functions, and some examples of this type are considered.
