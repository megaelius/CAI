Financial analyses of stock markets rely heavily on quantitative approaches in an attempt to predict
subsequent or market movements based on historical prices and other measurable metrics. These
quantitative analyses might have missed out on un-quantifiable aspects like sentiment and speculation
that also impact the market. Analyzing vast amounts of qualitative text data to understand public
opinion on social media platform is one approach to address this gap. This work carried out topic
analysis on 28264 financial tweets [1] via clustering to discover emerging events in the stock market.
Three main topics were discovered to be discussed frequently within the period. First, the financial
ratio EPS is a measure that has been discussed frequently by investors. Secondly, short selling
of shares were discussed heavily, it was often mentioned together with Morgan Stanley. Thirdly,
oil and energy sectors were often discussed together with policy. These tweets were semantically
clustered by a method consisting of word2vec algorithm to obtain word embeddings that map words
to vectors. Semantic word clusters were then formed. Each tweet was then vectorized using the Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) values of the words it consisted of and based on
which clusters its words were in. Tweet vectors were then converted to compressed representations
by training a deep-autoencoder. K-means clusters were then formed. This method reduces dimensionality
and produces dense vectors, in contrast to the usual Vector Space Model. Topic modelling with Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and top frequent words were used to analyze clusters and reveal emerging
events.
