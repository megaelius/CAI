Future telecommunication systems are expected to co-exist with different backhauling nodes such
as terrestrial or satellite systems. Satellite connectivity can add flexibility to backhauling
networks and provide an alternative route for transmission. This paper presents experimental
comparisons of satellite and terrestrial cellular networks and evaluates their performances
in terms of different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) including Channel Quality Index (CQI),
Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS) index, Downlink throughput, Frame Utilization (FU) and number
of Resource Block (RB) utilization ratios. Our experimental satellite network system uses a real
satellite backhaul deployment and works in Ka band (with two specific sub-bands on 19 Ghz in downlink
and 29 Ghz in uplink). As a benchmark, we compare our system with live terrestrial network in which
backhaul connection is cellular backhaul. Our experiments reveal three main observations: First
observation is that there exists FU and number of RB utilization problems in the satellite link even
though there exists a single test user equipment (UE) with high CQI and MCS index values. Second observation
is that in satellite link relatively low number of Protocol Data Units (PDUs) are generated at Radio
Link Controller (RLC) layer compared to the Packet Data Convergence Control (PDCP) layer. Finally,
our third observation concludes that the excessive existence of PDCP PDUs can be due to existence
of General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol-User Plane (GTP-U) accelerator where
an optimal balance between the caching size and the number of UEs using satellite eNodeB is needed.
For this reason, our experimental results reveal the existence of a trade-off between the supported
number of users on satellite link and the GTP-U acceleration rate.
