The objective of the study is to examine coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related discussions, concerns,
and sentiments that emerged from tweets posted by Twitter users. We collected 22 million Twitter
messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as "coronavirus," "COVID-19,"
"quarantine" from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments
in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams included "virus," "lockdown," and "quarantine." Popular
bigrams included "COVID-19," "stay home," "corona virus," "social distancing," and "new cases."
We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into different themes, such as "Measures
to slow the spread of COVID-19," "Quarantine and shelter-in-place order in the U.S.," "COVID-19
in New York," "Virus misinformation and fake news," "A need for a vaccine to stop the spread," "Protest
against the lockdown," and "Coronavirus new cases and deaths." The dominant sentiments for the
spread of coronavirus were anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling
of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public revealed a significant feeling of fear
when they discussed the coronavirus new cases and deaths. The study concludes that Twitter continues
to be an essential source for infodemiology study by tracking rapidly evolving public sentiment
and measuring public interests and concerns. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental
health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19
or a new surge of the imminent pandemic. Hearing and reacting to real concerns from the public can
enhance trust between the healthcare systems and the public as well as prepare for a future public
health emergency.
