Recent years have brought great advancement in 2D human pose estimation. However, bottom-up approaches
that do not rely on external detectors to generate person crops, tend to have large model sizes and
intense computational requirements, making them ill-suited for applications where large computation
costs can be prohibitive. Lightweight approaches are exceedingly rare and often come at the price
of massive accuracy loss. In this paper, we present EfficientHRNet, a family of lightweight 2D human
pose estimators that unifies the high-resolution structure of state-of-the-art HigherHRNet
with the highly efficient model scaling principles of EfficientNet to create high accuracy models
with significantly reduced computation costs compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
In addition, we provide a formulation for jointly scaling our backbone EfficientNet below the baseline
B0 and the rest of EfficientHRNet with it. Ultimately, we are able to create a family of highly accurate
and efficient 2D human pose estimators that is flexible enough to provide a lightweight solution
for a variety of application and device requirements. Baseline EfficientHRNet achieves a 0.4%
accuracy improvement when compared to HRNet while having a 34% reduction in floating point operations.
When compared to Lightweight OpenPose, a compressed network designed specifically for lightweight
inference, one EfficientHRNet model outperforms it by over 10% in accuracy while reducing overall
computation by 15%, and another model, while only having 2% higher accuracy than Lightweight OpenPose,
is able to further reduce computational complexity by 63%. At every level, EfficientHRNet proves
to be more computationally efficient than other bottom-up 2D human pose estimation approaches,
while achieving highly competitive accuracy.
