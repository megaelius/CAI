In the context of industrial engineering, it is important to integrate efficient computational
optimization methods in the product development process. Some of the most challenging simulation-based
engineering design optimization problems are characterized by: a large number of design variables,
the absence of analytical gradients, highly non-linear objectives and a limited function evaluation
budget. Although a huge variety of different optimization algorithms is available, the development
and selection of efficient algorithms for problems with these industrial relevant characteristics,
remains a challenge. In this communication, a hybrid variant of Differential Evolution (DE) is
introduced which combines aspects of Stochastic Quasi-Gradient (SQG) methods within the framework
of DE, in order to improve optimization efficiency on problems with the previously mentioned characteristics.
The performance of the resulting derivative-free algorithm is compared with other state-of-the-art
DE variants on 25 commonly used benchmark functions, under tight function evaluation budget constraints
of 1000 evaluations. The experimental results indicate that the new algorithm performs excellent
on the 'difficult' (high dimensional, multi-modal, inseparable) test functions. The operations
used in the proposed mutation scheme, are computationally inexpensive, and can be easily implemented
in existing differential evolution variants or other population-based optimization algorithms
by a few lines of program code as an non-invasive optional setting. Besides the applicability of
the presented algorithm by itself, the described concepts can serve as a useful and interesting
addition to the algorithmic operators in the frameworks of heuristics and evolutionary optimization
and computing.
