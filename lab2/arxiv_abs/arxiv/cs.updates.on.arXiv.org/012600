Approximate string-matching methods to account for complex variation in highly discriminatory
text fields, such as personal names, can enhance probabilistic record linkage. However, discriminating
between matching and non-matching strings is challenging for logographic scripts, where similarities
in pronunciation, appearance, or keystroke sequence are not directly encoded in the string data.
We leverage a large Chinese administrative dataset with known match status to develop logistic
regression and Xgboost classifiers integrating measures of visual, phonetic, and keystroke similarity
to enhance identification of potentially-matching name pairs. We evaluate three methods of leveraging
name similarity scores in large-scale probabilistic record linkage, which can adapt to varying
match prevalence and information in supporting fields: (1) setting a threshold score based on predicted
quality of name-matching across all record pairs; (2) setting a threshold score based on predicted
discriminatory power of the linkage model; and (3) using empirical score distributions among matches
and nonmatches to perform Bayesian adjustment of matching probabilities estimated from exact-agreement
linkage. In experiments on holdout data, as well as data simulated with varying name error rates
and supporting fields, a logistic regression classifier incorporated via the Bayesian method
demonstrated marked improvements over exact-agreement linkage with respect to discriminatory
power, match probability estimation, and accuracy, reducing the total number of misclassified
record pairs by 21% in test data and up to an average of 93% in simulated datasets. Our results demonstrate
the value of incorporating visual, phonetic, and keystroke similarity for logographic name matching,
as well as the promise of our Bayesian approach to leverage name-matching within large-scale record
linkage.
