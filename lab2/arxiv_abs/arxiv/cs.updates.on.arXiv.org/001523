Multi-view data clustering attracts more attention than their single view counterparts due to
the fact that leveraging multiple independent and complementary information from multi-view
feature spaces outperforms the single one. Multi-view Spectral Clustering aims at yielding the
data partition agreement over their local manifold structures by seeking eigenvalue-eigenvector
decompositions. However, as we observed, such classical paradigm still suffers from (1) overlooking
the flexible local manifold structure, caused by (2) enforcing the low-rank data correlation agreement
among all views; worse still, (3) LRR is not intuitively flexible to capture the latent data clustering
structures. In this paper, we present the structured LRR by factorizing into the latent low-dimensional
data-cluster representations, which characterize the data clustering structure for each view.
Upon such representation, (b) the laplacian regularizer is imposed to be capable of preserving
the flexible local manifold structure for each view. (c) We present an iterative multi-view agreement
strategy by minimizing the divergence objective among all factorized latent data-cluster representations
during each iteration of optimization process, where such latent representation from each view
serves to regulate those from other views, such intuitive process iteratively coordinates all
views to be agreeable. (d) We remark that such data-cluster representation can flexibly encode
the data clustering structure from any view with adaptive input cluster number. To this end, (e)
a novel non-convex objective function is proposed via the efficient alternating minimization
strategy. The complexity analysis are also presented. The extensive experiments conducted against
the real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate the superiority over state-of-the-arts.
