Motivated by many practical applications in logistics and mobility-as-a-service, we study the
top-k optimal sequenced routes (KOSR) querying on large, general graphs where the edge weights
may not satisfy the triangle inequality, e.g., road network graphs with travel times as edge weights.
The KOSR querying strives to find the top-k optimal routes (i.e., with the top-k minimal total costs)
from a given source to a given destination, which must visit a number of vertices with specific vertex
categories (e.g., gas stations, restaurants, and shopping malls) in a particular order (e.g.,
visiting gas stations before restaurants and then shopping malls). To efficiently find the top-k
optimal sequenced routes, we propose two algorithms PruningKOSR and StarKOSR. In PruningKOSR,
we define a dominance relationship between two partially-explored routes. The partially-explored
routes that can be dominated by other partially-explored routes are postponed being extended,
which leads to a smaller searching space and thus improves efficiency. In StarKOSR, we further improve
the efficiency by extending routes in an A* manner. With the help of a judiciously designed heuristic
estimation that works for general graphs, the cost of partially explored routes to the destination
can be estimated such that the qualified complete routes can be found early. In addition, we demonstrate
the high extensibility of the proposed algorithms by incorporating Hop Labeling, an effective
label indexing technique for shortest path queries, to further improve efficiency. Extensive
experiments on multiple real-world graphs demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly
outperform the baseline method. Furthermore, when k=1, StarKOSR also outperforms the state-of-the-art
method for the optimal sequenced route queries.
