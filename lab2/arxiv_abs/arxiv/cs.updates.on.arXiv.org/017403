With the advent of autonomous driving technologies, traffic control at intersections is expected
to experience revolutionary changes. Various novel intersection control methods have been proposed
in the existing literature, and they can be roughly divided into two categories: vehicle-based
traffic control and phase-based traffic control. Phase-based traffic control can be treated as
updated versions of the current intersection signal control with the incorporation of the performance
of autonomous vehicle functions. Meanwhile, vehicle-based traffic control utilizes some brand-new
methods, mostly in real-time fashion, to organize traffic at intersections for safe and efficient
vehicle passages. However, to date, no systematic comparison between these two control categories
has been performed to suggest their advantages and disadvantages. This paper conducts a series
of numerical simulations under various traffic scenarios to perform a fair comparison of their
performances. Specifically, we allow trajectory adjustments of incoming vehicles under phasebased
traffic control, while for its vehicle-based counterpart, we implement two strategies, i.e.,
the first-come-first-serve strategy and the conflict-point based rolling-horizon optimization
strategy. Overall, the simulation results show that vehicle-based traffic control generally
incurs a negligible delay when traffic demand is low but lead to an excessive queuing time as the traffic
volume becomes high. However, performance of vehicle-based traffic control may benefit from reduction
in conflicting vehicle pairs. We also discovered that when autonomous driving technologies are
not mature, the advantages of phase-based traffic control are much more distinct.
