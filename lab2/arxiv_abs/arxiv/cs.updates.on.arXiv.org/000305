Shamir's (n,k) threshold secret sharing is an important component of several cryptographic protocols.
These protocols typically assume the presence of direct communication links from the dealer to
all participants, in which case the dealer can directly pass the shares of the secret to each participant.
In this paper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have direct communication
links to all the participants, and instead, the dealer and the participants form a general network.
We present an efficient and distributed algorithm, which we call the SNEAK algorithm, for secret
sharing over general networks that satisfy what we call the k-propagating-dealer condition. We
also derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the communication complexity of secret sharing
over any network, under any algorithm, which may be of independent interest. We show that for networks
satisfying the k-propagating-dealer condition, the communication complexity of the SNEAK algorithm
is Theta(n), and furthermore, is within a constant factor of the lower bound. In contrast, the current
state-of-the-art solution entails a communication-complexity that is super-linear in n for a
wide class of networks, and is Theta(n^2) in the worst case. Moreover, the amount of randomness required
under the SNEAK algorithm is a constant, while that under the current state-of-the-art increases
with n for a large class of networks, and is Theta(n) when the degree of the dealer is bounded. Finally,
while the current state-of-the-art solution requires considerable coordination in the network
and knowledge of the global topology, the SNEAK algorithm is completely distributed and requires
each node to know only the identities of its one-hop neighbours. Our algorithm thus allows for efficient
generalization of several cryptographic protocols to a large class of general networks in a distributed
way.
