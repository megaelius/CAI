To properly assess the impact of (cooperative) adaptive cruise control ACC (CACC), one has to model
vehicle dynamics. First of all, one has to choose the car following model, as it determines the vehicle
flow as vehicles accelerate from standstill or decelerate because of the obstacle ahead. The other
factor significantly affecting the intersection throughput is the maximal vehicle acceleration
rate. In this paper, we analyze three car following behaviors: Gipps model, Improved Intelligent
Driver Model (IIDM) and Helly model. Gipps model exhibits rather aggressive acceleration behavior.
If used for the intersection throughput estimation, this model would lead to overly optimistic
results. Helly model is convenient to analyze due to its linear nature, but its deceleration behavior
in the presence of obstacles ahead is unrealistically abrupt. Showing the most realistic acceleration
and deceleration behavior of the three models, IIDM is suited for ACC/CACC impact evaluation better
than the other two. We discuss the influence of the maximal vehicle acceleration rate and presence
of different portions of ACC/CACC vehicles on intersection throughput in the context of the three
car following models. The analysis is done for two cases: (1) free road downstream of the intersection;
and (2) red light at some distance downstream of the intersection. Finally, we introduce the platoon
model and evaluate ACC and CACC with platooning in terms of travel time ad network throughput using
SUMO simulation of the 4-mile stretch of Colorado Boulevard / Huntington Drive arterial with 13
signalized intersections in Arcadia, Southern California.
