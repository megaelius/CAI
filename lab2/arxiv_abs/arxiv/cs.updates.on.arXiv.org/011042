The performance of imitation learning is typically upper-bounded by the performance of the demonstrator.
While recent empirical results demonstrate that ranked demonstrations allow for better-than-demonstrator
performance, preferences over demonstrations may be difficult to obtain, and little is known theoretically
about when such methods can be expected to successfully extrapolate beyond the performance of the
demonstrator. To address these issues, we first contribute a sufficient condition for better-than-demonstrator
imitation learning and provide theoretical results showing why preferences over demonstrations
can better reduce reward function ambiguity when performing inverse reinforcement learning.
Building on this theory, we introduce Disturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based
imitation learning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral cloning
to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked demonstrations are used to efficiently
learn a reward function that can then be optimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically
validate our approach on simulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that
D-REX outperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly surpass the performance
of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation learning approach to achieve significant extrapolation
beyond the demonstrator's performance without additional side-information or supervision,
such as rewards or human preferences. By generating rankings automatically, we show that preference-based
inverse reinforcement learning can be applied in traditional imitation learning settings where
only unlabeled demonstrations are available.
