This work is aimed at studying realistic social control strategies for social networks based on
the introduction of random information into the state of selected driver agents. Deliberately
exposing selected agents to random information is a technique already experimented in recommender
systems or search engines, and represents one of the few options for influencing the behavior of
a social context that could be accepted as ethical, could be fully disclosed to members, and does
not involve the use of force or of deception. Our research is based on a model of knowledge diffusion
applied to a time-varying adaptive network, and considers two well-known strategies for influencing
social contexts. One is the selection of few influencers for manipulating their actions in order
to drive the whole network to a certain behavior; the other, instead, drives the network behavior
acting on the state of a large subset of ordinary, scarcely influencing users. The two approaches
have been studied in terms of network and diffusion effects. The network effect is analyzed through
the changes induced on network average degree and clustering coefficient, while the diffusion
effect is based on two ad-hoc metrics defined to measure the degree of knowledge diffusion and skill
level, as well as the polarization of agent interests. The results, obtained through simulations
on synthetic networks, show a rich dynamics and strong effects on the communication structure and
on the distribution of knowledge and skills, supporting our hypothesis that the strategic use of
random information could represent a realistic approach to social network controllability, and
that with both strategies, in principle, the control effect could be remarkable.
