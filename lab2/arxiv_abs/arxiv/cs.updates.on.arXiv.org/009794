Model compression has emerged as an important area of research for deploying deep learning models
on Internet-of-Things (IoT). However, for extremely memory-constrained scenarios, even the
compressed models cannot fit within the memory of a single device and, as a result, must be distributed
across multiple devices. This leads to a distributed inference paradigm in which memory and communication
costs represent a major bottleneck. Yet, existing model compression techniques are not communication-aware.
Therefore, we propose Network of Neural Networks (NoNN), a new distributed IoT learning paradigm
that compresses a large pretrained 'teacher' deep network into several disjoint and highly-compressed
'student' modules, without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we propose a network science-based knowledge
partitioning algorithm for the teacher model, and then train individual students on the resulting
disjoint partitions. Extensive experimentation on five image classification datasets, for user-defined
memory/performance budgets, show that NoNN achieves higher accuracy than several baselines and
similar accuracy as the teacher model, while using minimal communication among students. Finally,
as a case study, we deploy the proposed model for CIFAR-10 dataset on edge devices and demonstrate
significant improvements in memory footprint (up to 24x), performance (up to 12x), and energy per
node (up to 14x) compared to the large teacher model. We further show that for distributed inference
on multiple edge devices, our proposed NoNN model results in up to 33x reduction in total latency
w.r.t. a state-of-the-art model compression baseline.
