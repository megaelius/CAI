Objectives; The accumulation and usefulness of clinical data have increased with IT development.
While using clinical data that needs to be identifiable to obtain meaningful information, it is
essential to ensure that data is de-identified and unnecessary clinical information is minimized
to protect personal information. This process requires criteria and an appropriate method as there
are clear identifiers as well as quasi-identifiers that are not readily identifiable. Methods;
To formulate such a method, first, primary quasi-identifiers were selected by classifying information
in 20 clinical personal information database tables into Direct-Identifier (DID), Quasi-Identifier
(QI), Sensitive Attribute (SA), and Non-Sensitive Attribute (NSA) according to its type. Secondary
QIs were then selected by assessing the risk for outliers by measuring uniqueness values of the selected
data and scoring re-identification by calculating equivalence class of the influence on other
data on QI removal. Third, the risk of re-identification of data users was numeralized and classified.
Lastly, the final QI according to user class was determined by comparing the calculated re-identification
scores to the threshold values of user classes. Results; Eventually, final QIs ranging from a minimum
of 18 to a maximum of 28 were selected by making an assumption about user classes and using it as criteria.
Conclusions; The QI selection method presented by the current investigators can be used by researchers
at the final checkup stage before they de-identify the selected QIs. Therefore, clinical data users
can securely and efficiently use clinical data containing personal information by objectively
selecting QIs using the method proposed in the present study.
