There is great potential to be explored regarding the use of agent-based modelling and simulation
as an alternative paradigm to investigate early-stage cancer interactions with the immune system.
It does not suffer from some limitations of ordinary differential equation models, such as the lack
of stochasticity, representation of individual behaviours rather than aggregates and individual
memory. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution of agent-based modelling and simulation
when contrasted with stochastic versions of ODE models using early-stage cancer examples. We seek
answers to the following questions: (1) Does this new stochastic formulation produce similar results
to the agent-based version? (2) Can these methods be used interchangeably? (3) Do agent-based models
outcomes reveal any benefit when compared to the Gillespie results? To answer these research questions
we investigate three well-established mathematical models describing interactions between
tumour cells and immune elements. These case studies were re-conceptualised under an agent-based
perspective and also converted to the Gillespie algorithm formulation. Our interest in this work,
therefore, is to establish a methodological discussion regarding the usability of different simulation
approaches, rather than provide further biological insights into the investigated case studies.
Our results show that it is possible to obtain equivalent models that implement the same mechanisms;
however, the incapacity of the Gillespie algorithm to retain individual memory of past events affects
the similarity of some results. Furthermore, the emergent behaviour of ABMS produces extra patters
of behaviour in the system, which was not obtained by the Gillespie algorithm.
