Accurately tracking and predicting behaviors of surrounding objects are key prerequisites for
intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles to achieve safe and high-quality decision making
and motion planning. However, there still remain challenges for multi-target tracking due to object
number fluctuation and occlusion. To overcome these challenges, we propose a constrained mixture
sequential Monte Carlo (CMSMC) method in which a mixture representation is incorporated in the
estimated posterior distribution to maintain multi-modality. Multiple targets can be tracked
simultaneously within a unified framework without explicit data association between observations
and tracking targets. The framework can incorporate an arbitrary prediction model as the implicit
proposal distribution of the CMSMC method. An example in this paper is a learning-based model for
hierarchical time-series prediction, which consists of a behavior recognition module and a state
evolution module. Both modules in the proposed model are generic and flexible so as to be applied
to a class of time-series prediction problems where behaviors can be separated into different levels.
Finally, the proposed framework is applied to a numerical case study as well as a task of on-road vehicle
tracking, behavior recognition, and prediction in highway scenarios. Instead of only focusing
on forecasting trajectory of a single entity, we jointly predict continuous motions for interactive
entities simultaneously. The proposed approaches are evaluated from multiple aspects, which
demonstrate great potential for intelligent vehicular systems and traffic surveillance systems.
