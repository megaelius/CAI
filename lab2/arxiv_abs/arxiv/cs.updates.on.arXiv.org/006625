Sample preparation is an indispensable component of almost all biochemical protocols, and it involves,
among others, making dilutions and mixtures of fluids in certain ratios. Recent microfluidic technologies
offer suitable platforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital microfluidic
biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is performed on fluid droplets to achieve
the target concentration factor (CF) of a sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing
of two unit-volume droplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume daughter-droplets.
However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is due to unbalanced splitting, where two
unequal-volume droplets are produced following a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring
in different mix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the target-CF
of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in life-critical assays. In order to
circumvent this problem, several error-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed
recently for DMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the dynamics
of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed. In this work, we investigate the effect
of multiple volumetric split-errors on various target-CFs during sample preparation. We also
perform a detailed analysis of the worst-case scenario, i.e., the condition when the error in a target-CF
is maximized. This analysis may lead to the development of new techniques for error-tolerant sample
preparation with DMFBs without using any sensing operation.
