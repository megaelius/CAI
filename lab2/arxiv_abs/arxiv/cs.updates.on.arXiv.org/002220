Accelerating the data acquisition of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) leads to a challenging
ill-posed inverse problem, which has received great interest from both the signal processing and
machine learning community over the last decades. The key ingredient to the problem is how to exploit
the temporal correlation of the MR sequence to resolve the aliasing artefact. Traditionally, such
observation led to a formulation of a non-convex optimisation problem, which were solved using
iterative algorithms. Recently, however, deep learning based-approaches have gained significant
popularity due to its ability to solve general inversion problems. In this work, we propose a unique,
novel convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture which reconstructs high quality
cardiac MR images from highly undersampled k-space data by jointly exploiting the dependencies
of the temporal sequences as well as the iterative nature of the traditional optimisation algorithms.
In particular, the proposed architecture embeds the structure of the traditional iterative algorithms,
efficiently modelling the recurrence of the iterative reconstruction stages by using recurrent
hidden connections over such iterations. In addition, spatiotemporal dependencies are simultaneously
learnt by exploiting bidirectional recurrent hidden connections across time sequences. The proposed
algorithm is able to learn both the temporal dependency and the iterative reconstruction process
effectively with only a very small number of parameters, while outperforming current MR reconstruction
methods in terms of computational complexity, reconstruction accuracy and speed.
