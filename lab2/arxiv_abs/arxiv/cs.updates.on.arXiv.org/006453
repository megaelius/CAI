We describe approximation algorithms in Linial's classic LOCAL model to find maximum-weight matchings
in a hypergraph of rank $r$. Our main result is a deterministic algorithm to generate a matching which
which is an $O(r)$-approximation to the maximum weight matching, running in $\tilde O(r \log \Delta
+ \log^3 \Delta + \log^* n)$ rounds. This is based on a new method for derandomizing LOCAL graph algorithms,
which extends a method of Ghaffari, Harris \& Kuhn (2017) to allow simulation of an alteration-based
probabilistic construction and to allow non-proper vertex colorings. This has two main algorithmic
consequences. First, it gives nearly-optimal deterministic and randomized algorithms for the
long-studied problem of maximum-weight graph matching. Specifically, we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$
approximation algorithm running in $\tilde O(\frac{\log \Delta}{\epsilon^3} + \text{polylog}(1/\epsilon,
\log \log n))$ randomized time and $\tilde O(\frac{\log^3 \Delta}{\epsilon^5} + \frac{\log^*
n}{\epsilon})$ deterministic time. These are significantly faster than prior $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithms; furthermore, there are no constraints on the size of the edge weights. Second, we get
a faster algorithm for hypergraph maximal matching. This is a versatile subroutine, introduced
in Ghaffari et al. (2017) for a variety of LOCAL algorithms; for example, it gives an algorithm for
$(2 \Delta - 1)$-edge-list coloring in $\tilde O(\log^3 \Delta \log n)$ rounds deterministically
or $\tilde O( (\log \log n)^4 )$ rounds randomly. Another consequence (with some additional optimizations)
is an algorithm which takes an arboricity-$\lambda$ graph and generates an edge-orientation with
out-degree at most $\lceil (1+\epsilon) \lambda \rceil$; for fixed $\epsilon > 0$ this runs in $\tilde
O(\log^7 n \log^3 \lambda)$ rounds deterministically or $\tilde O(\log^3 n )$ rounds randomly.
