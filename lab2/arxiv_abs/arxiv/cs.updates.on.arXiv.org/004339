In this paper, we propose a new paradigm in designing and realizing energy efficient wireless indoor
access networks, namely, a hybrid system enabled by traditional RF access, such as WiFi, as well
as the emerging visible light communication (VLC). VLC facilitates the great advantage of being
able to jointly perform illumination and communications, and little extra power beyond illumination
is required to empower communications, thus rendering wireless access with almost zero power consumption.
On the other hand, when illumination is not required from the light source, the energy consumed by
VLC could be more than that consumed by the RF. By capitalizing on the above properties, the proposed
hybrid RF-VLC system is more energy efficient and more adaptive to the illumination conditions
than the individual VLC or RF systems. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed system, we first
formulate the problem of minimizing the power consumption of the hybrid RF-VLC system while satisfying
the users requests and maintaining acceptable level of illumination, which is NP-complete. Therefore,
we divide the problem into two subproblems. In the first subproblems, we determine the set of VLC
access points (AP) that needs to be turned on to satisfy the illumination requirements. Given this
set, we turn our attention to satisfying the users' requests for real-time communications, and
we propose a randomized online algorithm that, against an oblivious adversary, achieves a competitive
ratio of $\log(N)\log(M)$ with probability of success $1 - \frac{1}{N}$, where $N$ is the number
of users and $M$ is the number of VLC and RF APs. We also show that the best online algorithm to solve
this problem can achieve a competitive ratio of $\log(M)$. Simulation results further demonstrate
the advantages of the hybrid system.
