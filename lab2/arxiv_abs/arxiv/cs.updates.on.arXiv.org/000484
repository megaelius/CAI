Research in life sciences is increasingly being conducted in a digital and online environment.
In particular, life scientists have been pioneers in embracing new computational tools to conduct
their investigations. To support the sharing of digital objects produced during such research
investigations, we have witnessed in the last few years the emergence of specialized repositories,
e.g., DataVerse and FigShare. Such repositories provide users with the means to share and publish
datasets that were used or generated in research investigations. While these repositories have
proven their usefulness, interpreting and reusing evidence for most research results is a challenging
task. Additional contextual descriptions are needed to understand how those results were generated
and/or the circumstances under which they were concluded. Because of this, scientists are calling
for models that go beyond the publication of datasets to systematically capture the life cycle of
scientific investigations and provide a single entry point to access the information about the
hypothesis investigated, the datasets used, the experiments carried out, the results of the experiments,
the people involved in the research, etc. In this paper we present the Research Object (RO) suite
of ontologies, which provide a structured container to encapsulate research data and methods along
with essential metadata descriptions. Research Objects are portable units that enable the sharing,
preservation, interpretation and reuse of research investigation results. The ontologies we
present have been designed in the light of requirements that we gathered from life scientists. They
have been built upon existing popular vocabularies to facilitate interoperability. Furthermore,
we have developed tools to support the creation and sharing of Research Objects, thereby promoting
and facilitating their adoption.
