This chapter presents the investigations and the results of feature learning using convolutional
neural networks to automatically assess knee osteoarthritis (OA) severity and the associated
clinical and diagnostic features of knee OA from X-ray images. Also, this chapter demonstrates
that feature learning in a supervised manner is more effective than using conventional handcrafted
features for automatic detection of knee joints and fine-grained knee OA image classification.
In the general machine learning approach to automatically assess knee OA severity, the first step
is to localize the region of interest that is to detect and extract the knee joint regions from the
radiographs, and the next step is to classify the localized knee joints based on a radiographic classification
scheme such as Kellgren and Lawrence grades. First, the existing approaches for detecting (or localizing)
the knee joint regions based on handcrafted features are reviewed and outlined. Next, three new
approaches are introduced: 1) to automatically detect the knee joint region using a fully convolutional
network, 2) to automatically assess the radiographic knee OA using CNNs trained from scratch for
classification and regression of knee joint images to predict KL grades in ordinal and continuous
scales, and 3) to quantify the knee OA severity optimizing a weighted ratio of two loss functions:
categorical cross entropy and mean-squared error using multi-objective convolutional learning
and ordinal regression. Two public datasets: the OAI and the MOST are used to evaluate the approaches
with promising results that outperform existing approaches. In summary, this work primarily contributes
to the field of automated methods for localization (automatic detection) and quantification (image
classification) of radiographic knee OA.
