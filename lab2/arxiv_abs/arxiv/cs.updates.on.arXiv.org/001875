Privacy-preserving data release mechanisms aim to simultaneously minimize information-leakage
with respect to sensitive data and distortion with respect to useful data. Dependencies between
sensitive and useful data results in a privacy-utility tradeoff that has strong connections to
generalized rate-distortion problems. In this work, we study how the optimal privacy-utility
tradeoff region is affected by constraints on the data that is directly available as input to the
release mechanism. In particular, we consider the availability of only sensitive data, only useful
data, and both (full data). We show that a general hierarchy holds: the tradeoff region given only
the sensitive data is no larger than the region given only the useful data, which in turn is clearly
no larger than the region given both sensitive and useful data. In addition, we determine conditions
under which the tradeoff region given only the useful data coincides with that given full data. These
are based on the common information between the sensitive and useful data. We establish these results
for general families of privacy and utility measures that satisfy certain natural properties required
of any reasonable measure of privacy or utility. We also uncover a new, subtler aspect of the data
processing inequality for general non-symmetric privacy measures and discuss its operational
relevance and implications. Finally, we derive exact closed-analytic-form expressions for the
privacy-utility tradeoffs for symmetrically dependent sensitive and useful data under mutual
information and Hamming distortion as the respective privacy and utility measures.
