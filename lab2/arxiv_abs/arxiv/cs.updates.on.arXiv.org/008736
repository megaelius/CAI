The Gene or DNA sequence in every cell does not control genetic properties on its own; Rather, this
is done through translation of DNA into protein and subsequent formation of a certain 3D structure.
The biological function of a protein is tightly connected to its specific 3D structure. Prediction
of the protein secondary structure is a crucial intermediate step towards elucidating its 3D structure
and function. Traditional experimental methods for prediction of protein structure are expensive
and time-consuming. Therefore, various machine learning approaches have been proposed to predict
the protein secondary structure. Nevertheless, the average accuracy of the suggested solutions
has hardly reached beyond 80%. The possible underlying reasons are the ambiguous sequence-structure
relation, noise in input protein data, class imbalance, and the high dimensionality of the encoding
schemes that represent the protein sequence. In this paper, we propose an accurate multi-component
prediction machine to overcome the challenges of protein structure prediction. We devise a multi-component
designation to address the high complexity challenge in sequence-structure relation. Furthermore,
we utilize a compound string dissimilarity measure to directly interpret protein sequence content
and avoid information loss. In order to improve the accuracy, we employ two different classifiers
including support vector machine and fuzzy nearest neighbor and collectively aggregate the classification
outcomes to infer the final protein secondary structures. We conduct comprehensive experiments
to compare our model with the current state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results demonstrate
that given a set of input sequences, our multi-component framework can accurately predict the protein
structure. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of our unified model an be further enhanced through
framework configuration.
