In 2005 Kumar studied the Restricted Disjunctive Temporal Problem (RDTP), a restricted but very
expressive class of disjunctive temporal problems (DTPs). It was shown that that RDTPs are solvable
in deterministic strongly-polynomial time by reducing them to the Connected Row-Convex (CRC)
constraints problem; plus, Kumar devised a randomized algorithm whose expected running time is
less than that of the deterministic one. Instead, the most general form of DTPs allows for multi-variable
disjunctions of many interval constraints and it is NP-complete. This work offers a deeper comprehension
on the tractability of RDTPs, leading to an elementary deterministic strongly-polynomial time
algorithm for them, significantly improving the asymptotic running times of both the deterministic
and randomized algorithms of Kumar. The result is obtained by reducing RDTPs to the Single-Source
Shortest-Paths (SSSP) and the 2-SAT problem (jointly), instead of reducing to CRCs. In passing,
we obtain a faster (quadratic-time) algorithm for RDTPs having only Type-1 and Type-2 constraints
(and no Type-3 constraint). As a second main contribution, we study the tractability frontier of
solving RDTPs by considering Hyper Temporal Networks (\HTNs), a strict generalization of \STNs
grounded on hypergraphs: on one side, we prove that solving temporal problems having only Type-2
constraints and either only multi-tail or only multi-head hyperarc constraints lies in both NP
and co-NP and it admits deterministic pseudo-polynomial time algorithms; on the other side, solving
problems with Type-3 constraints and either only multi-tail or only multi-head hyperarc constraints
turns strongly NP-complete.
