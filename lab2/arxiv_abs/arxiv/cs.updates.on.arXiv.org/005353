For online resource allocation problems, we propose a new demand arrival model where the sequence
of arrivals contains both an adversarial component and a stochastic one. Our model requires no demand
forecasting; however, due to the presence of the stochastic component, we can partially predict
future demand as the sequence of arrivals unfolds. Under the proposed model, we study the problem
of the online allocation of a single resource to two types of customers, and design online algorithms
that outperform existing ones. Our algorithms are adjustable to the relative size of the stochastic
component, and our analysis reveals that as the portion of the stochastic component grows, the loss
due to making online decisions decreases. This highlights the value of (even partial) predictability
in online resource allocation. We impose no conditions on how the resource capacity scales with
the maximum number of customers. However, we show that using an adaptive algorithm---which makes
online decisions based on observed data---is particularly beneficial when capacity scales linearly
with the number of customers. Our work serves as a first step in bridging the long-standing gap between
the two well-studied approaches to the design and analysis of online algorithms based on (1) adversarial
models and (2) stochastic ones. Using novel algorithm design, we demonstrate that even if the arrival
sequence contains an adversarial component, we can take advantage of the limited information that
the data reveals to improve allocation decisions. We also study the classical secretary problem
under our proposed arrival model, and we show that randomizing over multiple stopping rules may
increase the probability of success.
