Prediction of future movement of stock prices has always been a challenging task for the researchers.
While the advocates of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) believe that it is impossible to design
any predictive framework that can accurately predict the movement of stock prices, there are seminal
work in the literature that have clearly demonstrated that the seemingly random movement patterns
in the time series of a stock price can be predicted with a high level of accuracy. Design of such predictive
models requires choice of appropriate variables, right transformation methods of the variables,
and tuning of the parameters of the models. In this work, we present a very robust and accurate framework
of stock price prediction that consists of an agglomeration of statistical, machine learning and
deep learning models. We use the daily stock price data, collected at five minutes interval of time,
of a very well known company that is listed in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The granular
data is aggregated into three slots in a day, and the aggregated data is used for building and training
the forecasting models. We contend that the agglomerative approach of model building that uses
a combination of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning approaches, can very effectively
learn from the volatile and random movement patterns in a stock price data. We build eight classification
and eight regression models based on statistical and machine learning approaches. In addition
to these models, a deep learning regression model using a long-and-short-term memory (LSTM) network
is also built. Extensive results have been presented on the performance of these models, and the
results are critically analyzed.
