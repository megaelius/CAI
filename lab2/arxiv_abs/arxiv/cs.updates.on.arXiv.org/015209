Recent works have shown that the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$-gains are natural performance criteria for
linear positive systems as they can be characterized using linear programs. Those performance
measures have also been extended to linear positive impulsive and switched systems through the
concept of hybrid $L_1\times\ell_1$-gain. For LTI positive systems, the $L_\infty$-gain is known
to coincide with the $L_1$-gain of the transposed system and, as a consequence, one can use linear
copositive Lyapunov functions for characterizing the $L_\infty$-gain of LTI positive systems.
Unfortunately, this does not hold in the time-varying setting and one cannot characterize the hybrid
$L_\infty\times\ell_\infty$-gain of a linear positive impulsive system in terms of the hybrid
$L_1\times\ell_1$-gain of the transposed system. An alternative approach based on the use of linear
copositive max-separable Lyapunov functions is proposed. We first prove very general necessary
and sufficient conditions characterizing the exponential stability and the $L_\infty\times\ell_\infty$-
and $L_1\times\ell_1$-gains using linear max-separable copositive and linear sum-separable
copositive Lyapunov functions. Results characterizing the stability and the hybrid $L_\infty\times\ell_\infty$-gain
of linear positive impulsive systems under arbitrary, constant, minimum, and range dwell-time
constraints are then derived from the previously obtained general results. These conditions are
then exploited to yield constructive convex stabilization conditions via state-feedback. By
reformulating linear positive switched systems as impulsive systems with multiple jump maps,
stability and stabilization conditions are also obtained for linear positive switched systems.
It is notably proven that the obtained conditions generalize existing ones of the literature.
