Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can provide mechanical support for a failing heart as bridge
to transplant and destination therapy. Physiological control systems for LVADs should be designed
to respond to changes in hemodynamic across a variety of clinical scenarios and patients by automatically
adjusting the heart pump speed. In this study, a novel adaptive physiological control system for
an implantable heart pump was developed to respond to interpatient and intrapatient variations
to maintain the left-ventricle-end-diastolic-pressure (LVEDP) in the normal range of 3 to 15 mmHg
to prevent ventricle suction and pulmonary congestion. A new algorithm was also developed to detect
LVEDP from pressure sensor measurement in real-time mode. Model free adaptive control (MFAC) was
employed to control the pump speed via simulation of 100 different patient conditions in each of
six different patient scenarios, and compared to standard PID control. Controller performance
was tracked using the sum of the absolute error (SAE) between the desired and measured LVEDP. The
lower SAE on control tracking performance means the measured LVEDP follows the desired LVEDP faster
and with less amplitude oscillations preventing ventricle suction and pulmonary congestion (mean
and standard deviation of SAE(mmHg) for all 600 simulations were 18813+-29345 and 24794+-28380
corresponding to MFAC and PID controller respectively). In four out of six patient scenarios, MFAC
control tracking performance was better than the PID controller. This study shows the control performance
can be guaranteed across different patients and conditions when using MFAC over PID control, which
is a step towards clinical acceptance of these systems.
