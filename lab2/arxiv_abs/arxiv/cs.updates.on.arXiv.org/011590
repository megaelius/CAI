Graph spanners are sparse subgraphs which approximately preserve all pairwise shortest-path
distances in an input graph. The notion of approximation can be additive, multiplicative, or both,
and many variants of this problem have been extensively studied. We study the problem of computing
a graph spanner when the edges of the input graph are distributed across two or more sites in an arbitrary,
possibly worst-case partition, and the goal is for the sites to minimize the communication used
to output a spanner. We assume the message-passing model of communication, for which there is a point-to-point
link between all pairs of sites as well as a coordinator who is responsible for producing the output.
We stress that the subset of edges that each site has is not related to the network topology, which
is fixed to be point-to-point. While this model has been extensively studied for related problems
such as graph connectivity, it has not been systematically studied for graph spanners. We present
the first tradeoffs for total communication versus the quality of the spanners computed, for two
or more sites, as well as for additive and multiplicative notions of distortion. We show separations
in the communication complexity when edges are allowed to occur on multiple sites, versus when each
edge occurs on at most one site. We obtain nearly tight bounds (up to polylog factors) for the communication
of additive $2$-spanners in both the with and without duplication models, multiplicative $(2k-1)$-spanners
in the with duplication model, and multiplicative $3$ and $5$-spanners in the without duplication
model. Our lower bound for multiplicative $3$-spanners employs biregular bipartite graphs rather
than the usual Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture graphs and may be of wider interest.
