We study the problem of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) in the presence of prior side information.
The problem setup includes a database of $K$ independent messages possibly replicated on several
servers, and a user that needs to retrieve one of these messages. In addition, the user has some prior
side information in the form of a subset of $M$ messages, not containing the desired message and unknown
to the servers. This problem is motivated by practical settings in which the user can obtain side
information opportunistically from other users or has previously downloaded some messages using
classical PIR schemes. The objective of the user is to retrieve the required message without revealing
its identity while minimizing the amount of data downloaded from the servers. We focus on achieving
information-theoretic privacy in two scenarios: (i) the user wants to protect jointly its demand
and side information; (ii) the user wants to protect only the information about its demand, but not
the side information. To highlight the role of side information, we focus first on the case of a single
server (single database). In the first scenario, we prove that the minimum download cost is $K-M$
messages, and in the second scenario it is $\lceil \frac{K}{M+1}\rceil$ messages, which should
be compared to $K$ messages, the minimum download cost in the case of no side information. Then, we
extend some of our results to the case of the database replicated on multiple servers. Our proof techniques
relate PIR with side information to the index coding problem. We leverage this connection to prove
converse results, as well as to design achievability schemes.
