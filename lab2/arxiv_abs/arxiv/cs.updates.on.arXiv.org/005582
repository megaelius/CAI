A time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an integrate-and-fire-type
spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks,
in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed in each
layer and summation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation.
We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike
the conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use
transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can
be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption.
However, they have to use very high resistance devices on the order of G$\rm \Omega$. We designed
a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights
and evaluated it by post-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology. High
resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors.
Simulation results showed that energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 290~TOPS/W,
more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even
though the minimum width of interconnection used in the PoC chip was several times larger than that
in such digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is used to implement the proposed
model, an energy efficiency of more than 1,000~TOPS/W will be possible. For practical applications,
development of emerging analog memory devices such as ferroelectric-gate FETs is necessary.
