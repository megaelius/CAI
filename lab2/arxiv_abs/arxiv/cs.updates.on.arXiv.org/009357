The general problem of "information foraging" in an environment about which agents have incomplete
information has been explored in many fields, including cognitive psychology, neuroscience,
economics, finance, ecology, and computer science. In all of these areas, the searcher aims to enhance
future performance by surveying enough of existing knowledge to orient themselves in the information
space. Individuals can be viewed as conducting a cognitive search in which they must balance exploration
of ideas that are novel to them against exploitation of knowledge in domains in which they are already
expert. In this dissertation, I present several case studies that demonstrate how reading and writing
behaviors interact to construct personal knowledge bases. These studies use LDA topic modeling
to represent the information environment of the texts each author read and wrote. Three studies
revolve around Charles Darwin. Darwin left detailed records of every book he read for 23 years, from
disembarking from the H.M.S. Beagle to just after publication of The Origin of Species. Additionally,
he left copies of his drafts before publication. I characterize his reading behavior, then show
how that reading behavior interacted with the drafts and subsequent revisions of The Origin of Species,
and expand the dataset to include later readings and writings. Then, through a study of Thomas Jefferson's
correspondence, I expand the study to non-book data. Finally, through an examination of neuroscience
citation data, I move from individual behavior to collective behavior in constructing an information
environment. Together, these studies reveal "the interplay between individual and collective
phenomena where innovation takes place" (Tria et al. 2014).
