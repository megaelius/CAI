This study proposes an efficient neural network with convolutional layers to classify significantly
class-imbalanced clinical data. The data are curated from the National Health and Nutritional
Examination Survey (NHANES) with the goal of predicting the occurrence of Coronary Heart Disease
(CHD). While the majority of the existing machine learning models that have been used on this class
of data are vulnerable to class imbalance even after the adjustment of class-specific weights,
our simple two-layer CNN exhibits resilience to the imbalance with fair harmony in class-specific
performance. In order to obtain significant improvement in classification accuracy under supervised
learning settings, it is a common practice to train a neural network architecture with a massive
data and thereafter, test the resulting network on a comparatively smaller amount of data. However,
given a highly imbalanced dataset, it is often challenging to achieve a high class 1 (true CHD prediction
rate) accuracy as the testing data size increases. We adopt a two-step approach: first, we employ
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based feature weight assessment followed
by majority-voting based identification of important features. Next, the important features
are homogenized by using a fully connected layer, a crucial step before passing the output of the
layer to successive convolutional stages. We also propose a training routine per epoch, akin to
a simulated annealing process, to boost the classification accuracy. Despite a 35:1 (Non-CHD:CHD)
ratio in the NHANES dataset, the investigation confirms that our proposed CNN architecture has
the classification power of 77% to correctly classify the presence of CHD and 81.8% the absence of
CHD cases on a testing data, which is 85.70% of the total dataset. ( (<1920 characters)Please check
