The fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approach is a powerful tool in tackling computationally hard
problems. In this paper, we link FPT results to classic artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
to show how they complement each other. Specifically, we consider the workflow satisfiability
problem (WSP) which asks whether there exists an assignment of authorised users to the steps in a
workflow specification, subject to certain constraints on the assignment. It was shown by Cohen
et al. (JAIR 2014) that WSP restricted to the class of user-independent constraints (UI), covering
many practical cases, admits FPT algorithms, i.e. can be solved in time exponential only in the number
of steps $k$ and polynomial in the number of users $n$. Since usually $k \ll n$ in WSP, such FPT algorithms
are of great practical interest as they significantly extend the size of the problem that can be routinely
solved. We give a new view of the FPT nature of the WSP with UI constraints, showing that it decomposes
the problem into two levels. Exploiting this two-level split, we develop a new FPT algorithm that
is by many orders of magnitude faster than the previous state-of-the-art WSP algorithm; and it also
has only polynomial space complexity whereas the old algorithm takes memory exponential in $k$,
which limits its application. We also provide a new pseudo-boolean (PB) formulation of the WSP with
UI constraints which exploits this new decomposition of the problem into two levels. Our experiments
show that efficiency of solving this new PB formulation of the problem by a general purpose PB solver
can be close to the bespoke FPT algorithm, which raises the potential of using general purpose solvers
to tackle FPT problems efficiently. We also study the computational performance of various algorithms
to complement the overly-pessimistic worst-case analysis that is usually done in FPT studies.
