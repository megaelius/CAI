Adversarial attacks of deep neural networks have been intensively studied on image, audio, natural
language, patch, and pixel classification tasks. Nevertheless, as a typical, while important
real-world application, the adversarial attacks of online video object tracking that traces an
object's moving trajectory instead of its category are rarely explored. In this paper, we identify
a new task for the adversarial attack to visual object tracking: online generating imperceptible
perturbations that mislead trackers along an incorrect (Untargeted Attack, UA) or specified trajectory
(Targeted Attack, TA). To this end, we first propose a spatial-aware basic attack by adapting existing
attack methods, i.e., FGSM, BIM, and C\&W, and comprehensively analyze the attacking performance.
We identify that online object tracking poses two new challenges: 1) it is difficult to generate
imperceptible perturbations that can transfer across time/frames, and 2) real-time trackers
require the attack to satisfy a certain level of efficiency. To address these challenges, we further
propose the online incremental attack (OIA) that performs spatial-temporal sparse incremental
perturbations online and makes the adversarial attack less perceptible. In addition, as an optimization-based
method, OIA quickly converges to very small losses within several iterations by considering historical
incremental perturbations, making it much more efficient than the basic attacks. The in-depth
evaluation on the state-of-the-art trackers (i.e., SiamRPN with Alex, MobileNetv2, and ResNet-50)
for OTB100 and VOT2018 demonstrates the effectiveness and transferability of OIA in misleading
existing trackers under both UA and TA with minor perturbations.
