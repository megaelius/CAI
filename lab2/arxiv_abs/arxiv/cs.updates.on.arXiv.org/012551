Consecutive traffic signalized intersections can increase vehicle stops, producing vehicle
accelerations on arterial roads and potentially increasing vehicle fuel consumption levels.
Eco-driving systems are one method to improve vehicle energy efficiency with the help of vehicle
connectivity. In this paper, an eco-driving system is developed that computes a fuel-optimized
vehicle trajectory while traversing more than one signalized intersection. The system is designed
in a modular and scalable fashion allowing it to be implemented in large networks without significantly
increasing the computational complexity. The proposed system utilizes signal phasing and timing
(SPaT) data that are communicated to connected vehicles (CVs) together with real-time vehicle
dynamics to compute fuel-optimum trajectories. The proposed algorithm is incorporated in the
INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation software to conduct a comprehensive
sensitivity analysis of various variables, including: system market penetration rates (MPRs),
demand levels, phase splits, offsets and traffic signal spacings on the system performance. The
analysis shows that at 100\% MPR, fuel consumption can be reduced by as high as 13.8\%. Moreover,
higher MPRs and shorter phase lengths result in larger fuel savings. Optimum demand levels and traffic
signal spacings exist that maximize the effectiveness of the algorithm. Furthermore, the study
demonstrates that the algorithm works less effective when the traffic signal offset is closer to
its optimal value. Finally, the study highlights the need for further work to enhance the algorithm
to deal with over-saturated traffic conditions.
