Recently, federated learning (FL), as a promising distributed machine learning approach, has
attracted lots of research efforts. In FL, the parameter server and the mobile devices share the
training parameters over wireless links. As a result, reducing the communication overhead becomes
one of the most critical challenges. Despite that there have been various communication-efficient
machine learning algorithms in literature, few of the existing works consider their implementation
over wireless networks. In this work, the idea of SignSGD is adopted and only the signs of the gradients
are shared between the mobile devices and the parameter server. In addition, different from most
of the existing works that consider Channel State Information (CSI) at both the transmitter side
and the receiver side, only receiver side CSI is assumed. In such a case, an essential problem for
the mobile devices is to select appropriate local processing and communication parameters. In
particular, two tradeoffs are observed under a fixed total training time: (i) given the time for
each communication round, the energy consumption versus the outage probability per communication
round and (ii) given the energy consumption, the number of communication rounds versus the outage
probability per communication round. Two optimization problems regarding the aforementioned
two tradeoffs are formulated and solved. The first problem minimizes the energy consumption given
the outage probability (and therefore the learning performance) requirement while the second
problem optimizes the learning performance given the energy consumption requirement. Extensive
simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
