Since its introduction, the Grid computing paradigm has been widely adopted both in scientific
and also in industrial areas. The main advantage of the Grid computing paradigm is the ability to
enable, in a transparent way, the sharing and the coordination of several heterogeneous and large-scale
distributed resources belonging to different institutional domains. One of its limitation is
the lack of facilities for executing services. In fact, Grid computing has been traditionally used
and improved for running computational-intensive or data-intensive applications. A service
differs from this kind of applications in that it usually waits for requests from clients and replies
with useful information; moreover, a service is typically subjected to some predefined constraints,
called Service Level Agreement (SLA), including both temporal and performance restrictions.
In this paper we present the TAAROA middleware, a software system that tries to extend the traditional
target of the Grid computing paradigm to include the service concept. It attempts to accomplish
its goal by using the virtualization technology. By abstracting the hardware and software resources
of a computer, virtualization brings to TAAROA two important benefits: (1) the encapsulation of
the service runtime environment, and (2) the possibility, through the migration facility, to move
a service from the computer where it is running to another one that hopefully reduces the risk of violating
some of the SLA constraints. In the current version of TAAROA middleware there is no explicit mechanism
for achieving the level of a service as defined by the related SLA; this means that actually TAAROA
is only able to provide a best-effort service.
