This thesis focuses on process mining on event data where such a normative specification is absent
and, as a result, the event data is less structured. The thesis puts special emphasis on one application
domain that fits this description: the analysis of smart home data where sequences of daily activities
are recorded. In this thesis we propose a set of techniques to analyze such data, which can be grouped
into two categories of techniques. The first category of methods focuses on preprocessing event
logs in order to enable process discovery techniques to extract insights into unstructured event
data. In this category we have developed the following techniques: - An unsupervised approach to
refine event labels based on the time at which the event took place, allowing for example to distinguish
recorded eating events into breakfast, lunch, and dinner. - An approach to detect and filter from
event logs so-called chaotic activities, which are activities that cause process discovery methods
to overgeneralize. - A supervised approach to abstract low-level events into more high-level events,
where we show that there exist situations where process discovery approaches overgeneralize on
the low-level event data but are able to find precise models on the high-level event data. The second
category focuses on mining local process models, i.e., collections of process model patterns that
each describe some frequent pattern, in contrast to the single global process model that is obtained
with existing process discovery techniques. Several techniques are introduced in the area of local
process model mining, including a basic method, fast but approximate heuristic methods, and constraint-based
techniques.
