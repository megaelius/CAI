\textit{Objective}: Joint analysis of multi-subject brain imaging datasets has wide applications
in biomedical engineering. In these datasets, some sources belong to all subjects (joint), a subset
of subjects (partially-joint), or a single subject (individual). In this paper, this source model
is referred to as joint/partially-joint/individual multiple datasets multidimensional (JpJI-MDM),
and accordingly, a source extraction method is developed. Method: We present a deflation-based
algorithm utilizing higher-order cumulants to analyze the JpJI-MDM source model. The algorithm
maximizes a cost function which leads to an eigenvalue problem solved with a subspace iteration
method. Furthermore, we introduce the JpJI-feature which indicates the spatial shape of each source
and the amount of its jointness with other subjects. We use this feature to determine the type of sources.
Results: We evaluate our algorithm by analyzing simulated data and two real functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. In our simulation study, we will show that the proposed algorithm
determines the type of sources with an accuracy of 95% and 100% for 2-class and 3-class clustering
scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, our algorithm extracts meaningful joint and partially-joint
sources from the two real datasets, which are consistent with the existing neuroscience studies.
Conclusion: Our results in analyzing the real datasets reveal that both datasets follow the JpJI-MDM
source model. This source model improves the accuracy of source extraction methods developed for
multi-subject datasets. Significance: The proposed joint blind source separation algorithm
is robust and avoids parameters which are difficult to fine-tune.
