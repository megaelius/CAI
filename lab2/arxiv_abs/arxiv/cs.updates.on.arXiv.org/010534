Numerous methods for crafting adversarial examples were proposed recently with high success rate.
Since most existing machine learning based classifiers normalize images into some continuous,
real vector, domain firstly, attacks often craft adversarial examples in such domain. However,
"adversarial" examples may become benign after denormalizing them back into the discrete integer
domain, known as the discretization problem. This problem was mentioned in some work, but has received
relatively little attention. In this work, we first conduct a comprehensive study of existing methods
and tools for crafting. We theoretically analyze 34 representative methods and empirically study
20 representative open source tools for crafting adversarial images. Our study reveals that the
discretization problem is far more serious than originally thought. This suggests that the discretization
problem should be taken into account seriously when crafting adversarial examples and measuring
attack success rate. As a first step towards addressing this problem in black-box scenario, we propose
a black-box method which reduces the adversarial example searching problem to a derivative-free
optimization problem. Our method is able to craft adversarial images by derivative-free search
in the discrete integer domain. Experimental results show that our method is comparable to recent
white-box methods (e.g., FGSM, BIM and C\&W) and achieves significantly higher success rate in
terms of adversarial examples in the discrete integer domain than recent black-box methods (e.g.,
ZOO, NES-PGD and Bandits). Moreover, our method is able to handle models that is non-differentiable
and successfully break the winner of NIPS 2017 competition on defense with 95\% success rate. Our
results suggest that discrete optimization algorithms open up a promising area of research into
effective black-box attacks.
