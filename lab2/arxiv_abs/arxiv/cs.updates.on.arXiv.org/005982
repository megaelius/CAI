The scaled R\'enyi information plays a significant role in evaluating the performance of information
processing tasks by virtue of its connection to the error exponent analysis. In quantum information
theory, there are three generalizations of the classical R\'enyi divergence---the Petz's, sandwiched,
and log-Euclidean versions, that possess meaningful operational interpretation. However, these
scaled noncommutative R\'enyi informations are much less explored compared with their classical
counterpart, and lacking crucial properties hinders applications of these quantities to refined
performance analysis. The goal of this paper is thus to analyze fundamental properties of scaled
R\'enyi information from a noncommutative measure-theoretic perspective. Firstly, we prove
the uniform equicontinuity for all three quantum versions of R\'enyi information, hence it yields
the joint continuity of these quantities in the orders and priors. Secondly, we establish the concavity
in the region of $s\in(-1,0)$ for both Petz's and the sandwiched versions. This completes the open
questions raised by Holevo [\href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/868501/}{\textit{IEEE
Trans.~Inf.~Theory}, \textbf{46}(6):2256--2261, 2000}], Mosonyi and Ogawa [\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-017-2928-4/}{\textit{Commun.~Math.~Phys},
\textbf{355}(1):373--426, 2017}]. For the applications, we show that the strong converse exponent
in classical-quantum channel coding satisfies a minimax identity. The established concavity
is further employed to prove an entropic duality between classical data compression with quantum
side information and classical-quantum channel coding, and a Fenchel duality in joint source-channel
coding with quantum side information in the forthcoming papers.
