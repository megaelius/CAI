Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an effective tool for the analysis of structural brain connectivity
in normal development and in a broad range of brain disorders. However efforts to derive inherent
characteristics of structural brain networks have been hampered by the very high dimensionality
of the data, relatively small sample sizes, and the lack of widely acceptable connectivity-based
regions of interests (ROIs). Typical approaches have focused either on regions defined by standard
anatomical atlases that do not incorporate anatomical connectivity, or have been based on voxel-wise
analysis, which results in loss of statistical power relative to structure-wise connectivity
analysis. In this work, we propose a novel, computationally efficient iterative clustering method
to generate connectivity-based whole-brain parcellations that converge to a stable parcellation
in a few iterations. Our algorithm is based on a sparse representation of the whole brain connectivity
matrix, which reduces the number of edges from around a half billion to a few million while incorporating
the necessary spatial constraints. We show that the resulting regions in a sense capture the inherent
connectivity information present in the data, and are stable with respect to initialization and
the randomization scheme within the algorithm. These parcellations provide consistent structural
regions across the subjects of population samples that are homogeneous with respect to anatomic
connectivity. Our method also derives connectivity structures that can be used to distinguish
between population samples with known different structural connectivity. In particular, new
results in structural differences for different population samples such as Females vs Males, Normal
Controls vs Schizophrenia, and different age groups in Normal Controls are also shown.
