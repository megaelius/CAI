Developing robust simulation tools for problems involving multiple mathematical scales has been
a subject of great interest in computational mathematics and engineering. A desirable feature
to have in a numerical formulation for multiscale transient problems is to be able to employ different
time-steps (multi-time-step coupling), and different time integrators and different numerical
formulations (mixed methods) in different regions of the computational domain. We present two
new monolithic multi-time-step mixed coupling methods for first-order transient systems. We
shall employ unsteady advection-diffusion-reaction equation with linear decay as the model problem,
which offers several unique challenges in terms of non-self-adjoint spatial operator and rich
features in the solutions. We shall employ the dual Schur domain decomposition technique to handle
the decomposition of domain into subdomains. Two different methods of enforcing compatibility
along the subdomain interface will be used in the time discrete setting. A systematic theoretical
analysis (which includes numerical stability, influence of perturbations, bounds on drift along
the subdomain interface) will be performed. The first coupling method ensures that there is no drift
along the subdomain interface but does not facilitate explicit/implicit coupling. The second
coupling method allows explicit/implicit coupling with controlled (but non-zero) drift in the
solution along the subdomain interface. Several canonical problems will be solved to numerically
verify the theoretical predictions, and to illustrate the overall performance of the proposed
coupling methods. Finally, we shall illustrate the robustness of the proposed coupling methods
using a multi-time-step transient simulation of a fast bimolecular advective-diffusive-reactive
system.
