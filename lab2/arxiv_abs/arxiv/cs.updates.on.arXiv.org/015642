We study the scheduling of flows on a switch with the goal of optimizing metrics related to the response
time of the flows. The input to the problem is a sequence of flow requests on a switch, where the switch
is represented by a bipartite graph with a capacity on each vertex (or port), and a flow request is
an edge with associated demand. In each round, a subset of edges can be scheduled subject to the constraint
that the total demand of the scheduled edges incident on any vertex is at most the capacity of the vertex.
Previous work has essentially settled the complexity of metrics based on {\em completion time}.
The objective of average or maximum {\em response time}, however, is much more challenging. To the
best of our knowledge, there are no prior approximation algorithms results for these metrics in
the context of flow scheduling. We present the first approximation algorithms for flow scheduling
over a switch to optimize response time based metrics. For the average response time metric, whose
NP-hardness follows directly from past work, we present an offline $O(1 + O(\log(n))/c)$ approximation
algorithm for unit flows, assuming that the port capacities of the switch can be increased by a factor
of $1 + c$, for any given positive integer $c$. For the maximum response time metric, we first establish
that it is NP-hard to achieve an approximation factor of better than 4/3 without augmenting capacity.
We then present an offline algorithm that achieves {\em optimal maximum response time}, assuming
the capacity of each port is increased by at most $2 d_{max} - 1$, where $d_{max}$ is the maximum demand
of any flow. Both algorithms are based on linear programming relaxations. We also study the online
version of flow scheduling using the lens of competitive analysis, and present preliminary results
along with experiments that evaluate the performance of fast online heuristics.
