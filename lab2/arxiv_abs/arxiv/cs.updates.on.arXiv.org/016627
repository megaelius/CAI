Although unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely adopted across several computer
vision tasks, it is more desirable if we can exploit a few labeled data from new domains encountered
in a real application. The novel setting of the semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) problem
shares the challenges with the domain adaptation problem and the semi-supervised learning problem.
However, a recent study shows that conventional domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning
methods often result in less effective or negative transfer in the SSDA problem. In order to interpret
the observation and address the SSDA problem, in this paper, we raise the intra-domain discrepancy
issue within the target domain, which has never been discussed so far. Then, we demonstrate that
addressing the intra-domain discrepancy leads to the ultimate goal of the SSDA problem. We propose
an SSDA framework that aims to align features via alleviation of the intra-domain discrepancy.
Our framework mainly consists of three schemes, i.e., attraction, perturbation, and exploration.
First, the attraction scheme globally minimizes the intra-domain discrepancy within the target
domain. Second, we demonstrate the incompatibility of the conventional adversarial perturbation
methods with SSDA. Then, we present a domain adaptive adversarial perturbation scheme, which perturbs
the given target samples in a way that reduces the intra-domain discrepancy. Finally, the exploration
scheme locally aligns features in a class-wise manner complementary to the attraction scheme by
selectively aligning unlabeled target features complementary to the perturbation scheme. We
conduct extensive experiments on domain adaptation benchmark datasets such as DomainNet, Office-Home,
and Office. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on all datasets.
