Human pose estimation has an important impact on a wide range of applications from human-computer
interface to surveillance and content-based video retrieval. For human pose estimation, joint
obstructions and overlapping upon human bodies result in departed pose estimation. To address
these problems, by integrating priors of the structure of human bodies, we present a novel structure-aware
network to discreetly consider such priors during the training of the network. Typically, learning
such constraints is a challenging task. Instead, we propose generative adversarial networks as
our learning model in which we design two residual multiple instance learning (MIL) models with
the identical architecture, one is used as the generator and the other one is used as the discriminator.
The discriminator task is to distinguish the actual poses from the fake ones. If the pose generator
generates the results that the discriminator is not able to distinguish from the real ones, the model
has successfully learnt the priors. In the proposed model, the discriminator differentiates the
ground-truth heatmaps from the generated ones, and later the adversarial loss back-propagates
to the generator. Such procedure assists the generator to learn reasonable body configurations
and is proved to be advantageous to improve the pose estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, we propose
a novel function for MIL. It is an adjustable structure for both instance selection and modeling
to appropriately pass the information between instances in a single bag. In the proposed residual
MIL neural network, the pooling action adequately updates the instance contribution to its bag.
The proposed adversarial residual multi-instance neural network that is based on pooling has been
validated on two datasets for the human pose estimation task and successfully outperforms the other
state-of-arts models.
