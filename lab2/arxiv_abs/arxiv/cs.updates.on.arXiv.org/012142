Distributed optimization algorithms are frequently faced with solving sub-problems on disjoint
connected parts of a network. Unfortunately, the diameter of these parts can be significantly larger
than the diameter of the underlying network, leading to slow running times. Recent work by [Ghaffari
and Hauepler; SODA'16] showed that this phenomenon can be seen as the broad underlying reason for
the pervasive $\Omega(\sqrt{n} + D)$ lower bounds that apply to most optimization problems in the
CONGEST model. On the positive side, this work also introduced low-congestion shortcuts as an elegant
solution to circumvent this problem in certain topologies of interest. Particularly, they showed
that there exist good shortcuts for any planar network and more generally any bounded genus network.
This directly leads to fast $O(D \log^{O(1)} n)$ distributed algorithms for MST and Min-Cut approximation,
given that one can efficiently construct these shortcuts in a distributed manner. Unfortunately,
the shortcut construction of [Ghaffari and Hauepler; SODA'16] relies heavily on having access
to a genus embedding of the network. Computing such an embedding distributedly, however, is a hard
problem - even for planar networks. No distributed embedding algorithm for bounded genus graphs
is in sight. In this work, we side-step this problem by defining a restricted and more structured
form of shortcuts and giving a novel construction algorithm which efficiently finds a shortcut
which is, up to a logarithmic factor, as good as the best shortcut that exists for a given network.
This new construction algorithm directly leads to an $O(D \log^{O(1)} n)$-round algorithm for
solving optimization problems like MST for any topology for which good restricted shortcuts exist
- without the need to compute any embedding. This includes the first efficient algorithm for bounded
genus graphs.
