In this paper, we investigate the approximate consensus problem in highly dynamic networks in which
topology may change continually and unpredictably. We prove that in both synchronous and partially
synchronous systems, approximate consensus is solvable if and only if the communication graph
in each round has a rooted spanning tree, i.e., there is a coordinator at each time. The striking point
in this result is that the coordinator is not required to be unique and can change arbitrarily from
round to round. Interestingly, the class of averaging algorithms, which are memoryless and require
no process identifiers, entirely captures the solvability issue of approximate consensus in that
the problem is solvable if and only if it can be solved using any averaging algorithm. Concerning
the time complexity of averaging algorithms, we show that approximate consensus can be achieved
with precision of $\varepsilon$ in a coordinated network model in $O(n^{n+1} \log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
synchronous rounds, and in $O(\Delta n^{n\Delta+1} \log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ rounds when
the maximum round delay for a message to be delivered is $\Delta$. While in general, an upper bound
on the time complexity of averaging algorithms has to be exponential, we investigate various network
models in which this exponential bound in the number of nodes reduces to a polynomial bound. We apply
our results to networked systems with a fixed topology and classical benign fault models, and deduce
both known and new results for approximate consensus in these systems. In particular, we show that
for solving approximate consensus, a complete network can tolerate up to 2n-3 arbitrarily located
link faults at every round, in contrast with the impossibility result established by Santoro and
Widmayer (STACS '89) showing that exact consensus is not solvable with n-1 link faults per round
originating from the same node.
