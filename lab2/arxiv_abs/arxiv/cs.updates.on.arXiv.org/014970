Energy efficiency technologies (EETs) are crucial for saving energy and reducing carbon dioxide
emissions. However, the diffusion of EETs in small and medium-sized enterprises is rather slow.
Literature shows the interactions between innovation adopters and potential adopters have significant
impacts on innovation diffusion. Enterprises lack the motivation to share information, and EETs
usually lack observability, which suppress the inter-firm influence. Therefore, an information
platform, together with proper policies encouraging or forcing enterprises to disclose EET-related
information, should help harness inter-firm influence to accelerate EETs' diffusion. To explore
whether and how such an information platform affects EETs' diffusion in small and medium-sized
enterprises, this study builds an agent-based model to mimic EET diffusion processes. Based on
a series of controlled numerical experiments, some counter-intuitive phenomena are discovered
and explained. The results show that the information platform is a double-edged sword that notably
accelerates EETs' diffusion by approximately 47% but may also boost negative information to diffuse
even faster and delay massive adoption of EETs. Increasing network density and the intensity of
inter-firm influence are effective to speed EET diffusion, but their impacts diminish drastically
after reaching some critical values (0.05 and 0.15 respectively) and eventually harm the stability
of the system. Hence, the findings implicate that EET suppliers should carefully launch their promising
but immature products; policies that can reduce the perceived risk by enterprises and the effort
to maintain an informative rather than judgmental information platform can prominently mitigate
the negative side effects brought by high fluidity of information.
