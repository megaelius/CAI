In recent years we have witnessed a shift towards personalized, context-based applications and
services for mobile device users. A key component of many of these services is the ability to infer
the current location and predict the future location of users based on location sensors embedded
in the devices. Such knowledge enables service providers to present relevant and timely offers
to their users and better manage traffic congestion control, thus increasing customer satisfaction
and engagement. However, such services suffer from location data leakage which has become one of
today's most concerning privacy issues for smartphone users. In this paper we focus specifically
on location data that is exposed by Android applications via Internet network traffic in plaintext
(i.e., without encryption) without the user's awareness. We present an empirical evaluation,
involving the network traffic of real mobile device users, aimed at: (1) measuring the extent of
location data leakage in the Internet traffic of Android-based smartphone devices; and (2) understanding
the value of this data by inferring users' points of interests (POIs). This was achieved by analyzing
the Internet traffic recorded from the smartphones of a group of 71 participants for an average period
of 37 days. We also propose a procedure for mining and filtering location data from raw network traffic
and utilize geolocation clustering methods to infer users' POIs. The key findings of this research
center on the extent of this phenomenon in terms of both ubiquity and severity; we found that over
85\% of devices of users are leaking location data, and the exposure rate of users' POIs, derived
from the relatively sparse leakage indicators, is around 61%.
