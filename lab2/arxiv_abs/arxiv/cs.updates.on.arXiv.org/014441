L\'evy walk is a popular movement model where an agent repeatedly samples a direction uniformly
at random, and then travels in that direction for a distance which follows a power law distribution
with exponent $\alpha\in (1,\infty)$. L\'evy walks and some of its famous variants, such as Brownian
motion, have been subject to extensive empirical investigations in the continuous framework (i.e.
continuous time and support space) since, essentially, they play an important role in theoretical
biology: for instance, their search efficiency has been investigated in terms of the discovery
rate of food, where the latter corresponds to points distributed according to a given density over
$\mathbf{R}^2$. In that framework, it has been shown that the best efficiency is achieved by setting
the parameter $\alpha$ to 2. Motivated by their importance, we provide the first rigorous and comprehensive
analysis of the efficiency of L\'evy walks in the discrete setting, by estimating the search efficiency
of k independent, parallel L\'evy walks starting from the origin. In more detail, the search efficiency
of this parallel process is here described in terms of the hitting time with respect to (only) one
target node of the 2-dimensional infinite grid, and the consequent total work, i.e., the total number
of steps performed by all the agents. The study of distributed algorithms for k searching agents
on an infinite grid that aim to minimize the hitting time of a target node has been considered in Distributed
Computing under the name of ANTS Problem (Feinerman et al. PODC 2012). Our probabilistic analysis
of L\'evy walks implies the following main novel contributions: I. We show that L{\'e}vy walks provide
a biologically well-motivated, time-invariant search protocol for the ANTS Problem which does
not require any communication among the k agents, and which improves the state of the art in terms
of efficiency, for a wide range of the parameter k. II. In contrast with the apparent general optimality
of the setting $\alpha = 2$, suggested by the discovery rate mentioned above, we show that the best
exponent with respect to a natural measure, such as the total work of the process, directly depends
on the number of searching agents k.
