In the same way that subsequent pauses in spoken language are used to convey information, it is also
possible to transmit information in communication systems not only by message content (data payload),
but also with its timing. This paper presents an event-triggering strategy that utilizes timing
information by transmitting in a state-dependent fashion. We consider the stabilization of a continuous-time,
time-invariant, linear plant over a digital communication channel with bounded delay and in the
presence of bounded plant disturbances. We propose an encoding-decoding scheme that guarantees
a sufficient information transmission rate for stabilization of the plant. In addition, we determine
a lower bound on the information transmission rate of the sensor which is necessary for stabilization.
We show that for small values of the delay, the timing information implicit in the triggering events
is enough to stabilize the plant with any positive information transmission rate. In contrast,
when the delay increases beyond a critical threshold, the timing information alone is not enough
to stabilize the plant and the data payload transmission rate begins to increase. Finally, large
values of the delay require transmission rates higher than what prescribed by the classic data-rate
theorem. Our results also provide a novel encoding-decoding scheme for complex systems, which
can be readily applied to diagonalizable multivariate systems with complex eigenvalues. The identified
rates depend on parameters in the event-triggered law and plant dynamics, and the bounds on the plant
disturbances and channel delays. The technical treatment does not rely upon any a priori probabilistic
distribution of plant disturbances, initial condition, or delay. Our theoretical results are
also validated by numerical simulation.
