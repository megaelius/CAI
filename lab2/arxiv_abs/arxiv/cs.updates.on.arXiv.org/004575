With the development of the Internet, natural language processing (NLP), in which sentiment analysis
is an important task, became vital in information processing.Sentiment analysis includes aspect
sentiment classification. Aspect sentiment can provide complete and in-depth results with increased
attention on aspect-level. Different context words in a sentence influence the sentiment polarity
of a sentence variably, and polarity varies based on the different aspects in a sentence. Take the
sentence, 'I bought a new camera. The picture quality is amazing but the battery life is too short.'as
an example. If the aspect is picture quality, then the expected sentiment polarity is 'positive',
if the battery life aspect is considered, then the sentiment polarity should be 'negative'; therefore,
aspect is important to consider when we explore aspect sentiment in the sentence. Recurrent neural
network (RNN) is regarded as a good model to deal with natural language processing, and RNNs has get
good performance on aspect sentiment classification including Target-Dependent LSTM (TD-LSTM)
,Target-Connection LSTM (TC-LSTM) (Tang, 2015a, b), AE-LSTM, AT-LSTM, AEAT-LSTM (Wang et al.,
2016).There are also extensive literatures on sentiment classification utilizing convolutional
neural network, but there is little literature on aspect sentiment classification using convolutional
neural network. In our paper, we develop attention-based input layers in which aspect information
is considered by input layer. We then incorporate attention-based input layers into convolutional
neural network (CNN) to introduce context words information. In our experiment, incorporating
aspect information into CNN improves the latter's aspect sentiment classification performance
without using syntactic parser or external sentiment lexicons in a benchmark dataset from Twitter
but get better performance compared with other models.
