Finding dense subgraphs in a graph is a fundamental graph mining task, with applications in several
fields. Algorithms for identifying dense subgraphs are used in biology, in finance, in spam detection,
etc. Standard formulations of this problem such as the problem of finding the maximum clique of a
graph are hard to solve. However, some tractable formulations of the problem have also been proposed,
focusing mainly on optimizing some density function, such as the degree density and the triangle
density. However, maximization of degree density usually leads to large subgraphs with small density.
In this paper, we introduce the k-clique-graph densest subgraph problem, k >= 3, a novel formulation
for the discovery of dense subgraphs. Given an input graph, its k-clique-graph is a new graph created
from the input graph where each vertex of the new graph corresponds to a k-clique of the input graph
and two vertices are connected with an edge if they share a common (k-1)-clique. We define a simple
density function, the k-clique-graph density, which gives compact and at the same time dense subgraphs,
and we project its resulting subgraphs back to the input graph. In this paper we focus on the triangle-graph
densest subgraph problem obtained for k=3. To optimize the proposed function, we present an efficient
greedy approximation algorithm that scales well to larger graphs. We evaluate the proposed algorithm
on real datasets and compare it with other algorithms in terms of the size and the density of the extracted
subgraphs. The results verify the ability of the proposed algorithm in finding high-quality subgraphs
in terms of size and density. Finally, we apply the proposed method to the important problem of keyword
extraction from textual documents.
