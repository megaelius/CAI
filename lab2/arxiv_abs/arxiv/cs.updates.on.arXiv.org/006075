In the subgraph counting problem, we are given a input graph $G(V, E)$ and a target graph $H$; the goal
is to estimate the number of occurrences of $H$ in $G$. Our focus here is on designing sublinear-time
algorithms for approximately counting occurrences of $H$ in $G$ in the setting where the algorithm
is given query access to $G$. This problem has been studied in several recent papers which primarily
focused on specific families of graphs $H$ such as triangles, cliques, and stars. However, not much
is known about approximate counting of arbitrary graphs $H$. This is in sharp contrast to the closely
related subgraph enumeration problem that has received significant attention in the database
community as the database join problem. The AGM bound shows that the maximum number of occurrences
of any arbitrary subgraph $H$ in a graph $G$ with $m$ edges is $O(m^{\rho(H)})$, where $\rho(H)$
is the fractional edge-cover of $H$, and enumeration algorithms with matching runtime are known
for any $H$. We bridge this gap between subgraph counting and subgraph enumeration by designing
a sublinear-time algorithm that can estimate the number of any arbitrary subgraph $H$ in $G$, denoted
by $\#H$, to within a $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximation w.h.p. in $O(\frac{m^{\rho(H)}}{\#H})
\cdot poly(\log{n},1/\epsilon)$ time. Our algorithm is allowed the standard set of queries for
general graphs, namely degree queries, pair queries and neighbor queries, plus an additional edge-sample
query that returns an edge chosen uniformly at random. The performance of our algorithm matches
those of Eden et.al. [FOCS 2015, STOC 2018] for counting triangles and cliques and extend them to
all choices of subgraph $H$ under the additional assumption of edge-sample queries. We further
show that our algorithm works for the more general database join size estimation problem and prove
a matching lower bound for this problem.
