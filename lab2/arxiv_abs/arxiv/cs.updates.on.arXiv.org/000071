ROC is usually used to analyze the performance of classifiers in data mining. ROC convex hull (ROCCH)
is the least convex major-ant (LCM) of the empirical ROC curve, and covers potential optima for the
given set of classifiers. Generally, ROC performance maximization could be considered to maximize
the ROCCH, which also means to maximize the true positive rate (tpr) and minimize the false positive
rate (fpr) for each classifier in the ROC space. However, tpr and fpr are conflicting with each other
in the ROCCH optimization process. Though ROCCH maximization problem seems like a multi-objective
optimization problem (MOP), the special characters make it different from traditional MOP. In
this work, we will discuss the difference between them and propose convex hull-based multi-objective
genetic programming (CH-MOGP) to solve ROCCH maximization problems. Convex hull-based sort is
an indicator based selection scheme that aims to maximize the area under convex hull, which serves
as a unary indicator for the performance of a set of points. A selection procedure is described that
can be efficiently implemented and follows similar design principles than classical hyper-volume
based optimization algorithms. It is hypothesized that by using a tailored indicator-based selection
scheme CH-MOGP gets more efficient for ROC convex hull approximation than algorithms which compute
all Pareto optimal points. To test our hypothesis we compare the new CH-MOGP to MOGP with classical
selection schemes, including NSGA-II, MOEA/D) and SMS-EMOA. Meanwhile, CH-MOGP is also compared
with traditional machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes and Prie. Experimental
results based on 22 well-known UCI data sets show that CH-MOGP outperforms significantly traditional
EMOAs.
