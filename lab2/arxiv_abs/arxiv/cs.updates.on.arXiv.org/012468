With the increased availability of condition monitoring data and the increased complexity of explicit
system physics-based models, the application of data-driven approaches for fault detection and
isolation has recently grown. While detection accuracy of such approaches is generally good, their
performance on fault isolation often suffers from the fact that fault conditions affect a large
portion of the measured signals thereby masking the fault source. To overcome this limitation and
enable a more accurate fault detection, we propose a hybrid approach combining physical performance
models with deep learning algorithms. Unobserved process variables are inferred with a physics-based
performance model to enhance the input space of a data-driven diagnostics model. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we generate a condition monitoring dataset of an advanced
gas turbine during flight conditions under healthy and four faulty operative conditions based
on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed method in combination with two different deep learning algorithms:
feed forward neural networks and Variational Autoencoders, both of which demonstrate a significant
improvement when applied within the hybrid fault detection and diagnostics framework. The proposed
method is able to outperform pure data-driven solutions, particularly for systems with a high variability
of operating conditions. It provides superior results both for fault detection as well as for fault
isolation. For fault isolation, it overcomes the smearing effect that is observed in pure data-driven
approaches and enables a precise isolation of the affected signal. We also demonstrate that deep
learning algorithms provide a better performance on fault detection compared to the traditional
machine learning algorithms.
