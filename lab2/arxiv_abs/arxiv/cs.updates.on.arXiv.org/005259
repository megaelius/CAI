This thesis employs statistical learning technique to analyze, predict and solve the fixed charge
network flow (FCNF) problem, which is common encountered in many real-world network problems.
The cost structure for flows in the FCNF involves both fixed and variable costs. The FCNF problem
is modeled mixed binary linear programs and can be solved with standard commercial solvers, which
use branch and bound algorithm. This problem is important for its widely applications and solving
challenges. There does not exist a efficient algorithm to solve this problem optimally due to lacking
tight bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs statistical learning
technique to analyze the optimal flow of the FCNF problem. Most algorithms developed to solve the
FCNF problem are based on the cost structure, relaxation, etc. We start from the network characteristics
and explore the relationship between properties of nodes, arcs and networks and the optimal flow.
This is a bi-direction approach and the findings can be used to locate the features that affect the
optimal flow most significantly, predict the optimal arcs and provide information to solve the
FCNF problem. In particular, we define 33 features based on the network characteristics, from which
using step wise regression, we identify 26 statistical significant predictors for logistic regression
to predict which arcs will have positive flow in the optimal solutions. The predictive model achieves
88% accuracy and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.95. Two applications
are investigated. Firstly, the predictive results can be used directly as component critical index.
The failure of arcs with higher critical index result in more cost increase over the entire network.
