Despite the advances in aircraft guidance and control systems technology, Loss of Control remains
as the main cause of the fatal accidents of large transport aircraft. Loss of Control is defined as
excursion beyond the allowable flight envelope and is often a consequence of upset condition if
improper maneuver is implemented by the pilot. Hence, extensive research in recent years has focused
on improving the current fault tolerant control systems and developing new strategies for loss
of control prevention and recovery systems. However, success of such systems requires the perception
of the damaged aircraft's dynamic behavior and performance, and understanding of its new flight
envelope. This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of lateral control surfaces' failure
effect on the NASA Generic Transport Model's maneuvering flight envelope; which is a set of attainable
steady state maneuvers herein referred to as trim points. The study utilizes a massive database
of the Generic Transport Model's high-fidelity maneuvering flight envelopes computed for the
unimpaired case and wide ranges of aileron and rudder failure cases at different flight conditions.
Flight envelope boundary is rigorously investigated and the key parameters confining the trim
points at different boundary sections are identified. Trend analysis of the impaired flight envelopes
and the corresponding limiting factors is performed which demonstrates the effect of various failure
degrees on the remaining feasible trim points. Results of the post-failure analysis can be employed
in emergency path planning and have potential uses in the development of aircraft resilient control
and upset recovery systems.
