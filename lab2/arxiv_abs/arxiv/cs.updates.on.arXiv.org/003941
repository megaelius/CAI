High-performance computing (HPC) storage systems become increasingly critical to scientific
applications given the data-driven discovery paradigm shift. As a storage solution for large-scale
HPC systems, dozens of applications share the same storage system, and will compete and can interfere
with each other. Application interference can dramatically degrade the overall storage system
performance. Therefore, developing a flexible and effective storage solution to assure a certain
level of resources per application, i.e. the Quality-of-Service (QoS) support, is critical. One
of the common solution to achieve QoS assurance for storage systems is using provisioning technique~\cite{3}.
Provisioning refers to the ability of providing certain amount of resources for applications and
expected workloads. However, provisioning has limitations such as requiring the detailed knowledge
of the expected workloads. In addition, the storage workloads are transient hence expensive to
be satisfied. Due to these limitations, providing QoS storage systems through provisioning is
challenging. In this research, a software-defined approach~\cite{0} is proposed as a flexible
solution to achieve QoS guarantee for storage systems. The driving force of using a software-defined
approach instead of the traditional approaches, is that it has the ability to enable a more flexible,
scalable, and efficient platform. For example, if any changes occurred in the system, it does not
necessarily need to re-configure thousands of devices; instead, with re-configuring a logically
centralized component, other devices will be automatically notified.
