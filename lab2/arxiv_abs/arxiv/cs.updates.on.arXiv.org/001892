Motivated by applications in large scale wireless networks, we introduce and study queuing systems
of interacting queues where the interactions mimic wireless interference. Our network model is
an abstraction of an ad-hoc wireless network and is intended to capture the interplay between the
geometry of wireless links, which determine how the links interfere with each other, and their temporal
traffic dynamics. When a link accesses the spectrum, it causes interference to other nearby links,
and thus their rate of communication is lowered. This in turn implies they access the spectrum longer
and cause interference to nearby links for a larger duration. This coupling between the geometry
and temporal dynamics is one of the main challenges in assessing the performance of wireless systems.
Most prior work have modeled this phenomenon in a cellular network setting by generalizing the so
called coupled processors model. These models are difficult to analyze and even in the simplest
case, and one has to typically resort to bounds and approximations to derive insight. We consider
the ad-hoc network setting and propose a new model of queues, which interact through interference.
We show that this model is tractable, in the sense we can compute certain performance metrics even
when there is an infinite number of queues. Specifically, we prove a stability phase-transition
for such queuing systems. Furthermore, we also derive exactly the mean number of customers in any
queue in steady state. Thanks to Little's Law, this also yields an exact expression for mean delay
of a typical link in steady state. The key to our results is the analysis of certain Rate Conservation
equations along with monotonicity and tightness arguments, which are new and interesting in their
own right. Our model and results thus provide a basis to evaluate the performance of various protocols
on large networks.
