Emotion analysis has been attracting researchers' attention. Most previous works in the artificial
intelligence field focus on recognizing emotion rather than mining the reason why emotions are
not or wrongly recognized. Correlation among emotions contributes to the failure of emotion recognition.
In this paper, we try to fill the gap between emotion recognition and emotion correlation mining
through natural language text from web news. Correlation among emotions, expressed as the confusion
and evolution of emotion, is primarily caused by human emotion cognitive bias. To mine emotion correlation
from emotion recognition through text, three kinds of features and two deep neural network models
are presented. The emotion confusion law is extracted through orthogonal basis. The emotion evolution
law is evaluated from three perspectives, one-step shift, limited-step shifts, and shortest path
transfer. The method is validated using three datasets-the titles, the bodies, and the comments
of news articles, covering both objective and subjective texts in varying lengths (long and short).
The experimental results show that, in subjective comments, emotions are easily mistaken as anger.
Comments tend to arouse emotion circulations of love-anger and sadness-anger. In objective news,
it is easy to recognize text emotion as love and cause fear-joy circulation. That means, journalists
may try to attract attention using fear and joy words but arouse the emotion love instead; After news
release, netizens generate emotional comments to express their intense emotions, i.e., anger,
sadness, and love. These findings could provide insights for applications regarding affective
interaction such as network public sentiment, social media communication, and human-computer
interaction.
