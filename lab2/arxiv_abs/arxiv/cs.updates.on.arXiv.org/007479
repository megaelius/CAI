Social network and publishing platforms, such as Twitter, support the concept of a secret proprietary
verification process, for handles they deem worthy of platform-wide public interest. In line with
significant prior work which suggests that possessing such a status symbolizes enhanced credibility
in the eyes of the platform audience, a verified badge is clearly coveted among public figures and
brands. What are less obvious are the inner workings of the verification process and what being verified
represents. This lack of clarity, coupled with the flak that Twitter received by extending aforementioned
status to political extremists in 2017, backed Twitter into publicly admitting that the process
and what the status represented needed to be rethought. With this in mind, we seek to unravel the aspects
of a user's profile which likely engender or preclude verification. The aim of the paper is two-fold:
First, we test if discerning the verification status of a handle from profile metadata and content
features is feasible. Second, we unravel the features which have the greatest bearing on a handle's
verification status. We collected a dataset consisting of profile metadata of all 231,235 verified
English-speaking users (as of July 2018), a control sample of 175,930 non-verified English-speaking
users and all their 494 million tweets over a one year collection period. Our proposed models are
able to reliably identify verification status (Area under curve AUC > 99%). We show that number of
public list memberships, presence of neutral sentiment in tweets and an authoritative language
style are the most pertinent predictors of verification status. To the best of our knowledge, this
work represents the first attempt at discerning and classifying verification worthy users on Twitter.
