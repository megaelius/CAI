Motivated by the prediction of cell loads in cellular networks, we formulate the following new,
fundamental problem of statistical learning of geometric marks of point processes: An unknown
marking function, depending on the geometry of point patterns, produces characteristics (marks)
of the points. One aims at learning this function from the examples of marked point patterns in order
to predict the marks of new point patterns. To approximate (interpolate) the marking function,
in our baseline approach, we build a statistical regression model of the marks with respect some
local point distance representation. In a more advanced approach, we use a global data representation
via the scattering moments of random measures, which build informative and stable to deformations
data representation, already proven useful in image analysis and related application domains.
In this case, the regression of the scattering moments of the marked point patterns with respect
to the non-marked ones is combined with the numerical solution of the inverse problem, where the
marks are recovered from the estimated scattering moments. Considering some simple, generic marks,
often appearing in the modeling of wireless networks, such as the shot-noise values, nearest neighbour
distance, and some characteristics of the Voronoi cells, we show that the scattering moments can
capture similar geometry information as the baseline approach, and can reach even better performance,
especially for non-local marking functions. Our results motivate further development of statistical
learning tools for stochastic geometry and analysis of wireless networks, in particular to predict
cell loads in cellular networks from the locations of base stations and traffic demand.
