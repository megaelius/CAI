Active learning (AL) on attributed graphs has received increasing attention with the prevalence
of graph-structured data. Although AL has been widely studied for alleviating label sparsity issues
with the conventional non-related data, how to make it effective over attributed graphs remains
an open research question. Existing AL algorithms on graphs attempt to reuse the classic AL query
strategies designed for non-related data. However, they suffer from two major limitations. First,
different AL query strategies calculated in distinct scoring spaces are often naively combined
to determine which nodes to be labelled. Second, the AL query engine and the learning of the classifier
are treated as two separating processes, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper,
we propose a SEmi-supervised Adversarial active Learning (SEAL) framework on attributed graphs,
which fully leverages the representation power of deep neural networks and devises a novel AL query
strategy in an adversarial way. Our framework learns two adversarial components: a graph embedding
network that encodes both the unlabelled and labelled nodes into a latent space, expecting to trick
the discriminator to regard all nodes as already labelled, and a semi-supervised discriminator
network that distinguishes the unlabelled from the existing labelled nodes in the latent space.
The divergence score, generated by the discriminator in a unified latent space, serves as the informativeness
measure to actively select the most informative node to be labelled by an oracle. The two adversarial
components form a closed loop to mutually and simultaneously reinforce each other towards enhancing
the active learning performance. Extensive experiments on four real-world networks validate
the effectiveness of the SEAL framework with superior performance improvements to state-of-the-art
baselines.
