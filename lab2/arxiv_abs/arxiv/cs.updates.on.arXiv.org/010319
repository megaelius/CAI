With the advent of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, various networking consumer industrial
and autonomous systems exchange messages in the real world in order to achieve their objectives.
Parts of these systems are comprised of short-range wireless networks in the form of clusters that
collectively cover a large geographical area. In these clusters, the nodes that represent the cluster
heads need to deal with two types of communications: one is within the cluster and the other is from
the cluster to the sink node. As the number of clusters increases, it takes multiple hops for the cluster
head to forward data to the sink node, thus resulting in a low packet delivery rate and throughput.
To solve this problem, we propose a heterogeneous area network in which the cluster head is equipped
with two types of radios: the IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 radios. The former is for the devices within
the cluster to communicate, whereas the latter is for the cluster heads to communicate to the sink
node. Although the IEEE 802.11 links increase the link capacity, the IEEE 802.11 radio and the IEEE
802.15.4 radio might share the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, thus giving rise to the inter-network collisions
or interference. To tackle this problem and to maintain decent Qualityof-Service (QoS) for the
network, we subsequently present two interference mitigation techniques, in which a Blank Burst
(BB) period is proposed so that the IEEE 802.15.4 radios can be suspended while the IEEE 802.11 radios
are active. Simulation results show the proposed two methods can effectively mitigate the inter-network
collisions and are superior to the existing technique, which uses an adaptive aggregation technique
to mitigate the inter-network collisions.
