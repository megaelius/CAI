Being able to rapidly recognise new research trends is strategic for many stakeholders, including
universities, institutional funding bodies, academic publishers and companies. The literature
presents several approaches to identifying the emergence of new research topics, which rely on
the assumption that the topic is already exhibiting a certain degree of popularity and consistently
referred to by a community of researchers. However, detecting the emergence of a new research area
at an embryonic stage, i.e., before the topic has been consistently labelled by a community of researchers
and associated with a number of publications, is still an open challenge. In this dissertation,
we begin to address this challenge by performing a study of the dynamics preceding the creation of
new topics. This study indicates that the emergence of a new topic is anticipated by a significant
increase in the pace of collaboration between relevant research areas, which can be seen as the 'ancestors'
of the new topic. Based on this understanding, we developed Augur, a novel approach to effectively
detecting the emergence of new research topics. Augur analyses the diachronic relationships between
research areas and is able to detect clusters of topics that exhibit dynamics correlated with the
emergence of new research topics. Here we also present the Advanced Clique Percolation Method (ACPM),
a new community detection algorithm developed specifically for supporting this task. Augur was
evaluated on a gold standard of 1,408 debutant topics in the 2000-2011 timeframe and outperformed
four alternative approaches in terms of both precision and recall.
