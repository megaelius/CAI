Air-writing is the process of writing characters or words in free space using finger or hand movements
without the aid of any hand-held device. In this work, we address the problem of mid-air finger writing
using web-cam video as input. In spite of recent advances in object detection and tracking, accurate
and robust detection and tracking of the fingertip remains a challenging task, primarily due to
small dimension of the fingertip. Moreover, the initialization and termination of mid-air finger
writing is also challenging due to the absence of any standard delimiting criterion. To solve these
problems, we propose a new writing hand pose detection algorithm for initialization of air-writing
using the Faster R-CNN framework for accurate hand detection followed by hand segmentation and
finally counting the number of raised fingers based on geometrical properties of the hand. Further,
we propose a robust fingertip detection and tracking approach using a new signature function called
distance-weighted curvature entropy. Finally, a fingertip velocity-based termination criterion
is used as a delimiter to mark the completion of the air-writing gesture. Experiments show the superiority
of the proposed fingertip detection and tracking algorithm over state-of-the-art approaches
giving a mean precision of 73.1 % while achieving real-time performance at 18.5 fps, a condition
which is of vital importance to air-writing. Character recognition experiments give a mean accuracy
of 96.11 % using the proposed air-writing system, a result which is comparable to that of existing
handwritten character recognition systems.
