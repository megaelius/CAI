Silhouettes or 2D planar shapes are extremely important in human communication, which involves
many logos, graphics symbols and fonts in vector form. Many more shapes can be extracted from image
by binarization or segmentation, thus in raster form that requires a vectorization. There is a need
for disposing of a mathematically well defined and justified shape vectorization process, which
in addition provides a minimal set of control points with geometric meaning. In this paper we propose
a silhouette vectorization method which extracts the outline of a 2D shape from a raster binary image,
and converts it to a combination of cubic B\'{e}zier polygons and perfect circles. Starting from
the boundary curvature extrema computed at sub-pixel level, we identify a set of control points
based on the affine scale-space induced by the outline. These control points capture similarity
invariant geometric features of the given silhouette and give precise locations of the shape's
corners.of the given silhouette. Then, piecewise B\'{e}zier cubics are computed by least-square
fitting combined with an adaptive splitting to guarantee a predefined accuracy. When there are
no curvature extrema identified, either the outline is recognized as a circle using the isoperimetric
inequality, or a pair of the most distant outline points are chosen to initiate the fitting. Given
their construction, most of our control points are geometrically stable under affine transformations.
By comparing with other feature detectors, we show that our method can be used as a reliable feature
point detector for silhouettes. Compared to state-of-the-art image vectorization software,
our algorithm demonstrates superior reduction on the number of control points, while maintaining
high accuracy.
