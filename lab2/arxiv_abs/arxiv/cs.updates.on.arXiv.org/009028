Motivation: Graph embedding learning which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional node
representations has drawn increasing attention in recent years. To date, most recent graph embedding
methods are mainly evaluated on social and information networks and have yet to be comprehensively
studied on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for
a variety of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization
(which can be seen as one type of graph embedding methods) have shown promising results, and hence
there is a need to systematically evaluate more recent graph embedding methods (e.g., random walk-based
and neural network-based) in terms of their usability and potential to further the state-of-the-art.
Results: We conduct a systematic comparison of existing graph embedding methods on three important
biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease association (DDA) prediction, drug-drug interaction
(DDI)prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction, and one node classification
task, i.e., classifying the semantic types of medical terms (nodes). Our experimental results
demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods are generally more effective than traditional
embedding methods. Besides, compared with two state-of-the-art methods for DDAs and DDIs predictions,
graph embedding methods without using any biological features achieve very competitive performance.
Moreover, we summarize the experience we have learned and provide guidelines for properly selecting
graph embedding methods and setting their hyper-parameters. Availability: We develop an easy-to-use
Python package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, available at:https://github.com/xiangyue9607/BioNEV,
including all source code and datasets, to facilitate studying various graph embedding methods
