Community detection is the task of identifying clusters or groups of nodes in a network where nodes
within same group are more connected with each other than with nodes in different groups. It has practical
uses in identifying similar functions or roles of nodes in many biological, social and computer
networks. With the availability of very large networks in recent years, performance and scalability
of community detection algorithms become crucial, i.e. if time complexity of an algorithm is high,
it can not run on large networks. In this paper, we propose a new community detection algorithm which
has a local approach and is able to run on large networks. It has a simple and effective method; given
a network, we construct a preference network with same set of nodes and each node has a single outgoing
edge showing its preferred node to be in same community with. In such a preference network, each connected
component is a community. In construction of preference network, preferred node selection is critical
and we used similarity based metrics for this purpose. In order to keep local, we only used the metrics
that can be calculated in the 1- neighborhood of each node doing the selection. We used two similarity
metrics; first one is the number of common neighbors of selector node and its neighbors and, second
one is the spread capability of neighbors around the selector node which is calculated by the gossip
algorithm of Lind et.al. Our algorithm is tested on both computer generated LFR networks and real-life
networks with ground-truth community structure. It can identify communities accurately in a fast
way. It is local, scalable and suitable for distributed execution on large networks.
