The problem of combined state and input estimation of linear structural systems based on measured
responses and a priori knowledge of structural model is considered. A novel methodology using Gaussian
process latent force models is proposed to tackle the problem in a stochastic setting. Gaussian
process latent force models (GPLFMs) are hybrid models that combine differential equations representing
a physical system with data-driven non-parametric Gaussian process models. In this work, the unknown
input forces acting on a structure are modelled as Gaussian processes with some chosen covariance
functions which are combined with the mechanistic differential equation representing the structure
to construct a GPLFM. The GPLFM is then conveniently formulated as an augmented stochastic state-space
model with additional states representing the latent force components, and the joint input and
state inference of the resulting model is implemented using Kalman filter. The augmented state-space
model of GPLFM is shown as a generalization of the class of input-augmented state-space models,
is proven observable, and is robust compared to conventional augmented formulations in terms of
numerical stability. The hyperparameters governing the covariance functions are estimated using
maximum likelihood optimization based on the observed data, thus overcoming the need for manual
tuning of the hyperparameters by trial-and-error. To assess the performance of the proposed GPLFM
method, several cases of state and input estimation are demonstrated using numerical simulations
on a 10-dof shear building and a 76-storey ASCE benchmark office tower. Results obtained indicate
the superior performance of the proposed approach over conventional Kalman filter based approaches.
