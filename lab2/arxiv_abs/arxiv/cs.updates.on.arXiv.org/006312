Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, allow a set of actors to maintain a ledger of transactions
without relying on a central authority and to deploy scripts, called smart contracts, that are executed
whenever certain transactions occur. These features can be used as basic building blocks for executing
collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties. However, implementing
business processes using the low-level primitives provided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome
and error-prone. In contrast, established business process management systems, such as those
based on the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient abstractions
for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This article demonstrates how to combine
the advantages of a business process management system with those of a blockchain platform. The
article introduces a blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, namely Caterpillar. Like any BPMN
execution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model and allows
users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of
Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain
and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler.
The Caterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including subprocesses, multi-instances
activities and event handlers. The paper describes the architecture of Caterpillar, and the interfaces
it provides to support the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of work
items, and the execution of service tasks.
