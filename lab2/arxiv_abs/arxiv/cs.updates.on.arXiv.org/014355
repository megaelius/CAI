Transparent objects such as windows and bottles made by glass widely exist in the real world. Segmenting
transparent objects is challenging because these objects have diverse appearance inherited from
the image background, making them had similar appearance with their surroundings. Besides the
technical difficulty of this task, only a few previous datasets were specially designed and collected
to explore this task and most of the existing datasets have major drawbacks. They either possess
limited sample size such as merely a thousand of images without manual annotations, or they generate
all images by using computer graphics method (i.e. not real image). To address this important problem,
this work proposes a large-scale dataset for transparent object segmentation, named Trans10K,
consisting of 10,428 images of real scenarios with carefully manual annotations, which are 10 times
larger than the existing datasets. The transparent objects in Trans10K are extremely challenging
due to high diversity in scale, viewpoint and occlusion as shown in Fig. 1. To evaluate the effectiveness
of Trans10K, we propose a novel boundary-aware segmentation method, termed TransLab, which exploits
boundary as the clue to improve segmentation of transparent objects. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans10K and validate the practicality of learning
object boundary in TransLab. For example, TransLab significantly outperforms 20 recent object
segmentation methods based on deep learning, showing that this task is largely unsolved. We believe
that both Trans10K and TransLab have important contributions to both the academia and industry,
facilitating future researches and applications.
