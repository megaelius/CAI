We propose a novel application of coded computing to the problem of the nearest neighbor estimation
using MatDot Codes [Fahim. et.al. 2017], that are known to be optimal for matrix multiplication
in terms of recovery threshold under storage constraints. In approximate nearest neighbor algorithms,
it is common to construct efficient in-memory indexes to improve query response time. One such strategy
is Multiple Random Projection Trees (MRPT), which reduces the set of candidate points over which
Euclidean distance calculations are performed. However, this may result in a high memory footprint
and possibly paging penalties for large or high-dimensional data. Here we propose two techniques
to parallelize MRPT, that exploit data and model parallelism respectively, by dividing both the
data storage and the computation efforts among different nodes in a distributed computing cluster.
This is especially critical when a single compute node cannot hold the complete dataset in memory.
We also propose a novel coded computation strategy based on MatDot codes for the model-parallel
architecture that, in a straggler-prone environment, achieves the storage-optimal recovery
threshold, i.e., the number of nodes that are required to serve a query. We experimentally demonstrate
that, in the absence of straggling, our distributed approaches require less query time than execution
on a single processing node, providing near-linear speedups with respect to the number of worker
nodes. Through our experiments on real systems with simulated straggling, we also show that our
strategy achieves a faster query execution than the uncoded strategy in a straggler-prone environment.
