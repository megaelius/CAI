Graph spanners are well-studied and widely used both in theory and practice. In a recent breakthrough,
Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [CW16] improved the state-of-the-art for light spanners by constructing
a $(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges and $O_\epsilon(n^{1/k})$ lightness.
Soon after, Filtser and Solomon [FS16] showed that the classic greedy spanner construction achieves
the same bounds The major drawback of the greedy spanner is its running time of $O(mn^{1+1/k})$ (which
is faster than [CW16]). This makes the construction impractical even for graphs of moderate size.
Much faster spanner constructions do exist but they only achieve lightness $\Omega_\epsilon(kn^{1/k})$,
even when randomization is used. The contribution of this paper is deterministic spanner constructions
that are fast, and achieve similar bounds as the state-of-the-art slower constructions. Our first
result is an $O_\epsilon(n^{2+1/k+\epsilon'})$ time spanner construction which achieves the
state-of-the-art bounds. Our second result is an $O_\epsilon(m + n\log n)$ time construction of
a spanner with $(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$ stretch, $O(\log k\cdot n^{1+1/k})$ edges and $O_\epsilon(\log
k\cdot n^{1/k})$ lightness. This is an exponential improvement in the dependence on $k$ compared
to the previous result with such running time. Finally, for the important special case where $k=\log
n$, for every constant $\epsilon>0$, we provide an $O(m+n^{1+\epsilon})$ time construction that
produces an $O(\log n)$-spanner with $O(n)$ edges and $O(1)$ lightness which is asymptotically
optimal. This is the first known sub-quadratic construction of such a spanner for any $k = \omega(1)$.
To achieve our constructions, we show a novel deterministic incremental approximate distance
oracle, which may be of independent interest.
