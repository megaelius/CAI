\emph{Implicit Social Network} is a connected social structure among a group of persons, where
two of them are linked if they have some common interest. One real\mbox{-}life example of such networks
is the implicit social network among the customers of an online commercial house, where there exists
an edge between two customers if they like similar items. Such networks are often useful for different
commercial applications such as \textit{target advertisement}, \textit{viral marketing},
etc. In this article, we study two fundamental problems in this direction. The first one is that,
given the user\mbox{-}item rating data of an E\mbox{-}Commerce house, how we can design implicit
social networks among its users and the second one is at the time of designing itself can we obtain
the connectivity information among the users. Formally, we call the first problem as the \textsc{Implicit
User Network Design} Problem and the second one as \textsc{Implicit User Network Design with Connectivity
Checking} Problem. For the first problem, we propose three different algorithms, namely \emph{`Exhaustive
Search Approach'}, \emph{`Clique Addition Approach'}, and \textit{`Matrix Multiplication\mbox{-}Based
Approach'}. For the second problem, we propose two different approaches. The first one is the sequential
approach: designing and then connectivity checking, and the other one is a concurrent approach,
which is basically an incremental algorithm that performs designing and connectivity checking
simultaneously. Proposed methodologies have experimented with three publicly available rating
network datasets such as \emph{Flixter}, \textit{Movielens}, and \textit{Epinions}.
