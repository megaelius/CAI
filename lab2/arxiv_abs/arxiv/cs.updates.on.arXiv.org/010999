Business process modelling languages typically enable the representation of business process
models by employing (graphical) symbols. These symbols can vary depending upon the verbosity of
the language, the modeling paradigm, the focus of the language, and so on. To make explicit the different
constructs and rules employed by a specific language as well as bridge the gap across different languages,
meta-models have been proposed in literature. These meta-models are a crucial source of knowledge
on what state-of-the-art literature considers relevant to describe business processes. Moreover,
the rapid growth of techniques and tools that aim at supporting all dimensions of business processes
and not only its control flow perspective, as for instance data and organisational aspects, makes
even more important to have a clear idea, already at the conceptual level, of the key process constructs.
The goal of this work is to provide the first extensive systematic literature review (SLR) of business
process meta-models. This SLR aims at answering research questions concerning: (i) the kind of
meta-models proposed in literature; (ii) the recurring constructs they contain; (iii) their purposes;
and (iv) their evaluations. Thirty-six papers were selected and evaluated against four research
questions. The results indicate the existence of a reasonable body of work conducted in this specific
area, but not a full maturity. In particular, while traditional paradigms towards business process
modelling, and aspects related to the business process control flow seem to be well present, novel
paradigms and aspects related to the organisational, data and goal-oriented aspects of business
processes seem to be still under-investigated.
