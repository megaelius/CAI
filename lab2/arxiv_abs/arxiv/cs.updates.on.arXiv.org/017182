At the time of writing most governments around the whole world are prioritising the limiting of the
spread of the Covid-19 epidemic through a series of lockdown measures affecting schools, sports,
leisure, commercial and travel activities. The gradual reversal of these measures is being carried
out individually by countries and regions based on the public health emergency advice and other
epidemiological modelling outcomes. As is the case in any humanitarian crisis situation, there
is a need for specific, accurate and up-to-date geospatial information to facilitate emergency
response, management of the overall response and public information. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has
played a pivotal and often leading role in national and international humanitarian and citizen-led
responses to crises such as natural disasters over the last decade or so. OSM can take these leading
roles for a number of potential reasons, including; geospatial data availability under an open
access license, facilitating the development of open services such as mapping, routing, etc. This
paper critically assesses and reflects upon this new context and challenge for OpenStreetMap and
humanitarian mapping from a number of different positions which are outlined as follows: OpenStreetMap
usage as a cartographic basemap in Covid-19 related applications; Applications or services using
OpenStreetMap data; Initiatives or applications aimed at the collection of new OSM data immediately
relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic response or management; Import of authoritative geospatial
data into OpenStreetMap where there are gaps in the OpenStreetMap database for a particular country
or region; and, Academic research about the role or usage of OpenStreetMap in the Covid-19 response.
