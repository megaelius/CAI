Purpose: Gliomas are the most common and aggressive type of brain tumors due to their infiltrative
nature and rapid progression. The process of distinguishing tumor boundaries from healthy cells
is still a challenging task in the clinical routine. Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)
MRI modality can provide the physician with information about tumor infiltration. Therefore,
this paper proposes a new generic deep learning architecture; namely DeepSeg for fully automated
detection and segmentation of the brain lesion using FLAIR MRI data. Methods: The developed DeepSeg
is a modular decoupling framework. It consists of two connected core parts based on an encoding and
decoding relationship. The encoder part is a convolutional neural network (CNN) responsible for
spatial information extraction. The resulting semantic map is inserted into the decoder part to
get the full resolution probability map. Based on modified U-Net architecture, different CNN models
such as Residual Neural Network (ResNet), Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and NASNet
have been utilized in this study. Results: The proposed deep learning architectures have been successfully
tested and evaluated on-line based on MRI datasets of Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS 2019) challenge,
including s336 cases as training data and 125 cases for validation data. The dice and Hausdorff distance
scores of obtained segmentation results are about 0.81 to 0.84 and 9.8 to 19.7 correspondingly.
Conclusion: This study showed successful feasibility and comparative performance of applying
different deep learning models in a new DeepSeg framework for automated brain tumor segmentation
in FLAIR MR images. The proposed DeepSeg is open-source and freely available at https://github.com/razeineldin/DeepSeg/.
