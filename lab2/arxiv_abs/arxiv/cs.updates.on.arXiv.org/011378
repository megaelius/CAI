A new density field representation technique called the Bezier skeleton explicit density (BSED)
representation scheme for topology optimization of stretchable metamaterials under finite deformation
is proposed for the first time. The proposed approach overcomes a key deficiency in existing density-based
optimization methods that typically yield designs that do not have smooth surfaces but have large
number of small intricate features, which are difficult to manufacture even by additive manufacturing.
In the proposed approach, Bezier curves are utilized to describe the skeleton of the design being
optimized where the description of the entire design is realized by assigning thickness along the
curves. This geometric representation technique ensures that the optimized design is smooth and
concise and can easily be tuned to be manufacturable by additive manufacturing. In the optimization
method, the density field is described by the Heaviside function defined on the Bezier curves. Compared
to NURBS or B-spline based models, Bezier curves have fewer control parameters and hence are easier
to manipulate for sensitivity derivation, especially for distance sensitivities. Due to its powerful
curve fitting ability, using Bezier curve to represent density field allows exploring design space
effectively and generating concise structures without any intricate small features at the borders.
Furthermore, this density representation method is mesh independent and design variables are
reduced significantly so that optimization problem can be solved efficiently using small-scale
optimization algorithms such as sequential quadratic programming.
