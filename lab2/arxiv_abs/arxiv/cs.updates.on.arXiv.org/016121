Machine learning methods applied to complex biomedical data has enabled the construction of disease
signatures of diagnostic/prognostic value. However, less attention has been given to understanding
disease heterogeneity. Semi-supervised clustering methods can address this problem by estimating
multiple transformations from a (e.g. healthy) control (CN) group to a patient (PT) group, seeking
to capture the heterogeneity of underlying pathlogic processes. Herein, we propose a novel method,
Smile-GANs (SeMi-supervIsed cLustEring via GANs), for semi-supervised clustering, and apply
it to brain MRI scans. Smile-GANs first learns multiple distinct mappings by generating PT from
CN, with each mapping characterizing one relatively distinct pathological pattern. Moreover,
a clustering model is trained interactively with mapping functions to assign PT into corresponding
subtype memberships. Using relaxed assumptions on PT/CN data distribution and imposing mapping
non-linearity, Smile-GANs captures heterogeneous differences in distribution between the CN
and PT domains. We first validate Smile-GANs using simulated data, subsequently on real data, by
demonstrating its potential in characterizing heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and
its prodromal phases. The model was first trained using baseline MRIs from the ADNI2 database and
then applied to longitudinal data from ADNI1 and BLSA. Four robust subtypes with distinct neuroanatomical
patterns were discovered: 1) normal brain, 2) diffuse atrophy atypical of AD, 3) focal medial temporal
lobe atrophy, 4) typical-AD. Further longitudinal analyses discover two distinct progressive
pathways from prodromal to full AD: i) subtypes 1 - 2 - 4, and ii) subtypes 1 - 3 - 4. Although demonstrated
on an important biomedical problem, Smile-GANs is general and can find application in many biomedical
and other domains.
