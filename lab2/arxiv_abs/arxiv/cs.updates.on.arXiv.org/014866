Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fast-growing and highly invasive brain tumour, it tends to occur
in adults between the ages of 45 and 70 and it accounts for 52 percent of all primary brain tumours.
Usually, GBMs are detected by magnetic resonance images (MRI). Among MRI, Fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery (FLAIR) sequence produces high quality digital tumour representation. Fast detection
and segmentation techniques are needed for overcoming subjective medical doctors (MDs) judgment.
In the present investigation, we intend to demonstrate by means of numerical experiments that topological
features combined with textural features can be enrolled for GBM analysis and morphological characterization
on FLAIR. To this extent, we have performed three numerical experiments. In the first experiment,
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) of a simplified 2D tumour growth mathematical model had allowed
to understand the bio-chemical conditions that facilitate tumour growth: the higher the concentration
of chemical nutrients the more virulent the process. In the second experiment topological data
analysis was used for evaluating GBM temporal progression on FLAIR recorded within 90 days following
treatment (e.g., chemo-radiation therapy - CRT) completion and at progression. The experiment
had confirmed that persistent entropy is a viable statistics for monitoring GBM evolution during
the follow-up period. In the third experiment we had developed a novel methodology based on topological
and textural features and automatic interpretable machine learning for automatic GBM classification
on FLAIR. The algorithm reached a classification accuracy up to the 97%.
