We derive fundamental lower bounds on the connectivity and the memory requirements of deep neural
networks guaranteeing uniform approximation rates for arbitrary function classes in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$.
In other words, we establish a connection between the complexity of a function class and the complexity
of deep neural networks approximating functions from this class to within a prescribed accuracy.
Additionally, we prove that our lower bounds are achievable for a broad family of function classes.
Specifically, all function classes that are optimally approximated by a general class of representation
systems---so-called \emph{affine systems}---can be approximated by deep neural networks with
minimal connectivity and memory requirements. Affine systems encompass a wealth of representation
systems from applied harmonic analysis such as wavelets, ridgelets, curvelets, shearlets, $\alpha$-shearlets,
and more generally $\alpha$-molecules. Our central result elucidates a remarkable universality
property of neural networks and shows that they achieve the optimum approximation properties of
all affine systems combined. As a specific example, we consider the class of $\alpha^{-1}$-cartoon-like
functions, which is approximated optimally by $\alpha$-shearlets. We also explain how our results
can be extended to the case of functions on low-dimensional immersed manifolds. Finally, we present
numerical experiments demonstrating that the standard stochastic gradient descent algorithm
generates deep neural networks providing close-to-optimal approximation rates. Moreover, these
results indicate that stochastic gradient descent can actually learn approximations that are
sparse in the representation systems optimally sparsifying the function class the network is trained
on.
