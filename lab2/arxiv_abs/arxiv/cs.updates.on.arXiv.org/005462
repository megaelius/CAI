Current advances in emerging memory technologies enable novel and unconventional computing architectures
for high-performance and low-power electronic systems, capable of carrying out massively parallel
operations at the edge. One emerging technology, ReRAM, also known to belong in the family of memristors
(memory resistors), is gathering attention due to its attractive features for logic and in-memory
computing; benefits which follow from its technological attributes, such as nanoscale dimensions,
low power operation and multi-state programming. At the same time, design with CMOS is quickly reaching
its physical and functional limitations, and further research towards novel logic families, such
as Threshold Logic Gates (TLGs) is scoped. TLGs constitute a logic family known for its high-speed
and low power consumption, yet rely on conventional transistor technology. Introducing memristors
enables a more affordable reconfiguration capability of TLGs. Through this work, we are introducing
a physical implementation of a memristor-based current-mode TLG (MCMTLG) circuit and validate
its design and operation through multiple experimental setups. We demonstrate 2-input and 3-input
MCMTLG configurations and showcase their reconfiguration capability. This is achieved by varying
memristive weights arbitrarily for shaping the classification decision boundary, thus showing
promise as an alternative hardware-friendly implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Through the employment of real memristor devices as the equivalent of synaptic weights in TLGs,
we are realizing components that can be used towards an in-silico classifier.
