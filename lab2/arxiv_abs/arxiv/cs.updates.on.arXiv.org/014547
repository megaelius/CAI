Change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing images is crucial for disaster damage assessment.
Recent methods use homogenous transformation, which transforms the heterogeneous optical and
SAR remote sensing images into the same feature space, to achieve change detection. Such transformations
mainly operate on the low-level feature space and may corrupt the semantic content, deteriorating
the performance of change detection. To solve this problem, this paper presents a new homogeneous
transformation model termed deep homogeneous feature fusion (DHFF) based on image style transfer
(IST). Unlike the existing methods, the DHFF method segregates the semantic content and the style
features in the heterogeneous images to perform homogeneous transformation. The separation of
the semantic content and the style in homogeneous transformation prevents the corruption of image
semantic content, especially in the regions of change. In this way, the detection performance is
improved with accurate homogeneous transformation. Furthermore, we present a new iterative IST
(IIST) strategy, where the cost function in each IST iteration measures and thus maximizes the feature
homogeneity in additional new feature subspaces for change detection. After that, change detection
is accomplished accurately on the original and the transformed images that are in the same feature
space. Real remote sensing images acquired by SAR and optical satellites are utilized to evaluate
the performance of the proposed method. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed DHFF method
achieves significant improvement for change detection in heterogeneous optical and SAR remote
sensing images, in terms of both accuracy rate and Kappa index.
