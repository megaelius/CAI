Over the last decades, numerous security and privacy issues in all three active mobile network generations
have been revealed that threaten users as well as network providers. In view of the newest generation
(5G) currently under development, we now have the unique opportunity to identify research directions
for the next generation based on existing security and privacy issues as well as already proposed
defenses. This paper aims to unify security knowledge on mobile phone networks into a comprehensive
overview and to derive pressing open research questions. To achieve this systematically, we develop
a methodology that categorizes known attacks by their aim, proposed defenses, underlying causes,
and root causes. Further, we assess the impact and the efficacy of each attack and defense. We then
apply this methodology to existing literature on attacks and defenses in all three network generations.
By doing so, we identify ten causes and four root causes of attacks. Mapping the attacks to proposed
defenses and suggestions for the 5G specification enables us to uncover open research questions
and challenges for the development of next-generation mobile networks. The problems of unsecured
pre-authentication traffic and jamming attacks exist across all three mobile generations. They
should be addressed in the future, in particular, to wipe out the class of downgrade attacks and,
thereby, strengthen the users' privacy. Further advances are needed in the areas of inter-operator
protocols as well as secure baseband implementations. Mitigations against signal denial-of-service
attacks by smart protocol also design represent open research questions.
