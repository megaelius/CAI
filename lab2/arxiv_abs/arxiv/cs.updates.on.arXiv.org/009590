The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly empowering people with an interconnected world of
physical objects ranging from smart buildings to portable smart devices such as wearables. With
recent advances in mobile sensing, wearables have become a rich collection of portable sensors
and are able to provide various types of services including tracking of health and fitness, making
financial transactions, and unlocking smart locks and vehicles. Most of these services are delivered
based on users' confidential and personal data, which are stored on these wearables. Existing explicit
authentication approaches (i.e., PINs or pattern locks) for wearables suffer from several limitations,
including small or no displays, risk of shoulder surfing, and users' recall burden. Oftentimes,
users completely disable security features out of convenience. Therefore, there is a need for a
burden-free (implicit) authentication mechanism for wearable device users based on easily obtainable
biometric data. In this paper, we present an implicit wearable device user authentication mechanism
using combinations of three types of coarse-grain minute-level biometrics: behavioral (step
counts), physiological (heart rate), and hybrid (calorie burn and metabolic equivalent of task).
From our analysis of over 400 Fitbit users from a 17-month long health study, we are able to authenticate
subjects with average accuracy values of around .93 (sedentary) and .90 (non-sedentary) with equal
error rates of .05 using binary SVM classifiers. Our findings also show that the hybrid biometrics
perform better than other biometrics and behavioral biometrics do not have a significant impact,
even during non-sedentary periods.
