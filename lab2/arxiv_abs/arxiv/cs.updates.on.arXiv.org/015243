Differential machine learning (ML) extends supervised learning, with models trained on examples
of not only inputs and labels, but also differentials of labels to inputs. Differential ML is applicable
in all situations where high quality first order derivatives wrt training inputs are available.
In the context of financial Derivatives risk management, pathwise differentials are efficiently
computed with automatic adjoint differentiation (AAD). Differential ML, combined with AAD, provides
extremely effective pricing and risk approximations. We can produce fast pricing analytics in
models too complex for closed form solutions, extract the risk factors of complex transactions
and trading books, and effectively compute risk management metrics like reports across a large
number of scenarios, backtesting and simulation of hedge strategies, or capital regulations.
The article focuses on differential deep learning (DL), arguably the strongest application. Standard
DL trains neural networks (NN) on punctual examples, whereas differential DL teaches them the shape
of the target function, resulting in vastly improved performance, illustrated with a number of
numerical examples, both idealized and real world. In the online appendices, we apply differential
learning to other ML models, like classic regression or principal component analysis (PCA), with
equally remarkable results. This paper is meant to be read in conjunction with its companion GitHub
repo https://github.com/differential-machine-learning, where we posted a TensorFlow implementation,
tested on Google Colab, along with examples from the article and additional ones. We also posted
appendices covering many practical implementation details not covered in the paper, mathematical
proofs, application to ML models besides neural networks and extensions necessary for a reliable
implementation in production.
