Sleep staging plays an important role in assessment and treatment of sleep issues. This work proposes
a joint classification-and-prediction framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
for automatic sleep staging, and, subsequently, introduces a simple yet efficient CNN architecture
to power the framework. Given a single input epoch, the framework jointly determines its label (classification)
and those of its neighboring epochs in the contextual output (prediction). While the proposed framework
is orthogonal to the widely adopted classification schemes, which takes one or multiple epochs
as a contextual input and produces a single classification decision on the target epoch, we demonstrate
its advantages in different ways. First, it leverages the dependency among consecutive sleep epochs
while surpassing the problems experienced with the common classification schemes. Second, even
with a single model, the framework effortlessly produces multiple decisions as in ensemble-of-models
methods which are essential in obtaining a good performance. Probabilistic aggregation techniques
are then proposed to leverage the availability of multiple decisions. We demonstrate good performance
on the Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS) dataset consisting 200 subjects with an average
accuracy of 83.6%. We also show that the proposed framework not only is superior to the baselines
based on the common classification schemes but also outperforms existing deep-learning approaches.
To our knowledge, this is the first work going beyond the standard single-output classification
to consider neural networks with multiple outputs for automatic sleep staging. This framework
could provide avenues for further studies of different neural-network architectures for this
problem.
