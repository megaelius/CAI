Proof of Stake (PoS) is a burgeoning Sybil resistance mechanism that aims to have a digital asset
("token") serve as security collateral in crypto networks. However, PoS has so far eluded a comprehensive
threat model that encompasses both Byzantine attacks from distributed systems and financial attacks
that arise from the dual usage of the token as a means of payment and a Sybil resistance mechanism.
In particular, the existence of derivatives markets makes malicious coordination among validators
easier to execute than in Proof of Work systems. We demonstrate that it is also possible for on-chain
lending smart contracts to cannibalize network security in PoS systems. When the yield provided
by these contracts is more attractive than the inflation rate provided from staking, stakers will
tend to remove their staked tokens and lend them out, thus reducing network security. In this paper,
we provide a simple stochastic model that describes how rational validators with varying risk preferences
react to changes in staking and lending returns. For a particular configuration of this model, we
provide a formal proof of a phase transition between equilibria in which tokens are predominantly
staked and those in which they are predominantly lent. We further validate this emergent adversarial
behavior (e.g. reduced staked token supply) with agent-based simulations that sample transitions
under more realistic conditions. Our results illustrate that rational, non-adversarial actors
can dramatically reduce PoS network security if block rewards are not calibrated appropriately
above the expected yields of on-chain lending.
