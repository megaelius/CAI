In recent years, large amount of high spatial-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images are available
for land-cover mapping. However, due to the complex information brought by the increased spatial
resolution and the data disturbances caused by different conditions of image acquisition, it is
often difficult to find an efficient method for achieving accurate land-cover classification
with high-resolution and heterogeneous remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a scheme
to apply deep model obtained from labeled land-cover dataset to classify unlabeled HRRS images.
The main idea is to rely on deep neural networks for presenting the contextual information contained
in different types of land-covers and propose a pseudo-labeling and sample selection scheme for
improving the transferability of deep models. More precisely, a deep Convolutional Neural Networks
is first pre-trained with a well-annotated land-cover dataset, referred to as the source data.
Then, given a target image with no labels, the pre-trained CNN model is utilized to classify the image
in a patch-wise manner. The patches with high confidence are assigned with pseudo-labels and employed
as the queries to retrieve related samples from the source data. The pseudo-labels confirmed with
the retrieved results are regarded as supervised information for fine-tuning the pre-trained
deep model. To obtain a pixel-wise land-cover classification with the target image, we rely on the
fine-tuned CNN and develop a hybrid classification by combining patch-wise classification and
hierarchical segmentation. In addition, we create a large-scale land-cover dataset containing
150 Gaofen-2 satellite images for CNN pre-training. Experiments on multi-source HRRS images show
encouraging results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme to land-cover classification.
