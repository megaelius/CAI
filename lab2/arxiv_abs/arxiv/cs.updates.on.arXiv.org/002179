In vehicular cloud computing (VCC) systems, the computational resources of moving vehicles are
exploited and managed by infrastructures, e.g., roadside units, to provide computational services.
The offloading of computational tasks and collection of results rely on successful transmissions
between vehicles and infrastructures during encounters. In this paper, we investigate how to provide
timely computational services in VCC systems. In particular, we seek to minimize the deadline violation
probability given a set of tasks to be executed in vehicular clouds. Due to the uncertainty of vehicle
movements, the task replication methodology is leveraged which allows one task to be executed by
several vehicles, and thus trading computational resources for delay reduction. The optimal task
replication policy is of key interest. We first formulate the problem as a finite-horizon sampled-time
Markov decision problem and obtain the optimal policy by value iterations. To conquer the complexity
issue, we propose the balanced-task-assignment (BETA) policy which is proved optimal and has a
clear structure: it always assigns the task with the minimum number of replicas. Moreover, a tight
closed-form performance upper bound for the BETA policy is derived, which indicates that the deadline
violation probability follows the Rayleigh distribution approximately. Applying the vehicle
speed-density relationship in the traffic flow theory, we find that vehicle mobility benefits
VCC systems more compared with road traffic systems, by showing that the optimum vehicle speed to
minimize the deadline violation probability is larger than the critical vehicle speed in traffic
theory which maximizes traffic flow efficiency.
