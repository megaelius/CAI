In the kPath problem the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and the goal is to decide whether $G$
contains a simple path of length $k$. The fastest algorithm known for the directed version of this
problem runs in time $2^k\mathsf{poly}(n)$ [Williams, IPL, 2009] and for the undirected version
in time $1.66^k\mathsf{poly}(n)$ [Bj\"orklund et al., JCSS, 2014], while the only known lower
bound for these problems is $2^{\Omega(k)}\mathsf{poly}(n)$ assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis
(ETH), and finding any conditional lower bound with explicit constant in the exponent has been an
important open problem. Motivated by this challenge, we study the kHyperPath problem which is a
generalization of kPath to finding tight paths in $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ nodes and $m$ hyperedges,
namely, a sequence of $k$ nodes such that for every $r$ consecutive nodes in the sequence there is
an edge in the graph containing them. This problem was investigated in its cycle variant for large
values of the uniformity parameter $r\in [\omega(k),k)$ [Lincoln et al., SODA 2018], where a conditional
lower bound of $\tilde{O}(n^k)$ was presented. Considering smaller values of $r$, for every integer
$r\geq 3$ we show an algorithm with running time $(2+\varepsilon)^k m^{O(r\log r/\varepsilon)}$
for kHyperPath even for the directed version of this problem, which additionally has a permutation
for each edge, and requires the path to comply with those permutations. This running time is nearly
optimal as a $(2-\gamma)^k\mathsf{poly}(m)$-time algorithm with $\gamma$ independent of $r$
is probably impossible by our main result, as follows. We present a hierarchy of conditional lower
bounds assuming the Set Cover Conjecture, where for even undirected kHyperPath with \textit{explicit}
constants in the exponents, where for growing values of $r$ the problem requires time that approaches
$2^k\mathsf{poly}(m)$.
