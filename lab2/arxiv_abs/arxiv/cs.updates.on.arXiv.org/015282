We consider a routing game among non-atomic agents where link latency functions are conditional
on an uncertain state of the network. All the agents have the same prior belief about the state, but
only a fixed fraction receive private route recommendations. These recommendations are generated
by a publicly known 'signal' which maps state to a probability distribution over route recommendations.
The agents who do not receive recommendation choose route according to Bayes Nash flow with respect
to the prior. We develop a computational approach to solve the optimal information design problem,
i.e., to minimize expected social latency cost over all 'obedient' signals. A signal is obedient
if, for every agent, its recommended route is weakly better than other routes with respect to the
posterior induced by the signal. Computing the unique Bayes Nash flow for non-receiving agents
under a given signal is known to be convex. Given flow induced by non-receiving agents, we cast the
optimal information design problem for the receiving agents as an instance of the generalized problem
of moments. For affine latency functions, we exploit the structure of the obedience constraint
and the cost function to establish that it is sufficient to consider one-atomic signals. This implies
that there exists an optimal signal whose moment matrix has rank one, and therefore the information
design problem can be solved exactly by a semidefinite program. We provide numerical evidence to
suggest that the natural procedure to alternate between computing Bayes Nash flow for non-receiving
agents and optimal signal for receiving agents, while keeping the other fixed, is globally monotonically
convergent.
