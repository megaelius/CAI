Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are appealing for the purpose of classification of hand
movements from surface electromyography (sEMG) data because they have the ability to perform automated
person-specific feature extraction from raw data. In this paper, we make the novel contribution
of proposing and evaluating a design for the early processing layers in the deep CNN for multichannel
sEMG. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal-to-spatial (TtS) CNN architecture, where the
first layer performs convolution separately on each sEMG channel to extract temporal features.
This is motivated by the idea that sEMG signals in each channel are mediated by one or a small subset
of muscles, whose temporal activation patterns are associated with the signature features of a
gesture. The temporal layer captures these signature features for each channel separately, which
are then spatially mixed in successive layers to recognise a specific gesture. A practical advantage
is that this approach also makes the CNN simple to design for different sample rates. We use NinaPro
database 1 (27 subjects and 52 movements + rest), sampled at 100 Hz, and database 2 (40 subjects and
40 movements + rest), sampled at 2 kHz, to evaluate our proposed CNN design. We benchmark against
a feature-based support vector machine (SVM) classifier, two CNNs from the literature, and an additional
standard design of CNN. We find that our novel TtS CNN design achieves 66.6% per-class accuracy on
database 1, and 67.8% on database 2, and that the TtS CNN outperforms all other compared classifiers
using a statistical hypothesis test at the 2% significance level.
