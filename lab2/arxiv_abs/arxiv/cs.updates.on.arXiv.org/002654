The foundations of all methodologies for the measurement and verification (M&V) of energy savings
are based on the same five key principles: accuracy, completeness, conservatism, consistency
and transparency. The most widely accepted methodologies tend to generalise M&V so as to ensure
applicability across the spectrum of energy conservation measures (ECM's). These do not provide
a rigid calculation procedure to follow. This paper aims to bridge the gap between high-level methodologies
and the practical application of modelling algorithms, with a focus on the industrial buildings
sector. This is achieved with the development of a novel, machine learning supported methodology
for M&V 2.0 which enables accurate quantification of savings. A novel and computationally efficient
feature selection algorithm and powerful machine learning regression algorithms are employed
to maximise the effectiveness of available data. The baseline period energy consumption is modelled
using artificial neural networks, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbours and multiple
ordinary least squares regression. Improved knowledge discovery and an expanded boundary of analysis
allow more complex energy systems be analysed, thus increasing the applicability of M&V. A case
study in a large biomedical manufacturing facility is used to demonstrate the methodology's ability
to accurately quantify the savings under real-world conditions. The ECM was found to result in 604,527
kWh of energy savings with 57% uncertainty at a confidence interval of 68%. 20 baseline energy models
are developed using an exhaustive approach with the optimal model being used to quantify savings.
The range of savings estimated with each model are presented and the acceptability of uncertainty
is reviewed. The case study demonstrates the ability of the methodology to perform M&V to an acceptable
standard in challenging circumstances.
