Automatic detection of prohibited objects within passenger baggage is important for aviation
security. X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) based 3D imaging is widely used in airports for aviation
security screening whilst prior work on automatic prohibited item detection focus primarily on
2D X-ray imagery. These works have proven the possibility of extending deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN) based automatic prohibited item detection from 2D X-ray imagery to volumetric 3D
CT baggage security screening imagery. However, previous work on 3D object detection in baggage
security screening imagery focused on the detection of one specific type of objects (e.g., either
{\it bottles} or {\it handguns}). As a result, multiple models are needed if more than one type of
prohibited item is required to be detected in practice. In this paper, we consider the detection
of multiple object categories of interest using one unified framework. To this end, we formulate
a more challenging multi-class 3D object detection problem within 3D CT imagery and propose a viable
solution (3D RetinaNet) to tackle this problem. To enhance the performance of detection we investigate
a variety of strategies including data augmentation and varying backbone networks. Experimentation
carried out to provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the proposed approach
to multi-class 3D object detection within 3D CT baggage security screening imagery. Experimental
results demonstrate the combination of the 3D RetinaNet and a series of favorable strategies can
achieve a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 65.3\% over five object classes (i.e. {\it bottles, handguns,
binoculars, glock frames, iPods}). The overall performance is affected by the poor performance
on {\it glock frames} and {\it iPods} due to the lack of data and their resemblance with the baggage
clutter.
