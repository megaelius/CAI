Precise determination of target is an essential procedure in prostate interventions, such as the
prostate biopsy, lesion detection and targeted therapy. However, the prostate delineation may
be tough in some cases due to tissue ambiguity or lack of partial anatomical boundary. To address
this problem, we proposed a weakly supervised registration-based framework for the precise prostate
segmentation, by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) with statistical shape model (SSM).
To obtain the prostate region, an inception-based neural network (SSM-Net) was firstly exploited
to predict the model transform, shape control parameters and a fine-tuning vector, for the generation
of prostate boundary. According to the inferred boundary, a normalized distance map was calculated.
Then, a residual U-net (ResU-Net) was employed to predict a probability label map from the input
images. Finally, the average of the distance map and the probability map was regarded as the prostate
segmentation. After that, two public dataset PROMISE12 and NCI- ISBI 2013 were utilized for the
model computation and for the network training and testing. The validation results demonstrate
that the segmentation framework using a SSM with 9500 nodes achieved the best performance, with
a dice of 0.904 and an average surface distance of 1.88 mm. In addition, we verified the impact of model
elasticity augmentation and fine-tuning item on the network segmentation capability. As a result,
both factors have improved the delineation accuracy, with dice increased by 10% and 7% respectively.
In conclusion, via the combination of two weakly supervised neural networks, our segmentation
method might be an effective and robust approach for prostate segmentation.
