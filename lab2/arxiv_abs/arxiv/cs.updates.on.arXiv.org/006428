An ability to map seizure-generating brain tissue, i.e., the seizure onset zone (SOZ), without
recording actual seizures could reduce the duration of invasive EEG monitoring for patients with
drug-resistant epilepsy. A widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence
(events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers associated with epileptic
brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous seizures recorded with intracranial EEG,
primarily using a single biomarker. Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from
their inability to generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient variability
and (b) the temporal variability in the epileptogenic activity. Here, we report an artificial intelligence-based
approach for combining multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal
characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it can reliably identify
seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who underwent evaluation for drug-resistant
epilepsy. Our investigation provides evidence that utilizing the complementary information
provided by multiple electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics can
significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously published single-biomarker
incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in
a cohort of 82 patients. Our results also suggest that recording durations between ninety minutes
and two hours are sufficient to localize SOZs with accuracies that may prove clinically relevant.
The successful validation of our approach on a large cohort of 82 patients warrants future investigation
on the feasibility of utilizing intra-operative EEG monitoring and artificial intelligence to
localize epileptogenic brain tissue.
