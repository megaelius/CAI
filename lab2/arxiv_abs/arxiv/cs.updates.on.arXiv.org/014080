Having a cognitive and self-optimizing network that proactively adapts not only to channel conditions,
but also according to its users needs can be one of the highest forthcoming priorities of future 6G
Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary approach
linking the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio resource optimization
in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naive Bayesian
(NB) classifier, logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system
to analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings from body-attached
internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood of an imminent stroke. We convert the
stroke likelihood into a risk factor functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming
(MILP) optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate physical resource blocks (PRBs)
to HetNet users while prioritizing OPs by granting them high gain PRBs according to the severity
of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs to send their critical data to their healthcare
provider with minimized delay. To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted
sum rate maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The proposed
approaches increased the OPs average signal to interference plus noise (SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively.
The WSRMax approach increased the system total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach,
nevertheless, the PF approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin
of error.
