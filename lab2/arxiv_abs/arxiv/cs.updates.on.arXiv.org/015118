We introduce a new technique to visualize complex flowing phenomena by using concepts from shape
analysis. Our approach uses techniques that examine the intrinsic geometry of manifolds through
their heat kernel, to obtain representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and
multi-scale. These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point on
that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for classification and segmentation
that identify points that have similar structural properties. Our approach adapts heat kernel
signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a notion of shape where pathlines are observations
of a manifold living in a high-dimensional space. We use this space to compute and visualize heat
kernel signatures associated with each pathline. Besides being able to capture the structural
features of a pathline, heat kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different
flow datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power of heat kernel
signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow
datasets taken from ensemble simulations with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only
requires the pathlines themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly.
We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled from a continuous,
unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that have varying density and potential
unknown boundaries. We evaluate our approach through visualizations of a variety of two-dimensional
unsteady flows.
