We consider monotone inclusion problems where the operators may be expectation-valued. A direct
application of proximal and splitting schemes is complicated by resolving problems with expectation-valued
maps at each step, a concern that is addressed by using sampling. Accordingly, we propose avenues
for addressing uncertainty in the mapping. (i) Variance-reduced stochastic proximal point method
(vr-SPP). We develop amongst the first variance-reduced stochastic proximal-point schemes that
achieves deterministic rates of convergence in terms of solving proximal-point problems. In addition,
it is shown that the schemes are characterized by either optimal or near-optimal oracle (or sample)
complexity guarantees. Finally, the generated sequences are shown to be convergent to a solution
in an almost-sure sense in both monotone and strongly monotone regimes; (ii) Variance-reduced
stochastic modified forward-backward splitting scheme (vr-SMFBS). In constrained settings,
we consider structured settings when the map can be decomposed into an expectation-valued map $A$
and a maximal monotone map $B$ with a tractable resolvent. Akin to (i), we show that the proposed schemes
are equipped with a.s. convergence guarantees, linear (strongly monotone $A$) and $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$
(monotone $A$) rates of convergence while achieving optimal oracle complexity bounds. Of these,
the rate statements in monotone regimes rely on leveraging the Fitzpatrick gap function for monotone
inclusions. Furthermore, the schemes rely on weaker moment requirements on noise as well as allow
for weakening unbiasedness requirements on oracles in strongly monotone regimes. Preliminary
numerics reflect these findings and show that the variance-reduced schemes outperform stochastic
approximation schemes, stochastic splitting and proximal point schemes, and sample-average
approximation approaches.
