Achieving better exploitation and exploration capabilities (EEC) have always been an important
yet challenging issue in evolutionary optimization algorithm (EOA) design. The difficulties
lie in obtaining a good balance in EEC, which is cooperatively determined by operations and parameters
in an EOA. When deficiencies in exploitation or exploration are observed, most existing works only
consider supplementing it, either by designing new operations or by altering the parameters. Unfortunately,
when different situations are encountered, these proposals may fail to be the winner. To address
these problems, this paper proposes an explicit EEC control method named selective-candidate
framework with similarity selection rule (SCSS). On the one hand, M (M > 1) candidates are generated
from each current solution with independent operations and parameters to enrich the search. While
on the other hand, a similarity selection rule is designed to determine the final candidate. By considering
the fitness ranking of the current solution and its Euclidian distance to each of these M candidates,
superior current solutions select the closest to be the final candidate for efficient local exploitation
while inferior ones would favor the farthest candidate for exploration purpose. In this way, the
rule is able to synthesize exploitation and exploration, making the evolution more effective.
The proposed SCSS framework is general and easy to implement. It has been applied to three classic,
four state-of-the-art and four up-to-date EOAs from the branches of differential evolution, evolution
strategy and particle swarm optimization. As confirmed with simulation results, significant
performance enhancement is achieved.
