A large-scale dataset of measurements of ETSI ITS-G5 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC)
is presented. Our dataset consists of network interactions happening between two On-Board Units
(OBUs) and four Road Side Units (RSUs). Each OBU was fitted onto a vehicle. The two vehicles have been
driven across the Innovate UK-funded FLOURISH Test Track encompassing key roads in the center of
Bristol, UK. As for the RSUs, they were located at fixed locations around the track. Each RSU and OBU
were equipped with two transceivers operating at different frequencies. During our experiments,
each transceiver broadcast Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) every 10 ms to the neighboring
RSUs and OBUs. Our dataset contains eight experimental sessions of the length of $\sim$2 h each that
have taken place over four days -- allocating two experimental sessions per-day. On each day, the
two transceivers onboard each device were operated on two different frequencies. In particular,
we operated the transceivers both over the licensed DSRC band, and over the unlicensed Industrial,
Scientific, and Medical radio (ISM) bands 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz. During each experimental
session, for each transceiver, all the transmitted and received CAMs were recorded. For each of
the received CAMs, we also recorded its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the location
of the receiving transceiver. The dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.eupowp7h3jl525yxhm3521f57,
and it has been analyzed in the following paper: I. Mavromatis, A. Tassi, and R. J. Piechocki, "Operating
ITS-G5 DSRC over Unlicensed Bands: A City-Scale Performance Evaluation," Submitted to IEEE VTC-Spring
