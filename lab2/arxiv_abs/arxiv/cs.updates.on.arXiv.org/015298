We show that the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and its many variants may be modeled as functional
optimization problems over a graph. In this formulation, all vertices and arcs of the graph are functionals;
i.e., a mapping from a space of measurable functions to the field of real numbers. Many variants of
the TSP, such as those with neighborhoods, with forbidden neighborhoods, with time-windows and
with profits, can all be framed under this construct. In sharp contrast to their discrete-optimization
counterparts, the modeling constructs presented in this paper represent a fundamentally new domain
of analysis and computation for TSPs and their variants. Beyond its apparent mathematical unification
of a class of problems in graph theory, the main advantage of the new approach is that it facilitates
the modeling of certain application-specific problems in their home space of measurable functions.
Consequently, certain elements of economic system theory such as dynamical models and continuous-time
cost/profit functionals can be directly incorporated in the new optimization problem formulation.
Furthermore, subtour elimination constraints, prevalent in discrete optimization formulations,
are naturally enforced through continuity requirements. The price for the new modeling framework
is nonsmooth functionals. Although a number of theoretical issues remain open in the proposed mathematical
framework, we demonstrate the computational viability of the new modeling constructs over a sample
set of problems to illustrate the rapid production of end-to-end TSP solutions to extensively-constrained
practical problems.
