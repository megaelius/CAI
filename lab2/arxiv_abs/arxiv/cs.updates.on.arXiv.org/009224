Crop production needs to increase in a sustainable manner to meet the growing global demand for food.
To identify crop varieties with high yield potential, plant scientists and breeders evaluate the
performance of hundreds of lines in multiple locations over several years. To facilitate the process
of selecting advanced varieties, an automated framework was developed in this study. A hyperspectral
camera was mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle to collect aerial imagery with high spatial and
spectral resolution. Aerial images were captured in two consecutive growing seasons from three
experimental yield fields composed of hundreds experimental plots (1x2.4 meter), each contained
a single wheat line. The grain of more than thousand wheat plots was harvested by a combine, weighed,
and recorded as the ground truth data. To leverage the high spatial resolution and investigate the
yield variation within the plots, images of plots were divided into sub-plots by integrating image
processing techniques and spectral mixture analysis with the expert domain knowledge. Afterwards,
the sub-plot dataset was divided into train, validation, and test sets using stratified sampling.
Subsequent to extracting features from each sub-plot, deep neural networks were trained for yield
estimation. The coefficient of determination for predicting the yield of the test dataset at sub-plot
scale was 0.79 with root mean square error of 5.90 grams. In addition to providing insights into yield
variation at sub-plot scale, the proposed framework can facilitate the process of high-throughput
yield phenotyping as a valuable decision support tool. It offers the possibility of (i) remote visual
inspection of the plots, (ii) studying the effect of crop density on yield, and (iii) optimizing
plot size to investigate more lines in a dedicated field each year.
