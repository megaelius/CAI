The theoretical fundament of various theories and applications about CS lies upon a universal stable
embedding phenomenon brought by compressive measurement matrices. While in this paper, we explore
a similar embedding phenomenon of compressive measurement matrices upon a novel and more general
signal model, named Grassmann Manifold. Grassmann Manifold is believed to be a novel signal model,
and is more general and powerful than the conventional unions of subspaces model commonly used in
Compressive Sensing. Motivated by this, in this paper, we consider the concept of formulating signals
as points on Grassmann Manifold, with volume and product of principal sines utilized as generalized
norm and distance measure. We propose a volume preservation property of Gaussian random measurement
matrices for all multi-dimensional parallelotopes in a finite set on Grassmann Manifold, named
by stable volume embedding property. This property is a multi-dimensional generalization of the
conventional RIP or stable embedding property, which only concerns approximate preservation
of length of vectors in some unions of subspaces. Rigorous proof and detailed discussions are also
given. Besides, we further explore the application of the stable volume embedding to analyze our
generalized distance measure of signals on Grassmann Manifold from compressive measurements.
We find that the product of principal sines between points on Grassmann Manifold is well preserved
in the compressed domain by the stable volume embedding property. And this product of principal
sines can be directly calculated using basic matrix functions of received multi-dimensional data
matrices, thus it is believed to be both a trustworthy and efficient distance measure for signals
on Grassmann Manifold from compressive measurements.
