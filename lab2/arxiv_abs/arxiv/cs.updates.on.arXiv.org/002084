Four key processes in data integration are: data preparation (i.e., extracting, transforming,
and cleaning data), schema integration (i.e., identifying attribute correspondences), entity
resolution (i.e., finding clusters of records that represent the same entity) and entity consolidation
(i.e., merging each cluster into a 'golden record', which contains the canonical value for each
attribute). In real-world scenarios, Master Data Management (MDM) is often employed to perform
the last two steps using a 'match-merge' module, which is driven by a collection of user-written
match and merge rules. However, it is well understood that such solutions often fail to scale to the
sizes and complexity of problems currently being addressed. Scalable solutions to entity resolution
have been previously developed to generate a collection of clusters of records representing the
same entity. In this paper, we propose a scalable entity consolidation algorithm to merge these
clusters into 'golden records'. We first automatically generate matching rules from the clusters
and then group these rules into sets with common characteristics to cut down on the number which must
be verified by a human. Next, for the human-approved rule groups, we apply them to merge the duplicate
attribute values in the clusters. Finally, we employ existing truth discovery methods, such as
majority consensus (MC), to resolve remaining conflicts in the clusters. We applied our methods
on three real-world datasets. In a dataset with 31,023 clusters and 80,451 duplicate records, 72,239
matching rules were generated. By having a human con rm only 100 algorithm-generated rule groups,
we achieved a recall of 75% and a precision of 98% for merging duplicate attribute values. When we
invoked our algorithm prior to running MC, we improved the precision of golden record construction
by 40%.
