We address the following dynamic version of the school choice question: a city, named City, admits
students in two temporally-separated rounds, denoted $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$.
In round $\mathcal{R}_1$, the capacity of each school is fixed but in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, the
City is happy to allocate extra seats to specific schools per the recommendation of the mechanism;
in turn, the latter has to meet specified requirements. We study three natural settings of this model,
with the requirements getting increasingly more stringent. For Settings I and II, we give pairs
of polynomial time mechanisms $(\mathcal{M}_1, \mathcal{M}_2)$ which, besides addressing the
specific requirements, find stable matchings, are dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC)
w.r.t. reporting preference lists of students, and never break, in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, a match
created in round $\mathcal{R}_1$. In Setting III, the mechanism needs to deal with residents of
the City who try to game the system by not participating in round $\mathcal{R}_1$ and only showing
up in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, in addition to gaming by misreporting preference lists. We introduce
two new notions: 1. Non-oblivious mechanism: A mechanism that needs to know the preference lists
of {\em all} students who reside in the City, including the ones who don't participate in round $\mathcal{R}_1$
but could potentially participate in round $\mathcal{R}_2$. 2. Weak incentive compatible (WIC)
mechanism: A mechanism under which a student cannot gain by misreporting her choices, provided
all other students are truthful. i.e., truth revealing is not necessarily dominant strategy. After
establishing, via two impossibility results, that the strongest result we can hope to obtain for
Setting III is a pair of non-oblivious, stability-preserving, WIC mechanisms, we present such
a pair, which moreover runs in polynomial time.
