Aerators are essential and important auxiliary devices in intensive culture, especially in industrial
culture of aquaculture. Using existing surveillance cameras to realize real-time and automatic
detection of the object region and working state of aerators is a no-cost and real-time method, which
also provides a useful reference and attempt for intelligent agriculture and agricultural expert
systems. However, this expert system mainly faces three challenges: Firstly, the size and shape
of object region vary greatly depending on the position and angle of surveillance cameras. Secondly,
the interference factors, e.g., illumination, occlusion, complex background, etc., are strong,
so feature extraction is difficult to guarantee robustness. Finally, the expert system in real
applications requires real-time, robust and accurate features. To tackle these aforementioned
challenges, we propose an object region detection process based on reference frame Kanade Lucas
Tomasi (RF-KLT) algorithm to screen the small object region from candidate regions. Moreover,
we present a robust motion feature extraction method based on RF-KLT algorithm in a fixed region.
In addition, we also introduce a dimension reduction method for time series, which is used to establish
a feature dataset with obvious boundaries between classes. The experimental results show that
the accuracy for detecting object region and working state of aerators in the complex background
is 100% and 99.9% respectively, and the detection speed is 77-333 frames per second (FPS) according
to the different types of surveillance camera. The proposed expert system presents a complete solution
for the object region and working state detection of aerators, and achieves real-time, online and
state-of-the-art results in both the actual dataset and the augmented dataset.
