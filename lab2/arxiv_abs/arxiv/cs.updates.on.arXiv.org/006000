Comprehensive surgical planning require complex patient-specific anatomical models. For instance,
functional muskuloskeletal simulations necessitate all relevant structures to be segmented,
which could be performed in real-time using deep neural networks given sufficient annotated samples.
Such large datasets of multiple structure annotations are costly to procure and are often unavailable
in practice. Nevertheless, annotations from different studies and centers can be readily available,
or become available in the future in an incremental fashion. We propose a class-incremental segmentation
framework for extending a deep network trained for some anatomical structure to yet another structure
using a small incremental annotation set. Through distilling knowledge from the current state
of the framework, we bypass the need for a full retraining. This is a meta-method to extend any choice
of desired deep segmentation network with only a minor addition per structure, which makes it suitable
for lifelong class-incremental learning and applicable also for future deep neural network architectures.
We evaluated our methods on a public knee dataset of 100 MR volumes. Through varying amount of incremental
annotation ratios, we show how our proposed method can retain the previous anatomical structure
segmentation performance superior to the conventional finetuning approach. In addition, our
framework inherently exploits transferable knowledge from previously trained structures to
incremental tasks, demonstrated by superior results compared to non-incremental training. With
the presented method, new anatomical structures can be learned without catastrophic forgetting
of older structures and without extensive increase of memory and complexity.
