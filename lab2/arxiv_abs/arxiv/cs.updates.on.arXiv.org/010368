The majority of multi-agent system (MAS) implementations aim to optimise agents' policies with
respect to a single objective, despite the fact that many real-world problem domains are inherently
multi-objective in nature. Multi-objective multi-agent systems (MOMAS) explicitly consider
the possible trade-offs between conflicting objective functions. We argue that, in MOMAS, such
compromises should be analysed on the basis of the utility that these compromises have for the users
of a system. As is standard in multi-objective optimisation, we model the user utility using utility
functions that map value or return vectors to scalar values. This approach naturally leads to two
different optimisation criteria: expected scalarised returns (ESR) and scalarised expected
returns (SER). We develop a new taxonomy which classifies multi-objective multi-agent decision
making settings, on the basis of the reward structures, and which and how utility functions are applied.
This allows us to offer a structured view of the field, to clearly delineate the current state-of-the-art
in multi-objective multi-agent decision making approaches and to identify promising directions
for future research. Starting from the execution phase, in which the selected policies are applied
and the utility for the users is attained, we analyse which solution concepts apply to the different
settings in our taxonomy. Furthermore, we define and discuss these solution concepts under both
ESR and SER optimisation criteria. We conclude with a summary of our main findings and a discussion
of many promising future research directions in multi-objective multi-agent systems.
