The wide deployment of tokens for digital assets on top of Ethereum implies the need for powerful
trading platforms. Vickrey auctions have been known to determine the real market price of items
as bidders are motivated to submit their own monetary valuations without leaking their information
to the competitors. Recent constructions have utilized various cryptographic protocols such
as ZKP and MPC, however, these approaches either are partially privacy-preserving or require complex
computations with several rounds. In this paper, we overcome these limits by presenting Trustee
as a Vickrey auction on Ethereum which fully preserves bids' privacy at relatively much lower fees.
Trustee consists of three components: a front-end smart contract deployed on Ethereum, an Intel
SGX enclave, and a relay to redirect messages between them. Initially, the enclave generates an
Ethereum account and ECDH key-pair. Subsequently, the relay publishes the account's address and
ECDH public key on the smart contract. As a prerequisite, bidders are encouraged to verify the authenticity
and security of Trustee by using the SGX remote attestation service. To participate in the auction,
bidders utilize the ECDH public key to encrypt their bids and submit them to the smart contract. Once
the bidding interval is closed, the relay retrieves the encrypted bids and feeds them to the enclave
that autonomously generates a signed transaction indicating the auction winner. Finally, the
relay submits the transaction to the smart contract which verifies the transaction's authenticity
and the parameters' consistency before accepting the claimed auction winner. As part of our contributions,
we have made a prototype for Trustee available on Github for the community to review and inspect it.
Additionally, we analyze the security features of Trustee and report on the transactions' gas cost
incurred on Trustee smart contract.
