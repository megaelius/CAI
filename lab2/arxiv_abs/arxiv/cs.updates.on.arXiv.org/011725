Spectral graph sparsification aims to find ultra-sparse subgraphs whose Laplacian matrix can
well approximate the original Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In recent years, spectral
sparsification techniques have been extensively studied for accelerating various numerical
and graph-related applications. Prior nearly-linear-time spectral sparsification methods
first extract low-stretch spanning tree from the original graph to form the backbone of the sparsifier,
and then recover small portions of spectrally-critical off-tree edges to the spanning tree to significantly
improve the approximation quality. However, it is not clear how many off-tree edges should be recovered
for achieving a desired spectral similarity level within the sparsifier. Motivated by recent graph
signal processing techniques, this paper proposes a similarity-aware spectral graph sparsification
framework that leverages efficient spectral off-tree edge embedding and filtering schemes to
construct spectral sparsifiers with guaranteed spectral similarity (relative condition number)
level. An iterative graph densification scheme is also introduced to facilitate efficient and
effective filtering of off-tree edges for highly ill-conditioned problems. The proposed method
has been validated using various kinds of graphs obtained from public domain sparse matrix collections
relevant to VLSI CAD, finite element analysis, as well as social and data networks frequently studied
in many machine learning and data mining applications. For instance, a sparse SDD matrix with 40
million unknowns and 180 million nonzeros can be solved (1E-3 accuracy level) within two minutes
using a single CPU core and about 6GB memory.
