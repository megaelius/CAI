In two-player games on graphs, the players move a token through a graph to produce an infinite path,
which determines the winner or payoff of the game. Such games are central in formal verification
since they model the interaction between a non-terminating system and its environment. We study
{\em bidding games} in which the players bid for the right to move the token. Two bidding rules have
been defined. In {\em Richman} bidding, in each round, the players simultaneously submit bids,
and the higher bidder moves the token and pays the other player. {\em Poorman} bidding is similar
except that the winner of the bidding pays the "bank" rather than the other player. While poorman
reachability games have been studied before, we present, for the first time, results on {\em infinite-duration}
poorman games. A central quantity in these games is the {\em ratio} between the two players' initial
budgets. The questions we study concern a necessary and sufficient ratio with which a player can
achieve a goal. For reachability objectives, such {\em threshold ratios} are known to exist for
both bidding rules. We show that the properties of poorman reachability games extend to complex
qualitative objectives such as parity, similarly to the Richman case. Our most interesting results
concern quantitative poorman games, namely poorman mean-payoff games, where we construct optimal
strategies depending on the initial ratio, by showing a connection with {\em random-turn based
games}. The connection in itself is interesting, because it does not hold for reachability poorman
games. We also solve the complexity problems that arise in poorman bidding games.
