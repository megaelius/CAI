Defining a sound shift operator for signals existing on a certain graph structure, similar to the
well-defined shift operator in classical signal processing, is a crucial problem in graph signal
processing, since almost all operations, such as filtering, transformation, prediction, are
directly related to the graph shift operator. We define a set of energy-preserving shift operators
that satisfy many properties similar to their counterparts in classical signal processing. Our
definition of the graph shift operator negates the shift operators defined in the literature, such
as the graph adjacency matrix and Laplacian matrix based shift operators, which modify the energy
of a graph signal. We decouple the graph structure represented by eigengraphs and the eigenvalues
of the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We show that the adjacency matrix of a graph is indeed
a linear shift invariant (LSI) graph filter with respect to the defined shift operator. We introduce
graph finite impulse response (GFIR) and graph infinite impulse response (GIIR) filters and obtain
explicit forms for such filters. We further define autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions
of signals on the graph, enabling us to obtain the solution to the optimal filtering on graphs, i.e.,
the corresponding Wiener filtering on graphs and the efficient spectra analysis and frequency
domain filtering in parallel with those in classical signal processing. This new shift operator
based GSP framework enables the signal analysis along a correlation structure defined by a graph
shift manifold as opposed to classical signal processing operating on the assumption of the correlation
structure with a linear time shift manifold. We further provide the solution to the optimal linear
predictor problem over general graphs. Several illustrative simulations are presented to validate
the performance of the optimal LSI filters.
