The fidelity of a model relies both on its accuracy to predict the physical phenomena and its capability
to estimate unknown parameters using observations. This article focuses on this second aspect
by analyzing the reliability of two mathematical models proposed in the literature for the simulation
of heat losses through building walls. The first one, named DuFort-Frankel (DF), is the classical
heat diffusion equation combined with the DuFort-Frankel numerical scheme. The second is the so-called
RC lumped approach, based on a simple ordinary differential equation to compute the temperature
within the wall. The reliability is evaluated following a two stages method. First, samples of observations
are generated using a pseudo-spectral numerical model for the heat diffusion equation with known
input parameters. The results are then modified by adding a noise to simulate experimental measurements.
Then, for each sample of observation, the parameter estimation problem is solved using one of the
two mathematical models. The reliability is assessed based on the accuracy of the approach to recover
the unknown parameter. Three case studies are considered for the estimation of (i) the heat capacity,
(ii) the thermal conductivity or (iii) the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between the
wall and the ambient air. For all cases, the DF mathematical model has a very satisfactory reliability
to estimate the unknown parameters without any bias. However, the RC model lacks of fidelity and
reliability. The error on the estimated parameter can reach 40% for the heat capacity, 80% for the
thermal conductivity and 450% for the heat transfer coefficient.
