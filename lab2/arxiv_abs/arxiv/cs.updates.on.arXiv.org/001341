Objective: The aim of this study is to propose an adaptive scheme embedded into an open-source environment
for the estimation of the neural activation extent during deep brain stimulation and to investigate
the feasibility of approximating the neural activation extent by thresholds of the field solution.
Methods: Open-source solutions for solving the field equation in volume conductor models of deep
brain stimulation and computing the neural activation are embedded into a Python package to estimate
the neural activation dependent on the dielectric tissue properties and axon parameters by employing
a spatially adaptive scheme. Feasibility of the approximation of the neural activation extent
by field thresholds is investigated to further reduce the computational expense. Results: The
varying extents of neural activation for different patient-specific dielectric properties were
estimated with the adaptive scheme. The results revealed the strong influence of the dielectric
properties of the encapsulation layer in the acute and chronic phase after surgery. The computational
time required to determine the neural activation extent in each studied model case was substantially
reduced. Conclusion: The neural activation extent is altered by patient-specific parameters.
Threshold values of the electric potential and electric field norm facilitate a computationally
efficient method to estimate the neural activation extent. Significance: The presented adaptive
scheme is able to robustly determine neural activation extents and field threshold estimates for
varying dielectric tissue properties and axon diameters while reducing substantially the computational
expense.
