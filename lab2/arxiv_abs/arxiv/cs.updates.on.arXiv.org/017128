With the benefits of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm, come along unprecedented security challenges.
Among many applications of inter-connected systems, vehicular networks and smart cars are examples
that are already rolled out. Smart vehicles not only have networks connecting their internal components
e.g. via Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, but also are connected to the outside world through road
side units and other vehicles. In some cases, the internal and external network packets pass through
the same hardware and are merely isolated by software defined rules. Any misconfiguration opens
a window for the hackers to intrude into vehicles' internal components e.g. central lock system,
Engine Control Unit (ECU), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system.
Compromise of any of these can lead to disastrous outcomes. In this paper, we study the security of
smart vehicles' adaptive cruise control systems in the presence of covert attacks. We define two
covert/stealth attacks in the context of cruise control and propose a novel intrusion detection
and compensation method to disclose and respond to such attacks. More precisely, we focus on the
covert cyber attacks that compromise the integrity of cruise controller and employ a neural network
identifier in the IDS engine to estimate the system output dynamically and compare it against the
ACC output. If any anomaly is detected, an embedded substitute controller kicks in and takes over
the control. We conducted extensive experiments in MATLAB to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed scheme in a simulated environment.
