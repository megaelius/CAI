At present, recognition of the Bangla handwriting compound character has been an essential issue
for many years. In recent years there have been application-based researches in machine learning,
and deep learning, which is gained interest, and most notably is handwriting recognition because
it has a tremendous application such as Bangla OCR. MatrriVasha, the project which can recognize
Bangla, handwritten several compound characters. Currently, compound character recognition
is an important topic due to its variant application, and helps to create old forms, and information
digitization with reliability. But unfortunately, there is a lack of a comprehensive dataset that
can categorize all types of Bangla compound characters. MatrriVasha is an attempt to align compound
character, and it's challenging because each person has a unique style of writing shapes. After
all, MatrriVasha has proposed a dataset that intends to recognize Bangla 120(one hundred twenty)
compound characters that consist of 2552(two thousand five hundred fifty-two) isolated handwritten
characters written unique writers which were collected from within Bangladesh. This dataset faced
problems in terms of the district, age, and gender-based written related research because the samples
were collected that includes a verity of the district, age group, and the equal number of males, and
females. As of now, our proposed dataset is so far the most extensive dataset for Bangla compound
characters. It is intended to frame the acknowledgment technique for handwritten Bangla compound
character. In the future, this dataset will be made publicly available to help to widen the research.
