Today's telecommunication networks have become sources of enormous amounts of widely heterogeneous
data. This information can be retrieved from network traffic traces, network alarms, signal quality
indicators, users' behavioral data, etc. Advanced mathematical tools are required to extract
meaningful information from these data and take decisions pertaining to the proper functioning
of the networks from the network-generated data. Among these mathematical tools, Machine Learning
(ML) is regarded as one of the most promising methodological approaches to perform network-data
analysis and enable automated network self-configuration and fault management. The adoption
of ML techniques in the field of optical communication networks is motivated by the unprecedented
growth of network complexity faced by optical networks in the last few years. Such complexity increase
is due to the introduction of a huge number of adjustable and interdependent system parameters (e.g.,
routing configurations, modulation format, symbol rate, coding schemes, etc.) that are enabled
by the usage of coherent transmission/reception technologies, advanced digital signal processing
and compensation of nonlinear effects in optical fiber propagation. In this paper we provide an
overview of the application of ML to optical communications and networking. We classify and survey
relevant literature dealing with the topic, and we also provide an introductory tutorial on ML for
researchers and practitioners interested in this field. Although a good number of research papers
have recently appeared, the application of ML to optical networks is still in its infancy: to stimulate
further work in this area, we conclude the paper proposing new possible research directions.
