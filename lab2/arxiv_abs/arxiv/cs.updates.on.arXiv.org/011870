The Louisiana Department of Education partnered with the Gordon A. Cain Center at LSU to pilot a Computing
High School Graduation Pathway. The first course in the pathway, Introduction to Computational
Thinking (ICT), is designed to teach programming and reinforce mathematical practice skills of
nine-grade students, with an emphasis on promoting higher order thinking. In 2017-18, about 200
students and five teachers participated in the pilot, in 2018-2019 the participation increased
to 400 students, and in the current 2019-2020 year about 800 students in 11 schools are involved.
Professional development starts with a five-week intensive summer institute, which is complemented
with follow-up Saturday sessions and coaching support during the academic year. After describing
the course content and briefly the teacher training, we discuss the data we have collected in the
last two years. The overall student reception of the course has been positive, but the course was
categorized by most students as hard. However, the Computing Attitude Survey analysis indicates
that the difficulty of the course did not demotivate the students. The pre-post test content assessments
show that students learned not only the language, but also general principles of programming, logic
and modeling, as well as use of variables, expressions and functions. Lessons learned during the
pilot phase motivated changes, such as emphasizing during PD the need to provide timely feedback
to students, provide detailed rubrics for the projects and reorganize the lessons to increase the
initial engagement with the material. After two years of running pilots, the course is becoming
student-centered, where most of the code and image samples provided in the lessons are based on code
created by previous students.
