Advances in Wireless Sensor Network Technology (WSN) have provided the availability of small and
low-cost sensor with capability of sensing various types of physical and environmental conditions,
data processing and wireless communication. In WSN, the sensor nodes have a limited transmission
range, and their processing and storage capabilities as well as their energy resources are limited.
Triple Umpiring System (TUS) has already been proved its better performance on Wireless Sensor
Networks. Clustering technique provides an effective way to prolong the lifetime of WSN. In this
paper, we modified the Ad hoc on demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) by incorporating Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) based dynamic clustering. The proposed scheme Efficient and Secure Routing Protocol
for Wireless Sensor Networks through SNR based dynamic Clustering mechanisms (ESRPSDC) can partition
the nodes into clusters and select the Cluster Head (CH) among the nodes based on the energy and Non
Cluster Head (NCH) nodes join with a specific CH based on SNR Values. Error recovery has been implemented
during Inter cluster routing itself in order to avoid end-toend error recovery. Security has been
achieved by isolating the malicious nodes using sink based routing pattern analysis. Extensive
investigation studies using Global Mobile Simulator (GloMoSim) showed that this Hybrid ESRP significantly
improves the Energy efficiency and Packet Reception Rate (PRR) compared to SNR unaware routing
algorithms like Low Energy Aware Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Power- Efficient Gathering
in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS).
