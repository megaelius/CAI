Two of the main frameworks used for modeling information diffusions in the online are epidemic models
and Hawkes point processes. The former consider information as a viral contagion which spreads
into a population of online users, and employ tools initially developed in the field of epidemiology.
The latter view individual broadcasts of information as events in a point process and they modulate
the event rate according to observed (or assumed) social principles; they have been broadly used
in fields such as finance and geophysics. Here, we study for the first time the connection between
these two mature frameworks, and we find them to be equivalent. More precisely, the rate of events
in the Hawkes model is identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model when taking the expectation over recovery events -- which are unobserved in a Hawkes
process. This paves the way to apply tools developed for one framework across the gap, to the other
framework. We make three further contributions in this work. First, we propose HawkesN, an extension
of the basic Hawkes model, in which we introduce the notion of finite maximum number of events that
can occur. Second, we show HawkesN to explain real retweet cascades better than the current state-of-the-art
Hawkes modeling. The size of the population can be learned while observing the cascade, at the expense
of requiring larger amounts of training data. Third, we employ an SIR method based on Markov chains
for computing the final size distribution for a partially observed cascade fitted with HawkesN.
We propose an explanation to the generally perceived randomness of online popularity: the final
size distribution for real diffusion cascades tends to have two maxima, one corresponding to large
cascade sizes and another one around zero.
