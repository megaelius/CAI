Production planning in the manufacturing industry is crucial for fully utilizing factory resources
(e.g., machines, raw materials and workers) and reducing costs. With the advent of industry 4.0,
plenty of data recording the status of factory resources have been collected and further involved
in production planning, which brings an unprecedented opportunity to understand, evaluate and
adjust complex production plans through a data-driven approach. However, developing a systematic
analytics approach for production planning is often challenging due to the large volume of production
data, the complex dependence between products, and unexpected changes in the market demand, material
supplies and the production process. Previous studies only provide summarized results and fail
to show details for comparative analysis of production plans. Besides, the rapid adjustment to
the plan in the case of an unanticipated incident is also not supported. In this paper, we propose
PlanningVis, a visual analytics system to support the exploration and comparison of production
plans with three levels of details: a plan overview presenting the overall difference between plans,
a product view visualizing various properties of individual products, and a production detail
view displaying the product dependency, the daily production output and production capacity usage
in related factories. By integrating an automatic planning algorithm with interactive visual
explorations, PlanningVis is able to facilitate the efficient optimization of daily production
planning as well as support a quick response to unanticipated incidents in manufacturing. Two case
studies with real-world data and carefully designed interviews with domain experts from a world-leading
manufacturing company demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PlanningVis.
