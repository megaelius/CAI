The Quadruple Aim is a framework which prioritizes four aims, or dimensions of performance, for
innovating in the healthcare domain, respectively: 1) enhancing the individual experience of
care; 2) improving the work life of health care clinicians and staff; 3) improving the health of populations;
and 4) reducing the per capita cost of care. In this contribution, recent literature providing examples
of design research in the eHealth domain is reviewed to answer the research question: in which measure
has design research contributed to each of the four aims of eHealth innovation in the past five years?.
The results of the review are presented and employed to draw three main observations: 1) design researchers
in eHealth seem to be largely focused on improving experiences of care, either patients' or health
professionals; 2) design researchers' contribution on reducing per capita costs of care appears
to be less pronounced, which is outlined as a point for improvement; and 3) in a considerable amount
of reviewed contributions, design researchers appear to be contributing to multiple aims at once.
In this sub-group of reviewed contributions, several disciplinary areas and types of stakeholders
interact and integrate through design research activities. The latter observation leads to a reflection
on the strategic role of design research in the contexts of the convergence revolution and of the
non-communicable disease crisis. Implications of this reflection for design researchers are
recognized in the opportunity and timeliness to develop eHealth-specific ways to orchestrate
design integration. A direction for further research in this sense is identified in the use of sensory
and self-monitored data as a boundary object for eHealth innovation. The prospective value of this
direction is finally exemplified through the case of blood pressure.
