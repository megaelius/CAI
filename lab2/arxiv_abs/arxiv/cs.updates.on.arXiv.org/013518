Graph clustering objective functions with tunable resolution parameters make it possible to detect
different types of clustering structure in the same graph. These objectives also provide a unifying
view of other non-parametric objectives, which often can be captured as special cases. Previous
research has largely focused on parametric objectives for standard graphs, in which all nodes are
of the same type, and edges model pairwise relationships. In our work, we introduced parameterized
objective functions and approximation algorithms specifically for clustering bipartite graphs
and hypergraphs, based on correlation clustering. This enables us to develop principled approaches
for clustering datasets with different node types (bipartite graphs) or multiway relationships
(hypergraphs). Our hypergraph objective is related to higher-order notions of modularity and
normalized cut, and is amenable to approximation algorithms via hypergraph expansion techniques.
Our bipartite objective generalizes standard bipartite correlation clustering, and in a certain
parameter regime is equivalent to bicluster deletion, i.e., removing a minimum number of edges
to separate a bipartite graph into disjoint bicliques. The problem in general is NP-hard, but we
show that in a certain parameter regime it is equivalent to a bipartite matching problem, meaning
that it is polynomial time solvable in this regime. For other regimes, we provide approximation
guarantees based on LP-rounding. Our results include the first constant factor approximation
algorithm for bicluster deletion. We illustrate the flexibility of our framework in several experiments.
This includes clustering a food web and an email network based on higher-order motif structure,
detecting clusters of retail products in product review hypergraph, and evaluating our algorithms
across a range of parameter settings on several real world bipartite graphs.
