Steganography is the art and science of hiding secret messages in public communication so that the
presence of the secret messages cannot be detected. There are two provably secure steganographic
frameworks, one is black-box sampling based and the other is compression based. The former requires
a perfect sampler which yields data following the same distribution, and the latter needs explicit
distributions of generative objects. However, these two conditions are too strict even unrealistic
in the traditional data environment, because it is hard to model the explicit distribution of natural
image. With the development of deep learning, generative models bring new vitality to provably
secure steganography, which can serve as the black-box sampler or provide the explicit distribution
of generative media. Motivated by this, this paper proposes two types of provably secure stegosystems
with generative models. Specifically, we first design block-box sampling based provably secure
stegosystem for broad generative models without explicit distribution, such as GAN, VAE, and flow-based
generative models, where the generative network can serve as the perfect sampler. For compression
based stegosystem, we leverage the generative models with explicit distribution such as autoregressive
models instead, where the adaptive arithmetic coding plays the role of the perfect compressor,
decompressing the encrypted message bits into generative media, and the receiver can compress
the generative media into the encrypted message bits. To show the effectiveness of our method, we
take DFC-VAE, Glow, WaveNet as instances of generative models and demonstrate the perfectly secure
performance of these stegosystems with the state-of-the-art steganalysis methods.
