We are creating multimedia contents everyday and everywhere. While automatic content generation
has played a fundamental challenge to multimedia community for decades, recent advances of deep
learning have made this problem feasible. For example, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
is a rewarding approach to synthesize images. Nevertheless, it is not trivial when capitalizing
on GANs to generate videos. The difficulty originates from the intrinsic structure where a video
is a sequence of visually coherent and semantically dependent frames. This motivates us to explore
semantic and temporal coherence in designing GANs to generate videos. In this paper, we present
a novel Temporal GANs conditioning on Captions, namely TGANs-C, in which the input to the generator
network is a concatenation of a latent noise vector and caption embedding, and then is transformed
into a frame sequence with 3D spatio-temporal convolutions. Unlike the naive discriminator which
only judges pairs as fake or real, our discriminator additionally notes whether the video matches
the correct caption. In particular, the discriminator network consists of three discriminators:
video discriminator classifying realistic videos from generated ones and optimizes video-caption
matching, frame discriminator discriminating between real and fake frames and aligning frames
with the conditioning caption, and motion discriminator emphasizing the philosophy that the adjacent
frames in the generated videos should be smoothly connected as in real ones. We qualitatively demonstrate
the capability of our TGANs-C to generate plausible videos conditioning on the given captions on
two synthetic datasets (SBMG and TBMG) and one real-world dataset (MSVD). Moreover, quantitative
experiments on MSVD are performed to validate our proposal via Generative Adversarial Metric and
human study.
