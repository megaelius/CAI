Sparse superposition codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes for efficient communication over the AWGN
channel at rates approaching the channel capacity. In a standard SPARC, codewords are sparse linear
combinations of columns of an i.i.d. Gaussian design matrix, while in a spatially coupled SPARC,
the design matrix has a block-wise structure where the variance of the Gaussian entries can be varied
across blocks. A well-designed spatial coupling structure can enhance the error performance of
iterative decoding algorithms such as Approximate Message Passing (AMP). In this paper, we obtain
a non-asymptotic bound on the probability of error of spatially coupled SPARCs with AMP decoding.
Applying this bound to a simple band-diagonal design matrix, we prove that spatially coupled SPARCs
with AMP decoding achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel. The bound also highlights how the decay
of error probability depends on each design parameter of the spatially coupled SPARC. The asymptotic
mean squared error (MSE) of the AMP decoder can be predicted via a deterministic recursion called
state evolution. Our result provides the first proof that the MSE concentrates on the state evolution
prediction for spatially coupled SPARCs. Combined with the state evolution prediction, the result
implies that spatially coupled SPARCs are capacity-achieving. The proof technique used to establish
the main result is also used to obtain a concentration inequality for the MSE of AMP applied to compressed
sensing with spatially coupled design matrices. Finally, we provide numerical simulation results
that demonstrate the finite length error performance of spatially coupled SPARCs. The performance
is compared with coded modulation schemes that use LDPC codes from the DVB-S2 standard.
