Decentralization is a key indicator for the evaluation of public blockchains. In the past, there
have been very few studies on measuring and comparing the actual level of decentralization between
Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains and blockchains with other consensus protocols. This paper presents
a new comparison study of the level of decentralization in Bitcoin and Steem, a prominent Delegated-Proof-of-Stake
(DPoS) blockchain. Our study particularly focuses on analysing the power that decides the creators
of blocks in the blockchain. In Bitcoin, miners with higher computational power generate more blocks.
In contrast, blocks in Steem are equally generated by witnesses while witnesses are periodically
elected by stakeholders with different voting power weighted by invested stake. We analyze the
process of stake-weighted election of witnesses in DPoS and measure the actual stake invested by
each stakeholder in Steem. We then compute the Shannon entropy of the distribution of computational
power among miners in Bitcoin and the distribution of invested stake among stakeholders in Steem.
Our analyses reveal that neither Bitcoin nor Steem is dominantly better than the other with respect
to decentralization. Compared with Steem, Bitcoin tends to be more decentralized among top miners
but less decentralized in general. Our study is designed to provide insights into the current state
of the degree of decentralization in DPoS and PoW blockchains. We believe that the methodologies
and findings in this paper can facilitate future studies of decentralization in other blockchain
systems employing different consensus protocols.
