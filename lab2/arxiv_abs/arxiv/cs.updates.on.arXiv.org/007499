The explosion of 5G networks and the Internet of Things will result in an exceptionally crowded RF
environment, where techniques such as spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access will become
essential components of the wireless communication process. In this vision, wireless devices
must be able to (i) learn to autonomously extract knowledge from the spectrum on-the-fly; and (ii)
react in real time to the inferred spectrum knowledge by appropriately changing communication
parameters, including frequency band, symbol modulation, coding rate, among others. Traditional
CPU-based machine learning suffers from high latency, and requires application-specific and
computationally-intensive feature extraction/selection algorithms. In this paper, we present
RFLearn, the first system enabling spectrum knowledge extraction from unprocessed I/Q samples
by deep learning directly in the RF loop. RFLearn provides (i) a complete hardware/software architecture
where the CPU, radio transceiver and learning/actuation circuits are tightly connected for maximum
performance; and (ii) a learning circuit design framework where the latency vs. hardware resource
consumption trade-off can explored. We implement and evaluate the performance of RFLearn on custom
software-defined radio built on a system-on-chip (SoC) ZYNQ-7000 device mounting AD9361 radio
transceivers and VERT2450 antennas. We showcase the capabilities of RFLearn by applying it to solving
the fundamental problems of modulation and OFDM parameter recognition. Experimental results
reveal that RFLearn decreases latency and power by about 17x and 15x with respect to a software-based
solution, with a comparatively low hardware resource consumption.
