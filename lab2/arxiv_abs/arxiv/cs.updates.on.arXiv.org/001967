In this paper, we demonstrate how GPU-accelerated BEM routines can be used in a simple black-box
fashion to accelerate fast boundary element formulations based on Hierarchical Matrices (H-Matrices)
with ACA (Adaptive Cross Approximation). In particular, we focus on the expensive evaluation of
the discrete weak form of boundary operators associated with the Laplace and the Helmholtz equation
in three space dimensions. The method is based on offloading the CPU assembly of elements during
the ACA assembly onto a GPU device and to use threading strategies across ACA blocks to create sufficient
workload for the GPU. The proposed GPU strategy is designed such that it can be implemented in existing
code with minimal changes to the surrounding application structure. This is in particular interesting
for existing legacy code that is not from the ground-up designed with GPU computing in mind. Our benchmark
study gives realistic impressions of the benefits of GPU-accelerated BEM simulations by using
state-of-the-art multi-threaded computations on modern high-performance CPUs as a reference,
rather than drawing synthetic comparisons with single-threaded codes. Speed-up plots illustrate
that performance gains up to a factor of 5.5 could be realized with GPU computing under these conditions.
This refers to a boundary element model with about 4 million unknowns, whose H-Matrix weak form associated
with a real-valued (Laplace) boundary operator is set up in only 100 minutes harnessing the two GPUs
instead of 9 hours when using the 20 CPU cores at disposal only. The benchmark study is followed by
a particularly demanding real-life application, where we compute the scattered high-frequency
sound field of a submarine to demonstrate the increase in overall application performance from
moving to a GPU-based ACA assembly.
