The traction power of kites can be used for wind energy conversion at a potentially low cost. Crucially
important is a reliable control of flight path and tether reeling. The present study proposes a modelling
framework describing the dynamic behaviour of the interconnected system components, suitable
for design and optimization of the control systems. The wing, bridle line system, airborne control
unit and tether are represented as a particle system using spring-damper elements to describe the
mechanical properties of the tensile structure. Two alternative kite models are proposed. The
point mass model accounts only for the translational inertia of the wing, assuming an instantaneous
alignment with the local relative flow. The aerodynamic side force is assumed to be a linear function
of the steering line actuation. The four point model accounts also for the rotational inertia of
the wing and discretises the aerodynamics by a centre section and two tip sections. The local angle
of attack at the tip sections are assumed to be functions of the corresponding steering line actuations.
To simulate reel-out and reel-in of the tether, the lengths of the individual tether elements are
varied and the dynamic behaviour of the ground station is included. To validate the modelling framework,
it is combined with the automatic control system used for the operation of a kite power system demonstrator.
The simulation results show that the point mass model can be adjusted to match the measured behaviour
during a pumping cycle. The four point model is more accurate, with an efficiency error of less than
2 %, and remains stable also at low tether forces. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed
modelling framework is more accurate and robust while allowing dynamic simulations of the complete
system at real-time speed.
