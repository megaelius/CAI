Antagonistic crowd behaviors are often observed in cases of serious conflict. Antagonistic emotions,
which is the typical psychological state of agents in different roles (i.e. cops, activists, and
civilians) in crowd violent scenes, and the way they spread through contagion in a crowd are important
causes of crowd antagonistic behaviors. Moreover, games, which refers to the interaction between
opposing groups adopting different strategies to obtain higher benefits and less casualties,
determine the level of crowd violence. We present an antagonistic crowd simulation model, ACSEE,
which is integrated with antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories. Our
approach models the antagonistic emotions between agents in different roles using two components:
mental emotion and external emotion. We combine enhanced susceptible-infectious-susceptible
(SIS) and game approaches to evaluate the role of antagonistic emotional contagion in crowd violence.
Our evolutionary game theoretic approach incorporates antagonistic emotional contagion through
deterrent force, which is modelled by a mixture of emotional forces and physical forces defeating
the opponents. Antagonistic emotional contagion and evolutionary game theories influence each
other to determine antagonistic crowd behaviors. We evaluate our approach on real-world scenarios
consisting of different kinds of agents. We also compare the simulated crowd behaviors with real-world
crowd videos and use our approach to predict the trends of crowd movements in violence incidents.
We investigate the impact of various factors (number of agents, emotion, strategy, etc.) on the
outcome of crowd violence. We present results from user studies suggesting that our model can simulate
antagonistic crowd behaviors similar to those seen in real-world scenarios.
