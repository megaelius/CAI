Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) form an important area of research. In spite of its importance,
it is difficult for researchers to evaluate the domain primarily because of a considerable spread
of relevant literature in interdisciplinary domains. Previous surveys of CDSS have examined the
domain from the perspective of individual disciplines. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
visual scientometric survey of CDSS has previously been conducted which provides a broader spectrum
of the domain with a horizon covering multiple disciplines. While traditional systematic literature
surveys focus on analyzing literature using arbitrary results, visual surveys allow for the analysis
of domains by using complex network-based analytical models. In this paper, we present a detailed
visual survey of CDSS literature using important papers selected from highly cited sources in the
Thomson Reuters web of science. We analyze the entire set of relevant literature indexed in the Web
of Science database. Our key results include the discovery of the articles which have served as key
turning points in literature. Additionally, we have identified highly cited authors and the key
country of origin of top publications. We also present the Universities with the strongest citation
bursts. Finally, our network analysis has also identified the key journals and subject categories
both in terms of centrality and frequency. It is our belief that this paper will thus serve as an important
role for researchers as well as clinical practitioners interested in identifying key literature
and resources in the domain of clinical decision support.
