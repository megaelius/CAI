In this paper, we establish a zero-sum, hybrid state stochastic game model for designing defense
policies for cyber-physical systems against different types of attacks. With the increasingly
integrated properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) today, security is a challenge for critical
infrastructures. Though resilient control and detecting techniques for a specific model of attack
have been proposed, to analyze and design detection and defense mechanisms against multiple types
of attacks for CPSs requires new system frameworks. Besides security, other requirements such
as optimal control cost also need to be considered. The hybrid game model we propose in this work contains
physical states that are described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the
detection mode of the system composed by a set of subsystems. A strategy means selecting a subsystem
by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components
at each state. Based on the game model, we propose a suboptimal value iteration algorithm for a finite
horizon game, and prove that the algorithm results an upper bound for the value of the finite horizon
game. A moving-horizon approach is also developed in order to provide a scalable and real-time computation
of the switching strategies. Both algorithms aims at obtaining a saddle-point equilibrium policy
for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. The paper illustrates these concepts
using numerical examples, and we compare the results with previously system designs that only equipped
with one type of controller.
