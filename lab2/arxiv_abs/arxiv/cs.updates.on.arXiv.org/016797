Objective: In this work we address limitations in state-of-the-art ultrasound robots by designing
and integrating a novel soft robotic system for ultrasound imaging. It employs the inherent qualities
of soft fluidic actuators to establish safe, adaptable interaction between ultrasound probe and
patient. Methods: We acquire clinical data to determine the movement ranges and force levels required
in prenatal foetal ultrasound imaging and design the soft robotic end-effector accordingly. We
verify its mechanical characteristics, derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate
controllability and imaging capabilities on an ultrasound phantom. Results: The soft robot exhibits
the desired stiffness characteristics and is able to reach 100% of the required workspace when no
external force is present, and 95% of the workspace when considering its compliance. The model can
accurately predict the end-effector pose with a mean error of 1.18+/-0.29mm in position and 0.92+/-0.47deg
in orientation. The derived controller is, with an average position error of 0.39mm, able to track
a target pose efficiently without and with externally applied loads. Ultrasound images acquired
with the system are of equally good quality compared to a manual sonographer scan. Conclusion: The
system is able to withstand loads commonly applied during foetal ultrasound scans and remains controllable
with a motion range similar to manual scanning. Significance: The proposed soft robot presents
a safe, cost-effective solution to offloading sonographers in day-to-day scanning routines.
The design and modelling paradigms are greatly generalizable and particularly suitable for designing
soft robots for physical interaction tasks.
