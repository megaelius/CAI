With the increasing development of advanced communication technologies, vehicles are becoming
smarter and more connected. Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge
amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve
driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in
applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of
vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed.
In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing
to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential
to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources,
storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable
transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure
the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have
been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization,
anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and
key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this
paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information
while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side
units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered
VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that
the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features.
