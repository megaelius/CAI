We consider an electorate composed of both honest and fake voters, aka sybils, and investigate the
resilience of its democratic decision making against two types of sybil attacks: Sybils enforcing
decisions on the honest voters, and sybils blocking decisions by the honest voters. We follow Reality-aware
Social Choice and use the status quo as the anchor of \emph{sybil resilience}, which we characterize
by \emph{safety} -- the inability of sybils to change the status quo against the will of the majority
of the honest voters, and \emph{liveness} -- the ability of the honest voters to change the status
quo against the will of the sybils. We show that a reality-aware supermajority, in which a simple
majority plus half the sybil penetration rate is required to change the status quo, is safe. Interestingly,
a reality-aware supermajority is similar to byzantine failures in its tipping point: Below one-third
sybil penetration, it assures both safety and liveness, as a sufficiently-high majority of the
honest voters may effect a change of the status quo. Above one-third, it assures safety but not liveness,
as sybils, while unable to force a change to the status quo, may block any change to it. The proposed
reality-aware supermajority rule is safe only if all honest voters participate in the vote. Hence,
we explore two approaches to maintain safety while mitigating partial voter participation: One
is to further increase the reality-aware supermajority as a function of the participation rate.
Another is default (forced) delegation of uncasted votes in support of the status quo. Both ensure
safety but burden liveness by increasing the supermajority of active honest voters required to
change the status quo. We analyze and compare them.
