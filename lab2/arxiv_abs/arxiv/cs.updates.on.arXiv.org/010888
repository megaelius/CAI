Network attack is a significant security issue for modern society. From small mobile devices to
large cloud platforms, almost all computing products, used in our daily life, are networked and
potentially under the threat of network intrusion. With the fast-growing network users, network
intrusions become more and more frequent, volatile and advanced. Being able to capture intrusions
in time for such a large scale network is critical and very challenging. To this end, the machine learning
(or AI) based network intrusion detection (NID), due to its intelligent capability, has drawn increasing
attention in recent years. Compared to the traditional signature-based approaches, the AI-based
solutions are more capable of detecting variants of advanced network attacks. However, the high
detection rate achieved by the existing designs is usually accompanied by a high rate of false alarms,
which may significantly discount the overall effectiveness of the intrusion detection system.
In this paper, we consider the existence of spatial and temporal features in the network traffic
data and propose a hierarchical CNN+RNN neural network, LuNet. In LuNet, the convolutional neural
network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) learn input traffic data in sync with a gradually
increasing granularity such that both spatial and temporal features of the data can be effectively
extracted. Our experiments on two network traffic datasets show that compared to the state-of-the-art
network intrusion detection techniques, LuNet not only offers a high level of detection capability
but also has a much low rate of false positive-alarm.
