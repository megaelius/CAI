Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) model feedback causal relations in interwoven webs of causality and
policy variables. FCMs are fuzzy signed directed graphs that allow degrees of causal influence
and event occurrence. Such causal models can simulate a wide range of policy scenarios and decision
processes. Their directed loops or cycles directly model causal feedback. Their nonlinear dynamics
permit forward-chaining inference from input causes and policy options to output effects. Users
can add detailed dynamics and feedback links directly to the causal model or infer them with statistical
learning laws. Users can fuse or combine FCMs from multiple experts by weighting and adding the underlying
fuzzy edge matrices and do so recursively if needed. The combined FCM tends to better represent domain
knowledge as the expert sample size increases if the expert sample approximates a random sample.
Many causal models use more restrictive directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and Bayesian probabilities.
DAGs do not model causal feedback because they do not contain closed loops. Combining DAGs also tends
to produce cycles and thus tends not to produce a new DAG. Combining DAGs tends to produce a FCM. FCM
causal influence is also transitive whereas probabilistic causal influence is not transitive
in general. Overall: FCMs trade the numerical precision of probabilistic DAGs for pattern prediction,
faster and scalable computation, ease of combination, and richer feedback representation. We
show how FCMs can apply to problems of public support for insurgency and terrorism and to US-China
conflict relations in Graham Allison's Thucydides-trap framework. The appendix gives the textual
justification of the Thucydides-trap FCM. It also extends our earlier theorem [Osoba-Kosko2017]
to a more general result that shows the transitive and total causal influence that upstream concept
nodes exert on downstream nodes.
