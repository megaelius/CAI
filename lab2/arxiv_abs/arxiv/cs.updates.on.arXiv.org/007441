Traffic congestion is an increasing problem in most cities around the world. It impacts businesses
as well as commuters, small cities and large ones in developing as well as developed economies. One
approach to decrease urban traffic congestion is to optimize the traffic signal behaviour in order
to be adaptive to changes in the traffic conditions. From the perspective of intelligent transportation
systems, this optimization problem is called the traffic signal control problem and is considered
a large combinatorial problem with high complexity and uncertainty. A novel approach to the traffic
signal control problem is proposed in this thesis. The approach includes a new mechanism for Genetic
Programming inspired by Epigenetics. Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in biological
processes such as phenotype differentiation, memory consolidation within generations and environmentally
induced epigenetic modification of behaviour. These properties lead us to consider the implementation
of epigenetic mechanisms as a way to improve the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms in solution
to real-world problems with dynamic environmental changes, such as the traffic control signal
problem. The epigenetic mechanism proposed was evaluated in four traffic scenarios with different
properties and traffic conditions using two microscopic simulators. The results of these experiments
indicate that Genetic Programming was able to generate competitive actuated traffic signal controllers
for all the scenarios tested. Furthermore, the use of the epigenetic mechanism improved the performance
of Genetic Programming in all the scenarios. The evolved controllers adapt to modifications in
the traffic density and require less monitoring and less human interaction than other solutions
because they dynamically adjust the signal behaviour depending on the local traffic conditions
at each intersection.
