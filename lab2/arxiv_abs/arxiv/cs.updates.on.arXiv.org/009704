Intelligent algorithms are recently used in the optimization process in chemical engineering
and application of multiphase flows such as bubbling flow. This overview of modeling can be a great
replacement with complex numerical methods or very time-consuming and disruptive measurement
experimental process. In this study, we develop the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) method for mapping inputs and outputs together and understand the behavior of the fluid
flow from other output parameters of the bubble column reactor. Neural cells can fully learn the
process in their memory and after the training stage, the fuzzy structure predicts the multiphase
flow data. Four inputs such as x coordinate, y coordinate, z coordinate, and air superficial velocity
and one output such as pressure gradient are considered in the learning process of the ANFIS method.
During the learning process, the different number of the membership function, type of membership
functions and the number of inputs are examined to achieve the intelligent algorithm with high accuracy.
The results show that as the number of inputs increases the accuracy of the ANFIS method rises up to
R^2>0.99 almost for all cases, while the increment in the number of rules has a effect on the intelligence
of artificial algorithm. This finding shows that the density of neural objects or higher input parameters
enables the moded for better understanding. We also proposed a new evaluation of data in the bubble
column reactor by mapping inputs and outputs and shuffle all parameters together to understand
the behaviour of the multiphase flow as a function of either inputs or outputs. This new process of
mapping inputs and outputs data provides a framework to fully understand the flow in the fluid domain
in a short time of fuzzy structure calculation.
