Negotiation, as a seller or buyer, is an essential and complicated aspect of online shopping. It
is challenging for an intelligent agent because it requires (1) extracting and utilising information
from multiple sources (e.g. photos, texts, and numerals), (2) predicting a suitable price for the
products to reach the best possible agreement, (3) expressing the intention conditioned on the
price in a natural language and (4) consistent pricing. Conventional dialog systems do not address
these problems well. For example, we believe that the price should be the driving factor for the negotiation
and understood by the agent. But conventionally, the price was simply treated as a word token i.e.
being part of a sentence and sharing the same word embedding space with other words. To that end, we
propose our Visual Negotiator that comprises of an end-to-end deep learning model that anticipates
an initial agreement price and updates it while generating compelling supporting dialog. For (1),
our visual negotiator utilises attention mechanism to extract relevant information from the images
and textual description, and feeds the price (and later refined price) as separate important input
to several stages of the system, instead of simply being part of a sentence; For (2), we use the attention
to learn a price embedding to estimate an initial value; Subsequently, for (3) we generate the supporting
dialog in an encoder-decoder fashion that utilises the price embedding. Further, we use a hierarchical
recurrent model that learns to refine the price at one level while generating the supporting dialog
in another; For (4), this hierarchical model provides consistent pricing. Empirically, we show
that our model significantly improves negotiation on the CraigslistBargain dataset, in terms
of the agreement price, price consistency, and the language quality.
