Reconstruction closings have all properties of a physical flooding of a topographic surface. They
are precious for simplifying gradient images or, filling unwanted catchment basins, on which a
subsequent watershed transform extracts the targeted objects. Flooding a topographic surface
may be modeled as flooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights representing
the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be modeled on the region adjacency graph
(RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG each node represents a catchment basin and edges connect
neighboring nodes. The edges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent
regions. The graph is flooded from sources placed at the marker positions and each node is assigned
to the source by which it has been flooded. The level of the flood is represented on the nodes on each
type of graphs. The same flooding may thus be modeled on a TG or on a RAG. We characterize all valid floodings
on both types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then show that each flooding
of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge weighted graph with appropriate edge weights.
The highest flooding under a ceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the
root for the ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric distance between
two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both nodes are flooded. This remark permits
to flood edge or node weighted graphs by using shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection
of all lakes of a RAG has the structure of a dendrogram, on which the highest flooding under a ceiling
function may be rapidly found.
