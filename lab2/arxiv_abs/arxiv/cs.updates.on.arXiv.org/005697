Across various domains--such as health, education, and housing--improving societal welfare
involves allocating resources, setting policies, targeting interventions, and regulating activities.
These solutions have an immense impact on the day-to-day lives of individuals, whether in the form
of access to quality healthcare, labor market outcomes, or how votes are accounted for in a democratic
society. Problems that can have an out-sized impact on individuals whose opportunities have historically
been limited often pose conceptual and technical challenges, requiring insights from many disciplines.
Conversely, the lack of interdisciplinary approach can leave these urgent needs unaddressed and
can even exacerbate underlying socioeconomic inequalities. To realize the opportunities in these
domains, we need to correctly set objectives and reason about human behavior and actions. Doing
so requires a deep grounding in the field of interest and collaboration with domain experts who understand
the societal implications and feasibility of proposed solutions. These insights can play an instrumental
role in proposing algorithmically-informed policies. In this article, we describe the Mechanism
Design for Social Good (MD4SG) research agenda, which involves using insights from algorithms,
optimization, and mechanism design to improve access to opportunity. The MD4SG research community
takes an interdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder approach to improve societal welfare. We discuss
three exciting research avenues within MD4SG related to improving access to opportunity in the
developing world, labor markets and discrimination, and housing. For each of these, we showcase
ongoing work, underline new directions, and discuss potential for implementing existing work
in practice.
