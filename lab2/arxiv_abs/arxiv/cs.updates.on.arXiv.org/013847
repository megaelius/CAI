Multi-omics data, that is, datasets containing different types of high-dimensional molecular
variables (often in addition to classical clinical variables), are increasingly generated for
the investigation of various diseases. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the usefulness
of multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time. It is also unclear
which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction models. We aim to give some answers
to these questions by means of a large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction
methods from machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets from
the database "The Cancer Genome Atlas", containing from 35 to 1,000 observations and from 60,000
to 100,000 variables. The considered outcome was the (censored) survival time. Twelve methods
based on boosting, penalized regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods
that do and that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The Kaplan-Meier
estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used as reference methods. The methods
were compared using several repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated
Brier-score served as performance metrics. The results show that, although multi-omics data can
improve the prediction performance, this is not generally the case. Only the method block forest
slightly outperformed the Cox model on average over all datasets. Taking into account the multi-omics
structure improves the predictive performance and protects variables in low-dimensional groups
- especially clinical variables - from not being included in the model. All analyses are reproducible
using freely available R code.
