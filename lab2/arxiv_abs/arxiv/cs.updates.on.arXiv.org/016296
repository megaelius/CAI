Using the Blue Ocean strategy as an underlying strategic element, this dissertation analyses whether
this statement holds true for the rather more conservative banking sector in Germany and the overall
risk-averse mindset of the German population by using both quantitative and qualitative elements
to assess the current market share of FinTech companies in the Federal Republic, as well as grasp
a potential outlook on the future development. A literature review of the strategic framework,
the banking sector in Germany and the FinTech sector is carried out accordingly. Subsequently,
a formal verification as to whether the banking sector is a "Red Ocean" and if the FinTech industry
is a "Blue Ocean" is carried out using case studies from both sectors. A quantitative analysis of
banking customers in Germany and their use of FinTech companies is conducted by way of an online survey,
with selected participants being interviewed thereafter to gain additional insights. Data evaluation
is made using pivotal analysis and cross tabulation of survey results and interview findings, along
with extrapolating indicators to reflect the full size of the German banking sector and transactional
volumes per segment are provided and examined for signs of elevated FinTech use in the market. Despite
several limitations from where ideas for future research are derived, the outcomes provide an overview
of existing trends for the use of FinTechs in Germany. The main finding is that with the notable exception
of payment solutions, Germans do not have a high affinity towards FinTechs, rendering them a byproduct
of the financial service industry, with limited market share and low potential.
