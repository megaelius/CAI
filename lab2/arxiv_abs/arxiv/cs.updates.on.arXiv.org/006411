Conventional methods for visual assessment of civil infrastructures have certain limitations,
such as subjectivity of the collected data, long inspection time, and high cost of labor. Although
some new technologies i.e. robotic techniques that are currently in practice can collect objective,
quantified data, the inspectors own expertise is still critical in many instances since these technologies
are not designed to work interactively with human inspector. This study aims to create a smart, human
centered method that offers significant contributions to infrastructure inspection, maintenance,
management practice, and safety for the bridge owners. By developing a smart Mixed Reality framework,
which can be integrated into a wearable holographic headset device, a bridge inspector, for example,
can automatically analyze a certain defect such as a crack that he or she sees on an element, display
its dimension information in real-time along with the condition state. Such systems can potentially
decrease the time and cost of infrastructure inspections by accelerating essential tasks of the
inspector such as defect measurement, condition assessment and data processing to management
systems. The human centered artificial intelligence will help the inspector collect more quantified
and objective data while incorporating inspectors professional judgement. This study explains
in detail the described system and related methodologies of implementing attention guided semi
supervised deep learning into mixed reality technology, which interacts with the human inspector
during assessment. Thereby, the inspector and the AI will collaborate or communicate for improved
visual inspection.
