In recent years, we have seen the performance of video-based person Re-Identification (ReID) methods
have improved considerably. However, most of the work in this area has dealt with videos acquired
by fixed cameras with wider field of view. Recently, widespread use of wearable cameras and recording
devices such as cellphones have opened the door to interesting research in first-person Point-of-view
(POV) videos (egocentric videos). Nonetheless, analysis of such videos is challenging due to factors
such as poor video quality due to ego-motion, blurriness, severe changes in lighting conditions
and perspective distortions. To facilitate the research towards conquering these challenges,
this paper contributes a new dataset called EgoReID. The dataset is captured using 3 mobile cellphones
with non-overlapping field-of-view. It contains 900 IDs and around 10,200 tracks with a total of
176,000 detections. The dataset also contains 12-sensor meta data e.g. camera orientation pitch
and rotation for each video. In addition, we propose a new framework which takes advantage of both
visual and sensor meta data to successfully perform Person ReID. We extend image-based re-ID method
employing human body parsing trained on ten datasets to video-based re-ID. In our method, first
frame level local features are extracted for each semantic region, then 3D convolutions are applied
to encode the temporal information in each sequence of semantic regions. Additionally, we employ
sensor meta data to predict targets' next camera and their estimated time of arrival, which considerably
improves our ReID performance as it significantly reduces our search space.
