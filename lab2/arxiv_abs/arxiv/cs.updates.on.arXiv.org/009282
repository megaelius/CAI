Background: Many decisions made in Software Engineering practices are intertemporal choices:
trade-offs in time between closer options with potential short-term benefit and future options
with potential long-term benefit. However, how software professionals make intertemporal decisions
is not well understood. Aim: This paper investigates how shifting time frames influence preferences
in software projects in relation to purposefully selected background factors. Method: We investigate
temporal discounting by replicating a questionnaire-based observational study. The replication
uses a changed-population and -experimenter design to increase the internal and external validity
of the original results. Results: The results of this study confirm the occurrence of temporal discounting
in samples of both professional and student participants from different countries and demonstrate
strong variance in discounting between study participants. We found that professional experience
influenced discounting. Participants with broader professional experience exhibited less discounting
than those with narrower experience. Conclusions: The results provide strong empirical support
for the relevance and importance of temporal discounting in SE and the urgency of targeted interdisciplinary
research to explore the underlying mechanisms and their theoretical and practical implications.
The results suggest that technical debt management could be improved by increasing the breadth
of experience available for critical decisions with long-term impact. In addition, the present
study provides a methodological basis for replicating temporal discounting studies in software
engineering.
