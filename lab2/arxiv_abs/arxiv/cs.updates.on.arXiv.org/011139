Biomedical text tagging systems are plagued by the dearth of labeled training data. There have been
recent attempts at using pre-trained encoders to deal with this issue. Pre-trained encoder provides
representation of the input text which is then fed to task-specific layers for classification.
The entire network is fine-tuned on the labeled data from the target task. Unfortunately, a low-resource
biomedical task often has too few labeled instances for satisfactory fine-tuning. Also, if the
label space is large, it contains few or no labeled instances for majority of the labels. Most biomedical
tagging systems treat labels as indexes, ignoring the fact that these labels are often concepts
expressed in natural language e.g. `Appearance of lesion on brain imaging'. To address these issues,
we propose constructing extra labeled instances using label-text (i.e. label's name) as input
for the corresponding label-index (i.e. label's index). In fact, we propose a number of strategies
for manufacturing multiple artificial labeled instances from a single label. The network is then
fine-tuned on a combination of real and these newly constructed artificial labeled instances.
We evaluate the proposed approach on an important low-resource biomedical task called \textit{PICO
annotation}, which requires tagging raw text describing clinical trials with labels corresponding
to different aspects of the trial i.e. PICO (Population, Intervention/Control, Outcome) characteristics
of the trial. Our empirical results show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance for PICO annotation with very significant improvements over competitive baselines.
