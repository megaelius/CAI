While recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements in facial expression
classification (FEC), a major challenge that remains a bottleneck for the widespread deployment
of such systems is their high architectural and computational complexities. This is especially
challenging given the operational requirements of various FEC applications, such as safety, marketing,
learning, and assistive living, where real-time requirements on low-cost embedded devices is
desired. Motivated by this need for a compact, low latency, yet accurate system capable of performing
FEC in real-time on low-cost embedded devices, this study proposes EmotionNet Nano, an efficient
deep convolutional neural network created through a human-machine collaborative design strategy,
where human experience is combined with machine meticulousness and speed in order to craft a deep
neural network design catered towards real-time embedded usage. Two different variants of EmotionNet
Nano are presented, each with a different trade-off between architectural and computational complexity
and accuracy. Experimental results using the CK+ facial expression benchmark dataset demonstrate
that the proposed EmotionNet Nano networks demonstrated accuracies comparable to state-of-the-art
in FEC networks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters (e.g., 23$\times$ fewer at a higher
accuracy). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed EmotionNet Nano networks achieved real-time
inference speeds (e.g. $>25$ FPS and $>70$ FPS at 15W and 30W, respectively) and high energy efficiency
(e.g. $>1.7$ images/sec/watt at 15W) on an ARM embedded processor, thus further illustrating the
efficacy of EmotionNet Nano for deployment on embedded devices.
