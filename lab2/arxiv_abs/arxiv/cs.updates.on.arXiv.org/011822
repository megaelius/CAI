This work considers the problem of multiterminal secret key agreement by limited total public discussion
under the hypergraphical source model. The secrecy capacity as a function of the total discussion
rate is completely characterized by a polynomial-time computable linear program. Compared to
the existing solution for a particular hypergraphical source model called the pairwise independent
network (PIN) model, the current result is a non-trivial extension as it applies to a strictly larger
class of sources and a more general scenario involving helpers and wiretapper's side information.
In particular, while the existing solution by tree-packing can be strictly suboptimal for the PIN
model with helpers and the hypergraphical source model in general, we can show that decremental
secret key agreement and linear network coding is optimal, resolving a previous conjecture in the
affirmative. The converse is established by a single-letter upper bound on the secrecy capacity
for discrete memoryless multiple sources and individual discussion rate constraints. The minimax
optimization involved in the bound can be relaxed to give the best existing upper bounds on secrecy
capacities such as the lamination bounds for hypergraphical sources, helper-set bound for general
sources, the bound at asymptotically zero discussion rate via the multivariate G\'ac--K\"orner
common information, and the lower bound on communication complexity via a multivariate extension
of the Wyner common information. These reductions unify existing bounding techniques and reveal
surprising connections between seemingly different information-theoretic notions. Further
challenges are posed in this work along with a simple example of finite linear source where the current
converse techniques fail even though the proposed achieving scheme remains optimal.
