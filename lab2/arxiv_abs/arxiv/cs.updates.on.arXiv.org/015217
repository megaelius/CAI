In the proportional knapsack problem, we are given a knapsack of some capacity and a set of variably
sized items. The goal is to pack some of these items such that they fill the knapsack as much as possible
without ever exceeding the capacity. The online version of this problem reveals the items and their
sizes not all at once but one by one. For each item, the algorithm has to decide immediately whether
to pack it or not. We consider a natural variant of this online knapsack problem, which has been coined
removable knapsack and we denote by RemKnap. It differs from the classical variant by allowing the
removal of any packed item from the knapsack. Repacking is impossible, however: Once an item is removed,
it is gone for good. We analyze the advice complexity of this problem. It measures how many advice
bits an omniscient oracle needs to provide for an online algorithm to reach any given competitive
ratio, which is--understood in its strict sense--just the algorithm's approximation factor.
The online knapsack problem without removability is known for its peculiar advice behavior involving
three jumps in competitivity. We show that the advice complexity of RemKnap is quite different but
just as interesting. The competitivity starts from the golden ratio when no advice is given. It then
drops down in small increments to (1 + epsilon) for a constant amount of advice already, which requires
logarithmic advice in the classical version. Removability comes as no relief to the perfectionist,
however: Optimality still requires one full advice bit for every single item in the instance as before.
These results are particularly noteworthy from a structural viewpoint for the exceptionally slow
transition from near-optimality to optimality; such a steep jump up from constant to full linear
advice for just an infinitesimally small improvement is unique among the online problems examined
so far.
