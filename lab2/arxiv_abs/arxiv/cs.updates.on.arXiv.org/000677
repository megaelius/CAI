In Smart Grid applications, as the number of deployed electric smart meters increases, massive
amounts of valuable meter data is generated and collected every day. To enable reliable data collection
and make business decisions fast, high throughput storage and high-performance analysis of massive
meter data become crucial for grid companies. Considering the advantage of high efficiency, fault
tolerance, and price-performance of Hadoop and Hive systems, they are frequently deployed as underlying
platform for big data processing. However, in real business use cases, these data analysis applications
typically involve multidimensional range queries (MDRQ) as well as batch reading and statistics
on the meter data. While Hive is high-performance at complex data batch reading and analysis, it
lacks efficient indexing techniques for MDRQ. In this paper, we propose DGFIndex, an index structure
for Hive that efficiently supports MDRQ for massive meter data. DGFIndex divides the data space
into cubes using the grid file technique. Unlike the existing indexes in Hive, which stores all combinations
of multiple dimensions, DGFIndex only stores the information of cubes. This leads to smaller index
size and faster query processing. Furthermore, with pre-computing user-defined aggregations
of each cube, DGFIndex only needs to access the boundary region for aggregation query. Our comprehensive
experiments show that DGFIndex can save significant disk space in comparison with the existing
indexes in Hive and the query performance with DGFIndex is 2-63 times faster than existing indexes
in Hive, 2-94 times faster than HadoopDB, 2-75 times faster than scanning the whole table in different
query selectivity.
