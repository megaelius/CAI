Purpose: To organize a knee MRI segmentation challenge for characterizing the semantic and clinical
efficacy of automatic segmentation methods relevant for monitoring osteoarthritis progression.
Methods: A dataset partition consisting of 3D knee MRI from 88 subjects at two timepoints with ground-truth
articular (femoral, tibial, patellar) cartilage and meniscus segmentations was standardized.
Challenge submissions and a majority-vote ensemble were evaluated using Dice score, average symmetric
surface distance, volumetric overlap error, and coefficient of variation on a hold-out test set.
Similarities in network segmentations were evaluated using pairwise Dice correlations. Articular
cartilage thickness was computed per-scan and longitudinally. Correlation between thickness
error and segmentation metrics was measured using Pearson's coefficient. Two empirical upper
bounds for ensemble performance were computed using combinations of model outputs that consolidated
true positives and true negatives. Results: Six teams (T1-T6) submitted entries for the challenge.
No significant differences were observed across all segmentation metrics for all tissues (p=1.0)
among the four top-performing networks (T2, T3, T4, T6). Dice correlations between network pairs
were high (>0.85). Per-scan thickness errors were negligible among T1-T4 (p=0.99) and longitudinal
changes showed minimal bias (<0.03mm). Low correlations (<0.41) were observed between segmentation
metrics and thickness error. The majority-vote ensemble was comparable to top performing networks
(p=1.0). Empirical upper bound performances were similar for both combinations (p=1.0). Conclusion:
Diverse networks learned to segment the knee similarly where high segmentation accuracy did not
correlate to cartilage thickness accuracy. Voting ensembles did not outperform individual networks
but may help regularize individual models.
