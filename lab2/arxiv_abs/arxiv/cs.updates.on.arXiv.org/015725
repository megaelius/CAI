Co-registering the Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data of European Space Agency (ESA) is
of great importance for many remote sensing applications. The Sentinel-1 and 2 product specifications
from ESA show that the Sentinel-1 SAR L1 and the Sentinel-2 optical L1C images have a co-registration
accuracy of within 2 pixels. However, we find that the actual misregistration errors are much larger
than that between such images. This paper measures the misregistration errors by a block-based
multimodal image matching strategy to six pairs of the Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images,
which locate in China and Europe and cover three different terrains such as flat areas, hilly areas
and mountainous areas. Our experimental results show the misregistration errors of the flat areas
are 20-30 pixels, and these of the hilly areas are 20-40 pixels. While in the mountainous areas, the
errors increase to 50-60 pixels. To eliminate the misregistration, we use some representative
geometric transformation models such as polynomial models, projective models, and rational function
models for the co-registration of the two types of images, and compare and analyze their registration
accuracy under different number of control points and different terrains. The results of our analysis
show that the 3rd. Order polynomial achieves the most satisfactory registration results. Its registration
accuracy of the flat areas is less than 1.0 10m pixels, and that of the hilly areas is about 1.5 pixels,
and that of the mountainous areas is between 1.8 and 2.3 pixels. In a word, this paper discloses and
measures the misregistration between the Sentinel-1 SAR L1 and Sentinel-2 optical L1C images for
the first time. Moreover, we also determine a relatively optimal geometric transformation model
of the co-registration of the two types of images.
