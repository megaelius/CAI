Distracted pedestrians, like distracted drivers, are an increasingly dangerous threat and precursors
to pedestrian accidents in urban communities, often resulting in grave injuries and fatalities.
Mitigating such hazards to pedestrian safety requires employment of pedestrian safety systems
and applications that are effective in detecting them. Designing such frameworks is possible with
the availability of sophisticated mobile and wearable devices equipped with high-precision on-board
sensors capable of capturing fine-grained user movements and context, especially distracted
activities. However, the key technical challenge is accurate recognition of distractions with
minimal resources in real-time given the computation and communication limitations of these devices.
Several recently published works improve distracted pedestrian safety by leveraging on complex
activity recognition frameworks using mobile and wearable sensors to detect pedestrian distractions.
Their primary focus, however, was to achieve high detection accuracy, and therefore most designs
are either resource intensive and unsuitable for implementation on mainstream mobile devices,
or computationally slow and not useful for real-time pedestrian safety applications, or require
specialized hardware and less likely to be adopted by most users. In the quest for a pedestrian safety
system, we design an efficient and real-time pedestrian distraction detection technique that
overcomes some of these shortcomings. We demonstrate its practicality by implementing prototypes
on commercially-available mobile and wearable devices and evaluating them using data collected
from participants in realistic pedestrian experiments. Using these evaluations, we show that
our technique achieves a favorable balance between computational efficiency, detection accuracy
and energy consumption compared to some other techniques in the literature.
