Profit maximization (PM) is to select a subset of users as seeds for viral marketing in online social
networks, which balances between the cost and the profit from influence spread. We extend PM to that
under the general marketing strategy, and form continuous profit maximization (CPM-MS) problem,
whose domain is on integer lattices. The objective function of our CPM-MS is dr-submodular, but
non-monotone. It is a typical case of unconstrained dr-submodular maximization (UDSM) problem,
and take it as a starting point, we study UDSM systematically in this paper, which is very different
from those existing researcher. First, we introduce the lattice-based double greedy algorithm,
which can obtain a constant approximation guarantee. However, there is a strict and unrealistic
condition that requiring the objective value is non-negative on the whole domain, or else no theoretical
bounds. Thus, we propose a technique, called lattice-based iterative pruning. It can shrink the
search space effectively, thereby greatly increasing the possibility of satisfying the non-negative
objective function on this smaller domain without losing approximation ratio. Then, to overcome
the difficulty to estimate the objective value of CPM-MS, we adopt reverse sampling strategies,
and combine it with lattice-based double greedy, including pruning, without losing its performance
but reducing its running time. The entire process can be considered as a general framework to solve
the UDSM problem, especially for applying to social networks. Finally, we conduct experiments
on several real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.
