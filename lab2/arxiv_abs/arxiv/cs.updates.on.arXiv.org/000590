[Abridged] We propose a solution to the problem of quickly and accurately predicting gravitational
waveforms within any given physical model. The method is relevant for both real-time applications
and in more traditional scenarios where the generation of waveforms using standard methods can
be prohibitively expensive. Our approach is based on three offline steps resulting in an accurate
reduced-order model that can be used as a surrogate for the true/fiducial waveform family. First,
a set of m parameter values is determined using a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation
is constructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values for interpolating
a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant. Third, a fit in the parameter dimension is
performed for the waveform's value at each of these m times. The cost of predicting L waveform time
samples for a generic parameter choice is of order m L + m c_f online operations where c_f denotes the
fitting function operation count and, typically, m << L. We generate accurate surrogate
models for Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms of non-spinning binary black hole coalescences with
durations as long as 10^5 M, mass ratios from 1 to 10, and for multiple harmonic modes. We find that
these surrogates are three orders of magnitude faster to evaluate as compared to the cost of generating
EOB waveforms in standard ways. Surrogate model building for other waveform models follow the same
steps and have the same low online scaling cost. For expensive numerical simulations of binary black
hole coalescences we thus anticipate large speedups in generating new waveforms with a surrogate.
As waveform generation is one of the dominant costs in parameter estimation algorithms and parameter
space exploration, surrogate models offer a new and practical way to dramatically accelerate such
studies without impacting accuracy.
