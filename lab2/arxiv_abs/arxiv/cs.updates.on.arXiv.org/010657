Demystifying effective connectivity among neuronal populations has become the trend to understand
the brain mechanisms of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, mild traumatic brain injury, and
many other unlisted neurological diseases. Dynamic modeling is a state-of-the-art approach to
explore various connectivities among neuronal populations corresponding to different electrophysiological
responses. Through estimating the parameters in the dynamic models, including the strengths and
propagation delays of the electrophysiological signals, the discovery of the underlying connectivities
can lead to the elucidation of functional brain mechanisms. In this report, we survey six dynamic
models that describe the intrinsic function of a single neuronal/subneuronal population and three
effective network estimation methods that can trace the connections among the neuronal/subneuronal
populations. The six dynamic models are event related potential, local field potential, conductance-based
neural mass model, mean field model, neural field model, and canonical micro-circuits; the three
effective network estimation approaches are dynamic causal modeling, structural causal model,
and vector autoregression. Subsequently, we discuss dynamic parameter estimation methods including
variational Bayesian, particle filtering, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, Gauss-Newton algorithm,
collocation method, and constrained optimization. We summarize the merits and drawbacks of each
model, network estimation approach, and parameter estimation method. In addition, we demonstrate
an exemplary effective network estimation problem statement. Last, we identify possible future
work and challenges to develop an elevated package.
