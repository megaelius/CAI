Every day, thousands of users sign up as new Wikipedia contributors. Once joined, these users have
to decide which articles to contribute to, which users to seek out and learn from or collaborate with,
etc. Any such task is a hard and potentially frustrating one given the sheer size of Wikipedia. Supporting
newcomers in their first steps by recommending articles they would enjoy editing or editors they
would enjoy collaborating with is thus a promising route toward converting them into long-term
contributors. Standard recommender systems, however, rely on users' histories of previous interactions
with the platform. As such, these systems cannot make high-quality recommendations to newcomers
without any previous interactions -- the so-called cold-start problem. The present paper addresses
the cold-start problem on Wikipedia by developing a method for automatically building short questionnaires
that, when completed by a newly registered Wikipedia user, can be used for a variety of purposes,
including article recommendations that can help new editors get started. Our questionnaires are
constructed based on the text of Wikipedia articles as well as the history of contributions by the
already onboarded Wikipedia editors. We assess the quality of our questionnaire-based recommendations
in an offline evaluation using historical data, as well as an online evaluation with hundreds of
real Wikipedia newcomers, concluding that our method provides cohesive, human-readable questions
that perform well against several baselines. By addressing the cold-start problem, this work can
help with the sustainable growth and maintenance of Wikipedia's diverse editor community.
