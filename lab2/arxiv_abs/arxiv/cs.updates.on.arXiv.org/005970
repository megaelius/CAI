Logs are imperative in the development and maintenance process of many software systems. They record
detailed runtime information during system operation that allows developers and support engineers
to monitor their systems and dissect anomalous behaviors and errors. The increasing scale and complexity
of modern software systems, however, make the volume of logs explodes, thus rendering the infeasibility
of the traditional way of manual log inspection. Many recent studies, as well as industrial tools,
resort to powerful text search and machine learning-based analytics solutions. Due to the unstructured
nature of logs, a first crucial step is to parse log messages into structured data for subsequent
analysis. In recent years, automated log parsing has been widely studied in both academia and industry,
producing a series of log parsers by different techniques. To better understand the characteristics
of these log parsers, in this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation study on automated log
parsing and further release the tools and benchmarks to researchers and practitioners. More specifically,
we evaluate 13 log parsers on a total of 16 log datasets spanning distributed systems, supercomputers,
operating systems, mobile systems, server applications, and standalone software. We report the
benchmarking results in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, which are of practical
importance when deploying automated log parsing in production. We also share the success stories
and lessons learned in an industrial application at Huawei. We believe that our work could serve
as the basis and provide valuable guidance to future research and technology transfer of automated
log parsing.
