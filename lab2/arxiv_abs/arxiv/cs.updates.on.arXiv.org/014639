Concept drift describes unforeseeable changes in the underlying distribution of streaming data
over time. Concept drift research involves the development of methodologies and techniques for
drift detection, understanding and adaptation. Data analysis has revealed that machine learning
in a concept drift environment will result in poor learning results if the drift is not addressed.
To help researchers identify which research topics are significant and how to apply related techniques
in data analysis tasks, it is necessary that a high quality, instructive review of current research
developments and trends in the concept drift field is conducted. In addition, due to the rapid development
of concept drift in recent years, the methodologies of learning under concept drift have become
noticeably systematic, unveiling a framework which has not been mentioned in literature. This
paper reviews over 130 high quality publications in concept drift related research areas, analyzes
up-to-date developments in methodologies and techniques, and establishes a framework of learning
under concept drift including three main components: concept drift detection, concept drift understanding,
and concept drift adaptation. This paper lists and discusses 10 popular synthetic datasets and
14 publicly available benchmark datasets used for evaluating the performance of learning algorithms
aiming at handling concept drift. Also, concept drift related research directions are covered
and discussed. By providing state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers
in their understanding of research developments in the field of learning under concept drift.
