In this work we design an end-to-end deep learning architecture for predicting, on Chest X-rays
images (CXR), a multi-regional score conveying the degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients.
Such semi-quantitative scoring system, namely \texttt{Brixia~score}, is applied in serial monitoring
of such patients, showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that experienced
one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a challenging visual task, we adopt a weakly
supervised learning strategy structured to handle different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment,
and score estimation) trained with a "from part to whole" procedure involving different datasets.
In particular, we exploit a clinical dataset of almost 5,000 CXR annotated images collected in the
same hospital. Our BS-Net demonstrates self-attentive behavior and a high degree of accuracy in
all processing stages. Through inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard comparison, we
show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in rating accuracy and consistency,
thus supporting the possibility of using this tool in contexts of computer-assisted monitoring.
Highly resolved (super-pixel level) explainability maps are also generated, with an original
technique, to visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We also
consider other scores proposed in literature and provide a comparison with a recently proposed
non-specific approach. We eventually test the performance robustness of our model on a variegated
public COVID-19 dataset, for which we also provide \texttt{Brixia~score} annotations, observing
good direct generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that highlight the portability of BS-Net
in other clinical settings. The CXR dataset along with the source code and the trained model are publicly
released for research purposes.
