Multi-class vehicle detection from airborne imagery with orientation estimation is an important
task in the near and remote vision domains with applications in traffic monitoring and disaster
management. In the last decade, we have witnessed significant progress in object detection in ground
imagery, but it is still in its infancy in airborne imagery, mostly due to the scarcity of diverse
and large-scale datasets. Despite being a useful tool for different applications, current airborne
datasets only partially reflect the challenges of real-world scenarios. To address this issue,
we introduce EAGLE (oriEnted object detection using Aerial imaGery in real-worLd scEnarios),
a large-scale dataset for multi-class vehicle detection with object orientation information
in aerial imagery. It features high-resolution aerial images composed of different real-world
situations with a wide variety of camera sensor, resolution, flight altitude, weather, illumination,
haze, shadow, time, city, country, occlusion, and camera angle. The annotation was done by airborne
imagery experts with small- and large-vehicle classes. EAGLE contains 215,986 instances annotated
with oriented bounding boxes defined by four points and orientation, making it by far the largest
dataset to date in this task. It also supports researches on the haze and shadow removal as well as
super-resolution and in-painting applications. We define three tasks: detection by (1) horizontal
bounding boxes, (2) rotated bounding boxes, and (3) oriented bounding boxes. We carried out several
experiments to evaluate several state-of-the-art methods in object detection on our dataset to
form a baseline. Experiments show that the EAGLE dataset accurately reflects real-world situations
and correspondingly challenging applications. The dataset will be made publicly available.
