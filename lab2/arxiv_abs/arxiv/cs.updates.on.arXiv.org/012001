Over the past few years, we have experienced great technological advancements in the information
and communication field, which has significantly contributed to reshaping the Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) concept. Evolving from the platform of a collection of sensors aiming to collect data,
the data exchanged paradigm among vehicles is shifted from the local network to the cloud. With the
introduction of cloud and edge computing along with ubiquitous 5G mobile network, it is expected
to see the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in data processing and smart decision imminent.
So as to fully understand the future automobile scenario in this verge of industrial revolution
4.0, it is necessary first of all to get a clear understanding of the cutting-edge technologies that
going to take place in the automotive ecosystem so that the cyber-physical impact on transportation
system can be measured. CIoV, which is abbreviated from Cognitive Internet of Vehicle, is one of
the recently proposed architectures of the technological evolution in transportation, and it
has amassed great attention. It introduces cloud-based artificial intelligence and machine learning
into transportation system. What are the future expectations of CIoV. To fully contemplate this
architectures future potentials, and milestones set to achieve, it is crucial to understand all
the technologies that leaned into it. Also, the security issues to meet the security requirements
of its practical implementation. Aiming to that, this paper presents the evolution of CIoV along
with the layer abstractions to outline the distinctive functional parts of the proposed architecture.
It also gives an investigation of the prime security and privacy issues associated with technological
evolution to take measures.
