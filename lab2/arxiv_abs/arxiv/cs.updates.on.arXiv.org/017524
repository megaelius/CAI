Clustering is a popular data mining technique that aims to partition an input space into multiple
homogeneous regions. There exist several clustering algorithms in the literature. The performance
of a clustering algorithm depends on its input parameters which can substantially affect the behavior
of the algorithm. Cluster validity indices determine the partitioning that best fits the underlying
data. In bioinformatics, microarray gene expression technology has made it possible to measure
the gene expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Many genomic studies, which aim
to analyze the functions of some genes, highly rely on some clustering technique for grouping similarly
expressed genes in one cluster or partitioning tissue samples based on similar expression values
of genes. In this work, an application package called EXCLUVIS (gene EXpression data CLUstering
and VISualization) has been developed using MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment
for analyzing the performances of different clustering algorithms on gene expression datasets.
In this application package, the user needs to select a number of parameters such as internal validity
indices, external validity indices and number of clusters from the active windows for evaluating
the performance of the clustering algorithms. EXCLUVIS compares the performances of K-means,
fuzzy C-means, hierarchical clustering and multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithms.
Heatmap and cluster profile plots are used for visualizing the results. EXCLUVIS allows the users
to easily find the goodness of clustering solutions as well as provides visual representations
of the clustering outcomes.
