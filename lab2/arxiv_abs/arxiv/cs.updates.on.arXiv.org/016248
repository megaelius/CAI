Printed Mathematical expression recognition (PMER) aims to transcribe a printed mathematical
expression image into a structural expression, such as LaTeX expression. It is a crucial task for
many applications, including automatic question recommendation, automatic problem solving
and analysis of the students, etc. Currently, the mainstream solutions rely on solving image captioning
tasks, all addressing image summarization. As such, these methods can be suboptimal for solving
MER problem. In this paper, we propose a new method named EDSL, shorted for encoder-decoder with
symbol-level features, to identify the printed mathematical expressions from images. The symbol-level
image encoder of EDSL consists of segmentation module and reconstruction module. By performing
segmentation module, we identify all the symbols and their spatial information from images in an
unsupervised manner. We then design a novel reconstruction module to recover the symbol dependencies
after symbol segmentation. Especially, we employ a position correction attention mechanism to
capture the spatial relationships between symbols. To alleviate the negative impact from long
output, we apply the transformer model for transcribing the encoded image into the sequential and
structural output. We conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets to verify the effectiveness
and rationality of our proposed EDSL method. The experimental results have illustrated that EDSL
has achieved 92.7\% and 89.0\% in evaluation metric Match, which are 3.47\% and 4.04\% higher than
the state-of-the-art method. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/abcAnonymous/EDSL
