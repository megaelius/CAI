Wide-band Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation with sensor arrays is an essential task in sonar,
radar, acoustics, biomedical and multimedia applications. Many state of the art wide-band DOA
estimators coherently process frequency binned array outputs by approximate Maximum Likelihood,
Weighted Subspace Fitting or focusing techniques. This paper shows that bin signals obtained by
filter-bank approaches do not obey the finite rank narrow-band array model, because spectral leakage
and the change of the array response with frequency within the bin create \emph{ghost sources} dependent
on the particular realization of the source process. Therefore, existing DOA estimators based
on binning cannot claim consistency even with the perfect knowledge of the array response. In this
work, a more realistic array model with a finite length of the sensor impulse responses is assumed,
which still has finite rank under a space-time formulation. It is shown that signal subspaces at
arbitrary frequencies can be consistently recovered under mild conditions by applying MUSIC-type
(ST-MUSIC) estimators to the dominant eigenvectors of the wide-band space-time sensor cross-correlation
matrix. A novel Maximum Likelihood based ST-MUSIC subspace estimate is developed in order to recover
consistency. The number of sources active at each frequency are estimated by Information Theoretic
Criteria. The sample ST-MUSIC subspaces can be fed to any subspace fitting DOA estimator at single
or multiple frequencies. Simulations confirm that the new technique clearly outperforms binning
approaches at sufficiently high signal to noise ratio, when model mismatches exceed the noise floor.
