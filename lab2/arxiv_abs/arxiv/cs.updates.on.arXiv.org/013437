In this paper, we consider a mobile-edge computing system, where an access point assists a mobile
device (MD) to execute an application consisting of multiple tasks following a general task call
graph. The objective is to jointly determine the offloading decision of each task and the resource
allocation under time-varying wireless fading channels and stochastic edge computing capability,
so that the energy-time cost (ETC) of the MD is minimized. Solving the problem is particularly hard
due to the combinatorial offloading decisions and the strong coupling among task executions under
the general dependency model. Conventional numerical optimization methods are inefficient to
solve such a problem, especially when the problem size is large. To address the issue, we propose
a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the actor-critic learning structure. In
particular, the actor network utilizes a DNN to learn the optimal mapping from the input states to
the binary offloading decision of each task. Meanwhile, by analyzing the structure of the optimal
solution, we derive a low-complexity algorithm for the critic network to quickly evaluate the ETC
performance of the offloading decisions output by the actor network. With the low-complexity critic
network, we can quickly select the best offloading action and subsequently store the state-action
pair in an experience replay memory as the training dataset to continuously improve the action generation
DNN. To further reduce the complexity, we show that the optimal offloading decision exhibits an
one-climb structure, which can be utilized to significantly reduce the search space of action generation.
Numerical results show that for various types of task graphs, the proposed algorithm achieves up
to $99.1\%$ of the optimal performance while significantly reducing the computational complexity
compared to the existing optimization methods.
