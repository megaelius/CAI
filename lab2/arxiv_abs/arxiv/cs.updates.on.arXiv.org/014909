As genome sequencing tools and techniques improve, researchers are able to incrementally assemble
more accurate reference genomes. A more accurate reference genome enables increased accuracy
in read mappings, which provides more accurate variant information and thus health data on the donor.
Therefore, read data sets from sequenced samples should ideally be mapped to the latest available
reference genome. Unfortunately, the increasingly large amounts of available genomic data makes
it prohibitively expensive to fully map each read data set to its respective reference genome every
time the reference is updated. Several tools that attempt to reduce the procedure of updating a read
data set from one reference to another (i.e., remapping) have been published. These tools identify
regions of similarity across the two references and update the mapping locations of a read based
on the locations of similar regions in the new reference genome. The main drawback of existing approaches
is that if a read maps to a region in the old reference without similar regions in the new reference,
it cannot be remapped. We find that, as a result of this drawback, a significant portion of annotations
are lost when using state-of-the-art remapping tools. To address this major limitation in existing
tools, we propose AirLift, a fast and comprehensive technique for moving alignments from one genome
to another. AirLift can reduce 1) the number of reads that need to be mapped from the entire read set
by up to 99.9% and 2) the overall execution time to remap the reads between the two most recent reference
versions by 6.94x, 44.0x, and 16.4x for large (human), medium (C. elegans), and small (yeast) references,
respectively.
