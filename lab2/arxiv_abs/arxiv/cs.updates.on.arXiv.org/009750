Principia Logico-Metaphysica contains a foundational logical theory for metaphysics, mathematics,
and the sciences. It includes a canonical development of Abstract Object Theory [AOT], a metaphysical
theory (inspired by ideas of Ernst Mally, formalized by Zalta) that distinguishes between ordinary
and abstract objects. This article reports on recent work in which AOT has been successfully represented
and partly automated in the proof assistant system Isabelle/HOL. Initial experiments within this
framework reveal a crucial but overlooked fact: a deeply-rooted and known paradox is reintroduced
in AOT when the logic of complex terms is simply adjoined to AOT's specially-formulated comprehension
principle for relations. This result constitutes a new and important paradox, given how much expressive
and analytic power is contributed by having the two kinds of complex terms in the system. Its discovery
is the highlight of our joint project and provides strong evidence for a new kind of scientific practice
in philosophy, namely, computational metaphysics. Our results were made technically possible
by a suitable adaptation of Benzm\"uller's metalogical approach to universal reasoning by semantically
embedding theories in classical higher-order logic. This approach enables one to reuse state-of-the-art
higher-order proof assistants, such as Isabelle/HOL, for mechanizing and experimentally exploring
challenging logics and theories such as AOT. Our results also provide a fresh perspective on the
question of whether relational type theory or functional type theory better serves as a foundation
for logic and metaphysics.
