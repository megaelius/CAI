Genomic sequence alignment is an important research topic in bioinformatics and continues to attract
significant efforts. As genomic data grow exponentially, however, most of alignment methods face
challenges due to their huge computational costs. HMMER, a suite of bioinformatics tools, is widely
used for the analysis of homologous protein and nucleotide sequences with high sensitivity, based
on profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Its latest version, HMMER3, introdues a heuristic pipeline
to accelerate the alignment process, which is carried out on central processing units (CPUs) with
the support of streaming SIMD extensions (SSE) instructions. Few acceleration results have since
been reported based on HMMER3. In this paper, we propose a five-tiered parallel framework, CUDAMPF++,
to accelerate the most computationally intensive stages of HMMER3's pipeline, multiple/single
segment Viterbi (MSV/SSV), on a single graphics processing unit (GPU). As an architecture-aware
design, the proposed framework aims to fully utilize hardware resources via exploiting finer-grained
parallelism (multi-sequence alignment) compared with its predecessor (CUDAMPF). In addition,
we propose a novel method that proactively sacrifices L1 Cache Hit Ratio (CHR) to get improved performance
and scalability in return. A comprehensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework outperfroms
all existig work and exhibits good consistency in performance regardless of the variation of query
models or protein sequence datasets. For MSV (SSV) kernels, the peak performance of the CUDAMPF++
is 283.9 (471.7) GCUPS on a single K40 GPU, and impressive speedups ranging from 1.x (1.7x) to 168.3x
(160.7x) are achieved over the CPU-based implementation (16 cores, 32 threads).
