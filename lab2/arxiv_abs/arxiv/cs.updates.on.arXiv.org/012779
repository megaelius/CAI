Computer-assisted multimodal training is an effective way of learning complex motor skills in
various applications. In particular disciplines (eg. healthcare) incompetency in performing
dexterous hands-on examinations (clinical palpation) may result in misdiagnosis of symptoms,
serious injuries or even death. Furthermore, a high quality clinical examination can help to exclude
significant pathology, and reduce time and cost of diagnosis by eliminating the need for unnecessary
medical imaging. Medical palpation is used regularly as an effective preliminary diagnosis method
all around the world but years of training are required currently to achieve competency. This paper
focuses on a multimodal palpation training system to teach and improve clinical examination skills
in relation to the abdomen. It is our aim to shorten significantly the palpation training duration
by increasing the frequency of rehearsals as well as providing essential augmented feedback on
how to perform various abdominal palpation techniques which has been captured and modelled from
medical experts. Twenty three first year medical students divided into a control group (n=8), a
semi-visually trained group (n=8), and a fully visually trained group (n=7) were invited to perform
three palpation tasks (superficial, deep and liver). The medical students performances were assessed
using both computer-based and human-based methods where a positive correlation was shown between
the generated scores, r=.62, p(one-tailed)<.05. The visually-trained group significantly outperformed
the control group in which abstract visualisation of applied forces and their palmar locations
were provided to the students during each palpation examination (p<.05). Moreover, a positive
trend was observed between groups when visual feedback was presented, J=132, z=2.62, r=0.55.
