In this paper, we investigate different secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) optimization problems
in a multiple-input single-output underlay cognitive radio (CR) network in the presence of an energy
harvesting receiver. In particular, these energy efficient designs are developed with different
assumptions of channels state information (CSI) at the transmitter, namely perfect CSI, statistical
CSI and imperfect CSI with bounded channel uncertainties. In particular, the overarching objective
here is to design a beamforming technique maximizing the SEE while satisfying all relevant constraints
linked to interference and harvested energy between transmitters and receivers. We show that the
original problems are non-convex and their solutions are intractable. By using a number of techniques,
such as non-linear fractional programming and difference of concave (DC) functions, we reformulate
the original problems so as to render them tractable. We then combine these techniques with the Dinkelbach's
algorithm to derive iterative algorithms to determine relevant beamforming vectors which lead
to the SEE maximization. In doing this, we investigate the robust design with ellipsoidal bounded
channel uncertainties, by mapping the original problem into a sequence of semidefinite programs
by employing the semidefinite relaxation, non-linear fractional programming and S-procedure.
Furthermore, we show that the maximum SEE can be achieved through a search algorithm in the single
dimensional space. Numerical results, when compared with those obtained with existing techniques
in the literature, show the effectiveness of the proposed designs for SEE maximization.
