Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are highly complex to model. The
research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion,
minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction the property damage associated with floods.
To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past
two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction
systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and
potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through
introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate
and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state
of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this
paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness,
accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview
on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents
an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive
evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods
for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality
of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition,
algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the
improvement of ML methods.
