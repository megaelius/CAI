One of the main challenges slowing the deployment of airborne base stations (BSs) using unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the limited on-board energy and flight time. One potential solution to
such problem, is to provide the UAV with power supply through a tether that connects the UAV to the
ground. In this paper, we study the optimal placement of tethered UAVs (TUAVs) to minimize the average
path-loss between the TUAV and a receiver located on the ground. Given that the tether has a maximum
length, and the launching point of the TUAV (the starting point of the tether) is placed on a rooftop,
the TUAV is only allowed to hover within a specific hovering region. Beside the maximum tether length,
this hovering region also depends on the heights of the buildings surrounding the rooftop, which
requires the inclination angle of the tether not to be below a given minimum value, in order to avoid
tangling and ensure safety. We first formulate the optimization problem for such setup and provide
some useful insights on its solution. Next, we derive upper and lower bounds for the optimal values
of the tether length and inclination angle. We also propose a suboptimal closed-form solution for
the tether length and its inclination angle that is based on maximizing the line-of-sight probability.
Finally, we derive the probability distribution of the minimum inclination angle of the tether
length. We show that its mean value varies depending on the environment from 10 degrees in suburban
environments to 31 degrees in high rise urban environments. Our numerical results show that the
derived upper and lower bounds on the optimal values of the tether length and inclination angle lead
to tight suboptimal values of the average path-loss that are only 0-3 dBs above the minimum value.
