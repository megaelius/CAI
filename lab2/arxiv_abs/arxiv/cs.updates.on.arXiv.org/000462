When decomposing the total orbit into $N$ sub-orbits (or simply orbits) related to each of $N$ servers
and through comparing the numbers of customers in these orbits, we introduce a retrial supermarket
model of $N$ identical servers, where two probing-server choice numbers are respectively designed
for dynamically allocating each primary arrival and each retrial arrival into these orbits when
the chosen servers are all busy. Note that the designed purpose of the two choice numbers can effectively
improve performance measures of this retrial supermarket model. This paper analyzes a simple and
basic retrial supermarket model of N identical servers, that is, Poisson arrivals, exponential
service and retrial times. To this end, we first provide a detailed probability computation to set
up an infinite-dimensional system of differential equations (or mean-field equations) satisfied
by the expected fraction vector. Then, as N goes to infinity, we apply the operator semigroup to obtaining
the mean-field limit (or chaos of propagation) for the sequence of Markov processes which express
the state of this retrial supermarket model. Specifically, some simple and basic conditions for
the mean-field limit as well as for the Lipschitz condition are established through the first two
moments of the queue length in any orbit. Finally, we show that the fixed point satisfies a system
of nonlinear equations which is an interesting networking generalization of the tail equations
given in the M/M/1 retrial queue, and also use the fixed point to give performance analysis of this
retrial supermarket model through numerical computation.
