In this work, we present a unified performance analysis of a free-space optical (FSO) link that accounts
for pointing errors and both types of detection techniques (i.e. intensity modulation/direct
detection (IM/DD) as well as heterodyne detection). More specifically, we present unified exact
closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function, the probability density function,
the moment generating function, and the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of a single link FSO transmission system, all in terms of the Meijer's G function except for the moments
that is in terms of simple elementary functions. We then capitalize on these unified results to offer
unified exact closed-form expressions for various performance metrics of FSO link transmission
systems, such as, the outage probability, the scintillation index (SI), the average error rate
for binary and $M$-ary modulation schemes, and the ergodic capacity (except for IM/DD technique,
where we present closed-form lower bound results), all in terms of Meijer's G functions except for
the SI that is in terms of simple elementary functions. Additionally, we derive the asymptotic results
for all the expressions derived earlier in terms of Meijer's G function in the high SNR regime in terms
of simple elementary functions via an asymptotic expansion of the Meijer's G function. We also derive
new asymptotic expressions for the ergodic capacity in the low as well as high SNR regimes in terms
of simple elementary functions via utilizing moments. All the presented results are verified via
computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations.
