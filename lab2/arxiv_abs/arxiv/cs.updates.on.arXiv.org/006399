The bulk electric power system in New England is fundamentally changing. The representation of
nuclear, coal and oil generation facilities is set to dramatically fall, and natural gas, wind and
solar facilities will come to fill their place. The introduction of variable energy resources (VERs)
like solar and wind, however, necessitates fundamental changes in the power grid's dynamic operation.
VER forecasts are uncertain and their profiles are intermittent thus requiring greater quantities
of operating reserves. This paper describes the methodology and the key findings of the 2017 ISO
New England System Operational Analysis and Renewable Energy Integration Study (SOARES). This
study was commissioned by the ISO New England stakeholders to investigate the effect of several
scenarios of varying generation mix on normal operating reserves. The project was conducted using
the holistic assessment approach called the Electric Power Enterprise Control System (EPECS)
simulator.The EPECS characterizes a power system in terms of the physical power grid and its multiple
layers of control including commitment decisions, economic dispatch, and regulation services.
This paper provides precise definitions of how variable energy resources and operating reserves
are modeled. It also includes detailed models of the day-ahead resource scheduling, the same-day
resource scheduling, the real-time balancing operations and the regulation service. Among the
key findings, the reports shows that scenarios with high penetrations of VERs exhaust their operating
reserves for part of the year and all scenarios curtail semi-dispatchable resources both to complement
operating reserves and to mitigate some of the topological limitations of the system. Overall,
curtailment emerges as a key balancing performance control lever and there is a clear need for higher
amounts of operating reserves.
