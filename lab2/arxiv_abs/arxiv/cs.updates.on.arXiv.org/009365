Registration is a core component of many imaging pipelines. In case of clinical scans, with lower
resolution and sometimes substantial motion artifacts, registration can produce poor results.
Visual assessment of registration quality in large clinical datasets is inefficient. In this work,
we propose to automatically assess the quality of registration to an atlas in clinical FLAIR MRI
scans of the brain. The method consists of automatically segmenting the ventricles of a given scan
using a neural network, and comparing the segmentation to the atlas' ventricles propagated to image
space. We used the proposed method to improve clinical image registration to a general atlas by computing
multiple registrations and then selecting the registration that yielded the highest ventricle
overlap. Methods were evaluated in a single-site dataset of more than 1000 scans, as well as a multi-center
dataset comprising 142 clinical scans from 12 sites. The automated ventricle segmentation reached
a Dice coefficient with manual annotations of 0.89 in the single-site dataset, and 0.83 in the multi-center
dataset. Registration via age-specific atlases could improve ventricle overlap compared to a
direct registration to the general atlas (Dice similarity coefficient increase up to 0.15). Experiments
also showed that selecting scans with the registration quality assessment method could improve
the quality of average maps of white matter hyperintensity burden, instead of using all scans for
the computation of the white matter hyperintensity map. In this work, we demonstrated the utility
of an automated tool for assessing image registration quality in clinical scans. This image quality
assessment step could ultimately assist in the translation of automated neuroimaging pipelines
to the clinic.
