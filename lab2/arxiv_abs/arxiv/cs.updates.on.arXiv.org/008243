We study the problem of "isotropically rounding" a polytope $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, that is,
computing a linear transformation which makes the uniform distribution on the polytope have roughly
identity covariance matrix. We assume that $K$ is defined by $m$ linear inequalities, with guarantee
that $rB\subseteq K\subseteq RB$, where $B$ is the unit ball. We introduce a new variant of the ball
walk Markov chain and show that, roughly, the expected number of arithmetic operations per-step
of this Markov chain is $O(m)$ that is sublinear in the input size $mn$--the per-step time of all prior
Markov chains. Subsequently, we give a rounding algorithm that succeeds with probability $1-\varepsilon$
in $\tilde{O}(mn^{4.5}\mathrm{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r}))$ arithmetic
operations. This gives a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ improvement on the previous bound of $\tilde{O}(mn^{5}
\mathrm{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r}))$ for rounding, which uses the hit-and-run
algorithm. Since the cost of the rounding preprocessing step is in many cases the bottleneck in improving
sampling or volume computation, our results imply these tasks can also be achieved in roughly $\tilde{O}(mn^{4.5}\mathrm{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r})+mn^4\delta^{-2})$
operations for computing the volume of $K$ up to a factor $1+\delta$ and $\tilde{O}(m n^{4.5}\mathrm{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r})))$
for uniformly sampling on $K$ with TV error $\varepsilon$. This improves on the previous bounds
of $\tilde{O}(mn^{5}\mathrm{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r})+mn^4\delta^{-2})$
for volume computation and $\tilde{O}(mn^{5}\mathrm{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon},\frac{R}{r}))$
for sampling. We achieve this improvement by a novel method of computing polytope membership, where
one avoids checking inequalities which are estimated to have a very low probability of being violated.
