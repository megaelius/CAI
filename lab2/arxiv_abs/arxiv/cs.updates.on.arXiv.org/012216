In the community question answering (CQA) system, the answer selection task aims to identify the
best answer for a specific question, and thus is playing a key role in enhancing the service quality
through recommending appropriate answers for new questions. Recent advances in CQA answer selection
focus on enhancing the performance by incorporating the community information, particularly
the expertise (previous answers) and authority (position in the social network) of an answerer.
However, existing approaches for incorporating such information are limited in (a) only considering
either the expertise or the authority, but not both; (b) ignoring the domain knowledge to differentiate
topics of previous answers; and (c) simply using the authority information to adjust the similarity
score, instead of fully utilizing it in the process of measuring the similarity between segments
of the question and the answer. We propose the Knowledge-enhanced Attentive Answer Selection (KAAS)
model, which enhances the performance through (a) considering both the expertise and the authority
of the answerer; (b) utilizing the human-labeled tags, the taxonomy of the tags, and the votes as
the domain knowledge to infer the expertise of the answer; (c) using matrix decomposition of the
social network (formed by following-relationship) to infer the authority of the answerer and incorporating
such information in the process of evaluating the similarity between segments. Besides, for vertical
community, we incorporate an external knowledge graph to capture more professional information
for vertical CQA systems. Then we adopt the attention mechanism to integrate the analysis of the
text of questions and answers and the aforementioned community information. Experiments with
both vertical and general CQA sites demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed KAAS model.
