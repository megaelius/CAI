Recent years have seen a substantial development of quantitative methods, mostly led by the computer
science community with the goal to develop better machine learning application, mainly focused
on predictive modeling. However, economic, management, and technology forecasting research
has up to now been hesitant to apply predictive modeling techniques and workflows. In this paper,
we introduce to a machine learning (ML) approach to quantitative analysis geared towards optimizing
the predictive performance, contrasting it with standard practices inferential statistics which
focus on producing good parameter estimates. We discuss the potential synergies between the two
fields against the backdrop of this at first glance, \enquote{target-incompatibility}. We discuss
fundamental concepts in predictive modeling, such as out-of-sample model validation, variable
and model selection, generalization and hyperparameter tuning procedures. Providing a hands-on
predictive modelling for an quantitative social science audience, while aiming at demystifying
computer science jargon. We use the example of \enquote{high-quality} patent identification
guiding the reader through various model classes and procedures for data pre-processing, modelling
and validation. We start of with more familiar easy to interpret model classes (Logit and Elastic
Nets), continues with less familiar non-parametric approaches (Classification Trees and Random
Forest) and finally presents artificial neural network architectures, first a simple feed-forward
and then a deep autoencoder geared towards anomaly detection. Instead of limiting ourselves to
the introduction of standard ML techniques, we also present state-of-the-art yet approachable
techniques from artificial neural networks and deep learning to predict rare phenomena of interest.
