Recently, mobile ad hoc clouds have emerged as a promising technology for mobile cyber-physical
system applications, such as mobile intelligent video surveillance and smart homes. Resource
management plays a key role in maximizing resource utilization and application performance in
mobile ad hoc clouds. Unlike resource management in traditional distributed computing systems,
such as clouds, resource management in a mobile ad hoc cloud poses numerous challenges owing to the
node mobility, limited battery power, high latency, and the dynamic network environment. The real-time
requirements associated with mobile cyber-physical system applications make the problem even
more challenging. Currently, existing resource management systems for mobile ad hoc clouds are
not designed to support mobile cyber-physical system applications and energy-efficient communication
between application tasks. In this paper, we propose a new energy-efficient resource management
system for mobile ad hoc clouds. The proposed system consists of two layers: a network layer and a
middleware layer. The network layer provides ad hoc network and communication services to the middleware
layer and shares the collected information in order to allow efficient and robust resource management
decisions. It uses (1) a transmission power control mechanism to improve energy efficiency and
network capacity, (2) link lifetimes to reduce communication and energy consumption costs, and
(3) link quality to estimate data transfer times. The middleware layer is responsible for the discovery,
monitoring, migration, and allocation of resources. It receives application tasks from users
and allocates tasks to nodes on the basis of network and node-level information.
