The minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem in graphs is one of the most fundamental problems in combinatorial
optimization, and graph cuts underlie algorithms throughout discrete mathematics, theoretical
computer science, operations research, and data science. While graphs are a standard model for
pairwise relationships, hypergraphs provide the flexibility to model multi-way relationships,
and are now a standard model for complex data and systems. However, when generalizing from graphs
to hypergraphs, the notion of a "cut hyperedge" is less clear, as a hyperedge's nodes can be split
in several ways. Here, we develop a framework for hypergraph cuts by considering the problem of separating
two terminal nodes in a hypergraph in a way that minimizes a sum of penalties at split hyperedges.
In our setup, different ways of splitting the same hyperedge have different penalties, and the penalty
is encoded by what we call a splitting function. Our framework opens a rich space on the foundations
of hypergraph cuts. We first identify a natural class of cardinality-based hyperedge splitting
functions that depend only on the number of nodes on each side of the split. In this case, we show that
the general hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problem can be reduced to a tractable graph $s$-$t$ cut problem
if and only if the splitting functions are submodular. We also identify a wide regime of non-submodular
splitting functions for which the problem is NP-hard. We also analyze extensions to multiway cuts
with at least three terminal nodes and identify a natural class of splitting functions for which
the problem can be reduced in an approximation-preserving way to the node-weighted multiway cut
problem in graphs, again subject to a submodularity property. Finally, we outline several open
questions on general hypergraph cut problems.
