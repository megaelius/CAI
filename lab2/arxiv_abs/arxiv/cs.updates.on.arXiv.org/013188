Existing methods to reconstruct vascular structures from a computed tomography (CT) angiogram
rely on injection of intravenous contrast to enhance the radio-density within the vessel lumen.
However, pathological changes can be present in the blood lumen, vessel wall or a combination of
both that prevent accurate reconstruction. In the example of aortic aneurysmal disease, a blood
clot or thrombus adherent to the aortic wall within the expanding aneurysmal sac is present in 70-80%
of cases. These deformations prevent the automatic extraction of vital clinically relevant information
by current methods. In this study, we implemented a modified U-Net architecture with attention-gating
to establish a high-throughput and automated segmentation pipeline of pathological blood vessels
in CT images acquired with or without the use of a contrast agent. Twenty-six patients with paired
non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT images within the ongoing Oxford Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm
(OxAAA) study were randomly selected, manually annotated and used for model training and evaluation
(13/13). Data augmentation methods were implemented to diversify the training data set in a ratio
of 10:1. The performance of our Attention-based U-Net in extracting both the inner lumen and the
outer wall of the aortic aneurysm from CT angiograms (CTA) was compared against a generic 3-D U-Net
and displayed superior results. Subsequent implementation of this network architecture within
the aortic segmentation pipeline from both contrast-enhanced CTA and non-contrast CT images has
allowed for accurate and efficient extraction of the entire aortic volume. This extracted volume
can be used to standardize current methods of aneurysmal disease management and sets the foundation
for subsequent complex geometric and morphological analysis. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline
can be extended to other vascular pathologies.
