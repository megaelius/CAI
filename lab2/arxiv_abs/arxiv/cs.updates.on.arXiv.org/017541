Traditionally, especially in academic research in recommender systems, the focus has been solely
on the satisfaction of the end-user. While user satisfaction has, indeed, been associated with
the success of the business, it is not the only factor. In many recommendation domains, there are
other stakeholders whose needs should be taken into account in the recommendation generation and
evaluation. In this dissertation, I describe the notion of multi-stakeholder recommendation.
In particular, I study one of the most important challenges in recommendation research, popularity
bias, from a multi-stakeholder perspective since, as I show later in this dissertation, it impacts
different stakeholders in a recommender system. Popularity bias is a well-known phenomenon in
recommender systems where popular items are recommended even more frequently than their popularity
would warrant, amplifying long-tail effects already present in many recommendation domains.
Prior research has examined various approaches for mitigating popularity bias and enhancing the
recommendation of long-tail items overall. The effectiveness of these approaches, however, has
not been assessed in multi-stakeholder environments. In this dissertation, I study the impact
of popularity bias in recommender systems from a multi-stakeholder perspective. In addition,
I propose several algorithms each approaching the popularity bias mitigation from a different
angle and compare their performances using several metrics with some other state-of-the-art approaches
in the literature. I show that, often, the standard evaluation measures of popularity bias mitigation
in the literature do not reflect the real picture of an algorithm's performance when it is evaluated
from a multi-stakeholder point of view.
