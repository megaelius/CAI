Medical automatic diagnosis (MAD) aims to learn an agent that mimics the behavior of human doctors,
i.e. inquiring symptoms and informing diseases. Due to medical ethics concerns, it is impractical
to directly apply reinforcement learning techniques to MAD, e.g., training a reinforced agent
with human patients. Developing a patient simulator by using the collected patient-doctor dialogue
records has been proposed as a promising workaround to MAD. However, most of these existing works
overlook the causal relationship between patient symptoms and diseases. For example, these simulators
simply generate the "not-sure" response to the symptom inquiry if the symptom was not observed in
the dialogue record. Consequently, the MAD agent is usually trained without exploiting the counterfactual
reasoning beyond the factual observations. To address this problem, this paper presents a propensity-based
patient simulator (PBPS), which is capable of facilitating the training of MAD agents by generating
informative counterfactual answers along with the disease diagnosis. Specifically, our PBPS
estimates the propensity score of each record with the patient-doctor dialogue reasoning, and
can thus generate the counterfactual answers by searching across records. That is, the unrecorded
symptom for one patient can be found in the records of other patients according to the propensity
score matching. The informative and causal-aware responses from PBPS are beneficial for modeling
diagnostic confidence. To this end, we also propose a progressive assurance agent~(P2A) trained
with PBPS, which includes two separate yet cooperative branches accounting for the execution of
symptom-inquiry and disease-diagnosis actions, respectively.
