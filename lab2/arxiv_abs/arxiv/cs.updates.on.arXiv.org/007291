There is a growing acknowledgement in the scientific community of the importance of making experimental
data machine findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Recognizing that high
quality metadata are essential to make datasets FAIR, members of the GO FAIR Initiative and the Research
Data Alliance (RDA) have initiated a series of workshops to encourage the creation of Metadata for
Machines (M4M), enabling any self-identified stakeholder to define and promote the reuse of standardized,
comprehensive machine-actionable metadata. The funders of scientific research recognize that
they have an important role to play in ensuring that experimental results are FAIR, and that high
quality metadata and careful planning for FAIR data stewardship are central to these goals. We describe
the outcome of a recent M4M workshop that has led to a pilot programme involving two national science
funders, the Health Research Board of Ireland (HRB) and the Netherlands Organisation for Health
Research and Development (ZonMW). These funding organizations will explore new technologies
to define at the time that a request for proposals is issued the minimal set of machine-actionable
metadata that they would like investigators to use to annotate their datasets, to enable investigators
to create such metadata to help make their data FAIR, and to develop data-stewardship plans that
ensure that experimental data will be managed appropriately abiding by the FAIR principles. The
FAIR Funders design envisions a data-management workflow having seven essential stages, where
solution providers are openly invited to participate. The initial pilot programme will launch
using existing computer-based tools of those who attended the M4M Workshop.
