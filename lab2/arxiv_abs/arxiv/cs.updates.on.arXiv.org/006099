Hyperspectral images (HSI) contain a wealth of information over hundreds of contiguous spectral
bands, making it possible to classify materials through subtle spectral discrepancies. However,
the classification of this rich spectral information is accompanied by the challenges like high
dimensionality, singularity, limited training samples, lack of labeled data samples, heteroscedasticity
and nonlinearity. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised graph based dimensionality
reduction method named `semi-supervised spatial spectral regularized manifold local scaling
cut' (S3RMLSC). The underlying idea of the proposed method is to exploit the limited labeled information
from both the spectral and spatial domains along with the abundant unlabeled samples to facilitate
the classification task by retaining the original distribution of the data. In S3RMLSC, a hierarchical
guided filter (HGF) is initially used to smoothen the pixels of the HSI data to preserve the spatial
pixel consistency. This step is followed by the construction of linear patches from the nonlinear
manifold by using the maximal linear patch (MLP) criterion. Then the inter-patch and intra-patch
dissimilarity matrices are constructed in both spectral and spatial domains by regularized manifold
local scaling cut (RMLSC) and neighboring pixel manifold local scaling cut (NPMLSC) respectively.
Finally, we obtain the projection matrix by optimizing the updated semi-supervised spatial-spectral
between-patch and total-patch dissimilarity. The effectiveness of the proposed DR algorithm
is illustrated with publicly available real-world HSI datasets.
