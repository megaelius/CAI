This system paper presents the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a software platform designed for topological
data analysis in scientific visualization. TTK provides a unified, generic, efficient, and robust
implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical
points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees,
Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and
more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily
accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping
or through direct, dependence-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems.
While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which
we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete
gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This
algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported
by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale
exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports
time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input
simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory
overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient
and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings
and extensions. TTK is open source (BSD license) and its code, online documentation and video tutorials
are available on TTK's website.
