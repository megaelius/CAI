Random walk based distance measures for graphs such as commute-time distance are useful in a variety
of graph algorithms, such as clustering, anomaly detection, and creating low dimensional embeddings.
Since such measures hinge on the spectral decomposition of the graph, the computation becomes a
bottleneck for large graphs and do not scale easily to graphs that cannot be loaded in memory. Most
existing graph mining libraries for large graphs either resort to sampling or exploit the sparsity
structure of such graphs for spectral analysis. However, such methods do not work for dense graphs
constructed for studying pairwise relationships among entities in a data set. Examples of such
studies include analyzing pairwise locations in gridded climate data for discovering long distance
climate phenomena. These graphs representations are fully connected by construction and cannot
be sparsified without loss of meaningful information. In this paper we describe CADDeLaG, a framework
for scalable computation of commute-time distance based anomaly detection in large dense graphs
without the need to load the entire graph in memory. The framework relies on Apache Spark's memory-centric
cluster-computing infrastructure and consists of two building blocks: a decomposable algorithm
for commute time distance computation and a distributed linear system solver. We illustrate the
scalability of CADDeLaG and its dependency on various factors using both synthetic and real world
data sets. We demonstrate the usefulness of CADDeLaG in identifying anomalies in a climate graph
sequence, that have been historically missed due to ad hoc graph sparsification and on an election
donation data set.
