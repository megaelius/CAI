Recent work has shown that data augmentation has the potential to significantly improve the generalization
of deep learning models. Recently, learned augmentation strategies have led to state-of-the-art
results in image classification and object detection. While these strategies were optimized for
improving validation accuracy, they also led to state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised
learning and improved robustness to common corruptions of images. One obstacle to a large-scale
adoption of these methods is a separate search phase which significantly increases the training
complexity and may substantially increase the computational cost. Additionally, due to the separate
search phase, these learned augmentation approaches are unable to adjust the regularization strength
based on model or dataset size. Learned augmentation policies are often found by training small
models on small datasets and subsequently applied to train larger models. In this work, we remove
both of these obstacles. RandAugment may be trained on the model and dataset of interest with no need
for a separate proxy task. Furthermore, due to the parameterization, the regularization strength
may be tailored to different model and dataset sizes. RandAugment can be used uniformly across different
tasks and datasets and works out of the box, matching or surpassing all previous learned augmentation
approaches on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet. On the ImageNet dataset we achieve 85.0%
accuracy, a 0.6% increase over the previous state-of-the-art and 1.0% increase over baseline augmentation.
On object detection, RandAugment leads to 1.0-1.3% improvement over baseline augmentation, and
is within 0.3% mAP of AutoAugment on COCO. Finally, due to its interpretable hyperparameter, RandAugment
may be used to investigate the role of data augmentation with varying model and dataset size.
