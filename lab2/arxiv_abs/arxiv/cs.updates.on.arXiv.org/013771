We consider the online Min-Sum Set Cover (MSSC), a natural and intriguing generalization of the
classical list update problem. In Online MSSC, the algorithm maintains a permutation on $n$ elements
based on subsets $S_1, S_2, \ldots$ arriving online. The algorithm serves each set $S_t$ upon arrival,
using its current permutation $\pi_{t}$, incurring an access cost equal to the position of the first
element of $S_t$ in $\pi_{t}$. Then, the algorithm may update its permutation to $\pi_{t+1}$, incurring
a moving cost equal to the Kendall tau distance of $\pi_{t}$ to $\pi_{t+1}$. The objective is to minimize
the total access and moving cost for serving the entire sequence. We consider the $r$-uniform version,
where each $S_t$ has cardinality $r$. List update is the special case where $r = 1$. We obtain tight
bounds on the competitive ratio of deterministic online algorithms for MSSC against a static adversary,
that serves the entire sequence by a single permutation. First, we show a lower bound of $(r+1)(1-\frac{r}{n+1})$
on the competitive ratio. Then, we consider several natural generalizations of successful list
update algorithms and show that they fail to achieve any interesting competitive guarantee. On
the positive side, we obtain a $O(r)$-competitive deterministic algorithm using ideas from online
learning and the multiplicative weight updates (MWU) algorithm. Furthermore, we consider efficient
algorithms. We propose a memoryless online algorithm, called Move-All-Equally, which is inspired
by the Double Coverage algorithm for the $k$-server problem. We show that its competitive ratio
is $\Omega(r^2)$ and $2^{O(\sqrt{\log n \cdot \log r})}$, and conjecture that it is $f(r)$-competitive.
We also compare Move-All-Equally against the dynamic optimal solution and obtain (almost) tight
bounds by showing that it is $\Omega(r \sqrt{n})$ and $O(r^{3/2} \sqrt{n})$-competitive.
