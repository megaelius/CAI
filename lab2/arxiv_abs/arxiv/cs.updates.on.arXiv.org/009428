We study a robust control problem for dynamical flow networks. In the considered dynamical models,
traffic flows along the links of a transportation network --modeled as a capacited multigraph--
and queues up at the nodes, whereby control policies determine which incoming queues at a node are
to be allocated service simultaneously, within some predetermined scheduling constraints. We
first prove a fundamental performance limitation by showing that for a dynamical flow network to
be stabilizable by some control policy it is necessary that the exogenous inflows belong to a certain
stability region, that is determined by the network topology, link capacities, and scheduling
constraints. Then, we introduce a family of distributed controls, referred to as Generalized Proportional
Allocation (GPA) policies, and prove that they stabilize a dynamical transportation network whenever
the exogenous inflows belong to such stability region. The proposed GPA control policies are decentralized
and fully scalable as they rely on local feedback information only. Differently from previously
studied maximally stabilizing control strategies, the GPA control policies do not require any
global information about the network topology, the exogenous inflows, or the routing, which makes
them robust to demand variations and unpredicted changes in the link capacities or the routing decisions.
Moreover, the proposed GPA control policies also take into account the overhead time while switching
between services. Our theoretical results find one application in the control of urban traffic
networks with signalized intersections, where vehicles have to queue up at junctions and the traffic
signal controls determine the green light allocation to the different incoming lanes.
