Very recent studies showed that in a fully loaded dense small cell network (SCN), the coverage probability
performance will continuously decrease with the network densification. Such new results were
captured in IEEE ComSoc Technology News with an alarming title of "Will Densification Be the Death
of 5G?". In this paper, we revisit this issue from more practical views of realistic network deployment,
such as a finite number of active base stations (BSs) and user equipments (UEs), a decreasing BS transmission
power with the network densification, etc. Particularly, in dense SCNs, due to an oversupply of
BSs with respect to UEs, a large number of BSs can be put into idle modes without signal transmission,
if there is no active UE within their coverage areas. Setting those BSs into idle modes mitigates
unnecessary inter-cell interference and reduces energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate
the performance impact of such BS idle mode capability (IMC) on dense SCNs. Different from existing
work, we consider a realistic path loss model incorporating both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) transmissions. Moreover, we obtain analytical results for the coverage probability, the
area spectral efficiency (ASE) and the energy efficiency (EE) performance for SCNs with the BS IMC
and show that the performance impact of the IMC on dense SCNs is significant. As the BS density surpasses
the UE density in dense SCNs, the coverage probability will continuously increase toward one, addressing
previous concerns on "the death of 5G". Finally, the performance improvement in terms of the EE performance
is also investigated for dense SCNs using practical energy models developed in the Green-Touch
project.
