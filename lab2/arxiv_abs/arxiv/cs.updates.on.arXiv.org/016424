Online template attack (OTA) is a powerful technique previously used to attack elliptic curve scalar
multiplication algorithms. This attack has been only analyzed in the realm of power-consumption
and EM side-channels, where the signals leak about the value to be processed. However, no microarchitecture
analysis variant has been proposed, especially considering the different nature between power-consumption
signals and microarchitecture-based ones. In this paper we start filling this gap by revisiting
the original OTA description, proposing a generic framework and evaluation metrics for any side-channel
signal. Our analysis reveals OTA features not covered before, increasing its application scenarios
that requires revisiting original countermeasures to prevent it. In this regard we demonstrate
that OTA can work in the backward direction allowing to mount an augmented projective coordinates
attack wrt the proposed by Naccache et al. (Eurocrypt 2004). We analyze three libraries libgcrypt,
mbedTLS, and wolfSSL using two microarchitecture side-channels. For the libgcrypt case we target
its EdDSA implementation using Curve25519 twist curve. We obtain similar results for mbedTLS and
wolfSSL with curve secp256r1. For each library we execute extensive attack instances being able
to recover the complete scalar in all cases using a single trace. In this work demonstrate that microarchitecture
online template attacks are also very powerful in this scenario, recovering secret information
without knowing a leakage model. This highlights the importance of developing secure-by-default
implementations, instead of fix-on-demand ones.
