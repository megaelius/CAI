In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limitations of feedback mechanism in dealing with
uncertainties for network systems. The study of maximum capability of feedback control was pioneered
in Xie and Guo (2000) for scalar systems with nonparametric nonlinear uncertainty. In a network
setting, nodes with unknown and nonlinear dynamics are interconnected through a directed interaction
graph. Nodes can design feedback controls based on all available information, where the objective
is to stabilize the network state. Using information structure and decision pattern as criteria,
we specify three categories of network feedback laws, namely the global-knowledge/global-decision,
network-flow/local-decision, and local-flow/local-decision feedback. We establish a series
of network capacity characterizations for these three fundamental types of network control laws.
First of all, we prove that for global-knowledge/global-decision and network-flow/local-decision
control where nodes know the information flow across the entire network, there exists a critical
number $\big(3/2+\sqrt{2}\big)/\|A_{\mathrm{G}}\|_\infty$, where $3/2+\sqrt{2}$ is as known
as the Xie-Guo constant and $A_{\mathrm{G}}$ is the network adjacency matrix, defining exactly
how much uncertainty in the node dynamics can be overcome by feedback. Interestingly enough, the
same feedback capacity can be achieved under max-consensus enhanced local flows where nodes only
observe information flows from neighbors as well as extreme (max and min) states in the network.
Next, for local-flow/local-decision control, we prove that there exists a structure-determined
value being a lower bound of the network feedback capacity. These results reveal the important connection
between network structure and fundamental capabilities of in-network feedback control.
