With more than 1.3 Billion in the cumulative number of downloads reported, the top six applications
compete in the niche of Wi-Fi Direct D2D file sharing on Android. With the highest userbase in India
and Indonesia, ShareIT itself reports the number of active users of their application on desktop
and mobile devices exceeding 1.8 billion, ranked top 7 globally by the number of downloads on Google
Play and Apple App Store in 2018. Wi-Fi Direct, also known as Wi-Fi P2P, is commonly used for peer-to-peer,
high-speed file transfer between mobile devices, as well as a close proximity connection mode for
wireless cameras, network printers, TVs and other IoT and mobile devices. For its end users, such
type of direct file transfer does not result in cellular data charges and allows to keep their primary
Wi-Fi interface up concurrently with a dedicated Wi-Fi P2P interface, which is commonly provided
by the default wireless module of the mobile phone. However, despite the popularity of these solutions
demonstrated by Google Play download statistics, we observe that the software vendors tend to prioritize
the ease of user flow over the security of the implementation, introducing serious security flaws.
We perform a comprehensive security analysis in the context of security and usability behind the
identified flaws and report our findings in the form of 16 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE), disclosed to the corresponding vendors. To address the similar flaws at the early stage of
the application design, we propose a joint consideration of Security and Usability for such applications
and their protocols that can be visualized in form of a User Journey Map (UJM).
