Deep learning technologies such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide powerful methods
for image recognition and have recently been employed in the field of automated carcinoma detection
in confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) images. CLE is a (sub-)surface microscopic imaging technique
that reaches magnifications of up to 1000x and is thus suitable for in vivo structural tissue analysis.
In this work, we aim to evaluate the prospects of a priorly developed deep learning-based algorithm
targeted at the identification of oral squamous cell carcinoma with regard to its generalization
to further anatomic locations of squamous cell carcinomas in the area of head and neck. We applied
the algorithm on images acquired from the vocal fold area of five patients with histologically verified
squamous cell carcinoma and presumably healthy control images of the clinically normal contra-lateral
vocal cord. We find that the network trained on the oral cavity data reaches an accuracy of 89.45%
and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.955, when applied on the vocal cords data. Compared
to the state of the art, we achieve very similar results, yet with an algorithm that was trained on
a completely disjunct data set. Concatenating both data sets yielded further improvements in cross-validation
with an accuracy of 90.81% and AUC of 0.970. In this study, for the first time to our knowledge, a deep
learning mechanism for the identification of oral carcinomas using CLE Images could be applied
to other disciplines in the area of head and neck. This study shows the prospect of the algorithmic
approach to generalize well on other malignant entities of the head and neck, regardless of the anatomical
location and furthermore in an examiner-independent manner.
