The framework of document spanners abstracts the task of information extraction from text as a function
that maps every document (a string) into a relation over the document's spans (intervals identified
by their start and end indices). For instance, the regular spanners are the closure under the Relational
Algebra (RA) of the regular expressions with capture variables, and the expressive power of the
regular spanners is precisely captured by the class of vset-automata - a restricted class of transducers
that mark the endpoints of selected spans. In this work, we embark on the investigation of document
spanners that can annotate extractions with auxiliary information such as confidence, support,
and confidentiality measures. To this end, we adopt the abstraction of provenance semirings by
Green et al., where tuples of a relation are annotated with the elements of a commutative semiring,
and where the annotation propagates through the (positive) RA operators via the semiring operators.
Hence, the proposed spanner extension, referred to as an annotator, maps every string into an annotated
relation over the spans. As a specific instantiation, we explore weighted vset-automata that,
similarly to weighted automata and transducers, attach semiring elements to transitions. We investigate
key aspects of expressiveness, such as the closure under the positive RA, and key aspects of computational
complexity, such as the enumeration of annotated answers and their ranked enumeration in the case
of numeric semirings. For a number of these problems, fundamental properties of the underlying
semiring, such as positivity, are crucial for establishing tractability.
