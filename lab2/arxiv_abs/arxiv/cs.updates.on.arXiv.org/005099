Optical communication achieves high fanout and short delay advantageous for information integration
in neural systems. Superconducting detectors enable signaling with single photons for maximal
energy efficiency. We present designs of superconducting optoelectronic neurons based on superconducting
single-photon detectors, Josephson junctions, semiconductor light sources, and multi-planar
dielectric waveguides. These circuits achieve complex synaptic and neuronal functions with high
energy efficiency, leveraging the strengths of light for communication and superconducting electronics
for computation. The neurons send few-photon signals to synaptic connections. These signals communicate
neuronal firing events as well as update synaptic weights. Spike-timing-dependent plasticity
is implemented with a single photon triggering each step of the process. Microscale light-emitting
diodes and waveguide networks enable connectivity from a neuron to thousands of synaptic connections,
and the use of light for communication enables synchronization of neurons across an area limited
only by the distance light can travel within the period of a network oscillation. Experimentally,
each of the requisite circuit elements has been demonstrated, yet a hardware platform combining
them all has not been attempted. Compared to digital logic or quantum computing, device tolerances
are relaxed. For this neural application, optical sources providing incoherent pulses with 10,000
photons produced with efficiency of 10$^{-3}$ operating at 20\,MHz at 4.2\,K are sufficient to
enable a massively scalable neural computing platform with connectivity comparable to the brain
and thirty thousand times higher speed.
