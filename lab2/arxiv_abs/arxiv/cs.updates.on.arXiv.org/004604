In spite of progress in securing Vehicular Communication (VC) systems, there is no consensus on
how to distribute Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). The main challenges lie exactly in (i) crafting
an efficient and timely distribution of CRLs for numerous anonymous credentials, pseudonyms,
(ii) maintaining strong privacy for vehicles prior to revocation events, even with honest-but-curious
system entities, (iii) and catering to computation and communication constraints of on-board
units with intermittent connectivity to the infrastructure. Relying on peers to distribute the
CRLs is a double-edged sword: abusive peers could "pollute" the process, thus degrading the timely
CRLs distribution. In this paper, we propose a vehicle-centric solution that addresses all these
challenges and thus closes a gap in the literature. Our scheme radically reduces CRL distribution
overhead: each vehicle receives CRLs corresponding only to its region of operation and its actual
trip duration. Moreover, a "fingerprint" of CRL 'pieces' is attached to a subset of (verifiable)
pseudonyms for fast CRL 'piece' validation (while mitigating resource depletion attacks abusing
the CRL distribution). Our experimental evaluation shows that our scheme is efficient, scalable,
dependable, and practical: with no more than 25 KB/s of traffic load, the latest CRL can be delivered
to 95% of the vehicles in a region (50x50 KM) within 15s, i.e., more than 40 times faster than the state-of-the-art.
Overall, our scheme is a comprehensive solution that complements standards and can catalyze the
deployment of secure and privacy-protecting VC systems.
