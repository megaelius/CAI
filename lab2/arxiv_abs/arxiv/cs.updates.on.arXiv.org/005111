Feature selection can efficiently identify the most informative features with respect to the target
feature used in training. However, state-of-the-art vector-based methods are unable to encapsulate
the relationships between feature samples into the feature selection process, thus leading to
significant information loss. To address this problem, we propose a new graph-based structurally
interacting elastic net method for feature selection. Specifically, we commence by constructing
feature graphs that can incorporate pairwise relationship between samples. With the feature graphs
to hand, we propose a new information theoretic criterion to measure the joint relevance of different
pairwise feature combinations with respect to the target feature graph representation. This measure
is used to obtain a structural interaction matrix where the elements represent the proposed information
theoretic measure between feature pairs. We then formulate a new optimization model through the
combination of the structural interaction matrix and an elastic net regression model for the feature
subset selection problem. This allows us to a) preserve the information of the original vectorial
space, b) remedy the information loss of the original feature space caused by using graph representation,
and c) promote a sparse solution and also encourage correlated features to be selected. Because
the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we develop an efficient alternating direction
multiplier method (ADMM) to locate the optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on various datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
