In many applications, there is a need to predict the effect of an intervention on different individuals
from data. For example, which customers are persuadable by a product promotion? which groups would
benefit from a new policy? These are typical causal classification questions involving the effect
or the change in outcomes made by an intervention. The questions cannot be answered with traditional
classification methods as they only deal with static outcomes. In marketing research these questions
are often answered with uplift modelling, using experimental data. Some machine learning methods
have been proposed for heterogeneous causal effect estimation using either experimental or observational
data. In principle these methods can be used for causal classification, but a limited number of methods,
mainly tree based, on causal heterogeneity modelling, are inadequate for various real world applications.
In this paper, we propose a general framework for causal classification, as a generalisation of
both uplift modelling and causal heterogeneity modelling. When developing the framework, we have
identified the conditions where causal classification in both observational and experimental
data can be resolved by a naive solution using off-the-shelf classification methods, which supports
flexible implementations for various applications. This result not only enables a practical way
to solve the causal classification problem by using any existing classification method in the proposed
framework, but also makes it possible to cross use the methods developed in both uplift modelling
and causal heterogeneity modelling areas when the conditions are satisfied. Experiments have
shown that our framework with off-the-shelf classification methods is as competitive as the tailor-designed
uplift modelling and heterogeneous causal effect modelling methods.
