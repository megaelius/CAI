The input to the NP-hard Point Line Cover problem (PLC) consists of a set $P$ of $n$ points on the plane
and a positive integer $k$, and the question is whether there exists a set of at most $k$ lines which
pass through all points in $P$. A simple polynomial-time reduction reduces any input to one with
at most $k^2$ points. We show that this is essentially tight under standard assumptions. More precisely,
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level, there is no polynomial-time algorithm
that reduces every instance $(P,k)$ of PLC to an equivalent instance with $O(k^{2-\epsilon})$
points, for any $\epsilon>0$. This answers, in the negative, an open problem posed by Lokshtanov
(PhD Thesis, 2009). Our proof uses the machinery for deriving lower bounds on the size of kernels
developed by Dell and van Melkebeek (STOC 2010). It has two main ingredients: We first show, by reduction
from Vertex Cover, that PLC---conditionally---has no kernel of total size $O(k^{2-\epsilon})$
bits. This does not directly imply the claimed lower bound on the number of points, since the best
known polynomial-time encoding of a PLC instance with $n$ points requires $\omega(n^{2})$ bits.
To get around this we build on work of Goodman et al. (STOC 1989) and devise an oracle communication
protocol of cost $O(n\log n)$ for PLC; its main building block is a bound of $O(n^{O(n)})$ for the
order types of $n$ points that are not necessarily in general position, and an explicit algorithm
that enumerates all possible order types of n points. This protocol and the lower bound on total size
together yield the stated lower bound on the number of points. While a number of essentially tight
polynomial lower bounds on total sizes of kernels are known, our result is---to the best of our knowledge---the
first to show a nontrivial lower bound for structural/secondary parameters.
