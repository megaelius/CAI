Wireless communication enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as an appealing
technology for many application scenarios in future wireless systems. However, the limited endurance
of UAVs greatly hinders the practical implementation of UAV-enabled communications. To overcome
this issue, this paper proposes a novel scheme for UAV-enabled communications by utilizing the
promising technique of proactive caching at the users. Specifically, we focus on content-centric
communication systems, where a UAV is dispatched to serve a group of ground nodes (GNs) with random
and asynchronous requests for files drawn from a given set. With the proposed scheme, at the beginning
of each operation period, the UAV pro-actively transmits the files to a subset of selected GNs that
cooperatively cache all the files in the set. As a result, when requested, a file can be retrieved
by each GN either directly from its local cache or from its nearest neighbor that has cached the file
via device-to-device (D2D) communications. It is revealed that there exists a fundamental trade-off
between the file caching cost, which is the total time required for the UAV to transmit the files to
their designated caching GNs, and the file retrieval cost, which is the average time required for
serving one file request. To characterize this trade-off, we formulate an optimization problem
to minimize the weighted sum of the two costs, via jointly designing the file caching policy, the
UAV trajectory and communication scheduling. As the formulated problem is NP-hard in general,
we propose efficient algorithms to find high-quality approximate solutions for it. Numerical
results are provided to corroborate our study and show the great potential of proactive caching
for overcoming the limited endurance issue in UAV-enabled communications.
