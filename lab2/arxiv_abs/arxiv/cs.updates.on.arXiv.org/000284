The fourth international workshop on Computational Models for Cell Processes (CompMod 2013) took
place on June 11, 2013 at the {\AA}bo Akademi University, Turku, Finland, in conjunction with iFM
2013. The first edition of the workshop (2008) took place in Turku, Finland, in conjunction with
Formal Methods 2008, the second edition (2009) took place in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, as well
in conjunction with Formal Methods 2009, and the third one took place in Aachen, Germany, in conjunction
with CONCUR 2013. This volume contains the final versions of all contributions accepted for presentation
at the workshop. The goal of the CompMod workshop series is to bring together researchers in Computer
Science and Mathematics (both discrete and continuous), interested in the opportunities and the
challenges of Systems Biology. The Program Committee of CompMod 2013 selected 3 papers for presentation
at the workshop. In addition, we had two invited talks and five informal presentations. The scientific
program of the workshop spans an interesting mix of approaches to systems and even synthetic biology,
encompassing several different modeling approaches, ranging from quantitative to qualitative
techniques, from continuous to discrete mathematics, and from deterministic to stochastic methods.
We thank our invited speakers Daniela Besozzi (Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy)
and Juho Rousu (Aalto University, Finland) for accepting our invitation and for presenting some
of their recent results at CompMod 2013. The technical contributions address the mathematical
modeling of the PDGF signalling pathway, the canonical labelling of site graphs, rule-based modeling
of polymerization reactions, rule-based modeling as a platform for the analysis of synthetic self-assembled
nano-systems, robustness analysis of stochastic systems, an algebraic approach to gene assembly
in ciliates, and large-scale text mining of biomedical literature.
