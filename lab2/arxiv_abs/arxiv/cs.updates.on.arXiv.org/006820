The drug discovery process involves several tasks to be performed in vivo, in vitro and in silico.
Molecular docking is a task typically performed in silico. It aims at finding the three-dimensional
pose of a given molecule when it interacts with the target protein binding site. This task is often
done for virtual screening a huge set of molecules to find the most promising ones, which will be forwarded
to the later stages of the drug discovery process. Given the huge complexity of the problem, molecular
docking cannot be solved by exploring the entire space of the ligand poses. State-of-the-art approaches
face the problem by sampling the space of the ligand poses to generate results in a reasonable time
budget. In this work, we improve the geometric approach to molecular docking by introducing tunable
approximations. In particular, we analyzed and enriched the original implementation with tunable
software knobs to explore and control the performance-accuracy tradeoffs. We modeled time-to-solution
of the virtual screening task as a function of software knobs, input data features, and available
computational resources. Therefore, the application can autotune its configuration according
to a user-defined time budget. We used a Mini-App derived by LiGenDock - a state-of-the-art molecular
docking application - to validate the proposed approach. We run the enhanced Mini-App on an HPC system
by using a very large database of pockets and ligands. The proposed approach exposes a time-to-solution
interval spanning more than one order of magnitude with accuracy degradation up to 30%, more in general
providing different accuracy levels according to the needs of the virtual screening campaign.
