Biological data are generally high-dimensional and require efficient machine learning methods
that are well generalized and scalable to discover their complex nonlinear patterns. The recent
advances in the domain of artificial intelligence and machine learning can be attributed to deep
neural networks (DNNs) because they accomplish a variety of tasks in computer vision and natural
language processing. However, standard DNNs are not suitable for handling high-dimensional data
and data with small number of samples because they require a large pool of computing resources as
well as plenty of samples to learn a large number of parameters. In particular, although interpretability
is important for high-dimensional biological data such as gene expression data, a nonlinear feature
selection algorithm for DNN models has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel
nonlinear feature selection method called the Feature Selection Network (FsNet), which is a scalable
concrete neural network architecture, under high-dimensional and small number of samples setups.
Specifically, our network consists of a selector layer that uses a concrete random variable for
discrete feature selection and a supervised deep neural network regularized with the reconstruction
loss. Because a large number of parameters in the selector and reconstruction layer can easily cause
overfitting under a limited number of samples, we use two tiny networks to predict the large virtual
weight matrices of the selector and reconstruction layers. The experimental results on several
real-world high-dimensional biological datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
