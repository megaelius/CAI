This paper proposed a hierarchical visible autoencoder in the adaptive phantom limbs generation
according to the kinetic behavior of functional body-parts, which are measured by heterogeneous
kinetic sensors. The proposed visible hierarchical autoencoder consists of interpretable and
multi-correlated autoencoder pipelines, which is directly derived from the hierarchical network
described in forest data-structure. According to specified kinetic script (e.g., dancing, running,
etc.) and users' physical conditions, hierarchical network is extracted from human musculoskeletal
network, which is fabricated by multiple body components (e.g., muscle, bone, and joints, etc.)
that are bio-mechanically, functionally, or nervously correlated with each other and exhibit
mostly non-divergent kinetic behaviors. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor models, as well
as several variations of autoencoder models, are investigated for the sequential generation of
missing or dysfunctional limbs. The resulting kinematic behavior of phantom limbs will be constructed
using virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR), actuators, and potentially controller for
a prosthesis (an artificial device that replaces a missing body part). The addressed work aims to
develop practical innovative exercise methods that (1) engage individuals at all ages, including
those with a chronic health condition(s) and/or disability, in regular physical activities, (2)
accelerate the rehabilitation of patients, and (3) release users' phantom limb pain. The physiological
and psychological impact of the addressed work will critically be assessed in future work.
