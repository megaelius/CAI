Due to the dominance of the downlink traffic in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), a large number
of previous research efforts have been put to enhance the transmission from the Access Point (AP)
to stations (STAs). IEEE 802.11ac, the amendment for next generation WLANs, will support Multi-User
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) in the downlink, which is considered as one of the key
techniques leading WLANs to the Gigabit era. However, as cloud-based uploading services, Peer-to-Peer
(P2P) and telepresence applications get popular, the need for a higher uplink capacity has also
become inevitable. In this paper, a unified down/up-link Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol
called Uni-MUMAC is proposed to enhance the performance of IEEE 802.11ac WLANs by exploring the
multi-user spatial multiplexing. Specifically, in the downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant
MU-MIMO transmission scheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the
uplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two rounds, which enable
multiple STAs to transmit frames towards the AP in parallel. 2-nd round Contention Window (CW2nd
), a parameter that makes the length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic
condition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in saturated and non-saturated
conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic are present in the system. By properly setting
CW2nd and other parameters, a WLAN implementing Uni-MUMAC exhibits that the system not only performs
well in the downlink traffic dominated scenario, but it is also able to balance both the downlink
and uplink throughput in the emerging uplink bandwidth-hungry scenario.
