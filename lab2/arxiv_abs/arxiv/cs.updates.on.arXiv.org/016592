This paper studies the existence of pure Nash equilibria in resource graph games, which are a general
class of strategic games used to succinctly represent the players' private costs. There is a finite
set of resources and the strategy set of each player corresponds to a set of subsets of resources.
The cost of a resource is an arbitrary function that depends on the load vector of the resources in
a specified neighborhood. As our main result, we give complete characterizations of the cost functions
guaranteeing the existence of pure Nash equilibria for weighted and unweighted players, respectively.
1. For unweighted players, pure Nash equilibria are guaranteed to exist for any choice of the players'
strategy space if and only if the cost of each resource is an arbitrary function of the load of the resource
itself and linear in the load of all other resources where the linear coefficients of mutual influence
of different resources are symmetric. 2. For games with weighted players, pure Nash equilibria
are guaranteed to exist for any choice of the players' strategy space if and only if the cost of a resource
is linear in all resource loads, and the linear factors of mutual influence are symmetric, or there
is no interaction among resources and the cost is an exponential function of the local resource load.
3. For the special case that the players' strategy sets are matroids, we show that pure Nash equilibria
exist under a local monotonicity property, even when cost functions are player-specific. We point
out an application of this result to bilevel load balancing games, which are motivated by the study
of network infrastructures that are resilient against external attackers and internal congestion
effects. 4. Finally, we derive hardness results for deciding whether a given strategy is a pure Nash
equilibrium for network routing games and matroid games, respectively.
