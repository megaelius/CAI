We study decompositions of graphs that cover small-cardinality cuts an even number of times, and
we use these decompositions to design algorithms with improved approximation guarantees for the
traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the 2-edge-connected spanning multigraph problem (2EC)
on (restricted classes of) weighted graphs. For example, Boyd, Iwata and Takazawa recently presented
an algorithm to find a cycle cover that covers all 3- and 4-edge cuts in a bridgeless, cubic graph with
applications to 2EC on 3-edge-connected, cubic graphs. We present several applications of their
algorithm to connectivity problems on node-weighted graphs, which has been suggested as an intermediate
step between graph and general metrics. Specifically, on 3-edge-connected, cubic, node-weighted
graphs, we present a $\frac{7}{5}$-approximation algorithm for TSP and a $\frac{13}{10}$-approximation
algorithm for 2EC. To extend this approach to graphs that are 2-edge connected, we present a procedure
to decompose an optimal solution for the subtour linear program into spanning, connected subgraphs
that cover each 2-edge cut an even number of times. We use this decomposition to design a simple $\frac{4}{3}$-approximation
algorithm for 2EC on subcubic, node-weighted graphs. Finally, motivated by the well known "four-thirds
conjecture", we apply these decomposition tools to the problem of uniform covers. For a cubic, 3-edge-connected
graph, we show that the everywhere $\frac{18}{19}$ vector can be efficiently written as a convex
combination of tours, answering a question of Seb\H{o}. Additionally, for such graphs, we show
that the everywhere $\frac{15}{17}$ can be efficiently written as a convex combination of 2-edge-connected
spanning multigraphs.
