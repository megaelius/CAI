Parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas have experienced increased rates of seismicity in recent years,
providing new datasets of earthquake recordings to develop ground motion prediction models for
this particular region of the Central and Eastern North America (CENA). This paper outlines a framework
for using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to develop attenuation models from the ground motion
recordings in this region. While attenuation models exist for the CENA, concerns over the increased
rate of seismicity in this region necessitate investigation of ground motions prediction models
particular to these states. To do so, an ANN-based framework is proposed to predict peak ground acceleration
(PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) given magnitude, earthquake source-to-site distance, and
shear wave velocity. In this framework, approximately 4,500 ground motions with magnitude greater
than 3.0 recorded in these three states (Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas) since 2005 are considered.
Results from this study suggest that existing ground motion prediction models developed for CENA
do not accurately predict the ground motion intensity measures for earthquakes in this region,
especially for those with low source-to-site distances or on very soft soil conditions. The proposed
ANN models provide much more accurate prediction of the ground motion intensity measures at all
distances and magnitudes. The proposed ANN models are also converted to relatively simple mathematical
equations so that engineers can easily use them to predict the ground motion intensity measures
for future events. Finally, through a sensitivity analysis, the contributions of the predictive
parameters to the prediction of the considered intensity measures are investigated.
