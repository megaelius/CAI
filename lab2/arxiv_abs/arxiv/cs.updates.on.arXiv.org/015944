The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework introduced recently incorporates physics
into deep learning, and offers a promising avenue for the solution of partial differential equations
(PDEs) as well as identification of the equation parameters. The performance of existing PINN approaches,
however, may degrade in the presence of sharp gradients, as a result of the inability of the network
to capture the solution behavior globally. We posit that this shortcoming may be remedied by introducing
long-range (nonlocal) interactions into the network's input, in addition to the short-range (local)
space and time variables. Following this ansatz, here we develop a nonlocal PINN approach using
the Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO)---a numerical method which incorporates long-range
interactions and removes spatial derivatives in the governing equations. Because the PDDO functions
can be readily incorporated in the neural network architecture, the nonlocality does not degrade
the performance of modern deep-learning algorithms. We apply nonlocal PDDO-PINN to the solution
and identification of material parameters in solid mechanics and, specifically, to elastoplastic
deformation in a domain subjected to indentation by a rigid punch, for which the mixed displacement--traction
boundary condition leads to localized deformation and sharp gradients in the solution. We document
the superior behavior of nonlocal PINN with respect to local PINN in both solution accuracy and parameter
inference, illustrating its potential for simulation and discovery of partial differential equations
whose solution develops sharp gradients.
