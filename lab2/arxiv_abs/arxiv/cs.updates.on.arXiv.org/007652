Accompanied by the successful progress of deep representation learning, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been widely applied to improve the accuracy of polarimetric synthetic aperture
radar (PolSAR) image classification. However, in most applications, the difference between PolSAR
image and optical image is rarely considered. The design of most existing network structures is
not tailored to the characteristics of PolSAR image data and complex-valued data of PolSAR image
are simply equated to real-valued data to adapt to the existing mainstream network pipeline to avoid
complex-valued operations. These make CNNs unable to perform their full capabilities in the PolSAR
image classification tasks. In this paper, we focus on finding a better input form of PolSAR image
data and designing special CNN structures that are more compatible with PolSAR image. Considering
the relationship between complex number and its amplitude and phase, we extract the amplitude and
phase of the complex-valued PolSAR image data as input to maintain the integrity of the original
information while avoiding the current immature complex-valued operations, and a novel multi-task
CNN framework is proposed to adapt to novel form of input data. Furthermore, in order to better explore
the unique phase information in the PolSAR image data, depthwise separable convolutions are applied
to the proposed multi-task CNN model. Experiments on three benchmark datasets not only prove that
using amplitude and phase information as input does contribute to the improvement of classification
accuracy, but also verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods for amplitude and phase input.
