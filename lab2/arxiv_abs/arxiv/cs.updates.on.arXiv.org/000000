Conventional neuro-computing architectures and artificial neural networks have often been developed
with no or loose connections to neuroscience. As a consequence, they have largely ignored key features
of biological neural processing systems, such as their extremely low-power consumption features
or their ability to carry out robust and efficient computation using massively parallel arrays
of limited precision, highly variable, and unreliable components. Recent developments in nano-technologies
are making available extremely compact and low-power, but also variable and unreliable solid-state
devices that can potentially extend the offerings of availing CMOS technologies. In particular,
memristors are regarded as a promising solution for modeling key features of biological synapses
due to their nanoscale dimensions, their capacity to store multiple bits of information per element
and the low energy required to write distinct states. In this paper, we first review the neuro- and
neuromorphic-computing approaches that can best exploit the properties of memristor and-scale
devices, and then propose a novel hybrid memristor-CMOS neuromorphic circuit which represents
a radical departure from conventional neuro-computing approaches, as it uses memristors to directly
emulate the biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses. We point out the differences between
the use of memristors in conventional neuro-computing architectures and the hybrid memristor-CMOS
circuit proposed, and argue how this circuit represents an ideal building block for implementing
brain-inspired probabilistic computing paradigms that are robust to variability and fault-tolerant
by design.
