Population synthesis is concerned with the generation of synthetic yet realistic representations
of populations. It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transport where the synthetic populations
of micro-agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological
framework for how to 'grow' pools of micro-agents is presented. The model framework adopts a deep
generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches, including Iterative Proportional
Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling and traditional generative models such as Bayesian Networks or Hidden
Markov Models, the proposed method allows fitting the full joint distribution for high dimensions.
The proposed methodology is compared with a conventional Gibbs sampler and a Bayesian Network by
using a large-scale Danish trip diary. It is shown that, while these two methods outperform the VAE
in the low-dimensional case, they both suffer from scalability issues when the number of modeled
attributes increases. It is also shown that the Gibbs sampler essentially replicates the agents
from the original sample when the required conditional distributions are estimated as frequency
tables. In contrast, the VAE allows addressing the problem of sampling zeros by generating agents
that are virtually different from those in the original data but have similar statistical properties.
The presented approach can support agent-based modeling at all levels by enabling richer synthetic
populations with smaller zones and more detailed individual characteristics.
