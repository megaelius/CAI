Motivation: Since long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have involved in a wide range of functions in cellular
and developmental processes, an increasing number of methods have been proposed for distinguishing
lncRNAs from coding RNAs. However, most of the existing methods are designed for lncRNAs in animal
systems, and only a few methods focus on the plant lncRNA identification. Different from lncRNAs
in animal systems, plant lncRNAs have distinct characteristics. It is desirable to develop a computational
method for accurate and robust identification of plant lncRNAs. Results: Herein, we present a plant
lncRNA identification method ItLnc-BXE, which utilizes multiple features and the ensemble learning
strategy. First, a diversity of lncRNA features is collected and filtered by feature selection
to represent RNA transcripts. Then, several base learners are trained and further combined into
a single meta-learner by ensemble learning, and thus an ItLnc-BXE model is constructed. ItLnc-BXE
models are evaluated on datasets of six plant species, the results show that ItLnc-BXE outperforms
other state-of-the-art plant lncRNA identification methods, achieving better and robust performances
(AUC>95.91%). We also perform some experiments about cross-species lncRNA identification, and
the results indicate that dicots-based and monocots-based models can be used to accurately identify
lncRNAs in lower plant species, such as mosses and algae. Availability: source codes are available
