The importance of graph mining has been widely recognized thanks to a large variety of applications
in many areas, while real datasets always play important roles to examine the solution quality and
efficiency of a graph mining algorithm. Nevertheless, the size of a real dataset is usually fixed
and constrained according to the available resources, such as the efforts to crawl an on-line social
network. In this case, employing a synthetic graph generator is a possible way to generate a massive
graph (e.g., billions nodes) for evaluating the scalability of an algorithm, and current popular
statistical graph generators are properly designed to maintain statistical metrics such as total
node degree, degree distribution, diameter, and clustering coefficient of the original social
graphs. Nevertheless, in addition to the above metrics, recent studies on graph mining point out
that graph frequent patterns are also important to provide useful implications for the corresponding
social networking applications, but this crucial criterion has not been noticed in the existing
graph generators. This paper first manifests that numerous graph patterns, especially large patterns
that are crucial with important domain-specific semantic, unfortunately disappear in the graphs
created by popular statistic graph generators, even though those graphs enjoy the same statistical
metrics with the original real dataset. To address this important need, we make the first attempt
to propose a pattern based graph generator (PBGG) to generate a graph including all patterns and
satisfy the user-specified parameters on supports, network size, degree distribution, and clustering
coefficient. Experimental results show that PBGG is efficient and able to generate a billion-node
graph with about 10 minutes, and PBGG is released for free download.
