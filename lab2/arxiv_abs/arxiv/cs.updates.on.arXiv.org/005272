Stock prediction aims to predict the future trends of a stock in order to help investors to make good
investment decisions. Traditional solutions for stock prediction are based on time-series models.
With the recent success of deep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become
a promising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning solutions are not
optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting the best stock with the highest expected
revenue. Specifically, they typically formulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict
stock trend) or a regression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely treat
the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich relations between stocks
(or companies), such as two stocks are in the same sector and two companies have a supplier-customer
relation, is not considered. In this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational
Stock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing solutions in two major
aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock ranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations
in a time-sensitive manner. The key novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural
network modeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal evolution
and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform back-testing on the historical
data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of our RSR method. It outperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average
return ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.
