In recent years, the amount of information collected about human beings has increased dramatically.
This development has been partially driven by individuals posting and storing data about themselves
and friends using online social networks or collecting their data for self-tracking purposes (quantified-self
movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies collecting data with an unprecedented
resolution and scale. Using computational power combined with mathematical models, such rich
datasets can be mined to infer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature.
Much of the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most individuals would feel
uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data publicly. For this reason, the need for solutions
to ensure the privacy of the individuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection
efforts. Out of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts directly
instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the privacy of participants is not
sufficiently addressed. For example, study purposes are often not explicit, informed consent
is ill-defined, and security and sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides
a survey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies that collect detailed
sensor data on human behavior. Reflections on the key problems and recommendations for future work
are included. We hope the overview of the privacy-related practices in massive data collection
studies can be used as a frame of reference for practitioners in the field. Although focused on data
collection in an academic context, we believe that many of the challenges and solutions we identify
are also relevant and useful for other domains where massive data collection takes place, including
businesses and governments.
