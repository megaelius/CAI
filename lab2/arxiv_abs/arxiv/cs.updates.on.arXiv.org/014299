Accurately estimating the number of objects in a single image is a challenging yet meaningful task
and has been applied in many applications such as urban planning and public safety. In the various
object counting tasks, crowd counting is particularly prominent due to its specific significance
to social security and development. Fortunately, the development of the techniques for crowd counting
can be generalized to other related fields such as vehicle counting and environment survey, if without
taking their characteristics into account. Therefore, many researchers are devoting to crowd
counting, and many excellent works of literature and works have spurted out. In these works, they
are must be helpful for the development of crowd counting. However, the question we should consider
is why they are effective for this task. Limited by the cost of time and energy, we cannot analyze all
the algorithms. In this paper, we have surveyed over 220 works to comprehensively and systematically
study the crowd counting models, mainly CNN-based density map estimation methods. Finally, according
to the evaluation metrics, we select the top three performers on their crowd counting datasets and
analyze their merits and drawbacks. Through our analysis, we expect to make reasonable inference
and prediction for the future development of crowd counting, and meanwhile, it can also provide
feasible solutions for the problem of object counting in other fields. We provide the density maps
and prediction results of some mainstream algorithm in the validation set of NWPU dataset for comparison
and testing. Meanwhile, density map generation and evaluation tools are also provided. All the
codes and evaluation results are made publicly available at https://github.com/gaoguangshuai/survey-for-crowd-counting.
