The newly identified Coronavirus pneumonia, subsequently termed COVID-19, is highly transmittable
and pathogenic with no clinically approved antiviral drug or vaccine available for treatment.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, sore throat, and fever. Symptoms can progress
to a severe form of pneumonia with critical complications, including septic shock, pulmonary edema,
acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. While medical imaging is not currently
recommended in Canada for primary diagnosis of COVID-19, computer-aided diagnosis systems could
assist in the early detection of COVID-19 abnormalities and help to monitor the progression of the
disease, potentially reduce mortality rates. In this study, we compare popular deep learning-based
feature extraction frameworks for automatic COVID-19 classification. To obtain the most accurate
feature, which is an essential component of learning, MobileNet, DenseNet, Xception, ResNet,
InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, VGGNet, NASNet were chosen amongst a pool of deep convolutional
neural networks. The extracted features were then fed into several machine learning classifiers
to classify subjects as either a case of COVID-19 or a control. This approach avoided task-specific
data pre-processing methods to support a better generalization ability for unseen data. The performance
of the proposed method was validated on a publicly available COVID-19 dataset of chest X-ray and
CT images. The DenseNet121 feature extractor with Bagging tree classifier achieved the best performance
with 99% classification accuracy. The second-best learner was a hybrid of the a ResNet50 feature
extractor trained by LightGBM with an accuracy of 98%.
