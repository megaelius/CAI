Deep learning (DL) has recently achieved tremendous success in a variety of cutting-edge applications,
e.g., image recognition, speech and natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Besides
the available big data and hardware evolution, DL frameworks and platforms play a key role to catalyze
the research, development, and deployment of DL intelligent solutions. However, the difference
in computation paradigm, architecture design and implementation of existing DL frameworks and
platforms brings challenges for DL software development, deployment, maintenance, and migration.
Up to the present, it still lacks a comprehensive study on how current diverse DL frameworks and platforms
influence the DL software development process. In this paper, we initiate the first step towards
the investigation on how existing state-of-the-art DL frameworks (i.e., TensorFlow, Theano,
and Torch) and platforms (i.e., server/desktop, web, and mobile) support the DL software development
activities. We perform an in-depth and comparative evaluation on metrics such as learning accuracy,
DL model size, robustness, and performance, on state-of-the-art DL frameworks across platforms
using two popular datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. Our study reveals that existing DL frameworks still
suffer from compatibility issues, which becomes even more severe when it comes to different platforms.
We pinpoint the current challenges and opportunities towards developing high quality and compatible
DL systems. To ignite further investigation along this direction to address urgent industrial
demands of intelligent solutions, we make all of our assembled feasible toolchain and dataset publicly
available.
