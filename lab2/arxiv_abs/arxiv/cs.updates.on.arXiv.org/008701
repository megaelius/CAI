Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used to study the pathogenesis of diseases. To enhance
the interpretability of classical PCA, various improved PCA methods have been proposed to date.
Among these, a typical method is the so-called sparse PCA, which focuses on seeking sparse loadings.
However, the performance of these methods is still far from satisfactory due to their limitation
of using unsupervised learning methods; moreover, the class ambiguity within the sample is high.
To overcome this problem, this study developed a new PCA method, which is named the Supervised Discriminative
Sparse PCA (SDSPCA). The main innovation of this method is the incorporation of discriminative
information and sparsity into the PCA model. Specifically, in contrast to the traditional sparse
PCA, which imposes sparsity on the loadings, here, sparse components are obtained to represent
the data. Furthermore, via linear transformation, the sparse components approximate the given
label information. On the one hand, sparse components improve interpretability over traditional
PCA, while on the other hand, they are have discriminative abilities suitable for classification
purposes. A simple algorithm is developed and its convergence proof is provided. The SDSPCA has
been applied to common characteristic gene selection (com-characteristic gene) and tumor classification
on multi-view biological data. The sparsity and classification performance of the SDSPCA are empirically
verified via abundant, reasonable, and effective experiments, and the obtained results demonstrate
that SDSPCA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
