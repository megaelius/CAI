To enable densely deployed base stations (BSs) or access points (APs) to serve an increasing number
of users and provide diverse mobile services, we need to improve spectrum utilization in wireless
communication networks. Although spectral efficiency (SE) can be enhanced via smart and dynamic
resource allocation, interference has become a major impediment in improving SE. There have been
numerous interference management (IM) proposals at the interfering transmitter or the victim
transmitter/receiver separately or cooperatively. Moreover, the existing IM schemes rely mainly
on the use of channel state information (CSI). However, in some communication scenarios, the option
to adjust the interferer is not available, and, in the case of downlink transmission, it is always
difficult or even impossible for the victim receiver to acquire necessary information for IM. Based
on the above observations, we first propose a novel IM technique, called interference steering
(IS). By making use of both CSI w.r.t. and data carried in the interfering signal, IS generates a signal
to modify the spatial feature of the original interference, so that the steered interference at
the victim receiver is orthogonal to its intended signal. We then apply IS to an infrastructurebased
enterprise wireless local area network (WLAN) in which the same frequency band is reused by adjacent
basic service sets (BSSs) with overlapping areas. With IS, multiple nearby APs could simultaneously
transmit data on the same channel to their mobile stations (STAs), thus enhancing spectrum reuse.
Our in-depth simulation results show that IS significantly improves network SE over existing IM
schemes.
