Visual information plays an indispensable role in our daily interactions with environment. Such
information is manipulated for a wide range of purposes spanning from basic object and material
perception to complex gesture interpretations. There have been novel studies in cognitive science
for in-depth understanding of visual information manipulation, which lead to answer questions
such as: how we infer 2D/3D motion from a sequence of 2D images? how we understand a motion from a single
image frame? how we see forest avoiding trees? Leveraging on congruence, linear mapping transformation
determination between a set of shapes facilitate motion perception. Present study methodizes
recent discoveries of human cognitive ability for scene understanding. The proposed method processes
images hierarchically, that is an iterative analysis of scene abstractions using a rapidly converging
heuristic iterative method. The method hierarchically abstracts images; the abstractions are
represented in polar coordinate system, and any two consecutive abstractions have incremental
level of details. The method then creates a graph of approximated linear mapping transformations
based on circular shift permutations of hierarchical abstractions. The graph is then traversed
in best-first fashion to find best linear mapping transformation. The accuracy of the proposed
method is assessed using normal, noisy, and deformed images. Additionally, the present study deduces
(i) the possibility of determining optimal mapping linear transformations in logarithmic iterations
with respect to the precision of results, and (ii) computational cost is independent from the resolution
of input shapes.
