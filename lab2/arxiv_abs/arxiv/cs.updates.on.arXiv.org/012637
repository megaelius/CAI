The correct use of Dutch pronouns 'die' and 'dat' is a stumbling block for both native and non-native
speakers of Dutch due to the multiplicity of syntactic functions and the dependency on the antecedent's
gender and number. Drawing on previous research conducted on neural context-dependent dt-mistake
correction models (Heyman et al. 2018), this study constructs the first neural network model for
Dutch demonstrative and relative pronoun resolution that specifically focuses on the correction
and part-of-speech prediction of these two pronouns. Two separate datasets are built with sentences
obtained from, respectively, the Dutch Europarl corpus (Koehn 2015) - which contains the proceedings
of the European Parliament from 1996 to the present - and the SoNaR corpus (Oostdijk et al. 2013) -
which contains Dutch texts from a variety of domains such as newspapers, blogs and legal texts. Firstly,
a binary classification model solely predicts the correct 'die' or 'dat'. The classifier with a
bidirectional long short-term memory architecture achieves 84.56% accuracy. Secondly, a multitask
classification model simultaneously predicts the correct 'die' or 'dat' and its part-of-speech
tag. The model containing a combination of a sentence and context encoder with both a bidirectional
long short-term memory architecture results in 88.63% accuracy for die/dat prediction and 87.73%
accuracy for part-of-speech prediction. More evenly-balanced data, larger word embeddings,
an extra bidirectional long short-term memory layer and integrated part-of-speech knowledge
positively affects die/dat prediction performance, while a context encoder architecture raises
part-of-speech prediction performance. This study shows promising results and can serve as a starting
point for future research on machine learning models for Dutch anaphora resolution.
