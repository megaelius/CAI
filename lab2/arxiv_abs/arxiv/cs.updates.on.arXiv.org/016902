A growing number of countries have established programs to attract immigrants who can contribute
to their economy. Research suggests that an immigrant's initial arrival location plays a key role
in shaping their economic success. Yet immigrants currently lack access to personalized information
that would help them identify optimal destinations. Instead, they often rely on availability heuristics,
which can lead to the selection of sub-optimal landing locations, lower earnings, elevated outmigration
rates, and concentration in the most well-known locations. To address this issue and counteract
the effects of cognitive biases and limited information, we propose a data-driven decision helper
that draws on behavioral insights, administrative data, and machine learning methods to inform
immigrants' location decisions. The decision helper provides personalized location recommendations
that reflect immigrants' preferences as well as data-driven predictions of the locations where
they maximize their expected earnings given their profile. We illustrate the potential impact
of our approach using backtests conducted with administrative data that links landing data of recent
economic immigrants from Canada's Express Entry system with their earnings retrieved from tax
records. Simulations across various scenarios suggest that providing location recommendations
to incoming economic immigrants can increase their initial earnings and lead to a mild shift away
from the most populous landing destinations. Our approach can be implemented within existing institutional
structures at minimal cost, and offers governments an opportunity to harness their administrative
data to improve outcomes for economic immigrants.
