In this work, we introduce a platform for register-transfer level (RTL) architecture design space
exploration. The platform is an open-source, parameterized, synthesizable set of RTL modules
for designing RISC-V based single and multi-core architecture systems. The platform is designed
with a high degree of modularity. It provides highly-parameterized, composable RTL modules for
fast and accurate exploration of different RISC-V based core complexities, multi-level caching
and memory organizations, system topologies, router architectures, and routing schemes. The
platform can be used for both RTL simulation and FPGA based emulation. The hardware modules are implemented
in synthesizable Verilog using no vendor-specific blocks. The platform includes a RISC-V compiler
toolchain to assist in developing software for the cores, a web-based system configuration graphical
user interface (GUI) and a web-based RISC-V assembly simulator. The platform supports a myriad
of RISC-V architectures, ranging from a simple single cycle processor to a multi-core SoC with a
complex memory hierarchy and a network-on-chip. The modules are designed to support incremental
additions and modifications. The interfaces between components are particularly designed to
allow parts of the processor such as whole cache modules, cores or individual pipeline stages, to
be modified or replaced without impacting the rest of the system. The platform allows researchers
to quickly instantiate complete working RISC-V multi-core systems with synthesizable RTL and
make targeted modifications to fit their needs. The complete platform (including Verilog source
code) can be downloaded at https://ascslab.org/research/briscv/explorer/explorer.html.
