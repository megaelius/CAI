From medical charts to national census, healthcare has traditionally operated under a paper-based
paradigm. However, the past decade has marked a long and arduous transformation bringing healthcare
into the digital age. Ranging from electronic health records, to digitized imaging and laboratory
reports, to public health datasets, today, healthcare now generates an incredible amount of digital
information. Such a wealth of data presents an exciting opportunity for integrated machine learning
solutions to address problems across multiple facets of healthcare practice and administration.
Unfortunately, the ability to derive accurate and informative insights requires more than the
ability to execute machine learning models. Rather, a deeper understanding of the data on which
the models are run is imperative for their success. While a significant effort has been undertaken
to develop models able to process the volume of data obtained during the analysis of millions of digitalized
patient records, it is important to remember that volume represents only one aspect of the data.
In fact, drawing on data from an increasingly diverse set of sources, healthcare data presents an
incredibly complex set of attributes that must be accounted for throughout the machine learning
pipeline. This chapter focuses on highlighting such challenges, and is broken down into three distinct
components, each representing a phase of the pipeline. We begin with attributes of the data accounted
for during preprocessing, then move to considerations during model building, and end with challenges
to the interpretation of model output. For each component, we present a discussion around data as
it relates to the healthcare domain and offer insight into the challenges each may impose on the efficiency
of machine learning techniques.
