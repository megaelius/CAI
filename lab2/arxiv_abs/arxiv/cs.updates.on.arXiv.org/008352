Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) is an important computational tool in theoretical physics and chemistry.
In contrast to standard Monte Carlo, KMC permits the description of time dependent dynamical processes
and is not restricted to systems in equilibrium. Compared to Molecular Dynamics, it allows simulations
over significantly longer timescales. Recently KMC has been applied successfully in modelling
of novel energy materials such as Lithium-ion batteries and organic/perovskite solar cells. Motivated
by this, we consider general solid state systems which contain free, interacting particles which
can hop between localised sites in the material. The KMC transition rates for those hops depend on
the change in total potential energy of the system. For charged particles this requires the frequent
calculation of electrostatic interactions, which is usually the bottleneck of the simulation.
To avoid this issue and obtain results in reasonable times, many studies replace the long-range
potential by a phenomenological short range approximation, which leads to systematic errors and
unphysical results. On the other hand standard electrostatic solvers such as Ewald summation or
fast Poisson solvers are highly inefficient in the KMC setup or introduce uncontrollable systematic
errors at high resolution. In this paper we describe a new variant of the Fast Multipole Method by
Greengard and Rokhlin which overcomes this issue by dramatically reducing computational costs.
We construct an algorithm which scales linearly in the number of charges for each KMC step, something
which had not been deemed to be possible before. We demonstrate the performance and parallel scalability
of the method by implementing it in a performance portable software library. We describe the high-level
Python interface of the code, which makes it easy to adapt to specific use cases.
