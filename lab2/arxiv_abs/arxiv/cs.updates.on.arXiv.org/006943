We review the physical foundations of Landauer's Principle, which relates the loss of information
from a computational process to an increase in thermodynamic entropy. Despite the long history
of the Principle, its fundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently misunderstood.
Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere transfer of entropy between computational
and non-computational subsystems can occur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing
total entropy. However, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,
it more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated information from
a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an uncontrolled, non-computational form,
i.e., as part of a thermal environment. Any uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually
re-randomize the physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as observers
who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates of such environments. Thus,
any correlations involving information that is ejected into and subsequently thermalized by the
environment will be lost from our perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase
in total entropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational information
motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the requirements for computations to be
thermodynamically reversible are less restrictive than frequently described, particularly
in the case of stochastic computational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the
design of computational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational operations
while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be fully explored.
