Multiphase flow phenomena have been widely observed in the industrial applications, yet it remains
a challenging unsolved problem. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches
resolve of the flow fields on finer spatial and temporal scales, which can complement dedicated
experimental study. However, closures must be introduced to reflect the underlying physics in
multiphase flow. Among them, the interfacial forces, including drag, lift, turbulent-dispersion
and wall-lubrication forces, play an important role in bubble distribution and migration in liquid-vapor
two-phase flows. Development of those closures traditionally rely on the experimental data and
analytical derivation with simplified assumptions that usually cannot deliver a universal solution
across a wide range of flow conditions. In this paper, a data-driven approach, named as feature-similarity
measurement (FSM), is developed and applied to improve the simulation capability of two-phase
flow with coarse-mesh CFD approach. Interfacial momentum transfer in adiabatic bubbly flow serves
as the focus of the present study. Both a mature and a simplified set of interfacial closures are taken
as the low-fidelity data. Validation data (including relevant experimental data and validated
fine-mesh CFD simulations results) are adopted as high-fidelity data. Qualitative and quantitative
analysis are performed in this paper. These reveal that FSM can substantially improve the prediction
of the coarse-mesh CFD model, regardless of the choice of interfacial closures, and it provides
scalability and consistency across discontinuous flow regimes. It demonstrates that data-driven
methods can aid the multiphase flow modeling by exploring the connections between local physical
features and simulation errors.
