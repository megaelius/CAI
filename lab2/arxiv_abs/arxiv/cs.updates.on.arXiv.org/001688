Sub-cortical brain structure segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) has attracted the
interest of the research community for a long time because morphological changes in these structures
are related to different neurodegenerative disorders. However, manual segmentation of these
structures can be tedious and prone to variability, highlighting the need for robust automated
segmentation methods. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network based approach
for accurate segmentation of the sub-cortical brain structures that combines both convolutional
and prior spatial features for improving the segmentation accuracy. In order to increase the accuracy
of the automated segmentation, we propose to train the network using a restricted sample selection
to force the network to learn the most difficult parts of the structures. We evaluate the accuracy
of the proposed method on the public MICCAI 2012 challenge and IBSR 18 datasets, comparing it with
different available state-of-the-art methods and other recently proposed deep learning approaches.
On the MICCAI 2012 dataset, our method shows an excellent performance comparable to the best challenge
participant strategy, while performing significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques
such as FreeSurfer and FIRST. On the IBSR 18 dataset, our method also exhibits a significant increase
in the performance with respect to not only FreeSurfer and FIRST, but also comparable or better results
than other recent deep learning approaches. Moreover, our experiments show that both the addition
of the spatial priors and the restricted sampling strategy have a significant effect on the accuracy
of the proposed method. In order to encourage the reproducibility and the use of the proposed method,
a public version of our approach is available to download for the neuroimaging community.
