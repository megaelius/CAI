In this thesis, we present robust and fully-automated methods for the subdivision of the entire
human cerebral cortex based on connectivity information. Our contributions are four-fold: First,
we propose a clustering approach to delineate a cortical parcellation that provides a reliable
abstraction of the brain's functional organisation. Second, we cast the parcellation problem
as a feature reduction problem and make use of manifold learning and image segmentation techniques
to identify cortical regions with distinct structural connectivity patterns. Third, we present
a multi-layer graphical model that combines within- and between-subject connectivity, which
is then decomposed into a cortical parcellation that can represent the whole population, while
accounting for the variability across subjects. Finally, we conduct a large-scale, systematic
comparison of existing parcellation methods, with a focus on providing some insight into the reliability
of brain parcellations in terms of reflecting the underlying connectivity, as well as, revealing
their impact on network analysis. We evaluate the proposed parcellation methods on publicly available
data from the Human Connectome Project and a plethora of quantitative and qualitative evaluation
techniques investigated in the literature. Experiments across multiple resolutions demonstrate
the accuracy of the presented methods at both subject and group levels with regards to reproducibility
and fidelity to the data. The neuro-biological interpretation of the proposed parcellations is
also investigated by comparing parcel boundaries with well-structured properties of the cerebral
cortex. Results show the advantage of connectivity-driven parcellations over traditional approaches
in terms of better fitting the underlying connectivity.
