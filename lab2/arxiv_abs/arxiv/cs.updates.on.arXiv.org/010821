Finding automatically multiple lesions in large images is a common problem in medical image analysis.
Solving this problem can be challenging if, during optimization, the automated method cannot access
information about the location of the lesions nor is given single examples of the lesions. We propose
a new weakly supervised detection method using neural networks, that computes attention maps revealing
the locations of brain lesions. These attention maps are computed using the last feature maps of
a segmentation network optimized only with global image-level labels. The proposed method can
generate attention maps at full input resolution without need for interpolation during preprocessing,
which allows small lesions to appear in attention maps. For comparison, we modify state-of-the-art
methods to compute attention maps for weakly supervised object detection, by using a global regression
objective instead of the more conventional classification objective. This regression objective
optimizes the number of occurrences of the target object in an image, e.g. the number of brain lesions
in a scan, or the number of digits in an image. We study the behavior of the proposed method in MNIST-based
detection datasets, and evaluate it for the challenging detection of enlarged perivascular spaces
- a type of brain lesion - in a dataset of 2202 3D scans with point-wise annotations in the center of
all lesions in four brain regions. In the brain dataset, the weakly supervised detection methods
come close to the human intrarater agreement in each region. The proposed method reaches the best
area under the curve in two out of four regions, and has the lowest number of false positive detections
in all regions, while its average sensitivity over all regions is similar to that of the other best
methods. The proposed method can facilitate epidemiological and clinical studies of enlarged
perivascular spaces.
