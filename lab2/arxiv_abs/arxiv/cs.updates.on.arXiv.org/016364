The cut-set $\partial(S)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is the set of edges that have one endpoint in $S\subset
V$ and the other endpoint in $V\setminus S$, and whenever $G[S]$ is connected, the cut $[S,V\setminus
S]$ of $G$ is called a connected cut. A bond of a graph $G$ is an inclusion-wise minimal disconnecting
set of $G$, i.e., bonds are cut-sets that determine cuts $[S,V\setminus S]$ of $G$ such that $G[S]$
and $G[V\setminus S]$ are both connected. Contrasting with a large number of studies related to
maximum cuts, there exist very few results regarding the largest bond of general graphs. In this
paper, we aim to reduce this gap on the complexity of computing the largest bond, and the maximum connected
cut of a graph. Although cuts and bonds are similar, we remark that computing the largest bond and
the maximum connected cut of a graph tends to be harder than computing its maximum cut. We show that
it does not exist a constant-factor approximation algorithm to compute the largest bond, unless
P = NP. Also, we show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc Maximum Connected Cut} are NP-hard even for planar
bipartite graphs, whereas \textsc{Maximum Cut} is trivial on bipartite graphs and polynomial-time
solvable on planar graphs. In addition, we show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc Maximum Connected
Cut} are NP-hard on split graphs, and restricted to graphs of clique-width $w$ they can not be solved
in time $f(w)\times n^{o(w)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, but they can be solved
in time $f(w)\times n^{O(w)}$. Finally, we show that both problems are fixed-parameter tractable
when parameterized by the size of the solution, the treewidth, and the twin-cover number.
