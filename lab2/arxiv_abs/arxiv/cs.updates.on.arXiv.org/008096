Maintenance work zones on the road network have impacts on the normal travelling of vehicles, which
increase the risk of traffic accidents. The traffic characteristic analysis in maintenance work
zones is a basis for maintenance work zone related research such as layout design, traffic control
and safety assessment. Due to the difficulty in vehicle microscopic behaviour data acquisition,
traditional traffic characteristic analysis mainly focuses on macroscopic characteristics.
With the development of data acquisition technology, it becomes much easier to obtain a large amount
of microscopic behaviour data nowadays, which lays a good foundation for analysing the traffic
characteristics from a new point of view. This paper puts forward a method for expressing and displaying
the vehicle behaviour distribution in maintenance work zones. Using portable vehicle microscopic
behaviour data acquisition devices, lots of data can be obtained. Based on this data, an endpoint
detection technology is used to automatically extract the segments in behaviour data with violent
fluctuations, which are segments where vehicles take behaviours such as acceleration or turning.
Using the support vector machine classification method, the specific types of behaviours of the
segments extracted can be identified, and together with a data combination method, a total of ten
types of behaviours can be identified. Then the kernel density analysis is used to cluster different
types of behaviours of all passing vehicles to show the distribution on maps. By this method, how
vehicles travel through maintenance work zones, and how different vehicle behaviours distribute
in maintenance work zones can be displayed intuitively on maps, which is a novel traffic characteristic
and can shed light to maintenance work zone related researches such as safety assessment and design
method.
