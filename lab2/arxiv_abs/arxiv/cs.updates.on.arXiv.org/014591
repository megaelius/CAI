Wikipedia's vision is a world in which everyone can share in the sum of all knowledge. In its first
two decades, this vision has been very unevenly achieved. One of the largest hindrances is the sheer
number of languages Wikipedia needs to cover in order to achieve that goal. We argue that we need a
new approach to tackle this problem more effectively, a multilingual Wikipedia where content can
be shared between language editions. This paper proposes an architecture for a system that fulfills
this goal. It separates the goal in two parts: creating and maintaining content in an abstract notation
within a project called Abstract Wikipedia, and creating an infrastructure called Wikilambda
that can translate this notation to natural language. Both parts are fully owned and maintained
by the community, as is the integration of the results in the existing Wikipedia editions. This architecture
will make more encyclopedic content available to more people in their own language, and at the same
time allow more people to contribute knowledge and reach more people with their contributions,
no matter what their respective language backgrounds. Additionally, Wikilambda will unlock a
new type of knowledge asset people can share in through the Wikimedia projects, functions, which
will vastly expand what people can do with knowledge from Wikimedia, and provide a new venue to collaborate
and to engage the creativity of contributors from all around the world. These two projects will considerably
expand the capabilities of the Wikimedia platform to enable every single human being to freely share
in the sum of all knowledge.
