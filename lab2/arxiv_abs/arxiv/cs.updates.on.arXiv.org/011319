Influence maximization (IM) is the problem of finding for a given $s\geq 1$ a set $S$ of $|S|=s$ nodes
in a network with maximum influence. With stochastic diffusion models, the influence of a set $S$
of seed nodes is defined as the expectation of its reachability over simulations, where each simulation
specifies a deterministic reachability function. Two well-studied special cases are the Independent
Cascade (IC) and the Linear Threshold (LT) models of Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos. The influence
function in stochastic diffusion is unbiasedly estimated by averaging reachability values over
i.i.d. simulations. We study the IM sample complexity: the number of simulations needed to determine
a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximate maximizer with confidence $1-\delta$. Our main result is a surprising
upper bound of $O( s \tau \epsilon^{-2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta})$ for a broad class of models that includes
IC and LT models and their mixtures, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $\tau$ is the number of diffusion
steps. Generally $\tau \ll n$, so this significantly improves over the generic upper bound of $O(s
n \epsilon^{-2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta})$. Our sample complexity bounds are derived from novel upper
bounds on the variance of the reachability that allow for small relative error for influential sets
and additive error when influence is small. Moreover, we provide a data-adaptive method that can
detect and utilize fewer simulations on models where it suffices. Finally, we provide an efficient
greedy design that computes an $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximate maximizer from simulations and
applies to any submodular stochastic diffusion model that satisfies the variance bounds.
