Securing cyber-physical systems (CPS) against malicious attacks is of paramount importance because
these attacks may cause irreparable damages to physical systems. Recent studies have revealed
that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g.,
code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks).
Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented
exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus,
a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical
execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution
semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context and program
control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation
of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton
(eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates
event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical
event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our
prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show
that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs
a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s
for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.
