For software-defined networking (SDN) systems, to enhance the scalability and reliability of
control plane, existing solutions adopt either multi-controller design with static switch-controller
associations, or static control devolution by delegating certain request processing back to switches.
Such solutions can fall short in face of temporal variations of request traffics, incurring considerable
local computation costs on switches and their communication costs to controllers. So far, it still
remains an open problem to develop a joint online scheme that conducts dynamic switch-controller
association and dynamic control devolution. In addition, the fundamental benefits of predictive
scheduling to SDN systems still remain unexplored. In this paper, we identify the non-trivial trade-off
in such a joint design and formulate a stochastic network optimization problem that aims to minimize
time-averaged total system costs and ensure long-term queue stability. By exploiting the unique
problem structure, we devise a predictive online switch-controller association and control devolution
(POSCAD) scheme, which solves the problem through a series of online distributed decision making.
Theoretical analysis shows that without prediction, POSCAD can achieve near-optimal total system
costs with a tunable trade-off for queue stability. With prediction, POSCAD can achieve even better
performance with shorter latencies. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate POSCAD. Notably,
with mild-value of future information, POSCAD incurs a significant reduction in request latencies,
even when faced with prediction errors.
