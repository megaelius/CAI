For an airline, the crew operating cost is second only to the fuel cost, making the crew pairing optimization
(CPO) critical for business viability. Its aim is to generate a set of flight sequences (crew pairings)
that cover all flights in an airline's schedule, at minimum cost, while satisfying several legality
constraints. Being an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, CPO is tackled by relaxing
the underlying Integer Programming Problem into a Linear Programming Problem, and solving the
latter through Column generation (CG) technique. However, with the expansion of airlines' operations
lately, the curse of dimensionality renders the exact CG-implementations obsolete, paving the
way for heuristic-based CG-implementations. Yet, the much prevalent large-scale complex flight
networks involving multiple-crew bases and hub-and-spoke sub-networks, largely remain unaddressed.
To bridge the research gap, this paper proposes a novel CG heuristic, which has enabled in-house
development of an Airline Crew Pairing Optimizer (AirCROP). The efficacy of the heuristic/AirCROP
has been: (a) tested on real-world airline data with an unprecedented conjunct scale-and-complexity,
marked by over 4200 flights, 15 crew bases, and over a billion pairings, and (b) validated by the research
consortium's industrial sponsor. This paper has a dedicated focus on the proposed CG heuristic
which constitutes the core search mechanism of the optimizer, by balancing random exploration
(of pairings' space), exploitation of domain knowledge (on optimal solution's features), and
utilization of the past computational effort through archiving. Though this paper has an airline
context, the underlying propositions may find applications across different domains as the proposed
CG heuristic can serve as a template on how to utilize domain knowledge to better tackle large-scale
combinatorial optimization problems.
