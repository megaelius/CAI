LiDAR-camera calibration is a precondition for many heterogeneous systems that fuse data from
LiDAR and camera. However, the constraint from common field of view and the requirement for strict
time synchronization make the calibration a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
LiDAR-camera calibration method aiming to eliminate these two constraints. Specifically, we
capture a scan of 3D LiDAR when both the environment and the sensors are stationary, then move the
camera to reconstruct the 3D environment using the sequentially obtained images. Finally, we align
3D visual points to the laser scan based on tightly couple graph optimization method to calculate
the extrinsic parameters between LiDAR and camera. Under this design, the configuration of these
two sensors are free from the common field of view constraint owing to the extended view from the moving
camera. And we also eliminate the requirement for strict time synchronization as we only use the
single scan of laser data when the sensors are stationary. We theoretically derive the conditions
of minimal observability for our method and prove that the accuracy of calibration is improved by
collecting more observations from multiple scattered calibration targets. We validate our method
on both simulation platform and real-world datasets. Experiments show that our method achieves
higher accuracy than other comparable methods, which is in accordance with our theoretical analysis.
In addition, the proposed method is beneficial to not only plane measurement error based chessboard,
but also other point measurement error based calibration targets, such as boxes and polygonal boards.
