Aerators are essential and crucial auxiliary devices in intensive culture, especially in industrial
culture in China. The traditional methods cannot accurately detect abnormal condition of aerators
in time. Surveillance cameras are widely used as visual perception modules of the Internet of Things,
and then using these widely existing surveillance cameras to realize real-time anomaly detection
of aerators is a cost-free and easy-to-promote method. However, it is difficult to develop such
an expert system due to some technical and applied challenges, e.g., illumination, occlusion,
complex background, etc. To tackle these aforementioned challenges, we propose a real-time expert
system based on computer vision technology and existing surveillance cameras for anomaly detection
of aerators, which consists of two modules, i.e., object region detection and working state detection.
First, it is difficult to detect the working state for some small object regions in whole images,
and the time complexity of global feature comparison is also high, so we present an object region
detection method based on the region proposal idea. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm called
reference frame Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (RF-KLT) algorithm for motion feature extraction in fixed
regions. Then, we present a dimension reduction method of time series for establishing a feature
dataset with obvious boundaries between classes. Finally, we use machine learning algorithms
to build the feature classifier. The experimental results in both the actual video dataset and the
augmented video dataset show that the accuracy for detecting object region and working state of
aerators is 100% and 99.9% respectively, and the detection speed is 77-333 frames per second (FPS)
according to the different types of surveillance cameras.
