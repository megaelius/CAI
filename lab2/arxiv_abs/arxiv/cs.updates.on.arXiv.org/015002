Digital steganography is becoming a common tool for protecting sensitive communications in various
applications such as crime(terrorism) prevention whereby law enforcing personals need to remotely
compare facial images captured at the scene of crime with faces databases of known criminals(suspects);
exchanging military maps or surveillance video in hostile environment(situations); privacy
preserving in the healthcare systems when storing or exchanging patient medical images(records);
and prevent bank customers accounts(records) from being accessed illegally by unauthorized users.
Existing digital steganography schemes for embedding secret images in cover image files tend not
to exploit various redundancies in the secret image bit-stream to deal with the various conflicting
requirements on embedding capacity, stego-image quality, and un-detectibility. This paper is
concerned with the development of innovative image procedures and data hiding schemes that exploit,
as well as increase, similarities between secret image bit-stream and the cover image LSB plane.
This will be achieved in two novel steps involving manipulating both the secret and the cover images,prior
to embedding, to achieve higher 0:1 ratio in both the secret image bit-stream and the cover image
LSB plane. The above two steps strategy has been exploited to use a bit-plane(s) mapping technique,
instead of bit-plane(s) replacement to make each cover pixel usable for secret embedding. This
paper will demonstrate that this strategy produces stego-images that have minimal distortion,
high embedding efficiency, reasonably good stego-image quality and robustness against 3 well-known
targeted steganalysis tools.
