User profiling is a useful primitive for constructing personalised services, such as content recommendation.
In the present paper we investigate the feasibility of user profiling in a distributed setting,
with no central authority and only local information exchanges between users. We compute a profile
vector for each user (i.e., a low-dimensional vector that characterises her taste) via spectral
transformation of observed user-produced ratings for items. Our two main contributions follow:
i) We consider a low-rank probabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that
users and items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and items within
the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without prior knowledge of the compositions
of the classes, based solely on few random observed ratings (namely $O(N\log N)$ such ratings for
$N$ users), we can predict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a local
vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide empirical evaluations characterising
the way in which spectral profiling performance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such
evaluations are performed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We develop distributed
algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users into a low-dimensional space, based on
spectral transformation. These involve simple message passing among users, and provably converge
to the desired embedding. Our method essentially relies on a novel combination of gossiping and
the algorithm proposed by Oja and Karhunen.
