Scenario-based development and test processes are a promising approach for verifying and validating
automated driving functions. For this purpose, scenarios have to be generated during the development
process in a traceable manner. In early development stages, the operating scenarios of the item
to be developed are usually described in an abstract, linguistic way.Within the scope of a simulation-assisted
test process, these linguistically described scenarios have to be transformed into a state space
representation and converted into data formats which can be used with the respective simulation
environment. Currently, this step of detailing scenarios takes a considerable manual effort.
Furthermore, a standardized interpretation of the linguistically described scenarios and a consistent
transformation into the data formats are not guaranteed due to multiple authors as well as many constraints
between the scenario parameters. In this paper, the authors present an approach to automatically
detail a keyword-based scenario description for execution in a simulation environment and provide
a basis for test case generation. As a first step, the keyword-based description is transformed
into a parameter space representation. At the same time, constraints regarding the selection and
combination of parameter values are documented for the following process steps (e. g. evolutionary
or stochastic test methods). As a second step, the parameter space representation is converted
into data formats required by the simulation environment. As an example, the authors use scenarios
on German freeways and convert them into the data formats OpenDRIVE (description of the road) and
OpenSCENARIO (description of traffic participants and environmental conditions) for execution
in the simulation environment Virtual Test Drive.
