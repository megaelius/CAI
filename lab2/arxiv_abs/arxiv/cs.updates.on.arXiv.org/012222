Recent studies in maritime logistics have introduced a general ship routing problem and a benchmark
suite based on real shipping segments, considering pickups and deliveries, cargo selection, ship-dependent
starting locations, travel times and costs, time windows, and incompatibility constraints, among
other features. Together, these characteristics pose considerable challenges for exact and heuristic
methods, and some cases with as few as 18 cargoes remain unsolved. To face this challenge, we propose
an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm and a hybrid metaheuristic. Our exact method generates
elementary routes, but exploits decremental state-space relaxation to speed up column generation,
heuristic strong branching, as well as advanced preprocessing and route enumeration techniques.
Our metaheuristic is a sophisticated extension of the unified hybrid genetic search. It exploits
a set-partitioning phase and uses problem-tailored variation operators to efficiently handle
all the problem characteristics. As shown in our experimental analyses, the B&P optimally solves
239/240 existing instances within one hour. Scalability experiments on even larger problems demonstrate
that it can optimally solve problems with around 60 ships and 200 cargoes (i.e., 400 pickup and delivery
services) and find optimality gaps below 1.04% on the largest cases with up to 260 cargoes. The hybrid
metaheuristic outperforms all previous heuristics and produces near-optimal solutions within
minutes. These results are noteworthy, since these instances are comparable in size with the largest
problems routinely solved by shipping companies.
