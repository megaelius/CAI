Class imbalance has emerged as one of the major challenges for medical image segmentation. The model
cascade (MC) strategy significantly alleviates the class imbalance issue via running a set of individual
deep models for coarse-to-fine segmentation. Despite its outstanding performance, however,
this method leads to undesired system complexity and also ignores the correlation among the models.
To handle these flaws, we propose a light-weight deep model, i.e., the One-pass Multi-task Network
(OM-Net) to solve class imbalance better than MC does, while requiring only one-pass computation.
First, OM-Net integrates the separate segmentation tasks into one deep model, which consists of
shared parameters to learn joint features, as well as task-specific parameters to learn discriminative
features. Second, to more effectively optimize OM-Net, we take advantage of the correlation among
tasks to design both an online training data transfer strategy and a curriculum learning-based
training strategy. Third, we further propose sharing prediction results between tasks and design
a cross-task guided attention (CGA) module which can adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature
responses based on the category-specific statistics. Finally, a simple yet effective post-processing
method is introduced to refine the segmentation results. Extensive experiments are conducted
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on the BraTS 2015 testing set and BraTS 2017 online validation set. Using these proposed
approaches, we also won joint third place in the BraTS 2018 challenge among 64 participating teams.
