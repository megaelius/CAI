Two-player games on graphs are widely studied in formal methods as they model the interaction between
a system and its environment. The game is played by moving a token throughout a graph to produce an
infinite path. There are several common modes to determine how the players move the token through
the graph; e.g., in turn-based games the players alternate turns in moving the token. We study the
{\em bidding} mode of moving the token, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been studied
in infinite-duration games. The following bidding rule was previously defined and called Richman
bidding. Both players have separate {\em budgets}, which sum up to $1$. In each turn, a bidding takes
place: Both players submit bids simultaneously, where a bid is legal if it does not exceed the available
budget, and the higher bidder pays his bid to the other player and moves the token. The central question
studied in bidding games is a necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning the game: a {\em
threshold} budget in a vertex is a value $t \in [0,1]$ such that if Player $1$'s budget exceeds $t$,
he can win the game, and if Player $2$'s budget exceeds $1-t$, he can win the game. Threshold budgets
were previously shown to exist in every vertex of a reachability game, which have an interesting
connection with {\em random-turn} games -- a sub-class of simple stochastic games in which the player
who moves is chosen randomly. We show the existence of threshold budgets for a qualitative class
of infinite-duration games, namely parity games, and a quantitative class, namely mean-payoff
games. The key component of the proof is a quantitative solution to strongly-connected mean-payoff
bidding games in which we extend the connection with random-turn games to these games, and construct
explicit optimal strategies for both players.
