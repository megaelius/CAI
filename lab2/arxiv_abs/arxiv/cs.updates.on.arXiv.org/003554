We introduce the problem EndOfPotentialLine and the corresponding complexity class EOPL of all
problems that can be reduced to it in polynomial time. This class captures problems that admit a single
combinatorial proof of their joint membership in the complexity classes PPAD of fixpoint problems
and PLS of local search problems. EOPL is a combinatorially-defined alternative to the class CLS
(for Continuous Local Search), which was introduced in with the goal of capturing the complexity
of some well-known problems in PPAD $\cap$ PLS that have resisted, in some cases for decades, attempts
to put them in polynomial time. Two of these are Contraction, the problem of finding a fixpoint of
a contraction map, and P-LCP, the problem of solving a P-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem.
We show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via a two-way reduction to EndOfMeteredLine. The latter
was defined in to show query and cryptographic lower bounds for CLS. Our two main results are to show
that both PL-Contraction (Piecewise-Linear Contraction) and P-LCP are in EOPL. Our reductions
imply that the promise versions of PL-Contraction and P-LCP are in the promise class UniqueEOPL,
which corresponds to the case of a single potential line. This also shows that simple-stochastic,
discounted, mean-payoff, and parity games are in EOPL. Using the insights from our reduction for
PL-Contraction, we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithms for finding fixed points of contraction
maps in fixed dimension for any $\ell_p$ norm, where previously such algorithms were only known
for the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ norms. Our reduction from P-LCP to EndOfPotentialLine allows
a technique of Aldous to be applied, which in turn gives the fastest-known randomized algorithm
for the P-LCP.
