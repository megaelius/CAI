UAV swarms have triggered wide concern due to their potential application values in recent years.
While there are studies proposed in terms of the architecture design for UAV swarms, two main challenges
still exist: (1) Scalability, supporting a large scale of vehicles; (2) Versatility, integrating
diversified missions. To this end, a multi-layered and distributed architecture for mission oriented
miniature fixed-wing UAV swarms is presented in this paper. The proposed architecture is built
on the concept of modularity. It divides the overall system to five layers: low-level control, high-level
control, coordination, communication and human interaction layers, and many modules that can
be viewed as black boxes with interfaces of inputs and outputs. In this way, not only the complexity
of developing a large system can be reduced, but also the versatility of supporting diversified
missions can be ensured. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is fully distributed that each
UAV performs the decision-making procedure autonomously so as to achieve better scalability.
Moreover, different kinds of aerial platforms can be feasibly extended by using the control allocation
matrices and the integrated hardware box. A prototype swarm system based on the proposed architecture
is built and the proposed architecture is evaluated through field experiments with a scale of 21
fixed-wing UAVs. Particularly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work which successfully
demonstrates formation flight, target recognition and tracking missions within an integrated
architecture for fixed-wing UAV swarms through field experiments.
