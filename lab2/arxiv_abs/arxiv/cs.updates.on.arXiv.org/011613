The problem of automatic forecasting of time-series data has been a long-standing challenge for
the machine learning and forecasting community. The problem is relatively simple when the series
is stationary. However, the majority of the real-world time-series problems have non-stationary
characteristics making the understanding of the trend and seasonality very complex. Further,
it is assumed that the future response is dependent on the past data and, therefore, can be modeled
using a function approximator. Our interest in this paper is to study the applicability of the popular
deep neural networks (DNN) comprehensively as function approximators for non-stationary time-series
forecasting. We employ the following DNN models: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), and RNN with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM-RNN) and RNN with Gated-Recurrent
Unit (GRU-RNN). These powerful DNN methods have been evaluated over popular Indian financial stocks
data comprising of five stocks from National Stock Exchange Nifty-50 (NSE-Nifty50), and five stocks
from Bombay Stock Exchange 30 (BSE-30). Further, the performance evaluation of these DNNs in terms
of their predictive power has been done using two fashions: (1) single-step forecasting, (2) multi-step
forecasting. Our extensive simulation experiments on these ten datasets report that the performance
of these DNNs for single-step forecasting is pretty convincing as the predictions are found to follow
the truely observed values closely. However, we also find that all these DNN models perform miserably
in the case of multi-step time-series forecasting, based on the datasets used by us. Consequently,
we observe that none of these DNN models are reliable for multi-step time-series forecasting.
