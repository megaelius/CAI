Context: Demonstrating high reliability and safety for safety-critical systems (SCSs) remains
a hard problem. Diverse evidence needs to be combined in a rigorous way: in particular, results of
operational testing with other evidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning
in SCSs, by precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes operational testing
even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims. Objective: We use Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) as a current example to revisit the problem of demonstrating high reliability. AVs
are making their debut on public roads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently
needed. We demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV type, starting
with those proposed by a highly-cited study. Method: We apply new theorems extending Conservative
Bayesian Inference (CBI), which exploit the rigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk
of involuntary misuse associated with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define
additional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs. Results: Prior knowledge can bring
substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong expectations of safety before road testing.
We also show how naive attempts at conservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why
extrapolating the trend of disengagements is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge that
an AV has moved to a less stressful environment. Conclusion: While some reliability targets will
remain too high to be practically verifiable, CBI removes a major source of doubt: it allows use of
prior knowledge without inducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required
reliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments. Useful conservative
claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge.
