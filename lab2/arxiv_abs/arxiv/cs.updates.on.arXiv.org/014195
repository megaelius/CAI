Cribriform growth patterns in prostate carcinoma are associated with poor prognosis. We aimed
to introduce a deep learning method to detect such patterns automatically. To do so, convolutional
neural network was trained to detect cribriform growth patterns on 128 prostate needle biopsies.
Ensemble learning taking into account other tumor growth patterns during training was used to cope
with heterogeneous and limited tumor tissue occurrences. ROC and FROC analyses were applied to
assess network performance regarding detection of biopsies harboring cribriform growth pattern.
The ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve up to 0.82. FROC analysis demonstrated a sensitivity
of 0.9 for regions larger than 0.0150 mm2 with on average 6.8 false positives. To benchmark method
performance for intra-observer annotation variability, false positive and negative detections
were re-evaluated by the pathologists. Pathologists considered 9% of the false positive regions
as cribriform, and 11% as possibly cribriform; 44% of the false negative regions were not annotated
as cribriform. As a final experiment, the network was also applied on a dataset of 60 biopsy regions
annotated by 23 pathologists. With the cut-off reaching highest sensitivity, all images annotated
as cribriform by at least 7/23 of the pathologists, were all detected as cribriform by the network.
In conclusion, the proposed deep learning method has high sensitivity for detecting cribriform
growth patterns at the expense of a limited number of false positives. It can detect cribriform regions
that are labelled as such by at least a minority of pathologists. Therefore, it could assist clinical
decision making by suggesting suspicious regions.
