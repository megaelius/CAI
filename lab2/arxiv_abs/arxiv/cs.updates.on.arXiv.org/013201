Despite the recent success of state-of-the-art 3D object recognition approaches, service robots
are frequently failed to recognize many objects in real human-centric environments. For these
robots, object recognition is a challenging task due to the high demand for accurate and real-time
response under changing and unpredictable environmental conditions. Most of the recent approaches
use either the shape information only and ignore the role of color information or vice versa. Furthermore,
they mainly utilize the $L_n$ Minkowski family functions to measure the similarity of two object
views, while there are various distance measures that are applicable to compare two object views.
In this paper, we explore the importance of shape information, color constancy, color spaces, and
various similarity measures in open-ended 3D object recognition. Towards this goal, we extensively
evaluate the performance of object recognition approaches in three different configurations,
including \textit{color-only}, \textit{shape-only}, and \textit{ combinations of color and
shape}, in both offline and online settings. Experimental results concerning scalability, memory
usage, and object recognition performance show that all of the \textit{combinations of color and
shape} yields significant improvements over the \textit{shape-only} and \textit{color-only}
approaches. The underlying reason is that color information is an important feature to distinguish
objects that have very similar geometric properties with different colors and vice versa. Moreover,
by combining color and shape information, we demonstrate that the robot can learn new object categories
from very few training examples in a real-world setting.
