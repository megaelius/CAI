Whenever a social media user decides to share a story, she is typically pleased to receive likes,
comments, shares, or, more generally, feedback from her followers. As a result, she may feel compelled
to use the feedback she receives to (re-)estimate her followers' preferences and decides which
stories to share next to receive more (positive) feedback. Under which conditions can she succeed?
In this work, we first look into this problem from a theoretical perspective and then provide a set
of practical algorithms to identify and characterize such behavior in social media. More specifically,
we address the above problem from the viewpoint of sequential decision making and utility maximization.
For a wide variety of utility functions, we first show that, to succeed, a user needs to actively trade
off exploitation-- sharing stories which lead to more (positive) feedback--and exploration--
sharing stories to learn about her followers' preferences. However, exploration is not necessary
if a user utilizes the feedback her followers provide to other users in addition to the feedback she
receives. Then, we develop a utility estimation framework for observation data, which relies on
statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether a user utilizes the feedback she receives
from each of her followers to decide what to post next. Experiments on synthetic data illustrate
our theoretical findings and show that our estimation framework is able to accurately recover users'
underlying utility functions. Experiments on several real datasets gathered from Twitter and
Reddit reveal that up to 82% (43%) of the Twitter (Reddit) users in our datasets do use the feedback
they receive to decide what to post next.
