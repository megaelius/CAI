To ensure the secure transmission of data, cryptography is treated as the most effective solution.
Cryptographic key is an important entity in this procedure. In general, randomly generated cryptographic
key (of 256 bits) is difficult to remember. However, such a key needs to be stored in a protected place
or transported through a shared communication line which, in fact, poses another threat to security.
As an alternative, researchers advocate the generation of cryptographic key using the biometric
traits of both sender and receiver during the sessions of communication, thus avoiding key storing
and at the same time without compromising the strength in security. Nevertheless, the biometric-based
cryptographic key generation possesses few concerns such as privacy of biometrics, sharing of
biometric data between both communicating users (i.e., sender and receiver), and generating revocable
key from irrevocable biometric. This work addresses the above-mentioned concerns. In this work,
a framework for secure communication between two users using fingerprint based crypto-biometric
system has been proposed. For this, Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm is used to generate public keys
from private keys of both sender and receiver which are shared and further used to produce a symmetric
cryptographic key at both ends. In this approach, revocable key for symmetric cryptography is generated
from irrevocable fingerprint. The biometric data is neither stored nor shared which ensures the
security of biometric data, and perfect forward secrecy is achieved using session keys. This work
also ensures the long-term security of messages communicated between two users. Based on the experimental
evaluation over four datasets of FVC2002 and NIST special database, the proposed framework is privacy-preserving
and could be utilized onto real access control systems.
