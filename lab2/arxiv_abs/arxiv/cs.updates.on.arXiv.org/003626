We explore issues of dynamic supply and demand in ride sharing services such as Lyft and Uber, where
demand fluctuates over time and geographic location. We seek to maximize social welfare which depends
on taxicab and passenger locations, passenger valuations for service, and the distances between
taxicabs and passengers. Our only means of control is to set surge prices, then taxicabs and passengers
maximize their utilities subject to these prices. We study two related models: a continuous passenger-taxicab
setting, similar to the Wardrop model, and a discrete passenger-taxicab setting. In the continuous
setting, every location is occupied by a set of infinitesimal strategic taxicabs and a set of infinitesimal
non-strategic passengers. In the discrete setting every location is occupied by a set of strategic
agents, taxicabs and passengers, passengers have differing values for service. We expand the continuous
model to a time-dependent setting and study the corresponding online environment. Surge prices
are in passenger-taxicab equilibrium if there exists a min cost flow that moves taxicabs about such
that (a) every taxicab follows a best response, (b) all strategic passengers at $v$ with value above
the surge price $r_v$ for $v$, are served and (c) no strategic passengers with value below $r_v$ are
served (non-strategic infinitesimal passengers are always served). This paper computes surge
prices such that resulting passenger-taxicab equilibrium maximizes social welfare, and the computation
of such surge prices is in poly time. Moreover, it is a dominant strategy for passengers to reveal
their true values. We seek to maximize social welfare in the online environment, and derive tight
competitive ratio bounds to this end. Our online algorithms make use of the surge prices computed
over time and geographic location, inducing successive passenger-taxicab equilibria.
