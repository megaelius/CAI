Objective: Visual cohort analysis utilizing electronic health record data has become an important
tool in clinical assessment of patient outcomes. In this paper, we introduce Composer, a visual
analysis tool for orthopedic surgeons to compare changes in physical functions of a patient cohort
following various spinal procedures. The goal of our project is to help researchers analyze outcomes
of procedures and facilitate informed decision-making about treatment options between patient
and clinician. Methods: In collaboration with Orthopedic surgeons and researchers, we defined
domain-specific user requirements to inform the design. We developed the tool in an iterative process
with our collaborators to develop and refine functionality. With Composer, analysts can dynamically
define a patient cohort using demographic information, clinical parameters, and events in patient
medical histories and then analyze patient-reported outcome scores for the cohort over time, as
well as compare it to other cohorts. Using Composer's current iteration, we provide a usage scenario
for use of the tool in a clinical setting. Conclusion: We have developed a prototype cohort analysis
tool to help clinicians assess patient treatment options by analyzing prior cases with similar
characteristics. Though Composer was designed using patient data specific to Orthopedic research,
we believe the tool is generalizable to other healthcare domains. A long term goal for Composer is
to develop the application into a shared decision-making tool that allows translation of comparison
and analysis from a clinician facing interface into visual representations to communicate treatment
options to patients.
