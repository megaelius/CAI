We study the computational power of randomized computations on infinite objects, such as real numbers.
In particular, we introduce the concept of a Las Vegas computable multi-valued function, which
is a function that can be computed on a probabilistic Turing machine that receives a random binary
sequence as auxiliary input. The machine can take advantage of this random sequence, but it always
has to produce a correct result or to stop the computation after finite time if the random advice is
not successful. With positive probability the random advice has to be successful. We characterize
the class of Las Vegas computable functions in the Weihrauch lattice with the help of probabilistic
choice principles and Weak Weak K\H{o}nig's Lemma. Among other things we prove an Independent Choice
Theorem that implies that Las Vegas computable functions are closed under composition. In a case
study we show that Nash equilibria are Las Vegas computable, while zeros of continuous functions
with sign changes cannot be computed on Las Vegas machines. However, we show that the latter problem
admits randomized algorithms with weaker failure recognition mechanisms. The last mentioned
results can be interpreted such that the Intermediated Value Theorem is reducible to the jump of
Weak Weak K\H{o}nig's Lemma, but not to Weak Weak K\H{o}nig's Lemma itself. These examples also
demonstrate that Las Vegas computable functions form a proper superclass of the class of computable
functions and a proper subclass of the class of non-deterministically computable functions. We
also study the impact of specific lower bounds on the success probabilities, which leads to a strict
hierarchy of classes. In particular, the classical technique of probability amplification fails
for computations on infinite objects. We also investigate the dependency on the underlying probability
space.
