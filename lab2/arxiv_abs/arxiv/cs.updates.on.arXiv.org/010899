Whereas the availability of data has seen a manyfold increase in past years, its value can be only
shown if the data variety is effectively tackled ---one of the prominent Big Data challenges. The
lack of data interoperability limits the potential of its collective use for novel applications.
Achieving interoperability through the full transformation and integration of diverse data structures
remains an ideal that is hard, if not impossible, to achieve. Instead, methods that can simultaneously
interpret different types of data available in different data structures and formats have been
explored. On the other hand, many query languages have been designed to enable users to interact
with the data, from relational, to object-oriented, to hierarchical, to the multitude emerging
NoSQL languages. Therefore, the interoperability issue could be solved not by enforcing physical
data transformation, but by looking at techniques that are able to query heterogeneous sources
using one uniform language. Both industry and research communities have been keen to develop such
techniques, which require the translation of a chosen 'universal' query language to the various
data model specific query languages that make the underlying data accessible. In this article,
we survey more than forty query translation methods and tools for popular query languages, and classify
them according to eight criteria. In particular, we study which query language is a most suitable
candidate for that 'universal' query language. Further, the results enable us to discover the weakly
addressed and unexplored translation paths, to discover gaps and to learn lessons that can benefit
future research in the area.
