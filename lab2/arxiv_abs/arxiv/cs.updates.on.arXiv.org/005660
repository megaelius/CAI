Most tumor grading systems for human as for veterinary histopathology are based upon the absolute
count of mitotic figures in a certain reference area of a histology slide. Since time for prognostication
is limited in a diagnostic setting, the pathologist will often almost arbitrarily choose a certain
field of interest assumed to have the highest mitotic activity. However, as mitotic figures are
commonly very sparse on the slide and often have a patchy distribution, this poses a sampling problem
which is known to be able to influence the tumor prognostication. On the other hand, automatic detection
of mitotic figures can't yet be considered reliable enough for clinical application. In order to
aid the work of the human expert and at the same time reduce variance in tumor grading, it is beneficial
to assess the whole slide image (WSI) for the highest mitotic activity and use this as a reference
region for human counting. For this task, we compare two methods for region of interest proposal,
both based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). For both approaches, the CNN performs a segmentation
of the WSI to assess mitotic activity. The first method performs a segmentation at the original image
resolution, while the second approach performs a segmentation operation at a significantly reduced
resolution, cutting down on processing complexity. We evaluate the approach using a dataset of
32 completely annotated whole slide images of canine mast cell tumors, where 22 were used for training
of the network and 10 for test. Our results indicate that, while the overall correlation to the ground
truth mitotic activity is considerably higher (0.94 vs. 0.83) for the approach based upon the fine
resolution network, the field of interest choices are only marginally better. Both approaches
propose fields of interest that contain a mitotic count in the upper quartile of respective slides.
