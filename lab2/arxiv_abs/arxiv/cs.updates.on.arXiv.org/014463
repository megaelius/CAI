Hybrid simulation (HS) is a widely used structural testing method that combines a computational
substructure with a numerical model for well-understood components and an experimental substructure
for other parts of the structure that are physically tested. One challenge for fast HS or real-time
HS (RTHS) is associated with the analytical substructures of relatively complex structures, which
could have large number of degrees of freedoms (DOFs), for instance. These large DOFs computations
could be hard to perform in real-time, even with the all current hardware capacities. In this study,
a metamodeling technique is proposed to represent the structural dynamic behavior of the analytical
substructure. A preliminary study is conducted where a one-bay one-story concentrically braced
frame (CBF) is tested under earthquake loading by using a compact HS setup at the University of Nevada,
Reno. The experimental setup allows for using a small-scale brace as the experimental substructure
combined with a steel frame at the prototype full-scale for the analytical substructure. Two different
machine learning algorithms are evaluated to provide a valid and useful metamodeling solution
for analytical substructure. The metamodels are trained with the available data that is obtained
from the pure analytical solution of the prototype steel frame. The two algorithms used for developing
the metamodels are: (1) linear regression (LR) model, and (2) basic recurrent neural network (RNN).
The metamodels are first validated against the pure analytical response of the structure. Next,
RTHS experiments are conducted by using metamodels. RTHS test results using both LR and RNN models
are evaluated, and the advantages and disadvantages of these models are discussed.
