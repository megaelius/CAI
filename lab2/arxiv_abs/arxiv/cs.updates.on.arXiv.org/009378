The goal of this paper is to present a universal and intuitive approach to link static stability with
dynamic stability, i.e., asymptotic stability of equilibrium, through economic principles behind
evolutionary dynamics. In economics, static stability is traditionally defined as a notion about
how incentives respond to choices: for a population game, it means that, on average, the payoff of
a strategy responds negatively to an increase in the share of the strategy. This is characterized
by negative definiteness of the Hessian matrix of the payoff function and satisfied globally in
a contractive game and locally at a regular ESS. We say an evolutionary dynamic is economically reasonable,
if an agent's choice of a new strategy can be justified as an optimal choice possibly by introducing
additional costs and constraints; for example, inertia can be justified by switching costs, and
switches to suboptimal strategies can be by restriction to available strategies. This class of
dynamics includes not only the best response dynamic, pairwise payoff comparison dynamics and
excess payoff dynamics. The key in our proof is a net gain from revision of the strategy, i.e., the
payoff improvement by the revision minus the switching cost. Static stability implies that the
aggregate net gain monotonically decreases over time under an economic reasonable dynamic and
thus can be used as a Lyapunov function. Our Lyapunov function allows us to extend the dynamic stability
to mixture of heterogeneous populations, who may follow different dynamics or different payoff
functions. While our analysis here is confined to normal form games for clear illustration of our
approach, we argue that our approach is promising for further applications to more complex situations.
