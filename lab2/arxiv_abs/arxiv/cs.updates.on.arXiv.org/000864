Probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian Networks are one of the most powerful structures
known by the Computer Science community for deriving probabilistic inferences. However, modern
cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical
probability theory, because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make judgements.
Consequently, the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics,
leading to violations of the law of total probability. This means that probabilistic graphical
models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various
aspects of human decision making. Quantum probability theory was developed in order to accommodate
the paradoxical findings that the classical theory could not explain. Recent findings in cognitive
psychology revealed that quantum probability can fully describe human decisions in an elegant
framework. Their findings suggest that, before taking a decision, human thoughts are seen as superposed
waves that can interfere with each other, influencing the final decision. In this work, we propose
a new Bayesian Network based on the psychological findings of cognitive scientists. We made experiments
with two very well known Bayesian Networks from the literature. The results obtained revealed that
the quantum like Bayesian Network can affect drastically the probabilistic inferences, specially
when the levels of uncertainty of the network are very high (no pieces of evidence observed). When
the levels of uncertainty are very low, then the proposed quantum like network collapses to its classical
counterpart.
