We considered observational data available from the MIMIC-III open-access ICU database and collected
within a study period between year 2002 up to 2011. If a patient had multiple admissions to the ICU
during the 30 days before death, only the first stay was analyzed, leading to a final set of 6,436 unique
ICU admissions during the study period. We tested two hypotheses: (i) administration of invasive
intervention during the ICU stay immediately preceding end-of-life would decrease over the study
time period and (ii) time-to-death from ICU admission would also decrease, due to the decrease in
invasive intervention administration. To investigate the latter hypothesis, we performed a subgroups
analysis by considering patients with lowest and highest severity. To do so, we stratified the patients
based on their SAPS I scores, and we considered patients within the first and the third tertiles of
the score. We then assessed differences in trends within these groups between years 2002-05 vs.
2008-11. Comparing the period 2002-2005 vs. 2008-2011, we found a reduction in endotracheal ventilation
among patients who died within 30 days of ICU admission (120.8 vs. 68.5 hours for the lowest severity
patients, p<0.001; 47.7 vs. 46.0 hours for the highest severity patients, p=0.004). This is explained
in part by an increase in the use of non-invasive ventilation. Comparing the period 2002-2005 vs.
2008-2011, we found a reduction in the use of vasopressors and inotropes among patients with the
lowest severity who died within 30 days of ICU admission (41.8 vs. 36.2 hours, p<0.001) but not among
those with the highest severity. Despite a reduction in the use of invasive interventions, we did
not find a reduction in the time to death between 2002-2005 vs. 2008-2011 (7.8 days vs. 8.2 days for
the lowest severity patients, p=0.32; 2.1 days vs. 2.0 days for the highest severity patients, p=0.74).
