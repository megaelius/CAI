Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) is a technique frequently used in geotechnical engineering
and engineering geophysics to infer layered models of seismic shear wave velocities in the top tens
to hundreds of meters of the subsurface. We aim to accelerate MASW calculations by capitalizing
on modern computer hardware available in the workstations of most engineers: multiple cores and
graphics processing units (GPUs). We propose new parallel and GPU accelerated algorithms for evaluating
MASW data, and provide software implementations in C using Message Passing Interface (MPI) and
CUDA. These algorithms take advantage of sparsity that arises in the problem, and the work balance
between processes considers typical data trends. We compare our methods to an existing open source
Matlab MASW tool. Our serial C implementation achieves a 2x speedup over the Matlab software, and
we continue to see improvements by parallelizing the problem with MPI. We see nearly perfect strong
and weak scaling for uniform data, and improve strong scaling for realistic data by repartitioning
the problem to process mapping. By utilizing GPUs available on most modern workstations, we observe
an additional 1.3x speedup over the serial C implementation on the first use of the method. We typically
repeatedly evaluate theoretical dispersion curves as part of an optimization procedure, and on
the GPU the kernel can be cached for faster reuse on later runs. We observe a 3.2x speedup on the cached
GPU runs compared to the serial C runs. This work is the first open-source parallel or GPU-accelerated
software tool for MASW imaging, and should enable geotechnical engineers to fully utilize all computer
hardware at their disposal.
