Competitive resource allocation between adversarial decision makers arises in a wide spectrum
of real-world applications such as in communication systems, cyber-physical systems security,
as well as financial, political, and electoral competition. As such, developing analytical tools
to model and analyze competitive resource allocation is crucial for devising optimal allocation
strategies and anticipating the potential outcomes of the competition. To this end, the Colonel
Blotto game is one of the most popular game-theoretic frameworks for modeling and analyzing such
competitive resource allocation problems. However, in many real-world competitive situations,
the Colonel Blotto game does not admit solutions in deterministic strategies and, hence, one must
rely on analytically complex mixed-strategies with their associated tractability, applicability,
and practicality challenges. In this paper, a generalization of the Colonel Blotto game which enables
the derivation of deterministic, practical, and implementable equilibrium strategies is proposed
while accounting for the heterogeneity of the battlefields. In addition, the proposed generalized
game enables accounting for the consumed resources in each battlefield, a feature that is not considered
in the classical Blotto game. For the generalized game, the existence of a Nash equilibrium in pure-strategies
is shown. Then, closed-form analytical expressions of the equilibrium strategies, are derived
and the outcome of the game is characterized; based on the number of resources of each player as well
as the valuation of each battlefield. The generated results provide invaluable insights on the
outcome of the competition. For example, the results show that, when both players are fully rational,
the more resourceful player can achieve a better total payoff at the Nash equilibrium, a result that
is not mimicked in the classical Blotto game.
