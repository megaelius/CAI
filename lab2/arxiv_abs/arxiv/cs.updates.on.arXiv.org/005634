We study the notion of Bilu-Linial stability in the context of Independent Set. A weighted instance
$G=(V,E,w)$ of Independent Set is $\gamma$-stable if it has a unique optimal solution that remains
the unique optimal solution under multiplicative perturbations of the weights by a factor of at
most $\gamma\geq 1$. In this work, we use the standard LP as well as the Sherali-Adams hierarchy to
design algorithms for $(\Delta-1)$-stable instances on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, for
$(k-1)$-stable instances on $k$-colorable graphs and for $(1+\varepsilon)$-stable instances
on planar graphs. We also show that the integrality gap of relaxations of several maximization problems
reduces dramatically on stable instances. For general graphs we give an algorithm for $(\varepsilon
n)$-stable instances (for fixed $\varepsilon>0$), and on the negative side we show that there are
no efficient algorithms for $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon})$-stable instances assuming the
planted clique conjecture. As a side note, we exploit the connection between Vertex Cover and Node
Multiway Cut and give the first results about stable instances of Node Multiway Cut. Moreover, we
initiate the study of certified algorithms for Independent Set. The class of $\gamma$-certified
algorithms is a class of $\gamma$-approximation algorithms introduced by Makarychev and Makarychev
(2018) whose returned solution is optimal for a perturbation of the original instance. Using results
of Makarychev and Makarychev (2018) as well as combinatorial techniques, we obtain $\Delta$-certified
algorithms for Independent Set on graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and $(1+\varepsilon)$-certified
algorithms on planar graphs. Finally, we prove that an algorithm of Berman and F\"{u}rer (1994)
is a $\left(\frac{\Delta+1}{3}+\varepsilon\right)$-certified algorithm on graphs of maximum
degree $\Delta$ where all weights are equal to 1.
