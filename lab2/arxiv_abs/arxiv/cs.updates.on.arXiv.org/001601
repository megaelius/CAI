Purpose: To develop a general phase regularized image reconstruction method, with applications
to partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging. Theory and Methods: The problem
of enforcing phase constraints in reconstruction was studied under a regularized inverse problem
framework. A general phase regularized reconstruction algorithm was proposed to enable various
joint reconstruction of partial Fourier imaging, water-fat imaging and flow imaging, along with
parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS). Since phase regularized reconstruction is
inherently non-convex and sensitive to phase wraps in the initial solution, a reconstruction technique,
named phase cycling, was proposed to render the overall algorithm invariant to phase wraps. The
proposed method was applied to retrospectively under-sampled in vivo datasets and compared with
state of the art reconstruction methods. Results: Phase cycling reconstructions showed reduction
of artifacts compared to reconstructions with- out phase cycling and achieved similar performances
as state of the art results in partial Fourier, water-fat and divergence-free regularized flow
reconstruction. Joint reconstruction of partial Fourier + water-fat imaging + PI + CS, and partial
Fourier + divergence-free regularized flow imaging + PI + CS were demonstrated. Conclusion: The
proposed phase cycling reconstruction provides an alternative way to perform phase regularized
reconstruction, without the need to perform phase unwrapping. It is robust to the choice of initial
solutions and encourages the joint reconstruction of phase imaging applications.
