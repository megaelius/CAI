Motivated by the increasing need for fast distributed processing of large-scale graphs such as
the Web graph and various social networks, we study a message-passing distributed computing model
for graph processing and present lower bounds and algorithms for several graph problems. This work
is inspired by recent large-scale graph processing systems (e.g., Pregel and Giraph) which are
designed based on the message-passing model of distributed computing. Our model consists of a point-to-point
communication network of $k$ machines interconnected by bandwidth-restricted links. Communicating
data between the machines is the costly operation (as opposed to local computation). The network
is used to process an arbitrary $n$-node input graph (typically $n \gg k > 1$) that is randomly
partitioned among the $k$ machines (a common implementation in many real world systems). Our goal
is to study fundamental complexity bounds for solving graph problems in this model. We present techniques
for obtaining lower bounds on the distributed time complexity. Our lower bounds develop and use
new bounds in random-partition communication complexity. We first show a lower bound of $\Omega(n/k)$
rounds for computing a spanning tree (ST) of the input graph. This result also implies the same bound
for other fundamental problems such as computing a minimum spanning tree (MST). We also show an $\Omega(n/k^2)$
lower bound for connectivity, ST verification and other related problems. We give algorithms for
various fundamental graph problems in our model. We show that problems such as PageRank, MST, connectivity,
and graph covering can be solved in $\tilde{O}(n/k)$ time, whereas for shortest paths, we present
algorithms that run in $\tilde{O}(n/\sqrt{k})$ time (for $(1+\epsilon)$-factor approx.) and
in $\tilde{O}(n/k)$ time (for $O(\log n)$-factor approx.) respectively.
