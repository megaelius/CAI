Supplier selection problem has gained extensive attention in the prior studies. However, research
based on Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making (F-MADM) approach in ranking resilient suppliers
in logistic 4.0 is still in its infancy. Traditional MADM approach fails to address the resilient
supplier selection problem in logistic 4.0 primarily because of the large amount of data concerning
some attributes that are quantitative, yet difficult to process while making decisions. Besides,
some qualitative attributes prevalent in logistic 4.0 entail imprecise perceptual or judgmental
decision relevant information, and are substantially different than those considered in traditional
suppler selection problems. This study, for the first time, develops a Decision Support System
(DSS) that will help the decision maker to incorporate and process such imprecise heterogeneous
data in a unified framework to rank a set of resilient suppliers in the logistic 4.0 environment.
The proposed framework induces a triangular fuzzy number from large-scale temporal data using
probability-possibility consistency principle. Large number of non-temporal data presented
graphically are computed by extracting granular information that are imprecise in nature. Fuzzy
linguistic variables are used to map the qualitative attributes. Finally, fuzzy based TOPSIS method
is adopted to generate the ranking score of alternative suppliers. These ranking scores are used
as input in a Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) model to determine optimal order allocation
for respective suppliers. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assesses how the Cost versus Resilience
Index (SCRI) changes when differential priorities are set for respective cost and resilience attributes.
