Nowadays, the Internet is indispensable when it comes to information dissemination. People rely
on the Internet to inform themselves on current news events, as well as to verify facts. We, as a community,
are quickly approaching an 'electronic information age' where the majority of information will
be distributed electronically and tools to preserve this information will become essential. While
archiving online digital information is a good way to preserve online information for future generations,
it has many disadvantages including the easy manipulation of archived information, e.g. by the
archiving authority. Online information is also prone to getting hacked or being taken offline.
Therefore, it is necessary that archived online news information is securely time-stamped with
the date and time when it was first archived in a way that cannot be manipulated. The process of 'trusted
timestamping' is an established approach for claiming that particular digital information existed
at a particular 'point in time' in the past. However, traditional approaches for trusted timestamping
depend on the time-stamping authority's fidelity. Directly embedding the hash of a digital file
into the blockchain of a cryptocurrency is a more recent method that allows for secure time-stamping,
since digital information is stored as part of the transaction information in, e.g. Bitcoin's,
blockchain, and not stored at a centralized time-stamping authority. However, there is no system
yet available, which uses this approach for archiving and time-stamping online news articles.
Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to develop a system that 1) enables decentralized trusted time-stamping
of web and news articles as a means of making future manipulation of online information identifiable,
and 2) allows users to determine the authenticity of articles by checking different versions of
the same article online.
