Multi-user MIMO offers big advantages over conventional point-to-point MIMO: it works with cheap
single-antenna terminals, a rich scattering environment is not required, and resource allocation
is simplified because every active terminal utilizes all of the time-frequency bins. However,
multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned with roughly equal numbers of service-antennas and
terminals and FDD operation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as "Large-Scale
Antenna Systems", "Very Large MIMO", "Hyper MIMO") makes a clean break with current practice through
the use of a large excess of service-antennas over active terminals and TDD operation. Extra antennas
help by focusing energy into ever-smaller regions of space to bring huge improvements in throughput
and radiated energy efficiency. Other benefits of massive MIMO include the extensive use of inexpensive
low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the MAC layer, and robustness to intentional
jamming. The anticipated throughputs depend on the propagation environment providing asymptotically
orthogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed any limitations
in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional research problems irrelevant, it uncovers
entirely new problems that urgently need attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision
components that work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for newly-joined
terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided by the excess of service-antennas,
reducing internal power consumption to achieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding
new deployment scenarios.
