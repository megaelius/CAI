Accurate detection of pathological conditions in human subjects can be achieved through off-line
analysis of recorded biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). However, human diagnosis
is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires the time of medical professionals. This is especially
inefficient when indicative patterns in the biological signals are infrequent. Moreover, patients
with suspected pathologies are often monitored for extended periods, requiring the storage and
examination of large amounts of non-pathological data, and entailing a difficult visual search
task for diagnosing professionals. In this work we propose a compact and sub-mW low power neural
processing system that can be used to perform on-line and real-time preliminary diagnosis of pathological
conditions, to raise warnings for the existence of possible pathological conditions, or to trigger
an off-line data recording system for further analysis by a medical professional. We apply the system
to real-time classification of ECG data for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and pathological
rhythms. Multi-channel analog ECG traces are encoded as asynchronous streams of binary events
and processed using a spiking recurrent neural network operated in a reservoir computing paradigm.
An event-driven neuron output layer is then trained to recognize one of several pathologies. Finally,
the filtered activity of this output layer is used to generate a binary trigger signal indicating
the presence or absence of a pathological pattern. We validate the approach proposed using a Dynamic
Neuromorphic Asynchronous Processor (DYNAP) chip, implemented using a standard 180 nm CMOS VLSI
process, and present experimental results measured from the chip.
