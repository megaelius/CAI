The Web has become a potentially infinite information resource, turning into an essential tool
for many daily activities. This resulted in an increase in the amount of information available in
users' contexts that is not taken into account by current information retrieval systems. This thesis
proposes a semisupervised information retrieval technique that helps users to recover context
relevant information. The objective of the proposed technique is to reduce the vocabulary gap existing
between the knowledge a user has about a specific topic and the relevant documents available in the
Web. This thesis presents a method for learning novel terms associated with a thematic context.
This is achieved by identifying those terms that are good descriptors and good discriminators of
the user's current thematic context. In order to evaluate the proposed method, a theoretical framework
for the evaluation of search mechanisms was developed. This served as a guide for the implementation
of an evaluation framework that allowed to compare the techniques proposed in this thesis with other
techniques existing in the literature. The experimental evidence indicates that the methods proposed
in this thesis present significant improvements over previously published techniques. In addition,
the evaluation framework was equipped with novel evaluation metrics that favor the exploration
of novel material and incorporates a semantic relationship metric between documents. The algorithms
developed in this thesis evolve high quality queries, which have the capability of retrieving results
that are relevant to the user context. These results have a positive impact on the way users interact
with available resources.
