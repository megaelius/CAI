Recent studies have highlighted interesting structural properties of empirical cultural states.
Such a state is a collection of vectors of cultural traits of real individuals, based on which one
defines a matrix of similarities between individuals. This study provides further insights about
the structure encoded in these states, using concepts from random matrix theory. For generating
random matrices that are appropriate as a structureless reference, we propose a null model that
enforces, on average, the empirical occurrence frequency of each possible trait. With respect
to this null model, the empirical similarity matrices show deviating eigenvalues, which may be
signatures of cultural groups that might not be recognizable by other means. However, they can conceivably
also be artifacts of arbitrary, dataset-dependent correlations between cultural variables.
In order to understand this possibility, independently of any empirical information, we study
a toy model which explicitly enforces a specified level of correlation in a minimally-biased way,
in the simplest conceivable setting. In parallel, a second toy model is used to explicitly enforce
group structure, in a very similar setting. By analyzing and comparing cultural states generated
with these toy models, we show that a deviating eigenvalue, such as those observed for empirical
data, can also be induced by correlations alone. Such a "false" group mode can still be distinguished
from a "true" one, by evaluating the uniformity of the entries of the respective eigenvector, while
checking whether this uniformity is statistically compatible with the null model. For empirical
data, the eigenvector uniformities of all deviating eigenvalues are shown to be compatible with
the null model, suggesting that the apparent group structure is not genuine, although a decisive
statement requires further research.
