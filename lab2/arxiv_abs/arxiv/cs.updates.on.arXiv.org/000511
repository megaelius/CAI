Visually impaired people are often confronted with new environments and they find themselves face
to face with an innumerous amount of difficulties when facing these environments. Having to surpass
and deal with these difficulties that arise with their condition is something that we can help diminish.
They are one sense down when trying to understand their surrounding environments and gather information
about what is happening around them. Nowadays, mobile devices present significant computing and
technological capacity which has been increasing to the point where it is very common for most people
to have access to a device with Bluetooth, GPS, Wi-Fi, and both high processing and storage capacities.
This allows us to think of applications that can do so much to help people with difficulties. In the
particular case of blind people, the lack of visual information can be bypassed with other contextual
information retrieved by their own personal devices. Our goal is to provide information to blind
users, be able to give them information about the context that surrounds them. We wanted to provide
the blind users with the tools to create information and be able to share this information between
each other, information about people, locations or objects. Our approach was to split the project
into a data and information gathering phase where we did our field search and interviewed and elaborated
on how is the situation of environment perception for blind users, followed by a technical phase
where we implement a system based on the first stage. Our results gathered from both the collecting
phase and our implementing phase showed that there is potential to use these tools in the blind community
and that they welcome the possibilities and horizons that it opens them.
