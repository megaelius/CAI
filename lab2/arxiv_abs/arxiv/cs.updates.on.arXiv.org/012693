While deep learning has shown promise in the domain of disease classification from medical images,
models based on state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures often exhibit performance
loss due to dataset shift. Models trained using data from one hospital system achieve high predictive
performance when tested on data from the same hospital, but perform significantly worse when they
are tested in different hospital systems. Furthermore, even within a given hospital system, deep
learning models have been shown to depend on hospital- and patient-level confounders rather than
meaningful pathology to make classifications. In order for these models to be safely deployed,
we would like to ensure that they do not use confounding variables to make their classification,
and that they will work well even when tested on images from hospitals that were not included in the
training data. We attempt to address this problem in the context of pneumonia classification from
chest radiographs. We propose an approach based on adversarial optimization, which allows us to
learn more robust models that do not depend on confounders. Specifically, we demonstrate improved
out-of-hospital generalization performance of a pneumonia classifier by training a model that
is invariant to the view position of chest radiographs (anterior-posterior vs. posterior-anterior).
Our approach leads to better predictive performance on external hospital data than both a standard
baseline and previously proposed methods to handle confounding, and also suggests a method for
identifying models that may rely on confounders. Code available at https://github.com/suinleelab/cxr_adv.
