Premature ventricular contraction(PVC) is a type of premature ectopic beat originating from the
ventricles. Automatic method for accurate and robust detection of PVC is highly clinically desired.Currently,
most of these methods are developed and tested using the same database divided into training and
testing set and their generalization performance across databases has not been fully validated.
In this paper, a method based on densely connected convolutional neural network and spatial pyramid
pooling is proposed for PVC detection which can take arbitrarily-sized QRS complexes as input both
in training and testing. With a much less complicated and more straightforward architecture,the
proposed network achieves comparable results to current state-of-the-art deep learning based
method with regard to accuracy,sensitivity and specificity by training and testing using the MIT-BIH
arrhythmia database as benchmark.Besides the benchmark database,QRS complexes are extracted
from four more open databases namely the St-Petersburg Institute of Cardiological Technics 12-lead
Arrhythmia Database,The MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database,The MIT-BIH Long Term Database
and European ST-T Database. The extracted QRS complexes are different in length and sampling rate
among the five databases.Cross-database training and testing is also experimented.The performance
of the network shows an improvement on the benchmark database according to the result demonstrating
the advantage of using multiple databases for training over using only a single database.The network
also achieves satisfactory scores on the other four databases showing good generalization capability.
