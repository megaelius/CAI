Cryptographic protocols are often implemented at upper layers of communication networks, while
error-correcting codes are employed at the physical layer. In this paper, we consider utilizing
readily-available physical layer functions, such as encoders and decoders, together with shared
keys to provide a threshold-type security scheme. To this end, we first consider a scenario where
the effect of the physical layer is omitted and all the channels between the involved parties are
assumed to be noiseless. We introduce a model for threshold-secure coding, where the legitimate
parties communicate using a shared key such that an eavesdropper does not get any information, in
an information-theoretic sense, about the key as well as about any subset of the input symbols of
size up to a certain threshold. Then, a framework is provided for constructing threshold-secure
codes form linear block codes while characterizing the requirements to satisfy the reliability
and security conditions. Moreover, we propose a threshold-secure coding scheme, based on Reed-Muller
(RM) codes, that meets security and reliability conditions. It is shown that the encoder and the
decoder of the scheme can be implemented efficiently with quasi-linear time complexity. In particular,
a successive cancellation decoder is shown for the RM-based coding scheme. Then we extend the setup
to the scenario where the channel between the legitimate parties is no longer noiseless. The reliability
condition for noisy channels is then modified accordingly, and a method is described to construct
codes attaining threshold security as well as desired reliability. Also, we propose a coding scheme
based on RM codes for threshold security and robustness designed for binary erasure channels along
with a unified successive cancellation decoder. The proposed threshold-secure coding schemes
are flexible and can be adapted for different key lengths.
