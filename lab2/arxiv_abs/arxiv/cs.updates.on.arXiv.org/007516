Difficult image segmentation problems, for instance left atrium MRI, can be addressed by incorporating
shape priors to find solutions that are consistent with known objects. Nonetheless, a single multivariate
Gaussian is not an adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the
prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more general, but has a
ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious challenges in optimization, especially
in high dimensional spaces. Here, we propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on
a generative image model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use deep
autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding the careful selection
of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding
parameters in a high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional
subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a latent variable and
marginalize it within a generalized expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional
maximization-based scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific
shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and an intensity-based
energy minimization that translates the global notion of a nonlinear shape prior into a set of local
penalties. We demonstrate our approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced
MRI, which is useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation.
