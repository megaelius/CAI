A time-domain analog-weighted-sum calculation model based on a pulse-width modulation (PWM)
approach is proposed. The proposed calculation model can be applied to any types of network structure
including multi-layer feedforward networks. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI)
circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current mode
circuits used in computing-in-memory circuits, our time-domain analog circuits use transient
operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed
without operational amplifiers, they can be operated with extremely low power consumption. However,
they have to use very high-resistance devices, on the order of giga-ohms. We designed a CMOS VLSI
chip to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model with binary weights, which realizes
the BinaryConnect model. In the chip, memory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used
for synaptic connection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold
operation region of MOS transistors unlike the ordinary computing-in-memory circuits. The chip
was designed and fabricated using a 250-nm fabrication technology. Measurement results showed
that energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 300~TOPS/W (Tera-Operations Per
Second per Watt), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art
digital AI processors, even though the minimum width of interconnection used in this chip was several
times larger than that in such digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is used
to implement the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than 1,000~TOPS/W will be possible.
For practical applications, development of emerging analog memory devices such as ferroelectric-gate
field effect transistors (FeFETs) is necessary.
