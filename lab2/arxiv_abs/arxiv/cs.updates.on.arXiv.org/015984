With the rapid emergence of K-12 online learning platforms, a new era of education has been opened
up. It is crucial to have a dropout warning framework to preemptively identify K-12 students who
are at risk of dropping out of the online courses. Prior researchers have focused on predicting dropout
in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which often deliver higher education, i.e., graduate level
courses at top institutions. However, few studies have focused on developing a machine learning
approach for students in K-12 online courses. In this paper, we develop a machine learning framework
to conduct accurate at-risk student identification specialized in K-12 multimodal online environments.
Our approach considers both online and offline factors around K-12 students and aims at solving
the challenges of (1) multiple modalities, i.e., K-12 online environments involve interactions
from different modalities such as video, voice, etc; (2) length variability, i.e., students with
different lengths of learning history; (3) time sensitivity, i.e., the dropout likelihood is changing
with time; and (4) data imbalance, i.e., only less than 20\% of K-12 students will choose to drop out
the class. We conduct a wide range of offline and online experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach. In our offline experiments, we show that our method improves the dropout prediction
performance when compared to state-of-the-art baselines on a real-world educational dataset.
In our online experiments, we test our approach on a third-party K-12 online tutoring platform for
two months and the results show that more than 70\% of dropout students are detected by the system.
