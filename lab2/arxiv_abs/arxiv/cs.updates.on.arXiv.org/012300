High order implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods are often desired when evolving the solution of an
ordinary differential equation that has a stiff part that is linear and a non-stiff part that is nonlinear.
This situation often arises in semi-discretization of partial differential equations and many
such IMEX schemes have been considered in the literature. The methods considered usually have a
a global error that is of the same order as the local truncation error. More recently, methods with
global errors that are one order higher than predicted by the local truncation error have been devised
(by Kulikov and Weiner, Ditkowski and Gottlieb). In prior work we investigated the interplay between
the local truncation error and the global error to construct explicit and implicit {\em error inhibiting
schemes} that control the accumulation of the local truncation error over time, resulting in a global
error that is one order higher than expected from the local truncation error, and which can be post-processed
to obtain a solution which is two orders higher than expected. In this work we extend our error inhibiting
with post-processing framework introduced in our previous work to a class of additive general linear
methods with multiple steps and stages. We provide sufficient conditions under which these methods
with local truncation error of order p will produce solutions of order (p+1), which can be post-processed
to order (p+2), and describe the construction of one such post-processor. We apply this approach
to obtain implicit-explicit (IMEX) methods with multiple steps and stages. We present some of our
new IMEX methods and show their linear stability properties, and investigate how these methods
perform in practice on some numerical test cases.
