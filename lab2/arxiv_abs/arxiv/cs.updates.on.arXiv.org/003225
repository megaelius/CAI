It has been shown that for a general-valued constraint language $\Gamma$ the following statements
are equivalent: (1) any instance of $\operatorname{VCSP}(\Gamma)$ can be solved to optimality
using a constant level of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy; (2) any instance of $\operatorname{VCSP}(\Gamma)$
can be solved to optimality using the third level of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy; (3) the support
of $\Gamma$ satisfies the "bounded width condition", i.e., it contains weak near-unanimity operations
of all arities. We show that if the support of $\Gamma$ violates the bounded width condition then
not only is $\operatorname{VCSP}(\Gamma)$ not solved by a constant level of the Sherali-Adams
LP hierarchy but it is also not solved by $\Omega(n)$ levels of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy (also known
as the sum-of-squares SDP hierarchy). For $\Gamma$ corresponding to linear equations in an Abelian
group, this result follows from existing work on inapproximability of Max-CSPs. By a breakthrough
result of Lee, Raghavendra, and Steurer [STOC'15], our result implies that for any $\Gamma$ whose
support violates the bounded width condition no SDP relaxation of polynomial-size solves $\operatorname{VCSP}(\Gamma)$.
We establish our result by proving that various reductions preserve exact solvability by the Lasserre
SDP hierarchy (up to a constant factor in the level of the hierarchy). Our results hold for general-valued
constraint languages, i.e., sets of functions on a fixed finite domain that take on rational or infinite
values, and thus also hold in notable special cases of $\{0,\infty\}$-valued languages (CSPs),
$\{0,1\}$-valued languages (Min-CSPs/Max-CSPs), and $\mathbb{Q}$-valued languages (finite-valued
CSPs).
