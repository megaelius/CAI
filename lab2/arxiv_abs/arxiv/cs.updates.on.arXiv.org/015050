Increasing demand for secure remote operation in industry and technology advancements to support
delivering efficient services and tele-mentoring have opened a new market in healthcare sector
and emergency services based on 5G and Tactile internet capabilities. In a connected world, hospitals
would benefit from providing the on-time availability either for continuous health monitoring
or critical services to the citizens in need. In this paper, we propose a secure non-public health
enterprise network concept to enable an end-to-end secure and location-agnostic communication
between a patient and a healthcare service provider, and other contacts with patients consent either
in case of an emergency or to be stored in the medical records. We present how applying non-public
enterprise networks can address market demand in health care sector for improved end-to-end security
and privacy when dealing with personal and critical information. We present the three tier architecture
model describing continuous authentication mechanisms based on biometric collection as well
as the dynamic network solutions in the healthcare domain. The biometric collection can be done
using ambient or IoT sensors as well as wearable or implantable devices to monitor the patient unobtrusively.
Furthermore, end-to-end security solutions should adapt dynamically based on the user profile
and situation awareness to address the required level of security at the network side. We discuss
the related research challenges for developing the presented non-public health enterprise platform
and provide suggestions for future work based on the healthcare sector requirements and opportunities.
