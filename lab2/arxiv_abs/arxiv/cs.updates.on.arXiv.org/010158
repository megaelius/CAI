Graph embedding learning which aims to automatically learn low-dimensional node representations
has drawn increasing attention in recent years. To date, most recent graph embedding methods are
mainly evaluated on social and information networks and have not been comprehensively studied
on biomedical networks under systematic experiments and analyses. On the other hand, for a variety
of biomedical network analysis tasks, traditional techniques such as matrix factorization have
shown promising results, and hence there is a need to systematically evaluate the more recent graph
embedding methods (e.g., random walk-based and neural network-based) in terms of their usability
and potential to further the state-of-the-art. We select 11 representative graph embedding methods
and conduct a systematic comparison on three important biomedical link prediction tasks: drug-disease
association prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction,
and two node classification tasks: medical term semantic type classification, protein function
prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the recent graph embedding methods which
have not been explored completely on biomedical tasks achieve promising results and deserve more
attention in the future biomedical graph analysis. Besides, compared with three state-of-the-art
methods for DDAs, DDIs and protein function predictions, the recent graph embedding methods achieve
competitive performance without using any biological features. By summarizing the experimental
results, we provide general guidelines for properly selecting graph embedding methods and setting
their hyper-parameters for different biomedical tasks. We also develop an easy-to-use Python
package with detailed instructions, BioNEV, including all source code and datasets, to facilitate
studying various graph embedding methods on biomedical tasks.
