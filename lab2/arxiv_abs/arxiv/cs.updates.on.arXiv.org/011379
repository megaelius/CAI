Many challenges faced in today's semiconductor devices are related to self-heating phenomena.
The optimization of device designs can be assisted by numerical simulations using the non-isothermal
drift-diffusion system, where the magnitude of the thermoelectric cross effects is controlled
by the Seebeck coefficient. We show that the model equations take a remarkably simple form when assuming
the so-called Kelvin formula for the Seebeck coefficient. The corresponding heat generation rate
involves exactly the three classically known self-heating effects, namely Joule, recombination
and Thomson-Peltier heating, without any further (transient) contributions. Moreover, the thermal
driving force in the electrical current density expressions can be entirely absorbed in the diffusion
coefficient via a generalized Einstein relation. The efficient numerical simulation relies on
an accurate and robust discretization technique for the fluxes (finite volume Scharfetter-Gummel
method), which allows to cope with the typically stiff solutions of the semiconductor device equations.
We derive two non-isothermal generalizations of the Scharfetter-Gummel scheme for degenerate
semiconductors (Fermi-Dirac statistics) obeying the Kelvin formula. The approaches differ in
the treatment of degeneration effects: The first is based on an approximation of the discrete generalized
Einstein relation implying a specifically modified thermal voltage, whereas the second scheme
follows the conventionally used approach employing a modified electric field. We present a detailed
analysis and comparison of both schemes, indicating a superior performance of the modified thermal
voltage scheme.
