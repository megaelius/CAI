Automatic door is an automated movable barrier installed in the entry of a room or building to restrict
access, provide ease of opening a door or provide visual privacy. As a result of enhanced civilization
and modernization, the human nature demands more comfort to his life. The man seeks ways to do things
easily and which saves time. So thus, the automatic gates are one of the examples that human nature
invent to bring comfort and ease in its daily life. To this end, we model and design an automatic sliding
door with a room light control system to provide the mentioned needs. This was achieved by considering
some factors such as economy, availability of components and research materials, efficiency,
compatibility and portability and also durability in the design process. The performance of the
system after test met design specifications. This system works on the principle of breaking an infrared
beam of light, sensed by a photodiode. It consists of two transmitting infrared diodes and two receiving
photo-diodes. The first one is for someone coming in and the second one is for someone going out of
the room. The photodiodes are connected to comparators, which give a lower output when the beam is
broken and high output when transmitting normally. The general operation of the work and performance
is dependent on the presence of an intruder entering through the door and how close he/she is in closer
to the door. The door is meant to open automatically but in a case where there is no power supply trying
to force the door open would damage the mechanical control system of the unit. The overall work was
implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly functional.
