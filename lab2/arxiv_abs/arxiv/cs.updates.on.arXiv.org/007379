Learning with noisy labels, which aims to reduce expensive labors on accurate annotations, has
become imperative in the Big Data era. Previous noise transition based method has achieved promising
results and presented a theoretical guarantee on performance in the case of class-conditional
noise. However, this type of approaches critically depend on an accurate pre-estimation of the
noise transition, which is usually impractical. Subsequent improvement adapts the pre-estimation
along with the training progress via a Softmax layer. However, the parameters in the Softmax layer
are highly tweaked for the fragile performance due to the ill-posed stochastic approximation.
To address these issues, we propose a Latent Class-Conditional Noise model (LCCN) that naturally
embeds the noise transition under a Bayesian framework. By projecting the noise transition into
a Dirichlet-distributed space, the learning is constrained on a simplex based on the whole dataset,
instead of some ad-hoc parametric space. We then deduce a dynamic label regression method for LCCN
to iteratively infer the latent labels, to stochastically train the classifier and to model the
noise. Our approach safeguards the bounded update of the noise transition, which avoids previous
arbitrarily tuning via a batch of samples. We further generalize LCCN for open-set noisy labels
and the semi-supervised setting. We perform extensive experiments with the controllable noise
data sets, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and the agnostic noise data sets, Clothing1M and WebVision17.
The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art
methods.
