Image steganalysis is a special binary classification problem that aims to classify natural cover
images and suspected stego images which are the results of embedding very weak secret message signals
into covers. How to effectively suppress cover image content and thus make the classification of
cover images and stego images easier is the key of this task. Recent researches show that Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) are very effective to detect steganography by learning discriminative features
between cover images and their stegos. Several deep CNN models have been proposed via incorporating
domain knowledge of image steganography/steganalysis into the design of the network and achieve
state of the art performance on standard database. Following such direction, we propose a novel
model called Cover Image Suppression Network (CIS-Net), which improves the performance of spatial
image steganalysis by suppressing cover image content as much as possible in model learning. Two
novel layers, the Single-value Truncation Layer (STL) and Sub-linear Pooling Layer (SPL), are
proposed in this work. Specifically, STL truncates input values into a same threshold when they
are out of a predefined interval. Theoretically, we have proved that STL can reduce the variance
of input feature map without deteriorating useful information. For SPL, it utilizes sub-linear
power function to suppress large valued elements introduced by cover image contents and aggregates
weak embedded signals via average pooling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed network
equipped with STL and SPL achieves better performance than rich model classifiers and existing
CNN models on challenging steganographic algorithms.
