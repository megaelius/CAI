Robotic calibration allows for the fusion of data from multiple sensors such as odometers, cameras,
etc., by providing appropriate transformational relationships between the corresponding reference
frames. For wheeled robots equipped with exteroceptive sensors, calibration entails learning
the motion model of the sensor or the robot in terms of the odometric data, and must generally be performed
prior to performing tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Within this context,
the current trend is to carry out simultaneous calibration of odometry and sensor without the use
of any additional hardware. Building upon the existing simultaneous calibration algorithms,
we put forth a generalized calibration framework that can not only handle robots operating in 2D
with arbitrary or unknown motion models but also handle outliers in an automated manner. We first
propose an algorithm based on the alternating minimization framework applicable to two-wheel
differential drive. Subsequently, for arbitrary but known drive configurations we put forth an
iteratively re-weighted least squares methodology leveraging an intelligent weighing scheme.
Different from the existing works, these proposed algorithms require no manual intervention and
seamlessly handle outliers that arise due to both systematic and non-systematic errors. Finally,
we put forward a novel Gaussian Process-based non-parametric approach for calibrating wheeled
robots with arbitrary or unknown drive configurations. Detailed experiments are performed to
demonstrate the accuracy, usefulness, and flexibility of the proposed algorithms.
