The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the
global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected
patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography.
Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study
we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection
of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public.
To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for
COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open
access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient
patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best
of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using
an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated
with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible
and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from
the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net,
along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and
build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development
of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate
treatment of those who need it the most.
