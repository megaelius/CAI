Host logs, in particular, Windows Event Logs, are a valuable source of information often collected
by security operation centers (SOCs). The semi-structured nature of host logs inhibits automated
analytics, and while manual analysis is common, the sheer volume makes manual inspection of all
logs impossible. Although many powerful algorithms for analyzing time-series and sequential
data exist, utilization of such algorithms for most cyber security applications is either infeasible
or requires tailored, research-intensive preparations. In particular, basic mathematic and
algorithmic developments for providing a generalized, meaningful similarity metric on system
logs is needed to bridge the gap between many existing sequential data mining methods and this currently
available but under-utilized data source. In this paper, we provide a rigorous definition of a metric
product space on Windows Event Logs, providing an embedding that allows for the application of established
machine learning and time-series analysis methods. We then demonstrate the utility and flexibility
of this embedding with multiple use-cases on real data: (1) comparing known infected to new host
log streams for attack detection and forensics, (2) collapsing similar streams of logs into semantically-meaningful
groups (by user, by role), thereby reducing the quantity of data but not the content, (3) clustering
logs as well as short sequences of logs to identify and visualize user behaviors and background processes
over time. Overall, we provide a metric space framework for general host logs and log sequences that
respects semantic similarity and facilitates a wide variety of data science analytics to these
logs without data-specific preparations for each.
