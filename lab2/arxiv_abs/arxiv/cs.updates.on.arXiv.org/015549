The Web has become the main source for news acquisition. At the same time, news discussion has become
more social: users can post comments on news articles or discuss news articles on other platforms
like Reddit. These features empower and enable discussions among the users; however, they also
act as the medium for the dissemination of toxic discourse and hate speech. The research community
lacks a general understanding on what type of content attracts hateful discourse and the possible
effects of social networks on the commenting activity on news articles. In this work, we perform
a large-scale quantitative analysis of 125M comments posted on 412K news articles over the course
of 19 months. We analyze the content of the collected articles and their comments using temporal
analysis, user-based analysis, and linguistic analysis, to shed light on what elements attract
hateful comments on news articles. We also investigate commenting activity when an article is posted
on either 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/) or six selected subreddits. We find statistically
significant increases in hateful commenting activity around real-world divisive events like
the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville and political events like the second and third 2016
US presidential debates. Also, we find that articles that attract a substantial number of hateful
comments have different linguistic characteristics when compared to articles that do not attract
hateful comments. Furthermore, we observe that the post of a news articles on either /pol/ or the
six subreddits is correlated with an increase of (hateful) commenting activity on the news articles.
