Machine learning has recently been widely adopted to address the managerial decision making problems.
However, there is a trade-off between performance and interpretability. Full complexity models
(such as neural network-based models) are non-traceable black-box, whereas classic interpretable
models (such as logistic regression) are usually simplified with lower accuracy. This trade-off
limits the application of state-of-the-art machine learning models in management problems, which
requires high prediction performance, as well as the understanding of individual attributes'
contributions to the model outcome. Multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) is a family of interpretable
approaches to depicting the rationale of human decision behavior. It is also limited by strong assumptions
(e.g. preference independence). In this paper, we propose an interpretable machine learning approach,
namely Neural Network-based Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (NN-MCDA), which combines an additive
MCDA model and a fully-connected multilayer perceptron (MLP) to achieve good performance while
preserving a certain degree of interpretability. NN-MCDA has a linear component (in an additive
form of a set of polynomial functions) to capture the detailed relationship between individual
attributes and the prediction, and a nonlinear component (in a standard MLP form) to capture the
high-order interactions between attributes and their complex nonlinear transformations. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of NN-MCDA with extensive simulation studies and two real-world
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to enhance the interpretability
of machine learning models with MCDA techniques. The proposed framework also sheds light on how
to use machine learning techniques to free MCDA from strong assumptions.
