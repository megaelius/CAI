Worst-case hardness results for most equilibrium computation problems have raised the need for
beyond-worst-case analysis. To this end, we study the smoothed complexity of finding pure Nash
equilibria in Network Coordination Games, a PLS-complete problem in the worst case. This is a potential
game where the sequential-better-response algorithm is known to converge to a pure NE, albeit in
exponential time. First, we prove polynomial (resp. quasi-polynomial) smoothed complexity when
the underlying game graph is a complete (resp. arbitrary) graph, and every player has constantly
many strategies. We note that the complete graph case is reminiscent of perturbing all parameters,
a common assumption in most known smoothed analysis results. Second, we define a notion of smoothness-preserving
reduction among search problems, and obtain reductions from $2$-strategy network coordination
games to local-max-cut, and from $k$-strategy games (with arbitrary $k$) to local-max-cut up to
two flips. The former together with the recent result of [BCC18] gives an alternate $O(n^8)$-time
smoothed algorithm for the $2$-strategy case. This notion of reduction allows for the extension
of smoothed efficient algorithms from one problem to another. For the first set of results, we develop
techniques to bound the probability that an (adversarial) better-response sequence makes slow
improvements on the potential. Our approach combines and generalizes the local-max-cut approaches
of [ER14,ABPW17] to handle the multi-strategy case: it requires a careful definition of the matrix
which captures the increase in potential, a tighter union bound on adversarial sequences, and balancing
it with good enough rank bounds. We believe that the approach and notions developed herein could
be of interest in addressing the smoothed complexity of other potential and/or congestion games.
