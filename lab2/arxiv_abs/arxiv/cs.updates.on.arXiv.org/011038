As an important problem in computer vision, salient object detection (SOD) from images has been
attracting an increasing amount of research effort over the years. Recent advances in SOD, not surprisingly,
are dominantly led by deep learning-based solutions (named deep SOD) and reflected by hundreds
of published papers. To facilitate the in-depth understanding of deep SODs, in this paper we provide
a comprehensive survey covering various aspects ranging from algorithm taxonomy to unsolved open
issues. In particular, we first review deep SOD algorithms from different perspectives including
network architecture, level of supervision, learning paradigm and object/instance level detection.
Following that, we summarize existing SOD evaluation datasets and metrics. Then, we carefully
compile a thorough benchmark results of SOD methods based on previous work, and provide detailed
analysis of the comparison results. Moreover, we study the performance of SOD algorithms under
different attributes, which have been barely explored previously, by constructing a novel SOD
dataset with rich attribute annotations. We further analyze, for the first time in the field, the
robustness and transferability of deep SOD models w.r.t. adversarial attacks. We also look into
the influence of input perturbations, and the generalization and hardness of existing SOD datasets.
Finally, we discuss several open issues and challenges of SOD, and point out possible research directions
in future. All the saliency prediction maps, our constructed dataset with annotations, and codes
for evaluation are made publicly available at https://github.com/wenguanwang/SODsurvey.
