This paper investigates the hybrid precoding design for millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet inputs. The mmWave MIMO system employs partially-connected
hybrid precoding architecture with dynamic subarrays, where each radio frequency (RF) chain is
connected to a dynamic subset of antennas. We consider the design of analog and digital precoders
utilizing statistical and/or mixed channel state information (CSI), which involve solving an
extremely difficult problem in theory: First, designing the optimal partition of antennas over
RF chains is a combinatorial optimization problem, whose optimal solution requires an exhaustive
search over all antenna partitioning solutions; Second, the average mutual information under
mmWave MIMO channels lacks closed-form expression and involves prohibitive computational burden;
Third, the hybrid precoding problem with given partition of antennas is nonconvex with respect
to the analog and digital precoders. To address these issues, this study first presents a simple
criterion and the corresponding low complexity algorithm to design the optimal partition of antennas
using statistical CSI. Then it derives the lower bound and its approximation for the average mutual
information, in which the computational complexity is greatly reduced compared to calculating
the average mutual information directly. In addition, it also shows that the lower bound with a constant
shift offers a very accurate approximation to the average mutual information. This paper further
proposes utilizing the lower bound approximation as a low-complexity and accurate alternative
for developing a manifold-based gradient ascent algorithm to find near optimal analog and digital
precoders. Several numerical results are provided to show that our proposed algorithm outperforms
existing hybrid precoding algorithms.
