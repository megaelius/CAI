We consider message-efficient continuous random sampling from a distributed stream, where the
probability of inclusion of an item in the sample is proportional to a weight associated with the
item. The unweighted version, where all weights are equal, is well studied, and admits tight upper
and lower bounds on message complexity. For weighted sampling with replacement, there is a simple
reduction to unweighted sampling with replacement. However, in many applications the stream has
only a few heavy items which may dominate a random sample when chosen with replacement. Weighted
sampling \textit{without replacement} (weighted SWOR) eludes this issue, since such heavy items
can be sampled at most once. In this work, we present the first message-optimal algorithm for weighted
SWOR from a distributed stream. Our algorithm also has optimal space and time complexity. As an application
of our algorithm for weighted SWOR, we derive the first distributed streaming algorithms for tracking
\textit{heavy hitters with residual error}. Here the goal is to identify stream items that contribute
significantly to the residual stream, once the heaviest items are removed. Residual heavy hitters
generalize the notion of $\ell_1$ heavy hitters and are important in streams that have a skewed distribution
of weights. In addition to the upper bound, we also provide a lower bound on the message complexity
that is nearly tight up to a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor. Finally, we use our weighted sampling algorithm
to improve the message complexity of distributed $L_1$ tracking, also known as count tracking,
which is a widely studied problem in distributed streaming. We also derive a tight message lower
bound, which closes the message complexity of this fundamental problem.
