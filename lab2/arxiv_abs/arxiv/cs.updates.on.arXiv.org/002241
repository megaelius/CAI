$\textbf{Objective}$ Develop an automatic diagnostic system which only uses textual admission
information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and assist clinicians with a timely and statistically
proved decision tool. The hope is that the tool can be used to reduce mis-diagnosis. $\textbf{Materials
and Methods}$ We use the real-world clinical notes from MIMIC-III, a freely available dataset consisting
of clinical data of more than forty thousand patients who stayed in intensive care units of the Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. We proposed a Convolutional Neural Network
model to learn semantic features from unstructured textual input and automatically predict primary
discharge diagnosis. $\textbf{Results}$ The proposed model achieved an overall 96.11% accuracy
and 80.48% weighted F1 score values on 10 most frequent disease classes, significantly outperforming
four strong baseline models by at least 12.7% in weighted F1 score. $\textbf{Discussion}$ Experimental
results imply that the CNN model is suitable for supporting diagnosis decision making in the presence
of complex, noisy and unstructured clinical data while at the same time using fewer layers and parameters
that other traditional Deep Network models. $\textbf{Conclusion}$ Our model demonstrated capability
of representing complex medical meaningful features from unstructured clinical notes and prediction
power for commonly misdiagnosed frequent diseases. It can use easily adopted in clinical setting
to provide timely and statistically proved decision support. $\textbf{Keywords}$ Convolutional
