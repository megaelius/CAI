Thoracic diseases are very serious health problems that plague a large number of people. Chest X-ray
is currently one of the most popular methods to diagnose thoracic diseases, playing an important
role in the healthcare workflow. However, reading the chest X-ray images and giving an accurate
diagnosis remain challenging tasks for expert radiologists. With the success of deep learning
in computer vision, a growing number of deep neural network architectures were applied to chest
X-ray image classification. However, most of the previous deep neural network classifiers were
based on deterministic architectures which are usually very noise-sensitive and are likely to
aggravate the overfitting issue. In this paper, to make a deep architecture more robust to noise
and to reduce overfitting, we propose using deep generative classifiers to automatically diagnose
thorax diseases from the chest X-ray images. Unlike the traditional deterministic classifier,
a deep generative classifier has a distribution middle layer in the deep neural network. A sampling
layer then draws a random sample from the distribution layer and input it to the following layer for
classification. The classifier is generative because the class label is generated from samples
of a related distribution. Through training the model with a certain amount of randomness, the deep
generative classifiers are expected to be robust to noise and can reduce overfitting and then achieve
good performances. We implemented our deep generative classifiers based on a number of well-known
deterministic neural network architectures, and tested our models on the chest X-ray14 dataset.
The results demonstrated the superiority of deep generative classifiers compared with the corresponding
deep deterministic classifiers.
