Given access to accurate solutions of the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation, nearly all chemistry
could be derived from first principles. Exact wavefunctions of interesting chemical systems are
out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using
polynomially-scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice
of wavefunction approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy.
Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and
promise as a compact wavefunction Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure
require wavefunctions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning
architecture, the Fermionic Neural Network, as a powerful wavefunction Ansatz for many-electron
systems. The Fermionic Neural Network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum
Monte Carlo Ans\"atze on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions
and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two
challenging strongly-correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled
cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium
geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational
quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab-initio quantum chemistry methods,
opening the possibility of accurate direct optimisation of wavefunctions for previously intractable
molecules and solids.
