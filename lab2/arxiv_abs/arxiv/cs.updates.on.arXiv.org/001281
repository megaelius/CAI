Recent studies have shown that attackers can force deep learning models to misclassify so-called
"adversarial examples": maliciously generated images formed by making imperceptible modifications
to pixel values. With growing interest in deep learning for security applications, it is important
for security experts and users of machine learning to recognize how learning systems may be attacked.
Due to the complex nature of deep learning, it is challenging to understand how deep models can be
fooled by adversarial examples. Thus, we present a web-based visualization tool, Adversarial-Playground,
to demonstrate the efficacy of common adversarial methods against a convolutional neural network
(CNN) system. Adversarial-Playground is educational, modular and interactive. (1) It enables
non-experts to compare examples visually and to understand why an adversarial example can fool
a CNN-based image classifier. (2) It can help security experts explore more vulnerability of deep
learning as a software module. (3) Building an interactive visualization is challenging in this
domain due to the large feature space of image classification (generating adversarial examples
is slow in general and visualizing images are costly). Through multiple novel design choices, our
tool can provide fast and accurate responses to user requests. Empirically, we find that our client-server
division strategy reduced the response time by an average of 1.5 seconds per sample. Our other innovation,
a faster variant of JSMA evasion algorithm, empirically performed twice as fast as JSMA and yet maintains
a comparable evasion rate. Project source code and data from our experiments available at: https://github.com/QData/AdversarialDNN-Playground
