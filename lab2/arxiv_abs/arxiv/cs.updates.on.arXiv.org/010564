By combining a certain approximation property in the spatial domain, and weighted $\ell_2$-summability
of the Hermite polynomial expansion coefficients in the parametric domain obtained in [M. Bachmayr,
A. Cohen, R. DeVore and G. Migliorati, ESAIM Math. Model. Numer. Anal. {\bf 51}(2017), 341-363]
and [M. Bachmayr, A. Cohen, D. D\~ung and C. Schwab, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. {\bf 55}(2017), 2151-2186],
we investigate linear non-adaptive methods of fully discrete polynomial interpolation approximation
as well as fully discrete weighted quadrature methods of integration for parametric and stochastic
elliptic PDEs with lognormal inputs. We explicitly construct such methods and prove corresponding
convergence rates in $n$ of the approximations by them, where $n$ is a number characterizing computation
complexity. The linear non-adaptive methods of fully discrete polynomial interpolation approximation
are sparse-grid collocation methods. Moreover, they generate in a natural way discrete weighted
quadrature formulas for integration of the solution to parametric and stochastic elliptic PDEs
and its linear functionals, and the error of the corresponding integration can be estimated via
the error in the Bochner space $L_1({\mathbb R}^\infty,V,\gamma)$ norm of the generating methods
where $\gamma$ is the Gaussian probability measure on ${\mathbb R}^\infty$ and $V$ is the energy
space. We also briefly consider similar problems for parametric and stochastic elliptic PDEs with
affine inputs, and by-product problems of non-fully discrete polynomial interpolation approximation
and integration. In particular, the convergence rate of non-fully discrete obtained in this paper
improves the known one.
