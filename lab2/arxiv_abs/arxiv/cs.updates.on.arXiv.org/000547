Canonical orderings [STOC'88, FOCS'92] have been used as a key tool in graph drawing, graph encoding
and visibility representations for the last decades. We study a far-reaching generalization of
canonical orderings to non-planar graphs that was published by Lee Mondshein in a PhD-thesis at
M.I.T.\ as early as 1971. Mondshein proposed to order the vertices of a graph in a sequence such that,
for any $i$, the vertices from $1$ to $i$ induce essentially a $2$-connected graph while the remaining
vertices from $i+1$ to $n$ induce a connected graph. Mondshein's sequence generalizes canonical
orderings and became later and independently known under the name \emph{non-separating ear decomposition}.
Currently, the best known algorithm for computing this sequence achieves a running time of $O(nm)$;
the main open problem in Mondshein's and follow-up work is to improve this running time to a subquadratic
time. In this paper, we present the first algorithm that computes a Mondshein sequence in time and
space $O(m)$, improving the previous best running time by a factor of $n$. In addition, we illustrate
the impact of this result by deducing linear-time algorithms for several other problems, for which
the previous best running times have been quadratic. In particular, we show how to compute three
independent spanning trees in a $3$-connected graph in linear time, improving a result of Cheriyan
and Maheshwari [J. Algorithms 9(4)]. Secondly, we improve the preprocessing time for the output-sensitive
data structure by Di Battista, Tamassia and Vismara [Algorithmica 23(4)] that reports three internally
disjoint paths between any given vertex pair from $O(n^2)$ to $O(m)$. Finally, we show how a very
simple linear-time planarity test can be derived once a Mondshein sequence is computed.
