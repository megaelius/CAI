In two papers, B\"urgisser and Ikenmeyer (STOC 2011, STOC 2013) used an adaption of the geometric
complexity theory (GCT) approach by Mulmuley and Sohoni (Siam J Comput 2001, 2008) to prove lower
bounds on the border rank of the matrix multiplication tensor. A key ingredient was information
about certain Kronecker coefficients. While tensors are an interesting test bed for GCT ideas,
the far-away goal is the separation of algebraic complexity classes. The role of the Kronecker coefficients
in that setting is taken by the so-called plethysm coefficients: These are the multiplicities in
the coordinate rings of spaces of polynomials. Even though several hardness results for Kronecker
coefficients are known, there are almost no results about the complexity of computing the plethysm
coefficients or even deciding their positivity. In this paper we show that deciding positivity
of plethysm coefficients is NP-hard, and that computing plethysm coefficients is #P-hard. In fact,
both problems remain hard even if the inner parameter of the plethysm coefficient is fixed. In this
way we obtain an inner versus outer contrast: If the outer parameter of the plethysm coefficient
is fixed, then the plethysm coefficient can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we derive
new lower and upper bounds and in special cases even combinatorial descriptions for plethysm coefficients,
which we consider to be of independent interest. Our technique uses discrete tomography in a more
refined way than the recent work on Kronecker coefficients by Ikenmeyer, Mulmuley, and Walter (Comput
Compl 2017). This makes our work the first to apply techniques from discrete tomography to the study
of plethysm coefficients. Quite surprisingly, that interpretation also leads to new equalities
between certain plethysm coefficients and Kronecker coefficients.
