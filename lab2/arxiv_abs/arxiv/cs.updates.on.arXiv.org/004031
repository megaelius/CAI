Real-time algorithms for automatically recognizing surgical phases are needed to develop systems
that can provide assistance to surgeons, enable better management of operating room (OR) resources
and consequently improve safety within the OR. State-of-the-art surgical phase recognition algorithms
using laparoscopic videos are based on fully supervised training. This limits their potential
for widespread application, since creation of manual annotations is an expensive process considering
the numerous types of existing surgeries and the vast amount of laparoscopic videos available.
In this work, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach based on the prediction of
remaining surgery duration (RSD) from laparoscopic videos. The RSD prediction task is used to pre-train
a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network in an end-to-end
manner. Our proposed approach utilizes all available data and reduces the reliance on annotated
data, thereby facilitating the scaling up of surgical phase recognition algorithms to different
kinds of surgeries. Additionally, we present EndoN2N, an end-to-end trained CNN-LSTM model for
surgical phase recognition and evaluate the performance of our approach on a dataset of 120 Cholecystectomy
laparoscopic videos (Cholec120). This work also presents the first systematic study of self-supervised
pre-training approaches to understand the amount of annotations required for surgical phase recognition.
Interestingly, the proposed RSD pre-training approach leads to performance improvement even
when all the training data is manually annotated and outperforms the single pre-training approach
for surgical phase recognition presently published in the literature. It is also observed that
end-to-end training of CNN-LSTM networks boosts surgical phase recognition performance.
