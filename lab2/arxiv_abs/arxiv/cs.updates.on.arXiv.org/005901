Often, when dealing with real-world recognition problems, we do not need, and often cannot have,
knowledge of the entire set of possible classes that might appear during operational testing. Sometimes,
some of these classes may be ill-sampled, not sampled at all or undefined. In such cases, we need to
think of robust classification methods able to deal with the "unknown" and properly reject samples
belonging to classes never seen during training. Notwithstanding, almost all existing classifiers
to date were mostly developed for the closed-set scenario, i.e., the classification setup in which
it is assumed that all test samples belong to one of the classes with which the classifier was trained.
In the open-set scenario, however, a test sample can belong to none of the known classes and the classifier
must properly reject it by classifying it as unknown. In this work, we extend upon the well-known
Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier and introduce the Specialized Support Vector Machines
(SSVM), which is suitable for recognition in open-set setups. SSVM balances the empirical risk
and the risk of the unknown and ensures that the region of the feature space in which a test sample would
be classified as known (one of the known classes) is always bounded, ensuring a finite risk of the
unknown. The same cannot be guaranteed by the traditional SVM formulation, even when using the Radial
Basis Function (RBF) kernel. In this work, we also highlight the properties of the SVM classifier
related to the open-set scenario, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an RBF SVM
to have bounded open-space risk. We also indicate promising directions of investigation of SVM-based
methods for open-set scenarios. An extensive set of experiments compares the proposed method with
existing solutions in the literature for open-set recognition and the reported results show its
effectiveness.
