The rapid advances in e-commerce and Web 2.0 technologies have greatly increased the impact of commercial
advertisements on the general public. As a key enabling technology, a multitude of recommender
systems exists which analyzes user features and browsing patterns to recommend appealing advertisements
to users. In this work, we seek to study the characteristics or attributes that characterize an effective
advertisement and recommend a useful set of features to aid the designing and production processes
of commercial advertisements. We analyze the temporal patterns from multimedia content of advertisement
videos including auditory, visual and textual components, and study their individual roles and
synergies in the success of an advertisement. The objective of this work is then to measure the effectiveness
of an advertisement, and to recommend a useful set of features to advertisement designers to make
it more successful and approachable to users. Our proposed framework employs the signal processing
technique of cross modality feature learning where data streams from different components are
employed to train separate neural network models and are then fused together to learn a shared representation.
Subsequently, a neural network model trained on this joint feature embedding representation is
utilized as a classifier to predict advertisement effectiveness. We validate our approach using
subjective ratings from a dedicated user study, the sentiment strength of online viewer comments,
and a viewer opinion metric of the ratio of the Likes and Views received by each advertisement from
an online platform.
