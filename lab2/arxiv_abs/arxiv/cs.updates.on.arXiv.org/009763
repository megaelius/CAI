The capacity of additive Gaussian noise (AGN) channels with feedback, when the noise is described
by, stable and unstable, autoregressive models, is characterized, under the condition that, channel
input feedback strategies are time-invariant and induce asymptotic stationarity, and ergodicity
of the channel output process. This condition is more relaxed than imposing stationarity or asymptotic
stationarity of the joint input and output process, as done in [1]. Based on this characterization,
new closed form capacity formulas, and lower bounds are derived, for the stable and unstable AR$(c)$
noise, $V_t=cV_{t-1}+ W_t, V_0=v_0, t=1, \ldots, n$, where $c\in (-\infty,\infty)$, $W_t, t=1,\ldots,
n$, is a zero mean, variance $K_W$, independent Gaussian sequence, independent of $V_0$. Our capacity
formulas are fundamentally different from existing formulas found in the literature. The new formulas
illustrate multiple regimes of capacity, as a function of the parameters $(c,K_W,\kappa)$, where
$\kappa$ is the total average power allocated to the transmitter. In particular, 1) feedback increases
capacity for the regime, $c^2 \in (1, \infty),$ for $\kappa > \frac{K_W}{\big(c^2-1\big)^2}$,
2) feedback does not increase capacity for the regime $c^2 \in (1, \infty)$, for $\kappa \leq \frac{K_W}{\big(c^2-1\big)^2}$,
and 3) feedback does not increase capacity for the regime $c \in [-1,1]$, for $ \kappa \in [0,\infty)$.
We show that our disagreement with [1] is mainly attributed to the use of necessary and sufficient
conditions for convergence of generalized difference Riccati equations (DREs) to analogous generalized
algebraic Riccati equations (AREs), of Gaussian estimation problems, known as detectability
and stabilizability conditions, to ensure asymptotic stationarity and ergodicity of the channel
output process.
