Event-based collections are often started with a web search, but the search results you find on Day
1 may not be the same as those you find on Day 7. In this paper, we consider collections that originate
from extracting URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).
Specifically, we seek to provide insight about the retrievability of URIs of news stories found
on Google, and to answer two main questions: first, can one "refind" the same URI of a news story (for
the same query) from Google after a given time? Second, what is the probability of finding a story
on Google over a given period of time? To answer these questions, we issued seven queries to Google
every day for over seven months (2017-05-25 to 2018-01-12) and collected links from the first five
SERPs to generate seven collections for each query. The queries represent public interest stories:
"healthcare bill," "manchester bombing," "london terrorism," "trump russia," "travel ban,"
"hurricane harvey," and "hurricane irma." We tracked each URI in all collections over time to estimate
the discoverability of URIs from the first five SERPs. Our results showed that the daily average
rate at which stories were replaced on the default Google SERP ranged from 0.21 -0.54, and a weekly
rate of 0.39 - 0.79, suggesting the fast replacement of older stories by newer stories. The probability
of finding the same URI of a news story after one day from the initial appearance on the SERP ranged
from 0.34 - 0.44. After a week, the probability of finding the same news stories diminishes rapidly
to 0.01 - 0.11. Our findings suggest that due to the difficulty in retrieving the URIs of news stories
from Google, collection building that originates from search engines should begin as soon as possible
in order to capture the first stages of events, and should persist in order to capture the evolution
of the events...
