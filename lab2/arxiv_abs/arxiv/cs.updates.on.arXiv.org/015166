In this paper, we revisit the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem and its robust version, MEB with
outliers, in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. Though the problem has been extensively studied
before, most of the existing algorithms need at least linear time (in the number of input points $n$
and the dimensionality $d$) to achieve a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. Motivated by some recent
developments on beyond worst-case analysis, we introduce the notion of stability for MEB (with
outliers), which is natural and easy to understand. Roughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable,
if the radius of the resulting ball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction
of the input points. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling algorithms for computing
approximate MEB with sample complexities independent of the number of input points $n$. In particular,
the second algorithm has the sample complexity even independent of the dimensionality $d$. Further,
we extend the idea to achieve a sub-linear time approximation algorithm for the MEB with outliers
problem. Note that most existing sub-linear time algorithms for the problems of MEB and MEB with
outliers usually result in bi-criteria approximations, where the "bi-criteria" means that the
solution has to allow the approximations on the radius and the number of covered points. Differently,
all the algorithms proposed in this paper yield single-criterion approximations (with respect
to radius). We expect that our proposed notion of stability and techniques will be applicable to
design sub-linear time algorithms for other optimization problems.
