Nowadays, all major web browsers have a private browsing mode. However, the mode's benefits and
limitations are not particularly understood. Through the use of survey studies, prior work has
found that most users are either unaware of private browsing or do not use it. Further, those who do
use private browsing generally have misconceptions about what protection it provides. However,
prior work has not investigated why users misunderstand the benefits and limitations of private
browsing. In this work, we do so by designing and conducting a two-part user study with 20 demographically-diverse
participants: (1) a qualitative, interview-based study to explore users' mental models of private
browsing and its security goals; (2) a participatory design study to investigate whether existing
browser disclosures, the in-browser explanations of private browsing mode, communicate the security
goals of private browsing to users. We asked our participants to critique the browser disclosures
of three web browsers: Brave, Firefox, and Google Chrome, and then design new ones. We find that most
participants had incorrect mental models of private browsing, influencing their understanding
and usage of private browsing mode. Further, we find that existing browser disclosures are not only
vague, but also misleading. None of the three studied browser disclosures communicates or explains
the primary security goal of private browsing. Drawing from the results of our user study, we distill
a set of design recommendations that we encourage browser designers to implement and test, in order
to design more effective browser disclosures.
