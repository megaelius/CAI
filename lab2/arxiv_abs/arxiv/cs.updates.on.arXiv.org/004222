Data storage systems and their availability play a crucial role in contemporary datacenters. Despite
using mechanisms such as automatic fail-over in datacenters, the role of human agents and consequently
their destructive errors is inevitable. Due to very large number of disk drives used in exascale
datacenters and their high failure rates, the disk subsystem in storage systems has become a major
source of Data Unavailability (DU) and Data Loss (DL) initiated by human errors. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of Incorrect Disk Replacement Service (IDRS) on the availability and reliability
of data storage systems. To this end, we analyze the consequences of IDRS in a disk array, and conduct
Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate DU and DL during mission time. The proposed modeling framework
can cope with a) different storage array configurations and b) Data Object Survivability (DOS),
representing the effect of system level redundancies such as remote backups and mirrors. In the
proposed framework, the model parameters are obtained from industrial and scientific reports
alongside field data which have been extracted from a datacenter operating with 70 storage racks.
The results show that ignoring the impact of IDRS leads to unavailability underestimation by up
to three orders of magnitude. Moreover, our study suggests that by considering the effect of human
errors, the conventional beliefs about the dependability of different Redundant Array of Independent
Disks (RAID) mechanisms should be revised. The results show that RAID1 can result in lower availability
compared to RAID5 in the presence of human errors. The results also show that employing automatic
fail-over policy (using hot spare disks) can reduce the drastic impacts of human errors by two orders
of magnitude.
