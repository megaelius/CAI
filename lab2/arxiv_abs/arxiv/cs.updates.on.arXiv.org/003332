Coin-flipping is a cryptographic task in which two physically separated, mistrustful parties
wish to generate a fair coin-flip by communicating with each other. Chailloux and Kerenidis (2009)
designed quantum protocols that guarantee coin-flips with near optimal bias. The probability
of any outcome in these protocols is provably at most $1/\sqrt{2} + \delta$ for any given $\delta
> 0$. However, no explicit description of these protocols is known, and the number of rounds in the
protocols tends to infinity as $\delta$ goes to 0. In fact, the smallest bias achieved by known explicit
protocols is $1/4$ (Ambainis, 2001). We take a computational optimization approach, based mostly
on convex optimization, to the search for simple and explicit quantum strong coin-flipping protocols.
We present a search algorithm to identify protocols with low bias within a natural class, protocols
based on bit-commitment (Nayak and Shor, 2003) restricting to commitment states used by Mochon
(2005). An analysis of the resulting protocols via semidefinite programs (SDPs) unveils a simple
structure. For example, we show that the SDPs reduce to second-order cone programs. We devise novel
cheating strategies in the protocol by restricting the semidefinite programs and use the strategies
to prune the search. The techniques we develop enable a computational search for protocols given
by a mesh over the parameter space. The protocols have up to six rounds of communication, with messages
of varying dimension and include the best known explicit protocol (with bias 1/4). We conduct two
kinds of search: one for protocols with bias below 0.2499, and one for protocols in the neighbourhood
of protocols with bias 1/4. Neither of these searches yields better bias. Based on the mathematical
ideas behind the search algorithm, we prove a lower bound on the bias of a class of four-round protocols.
