Underwater images often have severe quality degradation and distortion due to light absorption
and scattering in the water medium. A hazed image formation model is widely used to restore the image
quality. It depends on two optical parameters: the background light and the transmission map. Underwater
images can also be enhanced by color and contrast correction from the perspective of image processing.
In this paper, we propose an effective underwater image enhancement method for underwater images
in composition of underwater image restoration and color correction. Firstly, a manually annotated
background lights (MABLs) database is developed. With reference to the relationship between MABLs
and the histogram distributions of various underwater images, robust statistical models of BLs
estimation are provided. Next, the TM of R channel is roughly estimated based on the new underwater
dark channel prior via the statistic of clear and high resolution underwater images, then a scene
depth map based on the underwater light attenuation prior and an adjusted reversed saturation map
are applied to compensate and modify the coarse TM of R channel. Next, TMs of G-B channels are estimated
based on the difference of attenuation ratios between R channel and G-B channels. Finally, to improve
the color and contrast of the restored image with a natural appearance, a variation of white balance
is introduced as post-processing. In order to guide the priority of underwater image enhancement,
sufficient evaluations are conducted to discuss the impacts of the key parameters including BL
and TM, and the importance of the color correction. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods
demonstrate that our proposed underwater image enhancement method can achieve higher accuracy
of estimated BLs, less computation time, more superior performance, and more valuable information
retention.
