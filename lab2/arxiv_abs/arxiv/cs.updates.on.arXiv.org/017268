Currently, most image quality assessment (IQA) models are supervised by the MAE or MSE loss with
empirically slow convergence. It is well-known that normalization can facilitate fast convergence.
Therefore, we explore normalization in the design of loss functions for IQA. Specifically, we first
normalize the predicted quality scores and the corresponding subjective quality scores. Then,
the loss is defined based on the norm of the differences between these normalized values. The resulting
"Norm-in-Norm'' loss encourages the IQA model to make linear predictions with respect to subjective
quality scores. After training, the least squares regression is applied to determine the linear
mapping from the predicted quality to the subjective quality. It is shown that the new loss is closely
connected with two common IQA performance criteria (PLCC and RMSE). Through theoretical analysis,
it is proved that the embedded normalization makes the gradients of the loss function more stable
and more predictable, which is conducive to the faster convergence of the IQA model. Furthermore,
to experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss, it is applied to solve a challenging
problem: quality assessment of in-the-wild images. Experiments on two relevant datasets (KonIQ-10k
and CLIVE) show that, compared to MAE or MSE loss, the new loss enables the IQA model to converge about
10 times faster and the final model achieves better performance. The proposed model also achieves
state-of-the-art prediction performance on this challenging problem. For reproducible scientific
