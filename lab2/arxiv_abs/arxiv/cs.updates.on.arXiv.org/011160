Machine learning has recently been widely adopted to address the managerial decision making problems,
in which the decision maker needs to be able to interpret the contributions of individual attributes
in an explicit form. However, there is a trade-off between performance and interpretability. Full
complexity models are non-traceable black-box, whereas classic interpretable models are usually
simplified with lower accuracy. This trade-off limits the application of state-of-the-art machine
learning models in management problems, which requires high prediction performance, as well as
the understanding of individual attributes' contributions to the model outcome. Multiple criteria
decision aiding (MCDA) is a family of analytic approaches to depicting the rationale of human decision.
It is also limited by strong assumptions. To meet the decision maker's demand for more interpretable
machine learning models, we propose a novel hybrid method, namely Neural Network-based Multiple
Criteria Decision Aiding, which combines an additive value model and a fully-connected multilayer
perceptron (MLP) to achieve good performance while capturing the explicit relationships between
individual attributes and the prediction. NN-MCDA has a linear component to characterize such
relationships through providing explicit marginal value functions, and a nonlinear component
to capture the implicit high-order interactions between attributes and their complex nonlinear
transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NN-MCDA with extensive simulation studies
and three real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to enhance
the interpretability of machine learning models with MCDA techniques. The proposed framework
also sheds light on how to use machine learning techniques to free MCDA from strong assumptions.
