Information security awareness (ISA) is a practice focused on the set of skills, which help a user
successfully mitigate a social engineering attack. Previous studies have presented various methods
for evaluating the ISA of both PC and mobile users. These methods rely primarily on subjective data
sources such as interviews, surveys, and questionnaires that are influenced by human interpretation
and sincerity. Furthermore, previous methods for evaluating ISA did not address the differences
between classes of social engineering attacks. In this paper, we present a novel framework designed
for evaluating the ISA of smartphone users to specific social engineering attack classes. In addition
to questionnaires, the proposed framework utilizes objective data sources: a mobile agent and
a network traffic monitor; both of which are used to analyze the actual behavior of users. We empirically
evaluated the ISA scores assessed from the three data sources (namely, the questionnaires, mobile
agent, and network traffic monitor) by conducting a long-term user study involving 162 smartphone
users. All participants were exposed to four different security challenges that resemble real-life
social engineering attacks. These challenges were used to assess the ability of the proposed framework
to derive a relevant ISA score. The results of our experiment show that: (1) the self-reported behavior
of the users differs significantly from their actual behavior; and (2) ISA scores derived from data
collected by the mobile agent or the network traffic monitor are highly correlated with the users'
success in mitigating social engineering attacks.
