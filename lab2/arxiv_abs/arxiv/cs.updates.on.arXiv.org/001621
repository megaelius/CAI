Pok\'emon Go, a location-based game that uses augmented reality techniques, received unprecedented
media coverage due to claims that it allowed for greater access to public spaces, increasing the
number of people out on the streets, and generally improving health, social, and security indices.
However, the true impact of Pok\'emon Go on people's mobility patterns in a city is still largely
unknown. In this paper, we perform a natural experiment using data from mobile phone networks to
evaluate the effect of Pok\'emon Go on the pulse of a big city: Santiago, capital of Chile. We found
significant effects of the game on the floating population of Santiago compared to movement prior
to the game's release in August 2016: in the following week, up to 13.8\% more people spent time outside
at certain times of the day, even if they do not seem to go out of their usual way. These effects were
found by performing regressions using count models over the states of the cellphone network during
each day under study. The models used controlled for land use, daily patterns, and points of interest
in the city. Our results indicate that, on business days, there are more people on the street at commuting
times, meaning that people did not change their daily routines but slightly adapted them to play
the game. Conversely, on Saturday and Sunday night, people indeed went out to play, but favored places
close to where they live. Even if the statistical effects of the game do not reflect the massive change
in mobility behavior portrayed by the media, at least in terms of expanse, they do show how "the street"
may become a new place of leisure. This change should have an impact on long-term infrastructure
investment by city officials, and on the drafting of public policies aimed at stimulating pedestrian
traffic.
