As the 5G communications technology is developing, vehicular communications that require high
reliability, low latency, and massive connectivity are getting increasing interests from academia
and industry. Due to the developed technologies, vehicular communications is not only limited
to vehicle components in the forms of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I) network, but also extended to connect with other users such as pedestrians and cellular user.
Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) is the conventional vehicular communication standard
for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). More recently, 3GPP introduced the Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything
(C-V2X) which arises as a competitor to DSRC. Meanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to consider deploying Unlicensed National
Information Infrastructure (U-NII) devices in the ITS band with two interference mitigation approaches:
Detect and Vacate (DAV) and Re-channelization (Re-CH). With multiple standard options and interference
mitigation approaches, numerous regulatory taxonomies can be identified and relevant technical
challenges are issued. However, these challenges are much broader than the current and future regulatory
taxonomies pursued by the different countries. Because of different plans, the technical and regulatory
challenges vary. This paper presents a literature survey about the technical challenges, the current
and future ITS band usage plans for U.S., Europe, China, Korea, and Japan, and the major research
testbeds and plans. This survey shows that the most likely deployment taxonomies are (1) DSRC, C-V2X,
Wi-Fi with Re-CH, (2) DSRC and C-V2X with interoperation, (3) C-V2X only, whereas the most difficult
technical challenge is the interoperability between the Wi-Fi-like DSRC and 4G LTE-like C-V2X.
