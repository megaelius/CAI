Unsupervised change detection techniques are generally constrained to two multi-band optical
images acquired at different times through sensors sharing the same spatial and spectral resolution.
This scenario is suitable for a straight comparison of homologous pixels such as pixel-wise differencing.
However, in some specific cases such as emergency situations, the only available images may be those
acquired through different kinds of sensors with different resolutions. Recently some change
detection techniques dealing with images with different spatial and spectral resolutions, have
been proposed. Nevertheless, they are focused on a specific scenario where one image has a high spatial
and low spectral resolution while the other has a low spatial and high spectral resolution. This
paper addresses the problem of detecting changes between any two multi-band optical images disregarding
their spatial and spectral resolution disparities. We propose a method that effectively uses the
available information by modeling the two observed images as spatially and spectrally degraded
versions of two (unobserved) latent images characterized by the same high spatial and high spectral
resolutions. Covering the same scene, the latent images are expected to be globally similar except
for possible changes in spatially sparse locations. Thus, the change detection task is envisioned
through a robust fusion task which enforces the differences between the estimated latent images
to be spatially sparse. We show that this robust fusion can be formulated as an inverse problem which
is iteratively solved using an alternate minimization strategy. The proposed framework is implemented
for an exhaustive list of applicative scenarios and applied to real multi-band optical images.
A comparison with state-of-the-art change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the proposed
robust fusion-based strategy.
