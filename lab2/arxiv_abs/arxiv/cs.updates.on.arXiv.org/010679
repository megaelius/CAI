PURPOSE: To apply deep CNN to the segmentation task in myocardial arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion
imaging and to develop methods that measure uncertainty and that adapt the CNN model to a specific
false positive vs. false negative tradeoff. METHODS: The Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) U-Net was trained
on data from 22 subjects and tested on data from 6 heart transplant recipients. Manual segmentation
and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF) were available for comparison. We consider two global
uncertainty measures, named Dice Uncertainty and MCD Uncertainty, which were calculated with
and without the use of manual segmentation, respectively. Tversky loss function with a hyperparameter
$\beta$ was used to adapt the model to a specific false positive vs. false negative tradeoff. RESULTS:
The MCD U-Net achieved Dice coefficient of mean(std) = 0.91(0.04) on the test set. MBF measured using
automatic segmentations was highly correlated to that measured using the manual segmentation
($R^2$ = 0.96). Dice Uncertainty and MCD Uncertainty were in good agreement ($R^2$ = 0.64). As $\beta$
increased, the false positive rate systematically decreased and false negative rate systematically
increased. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the feasibility of deep CNN for automatic segmentation
of myocardial ASL, with good accuracy. We also introduce two simple methods for assessing model
uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to adapt the CNN model to a specific false positive
vs. false negative tradeoff. These findings are directly relevant to automatic segmentation in
quantitative cardiac MRI and are broadly applicable to automatic segmentation problems in diagnostic
imaging.
