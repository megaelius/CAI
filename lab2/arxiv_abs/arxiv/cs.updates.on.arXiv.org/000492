Intersection graphs of geometric objects have been extensively studied, both due to their interesting
structure and their numerous applications; prominent examples include interval graphs and permutation
graphs. In this paper we study a natural graph class that generalizes both interval and permutation
graphs, namely \emph{simple-triangle} graphs. Simple-triangle graphs - also known as \emph{PI}
graphs (for Point-Interval) - are the intersection graphs of triangles that are defined by a point
on a line $L_{1}$ and an interval on a parallel line $L_{2}$. They lie naturally between permutation
and trapezoid graphs, which are the intersection graphs of line segments between $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$
and of trapezoids between $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, respectively. Although various efficient recognition
algorithms for permutation and trapezoid graphs are well known to exist, the recognition of simple-triangle
graphs has remained an open problem since their introduction by Corneil and Kamula three decades
ago. In this paper we resolve this problem by proving that simple-triangle graphs can be recognized
in polynomial time. As a consequence, our algorithm also solves a longstanding open problem in the
area of partial orders, namely the recognition of \emph{linear-interval orders}, i.e. of partial
orders $P=P_{1}\cap P_{2}$, where $P_{1}$ is a linear order and $P_{2}$ is an interval order. This
is one of the first results on recognizing partial orders $P$ that are the intersection of orders
from two different classes $\mathcal{P}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{2}$. In complete contrast to
this, partial orders $P$ which are the intersection of orders from the same class $\mathcal{P}$
have been extensively investigated, and in most cases the complexity status of these recognition
problems has been already established.
