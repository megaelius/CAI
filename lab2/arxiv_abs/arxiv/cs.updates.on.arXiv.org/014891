Prolonged sedentary behavior is related to a number of risk factors for chronic diseases. Given
the high prevalence of sedentary behavior in daily life, light-weight solutions for behavior change
are needed to avoid detrimental health effects. The mobile app SedVis was developed based on the
Health Action Process Approach. The app provides personal mobility pattern visualization (for
both physical activity and sedentary behavior) and action planning for sedentary behavior change.
The primary aim of the study was to investigate the effect of mobility visualization on users' action
planning for changing their sedentary behavior. The secondary aim was to evaluate user engagement
with the visualization and user experience of the app. A three-week pilot study was conducted with
16 participants who had the motivation to reduce their sedentary behavior. The results showed that
the visualizations in SedVis had no statistically significant effect on the participants' action
planning. The intervention involving the visualizations and action planning in SedVis had a positive
effect on reducing participants' sedentary hours with weak evidence (mean -0.40, SD 0.63), while
the active control condition did not decrease sedentary time (mean 0.17, SD 1.65). The results also
suggested that the more frequently the users checked the app, the more they might reduce their sedentary
behavior; however, this finding did not reach statistical significance. The visualizations in
the app also led to higher user-perceived novelty. No participant complained about the interruption,
while some participants commented that making action plans every day was boring. Using a smartphone
app to collect mobility data and provide feedback in real-time using visualizations might be a promising
method to induce changes in sedentary behavior and might be more effective than action planning
alone.
