Predicting the collective motion of a group of pedestrians (a crowd) under the vehicle influence
is essential for the development of autonomous vehicles to deal with mixed urban scenarios where
interpersonal interaction and vehicle-crowd interaction (VCI) are significant. This usually
requires a model that can describe individual pedestrian motion under the influence of nearby pedestrians
and the vehicle. This study proposed two pedestrian trajectory datasets, CITR dataset and DUT dataset,
so that the pedestrian motion models can be further calibrated and verified, especially when vehicle
influence on pedestrians plays an important role. CITR dataset consists of experimentally designed
fundamental VCI scenarios (front, back, and lateral VCIs) and provides unique ID for each pedestrian,
which is suitable for exploring a specific aspect of VCI. DUT dataset gives two ordinary and natural
VCI scenarios in crowded university campus, which can be used for more general purpose VCI exploration.
The trajectories of pedestrians, as well as vehicles, were extracted by processing video frames
that come from a down-facing camera mounted on a hovering drone as the recording equipment. The final
trajectories of pedestrians and vehicles were refined by Kalman filters with linear point-mass
model and nonlinear bicycle model, respectively, in which xy-velocity of pedestrians and longitudinal
speed and orientation of vehicles were estimated. The statistics of the velocity magnitude distribution
demonstrated the validity of the proposed dataset. In total, there are approximate 340 pedestrian
trajectories in CITR dataset and 1793 pedestrian trajectories in DUT dataset. The dataset is available
at GitHub.
