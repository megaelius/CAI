Resolution over linear equations (introduced in [RT08]) emerged recently as an important object
of study. This refutation system, denoted Res(lin$_R$), operates with disjunction of linear equations
over a ring $R$. On the one hand, the system captures a natural "minimal" extension of resolution
in which efficient counting can be achieved; while on the other hand, as observed by, e.g., Krajicek
[Kra16] (cf. [IS14,KO18,GK17]), when considered over prime fields, and specifically $\mathbf{F}_2$,
super-polynomial lower bounds on Res(lin$_{\mathbf{F}_2}$) is a first step towards the long-standing
open problem of establishing constant-depth Frege with counting gates (AC$^0[2]$-Frege) lower
bounds. In this work we develop new lower bound techniques for resolution over linear equations
and extend existing ones to work over different rings. We obtain a host of new lower bounds, separations
and upper bounds, while calibrating the relative strength of different sub-systems. We first establish,
over fields of characteristic zero, exponential-size lower bounds against resolution over linear
equations refutations of instances with large coefficients. Specifically, we demonstrate that
the subset sum principle $\alpha_1 x_1 +\ldots +\alpha_n x_n = \beta$, for $\beta$ not in the image
of the linear form, requires refutations proportional to the size of the image. Moreover, for instances
with small coefficients, we separate the tree and dag-like versions of Res(lin$_{\mathbf{F}}$),
when $\mathbf{F}$ is of characteristic zero, by employing the notion of immunity from Alekhnovich-Razborov
[AR01], among other techniques. (Abstract continued in the full paper.)
