In recent years, with the growing number of online social networks, these networks have become one
of the best markets for advertising and commerce, so studying these networks is very important.
Forecasting new edges in online social networks can give us a better understanding of the growth
of these networks. There have been many studies of link prediction in the field of engineering and
humanities. Scientists attribute the existence of a new relationship between two individuals
for two reasons: 1) Proximity to the graph (structure) 2) Similar properties of the two individuals
(Homophile law). However, studying the impact of the two approaches working together to create
new edges remains an open problem. Similarity metrics can also be divided into two categories; Neighborhood-based
and path-based. So far, the above two theoretical approaches (proximity and homophile) have not
been found together in the neighborhood-based metrics. In this paper, we first attempt to provide
a solution to determine importance of the proximity to the graph and similar features in the connectivity
of the graphs. Then obtained weights are assigned to both proximity and homophile. Then the best
similarity metric in each approach are obtained. Finally, the selected metric of homophily similarity
and structural similarity are combined with the obtained weights. The results of this study were
evaluated on two datasets; Zanjan University Graduate School of Social Sciences and Pokec online
Social Network. The first data set was collected for this study and then the questionnaires and data
collection methods were filled out. Since this dataset is one of the few Iranian datasets that has
been compiled with its users' specifications, it can be of great value. In this paper, we have been
able to increase the accuracy of Neighborhood-based similarity metric by using two proximity in
graph and homophily approaches.
