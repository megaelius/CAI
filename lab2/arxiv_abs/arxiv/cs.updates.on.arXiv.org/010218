Music has been one of the strongest forms of cultural expression and identity for thousands of years
and has evolved into a strongly collaborative artistic domain. While the emergence of success in
music has been studied at large, the link between individual success and collaboration has not yet
been fully uncovered. Here we aim to fill this gap by analyzing longitudinal data on the co-releasing
and mentoring patterns of tens of thousands of electronic music artists, the most popular of them
appearing in the annual Top 100 ranking of the DJ Magazine. We find that while this ranking list of
popularity publishes the Top 100 names, only the top 20 is relatively stable in time, showcasing
a lock-in effect on the stars of electronic music. Based on the temporal co-release network of Top
100 musicians, we uncover a diverse community structure characterizing the electronic music industry.
These groups of artists are temporally segregated, formed one after the other around leading musicians,
and represent slight changes in music genres. We show that a major building force behind such communities
is mentorship: around half of the musicians entering the Top 100 have been mentored by current leading
figures before they entered the Top 100. We also find that the mentees are unlikely to break into the
top 20, yet have much higher expected best ranks than those who were not mentored. This implies that
mentorship helps rising talents, but becoming an all-time star requires more. Our results provide
insights into the intertwined roles of success and collaboration in electronic music, highlighting
the mechanisms shaping the formation and landscape of artistic elites in electronic music.
