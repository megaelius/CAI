We consider the problem of entanglement-assisted one-shot classical communication. In the zero-error
regime, entanglement can increase the one-shot zero-error capacity of a family of classical channels
following the strategy of Cubitt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 230503 (2010). This strategy uses
the Kochen-Specker theorem which is applicable only to projective measurements. As such, in the
regime of noisy states and/or measurements, this strategy cannot increase the capacity. To accommodate
generically noisy situations, we examine the one-shot success probability of sending a fixed number
of classical messages. We show that preparation contextuality powers the quantum advantage in
this task, increasing the one-shot success probability beyond its classical maximum. Our treatment
extends beyond Cubitt et al. and includes, for example, the experimentally implemented protocol
of Prevedel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 110505 (2011). We then show a mapping between this communication
task and a corresponding nonlocal game. This mapping generalizes the connection with pseudotelepathy
games previously noted in the zero-error case. Finally, after motivating a constraint we term context-independent
guessing, we show that contextuality witnessed by noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities
obtained in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 4, 219 (2020), is sufficient for enhancing the one-shot success
probability. This provides an operational meaning to these inequalities and the associated hypergraph
invariant, the weighted max-predictability, introduced in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 3, 184 (2019).
Our results show that the task of entanglement-assisted oneshot classical communication provides
a fertile ground to study the interplay of the Kochen-Specker theorem, Spekkens contextuality,
and Bell nonlocality.
