Despite marked progress over the past several decades, convective storm nowcasting remains a challenge
because most nowcasting systems are based on linear extrapolation of radar reflectivity without
much consideration for other meteorological fields. The variational Doppler radar analysis system
(VDRAS) is an advanced convective-scale analysis system capable of providing analysis of 3-D wind,
temperature, and humidity by assimilating Doppler radar observations. Although potentially
useful, it is still an open question as to how to use these fields to improve nowcasting. In this study,
we present results from our first attempt at developing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Box-based
nOWcasting (SBOW) method under the machine learning framework using VDRAS analysis data. The key
design points of SBOW are as follows: 1) The study domain is divided into many position-fixed small
boxes and the nowcasting problem is transformed into one question, i.e., will a radar echo > 35 dBZ
appear in a box in 30 minutes? 2) Box-based temporal and spatial features, which include time trends
and surrounding environmental information, are elaborately constructed, and 3) The box-based
constructed features are used to first train the SVM classifier, and then the trained classifier
is used to make predictions. Compared with complicated and expensive expert systems, the above
design of SBOW allows the system to be small, compact, straightforward, and easy to maintain and
expand at low cost. The experimental results show that, although no complicated tracking algorithm
is used, SBOW can predict the storm movement trend and storm growth with reasonable skill.
