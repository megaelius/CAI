Remote sensing image classification can be performed in many different ways to extract meaningful
features. One common approach is to perform edge detection. A second approach is to try and detect
whole shapes, given the fact that these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such
as object foreground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be combined.
This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively select threshold based features
to improve remote sensing image. Feature selection is an important combinatorial optimization
problem in the remote sensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve
three characteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection and reducing
storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics analysis helping to understand
the problem, and third to improve prediction accuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality.
The goal of this thresholding an image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation
of classification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of thresholding that takes
into account spatial variations in illumination of remote sensing image. We present a technique
for remote sensing based adaptive thresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input.
However, our solution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image. Additionally,
our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective algorithm to classify the image pixels.
This technique is suitable for preprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making
it a valuable tool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the classification
procedure.
