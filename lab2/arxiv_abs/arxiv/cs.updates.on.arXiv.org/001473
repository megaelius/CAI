The Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is a problem of computing a homomorphism ${\bf R}\to
{\bf \Gamma}$ between two relational structures, where ${\bf R}$ is defined over a domain $V$ and
${\bf \Gamma}$ is defined over a domain $D$. In fixed template CSPs, denoted $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$,
the right side structure ${\bf \Gamma}$ is fixed and the left side structure ${\bf R}$ is unconstrained.
In the last 2 decades it was impressively revealed that those templates ${\bf \Gamma}$ are tractable
that are preserved under certain polymorphisms $p_1, ..., p_k$. Moreover, the set of all homomorphisms
from ${\bf R}$ to ${\bf \Gamma}$ are preserved under the same $p_1, ..., p_k$. I.e. $p_1, ..., p_k$
not only guide us in the decision problem, but also define algebraic properties of the solutions
set. This view makes of interest the following formulation: given a prespecified finite set of algebras
${\mathcal B}$ whose domain is $D$, is it possible to present the solutions set of a CSP instance as
a subalgebra of ${\mathbb A}_1\times ... \times {\mathbb A}_{|V|}$ where ${\mathbb A}_i\in {\mathcal
B}$? We study this formulation and prove that the latter problem itself is an instance of a certain
fixed-template CSP, over another template ${\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal B}$. We prove that $CSP({\bf
\Gamma}^{\mathcal B})$ can be reduced to a certain fragment of $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$, under natural
assumptions on ${\mathcal B}$. We also study the conditions under which $CSP({\bf \Gamma})$ can
be reduced to $CSP({\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal B})$. Since the complexity of $CSP({\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal
B})$ is defined by $Pol({\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal B})$, we study the relationship between $Pol({\bf
\Gamma})$ and $Pol({\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal B})$. It turns out that if $\mathcal{B}$ is preserved
by some $p\in Pol({\bf \Gamma})$, then $p$ can be extended to a polymorphism of ${\bf \Gamma}^{\mathcal
B}$.
