Deep learning achieves state-of-the-art results in many areas. However recent works have shown
that deep networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations which slightly changes the input
but leads to incorrect prediction. Adversarial training is an effective way of improving the robustness
to the adversarial examples, typically formulated as a robust optimization problem for network
training. To solve it, previous works directly run gradient descent on the "adversarial loss",
i.e. replacing the input data with the corresponding adversaries. A major drawback of this approach
is the computational overhead of adversary generation, which is much larger than network updating
and leads to inconvenience in adversarial defense. To address this issue, we fully exploit structure
of deep neural networks and propose a novel strategy to decouple the adversary update with the gradient
back propagation. To achieve this goal, we follow the research line considering training deep neural
network as an optimal control problem. We formulate the robust optimization as a differential game.
This allows us to figure out the necessary conditions for optimality. In this way, we train the neural
network via solving the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP). The adversary is only coupled with
the first layer weight in PMP. It inspires us to split the adversary computation from the back propagation
gradient computation. As a result, our proposed YOPO (You Only Propagate Once) avoids forward and
backward the data too many times in one iteration, and restricts core descent directions computation
to the first layer of the network, thus speeding up every iteration significantly. For adversarial
example defense, our experiment shows that YOPO can achieve comparable defense accuracy using
around 1/5 GPU time of the original projected gradient descent training.
