The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one
another with minimal human intervention. It is one of the fastest developing fields in the history
of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. On the one hand, IoT play a crucial
role in enhancing several real-life smart applications that can improve life quality. On the other
hand, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in
the deployment of such systems introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures,
such as encryption, authentication, access control, network security and application security,
for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security
methods should be enhanced to secure the IoT system effectively. Machine learning and deep learning
(ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned
from laboratory curiosity to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently,
ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating
secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this
work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML /DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security
methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats
are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related
to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present
the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and
challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can
serve as potential future research directions.
