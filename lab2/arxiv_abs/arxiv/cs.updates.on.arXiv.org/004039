Very important breakthroughs in data centric deep learning algorithms led to impressive performance
in transactional point applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Face Recognition,
or EKG classification. With all due appreciation, however, knowledge blind data only machine learning
algorithms have severe limitations for non-transactional AI applications, such as medical diagnosis
beyond the EKG results. Such applications require deeper and broader knowledge in their problem
solving capabilities, e.g. integrating anatomy and physiology knowledge with EKG results and
other patient findings. Following a review and illustrations of such limitations for several real
life AI applications, we point at ways to overcome them. The proposed Wikipedia for Smart Machines
initiative aims at building repositories of software structures that represent humanity science
& technology knowledge in various parts of life; knowledge that we all learn in schools, universities
and during our professional life. Target readers for these repositories are smart machines; not
human. AI software developers will have these Reusable Knowledge structures readily available,
hence, the proposed name ReKopedia. Big Data is by now a mature technology, it is time to focus on Big
Knowledge. Some will be derived from data, some will be obtained from mankind gigantic repository
of knowledge. Wikipedia for smart machines along with the new Double Deep Learning approach offer
a paradigm for integrating datacentric deep learning algorithms with algorithms that leverage
deep knowledge, e.g. evidential reasoning and causality reasoning. For illustration, a project
is described to produce ReKopedia knowledge modules for medical diagnosis of about 1,000 disorders.
Data is important, but knowledge deep, basic, and commonsense is equally important.
