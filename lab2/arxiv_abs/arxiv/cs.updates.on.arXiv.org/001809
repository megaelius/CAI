We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct
the dynamics and generating mechanisms of dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations
based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory
of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled
interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected
in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation.
The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and
formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic
information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording
an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these
methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access
to the system's actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields
a suite of powerful parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery
of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness
principle and a system's (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static and to evolving
genetic regulatory networks. We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related
to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally
validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a system's dynamics
in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.
