Recommender systems are software tools used to generate and provide suggestions for items and other
entities to the users by exploiting various strategies. Hybrid recommender systems combine two
or more recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit from their complementary advantages.
This systematic literature review presents the state of the art in hybrid recommender systems of
the last decade. It is the first quantitative review work completely focused in hybrid recommenders.
We address the most relevant problems considered and present the associated data mining and recommendation
techniques used to overcome them. We also explore the hybridization classes each hybrid recommender
belongs to, the application domains, the evaluation process and proposed future research directions.
Based on our findings, most of the studies combine collaborative filtering with another technique
often in a weighted way. Also cold-start and data sparsity are the two traditional and top problems
being addressed in 23 and 22 studies each, while movies and movie datasets are still widely used by
most of the authors. As most of the studies are evaluated by comparisons with similar methods using
accuracy metrics, providing more credible and user oriented evaluations remains a typical challenge.
Besides this, newer challenges were also identified such as responding to the variation of user
context, evolving user tastes or providing cross-domain recommendations. Being a hot topic, hybrid
recommenders represent a good basis with which to respond accordingly by exploring newer opportunities
such as contextualizing recommendations, involving parallel hybrid algorithms, processing
larger datasets, etc.
