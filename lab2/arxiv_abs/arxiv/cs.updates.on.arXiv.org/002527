There is a growing literature on teenage and young adult users' attitudes toward and concerns about
online privacy, yet little is known about older adults and their unique experiences. As older adults
join the digital world in growing numbers, we need to gain a better understanding of how they experience
and navigate online privacy. This paper fills this research gap by examining 40 in-depth interviews
with older adults (65 and older) living in East York, Toronto. We found Westin's typology to be a useful
starting point for understanding privacy attitudes and concerns in this demographic. We expand
Westin's typology and distinguish five categories: fundamentalist, intense pragmatist, relaxed
pragmatist, marginally concerned, and cynical expert. We find that older adults are not a homogenous
group composed of privacy fundamentalists; rather, there is considerable variability in terms
of their privacy attitudes, with only 13 per cent being fundamentalists. We also identify a group
of cynical experts who believe that online privacy breaches are inevitable. A large majority of
older adults are marginally concerned, as they see their online participation as limited and harmless.
Older adults were also grouped as either intense or relaxed pragmatists. We find that some privacy
concerns are shared by older adults across several categories, the most common being spam, unauthorized
access to personal information, and information misuse. We discuss theoretical implications
based on the findings for our understanding of privacy in the context of older adults' digital lives
and discuss implications for offering training appropriate for enhancing privacy literacy in
this age group.
