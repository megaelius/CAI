Machine learning offers remarkable benefits for improving workplaces and working conditions
amongst others in the recycling industry. Here e.g. hand-sorting of medium value scrap is labor
intensive and requires experienced and skilled workers. On the one hand, they have to be highly concentrated
for making proper readings and analyses of the material, but on the other hand, this work is monotonous.
Therefore, a machine learning approach is proposed for a quick and reliable automated identification
of alloys in the recycling industry, while the mere scrap handling is regarded to be left in the hands
of the workers. To this end, a set of twelve tool and high-speed steels from the field were selected
to be identified by their spectrum induced by electric arcs. For data acquisition, the optical emission
spectrometer Thorlabs CCS 100 was used. Spectra have been post-processed to be fed into the supervised
machine learning algorithm. The development of the machine learning software is conducted according
to the steps of the VDI 2221 standard method. For programming Python 3 as well as the python-library
sklearn were used. By systematic parameter variation, the appropriate machine learning algorithm
was selected and validated. Subsequent validation steps showed that the automated identification
process using a machine learning approach and the optical emission spectrometry is applicable,
reaching a maximum F1 score of 96.9 %. This performance is as good as the performance of a highly trained
worker using visual grinding spark identification. The tests were based on a self-generated set
of 600 spectra per single alloy (7,200 spectra in total) which were produced using an industry workshop
device.
