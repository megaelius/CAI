Formation of a hierarchy within an organization is a natural way of optimizing the duties, responsibilities
and flow of information. Only for the smallest organizations the lack of the hierarchy is possible,
yet, if they grow, its appearance is inevitable. Most often, its existence results in a different
nature of the tasks and duties of its members located at different organizational levels. On the
other hand, employees often send dozens of emails each day, and by doing so, and also by being engaged
in other activities, they naturally form an informal social network where nodes are individuals
and edges are the actions linking them. At first, such a social network may seem distinct from the
organizational one. However, the analysis of this network may lead to reproducing the organizational
hierarchy of companies. This is due to the fact that that people holding a similar position in the
hierarchy can possibly share also a similar way of behaving and communicating attributed to their
role. The key concept of this work is to evaluate how well social network measures when combined with
other features gained from the feature engineering align with the classification of the members
of organizational social network. As a technique for answering the research question, machine
learning apparatus was employed. Here, for the classification task, Decision Tree and Random Forest
algorithms where used, as well as a simple collective classification algorithm, which is also proposed
in this paper. The used approach allowed to compare how traditional methods of machine learning
classification, while supported by social network analysis, performed in comparison to a typical
graph algorithm.
