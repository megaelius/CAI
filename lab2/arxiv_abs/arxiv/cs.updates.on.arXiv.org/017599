We give the first ANN-data structure for time series under the continuous Fr\'echet distance, where
ANN stands for approximate near neighbor. Given a parameter $\epsilon \in (0,1]$, the data structure
can be used to preprocess $n$ curves in Euclidean $\mathbb{R}$ (aka time series), each of complexity
$m$, to answer queries with a curve of complexity $k$ by either returning a curve that lies within
Fr\'echet distance $2+\epsilon$, or answering that there exists no curve in the input within distance
$1$. In both cases, the answer is correct. Our data structure uses space in $n\cdot \mathcal{O}\left({\epsilon^{-1}}\right)^{k}
+ \mathcal{O}(nm)$ and query time in $\mathcal{O}\left(k\right)$. The data structure is therefore
especially useful in the asymmetric setting, where $k \ll m$. This is well-motivated for the continuous
Fr\'echet distance as the distance measure takes into account the interior points along the edges
of the curve. We show that the approximation factor achieved by our data structure is optimal in the
cell-probe model of computation. Concretely, we show that for any data structure which achieves
an approximation factor less than $2$ and which supports curves of arclength at most $L$, uses a word
size bounded by $O(L^{1-\epsilon})$ for some constant $\epsilon>0$, and answers the query using
only a constant number of probes, the number of words used to store the data structure must be at least
$L^{\Omega(k)}$. Our data structure uses only a constant number of probes per query and does not
have any dependency on $L$. We apply similar techniques for proving cell-probe lower bounds for
the discrete Fr\'echet distance matching known upper bounds.
