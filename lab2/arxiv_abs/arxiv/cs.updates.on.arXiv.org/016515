Context: Several researchers have reported their experiences in applying secondary studies (Systematic
Literature Reviews - SLRs and Systematic Mappings - SMs) in Software Engineering (SE). However,
there is still a lack of studies discussing the value of performing secondary studies in an academic
context. Goal: The main goal of this study is to provide an overview on the use of secondary studies
in an academic context. Method: Two empirical research methods were used. Initially, we conducted
an SM to identify the available and relevant studies on the use of secondary studies as a research
methodology for conducting SE research projects. Secondly, a survey was performed with 64 SE researchers
to identify their perception related to the value of performing secondary studies to support their
research projects. Results: Our results show benefits of using secondary studies in the academic
context, such as, providing an overview of the literature as well as identifying relevant research
literature on a research area enabling to find reasons to explain why a research project should be
approved for a grant and/or supporting decisions made in a research project. Difficulties faced
by SE graduate students with secondary studies are that they tend to be conducted by a team and it demands
more effort than a traditional review. Conclusions: Secondary studies are valuable to graduate
students. They should consider conducting a secondary study for their research project due to the
benefits and contributions provided to develop the overall project. However, the advice of an experienced
supervisor is essential to avoid bias. In addition, the acquisition of skills can increase student's
motivation to pursue their research projects and prepare them for both academic or industrial careers.
