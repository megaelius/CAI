Medication non-adherence is a widespread problem affecting over 50% of people who have chronic
illness and need chronic treatment. Non-adherence exacerbates health risks and drives significant
increases in treatment costs. In order to address these challenges, the importance of predicting
patients' adherence has been recognised. In other words, it is important to improve the efficiency
of interventions of the current healthcare system by prioritizing resources to the patients who
are most likely to be non-adherent. Our objective in this work is to make predictions regarding individual
patients' behaviour in terms of taking their medication on time during their next scheduled medication
opportunity. We do this by leveraging a number of machine learning models. In particular, we demonstrate
the use of a connected IoT device; a "Smart Sharps Bin", invented by HealthBeacon Ltd.; to monitor
and track injection disposal of patients in their home environment. Using extensive data collected
from these devices, five machine learning models, namely Extra Trees Classifier, Random Forest,
XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and Multilayer Perception were trained and evaluated on a large dataset
comprising 165,223 historic injection disposal records collected from 5,915 HealthBeacon units
over the course of 3 years. The testing work was conducted on real-time data generated by the smart
device over a time period after the model training was complete, i.e. true future data. The proposed
machine learning approach demonstrated very good predictive performance exhibiting an Area Under
the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.86.
