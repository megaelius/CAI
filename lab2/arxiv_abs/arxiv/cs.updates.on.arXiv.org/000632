Can noncooperative behaviour of merchants lead to a market allocation that prima facie seems anticompetitive?
We introduce a model in which service providers aim at optimizing the number of customers who use
their services, while customers aim at choosing service providers with minimal customer load.
Each service provider chooses between a variety of levels of service, and as long as it does not lose
customers, aims at minimizing its level of service; the minimum level of service required to satisfy
a customer varies across customers. We consider a two-stage competition, in the first stage of which
the service providers select their levels of service, and in the second stage --- customers choose
between the service providers. In the two-stage game, we show that the competition among the service
providers possesses a unique Nash equilibrium, which is moreover super strong; we also show that
all sequential better-response dynamics of service providers reach this equilibrium, with best-response
dynamics doing so surprisingly fast. If service providers choose their levels of service according
to this equilibrium, then the unique Nash equilibrium among customers in the second phase is essentially
an allocation (i.e. split) of the market between the service providers, based on the customers'
minimum acceptable quality of service; moreover, each service provider's chosen level of service
is the lowest acceptable by the entirety of the market share allocated to it. Our results show that
this seemingly-cooperative allocation of the market arises as the unique and highly-robust outcome
of noncooperative, even myopic, service-provider behaviour. The results of this paper are applicable
to a variety of scenarios, such as the competition among ISPs, and shed a surprising light on aspects
of location theory, such as the formation and structure of a city's central business district.
