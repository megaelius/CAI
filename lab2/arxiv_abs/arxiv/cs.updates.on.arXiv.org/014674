With the increasing demand for millions of COVID-19 screenings, Computed Tomography (CT) based
test has emerged as a promising alternative to the gold standard RT-PCR test. However, it is primarily
provided in hospital setting due to the need for expensive equipment and experienced radiologists.
An accurate, rapid yet inexpensive test that is suitable for COVID-19 population screenings at
mobile, urgent and primary care clinics is urgently needed. We present COVID-MobileXpert: a lightweight
deep neural network (DNN) based mobile app that can use noisy snapshots of chest X-ray (CXR) for point-of-care
COVID-19 screening. We design and implement a novel three-player knowledge transfer and distillation
(KTD) framework including a pre-trained attending physician (AP) network that extracts CXR imaging
features from large scale of lung disease CXR images, a fine-tuned resident fellow (RF) network
that learns the essential CXR imaging features to discriminate COVID-19 from pneumonia and/or
normal cases using a small amount of COVID-19 cases, and a trained lightweight medical student (MS)
network that performs on-device COVID-19 screening. To accommodate the need for screening using
noisy snapshots of CXR images, we employ novel loss functions and training schemes for the MS network
to learn the robust imaging features for accurate on-device COVID-19 screening. We demonstrate
the strong potential of COVID-MobileXpert for rapid deployment via extensive experiments with
diverse MS network architecture, CXR imaging quality, and tuning parameter settings. The source
code of cloud and mobile based models are available from https://github.com/xinli0928/COVID-Xray.
