Accurately predicting future behaviors of surrounding vehicles is an essential capability for
autonomous vehicles in order to plan safe and feasible trajectories. The behaviors of others, however,
are full of uncertainties. Both rational and irrational behaviors exist, and the autonomous vehicles
need to be aware of this in their prediction module. The prediction module is also expected to generate
reasonable results in the presence of unseen and corner scenarios. Two types of prediction models
are typically used to solve the prediction problem: learning-based model and planning-based model.
Learning-based model utilizes real driving data to model the human behaviors. Depending on the
structure of the data, learning-based models can predict both rational and irrational behaviors.
But the balance between them cannot be customized, which creates challenges in generalizing the
prediction results. Planning-based model, on the other hand, usually assumes human as a rational
agent, i.e., it anticipates only rational behavior of human drivers. In this paper, a generic prediction
architecture is proposed to address various rationalities in human behavior. We leverage the advantages
from both learning-based and planning-based prediction models. The proposed approach is able
to predict continuous trajectories that well-reflect possible future situations of other drivers.
Moreover, the prediction performance remains stable under various unseen driving scenarios.
A case study under a real-world roundabout scenario is provided to demonstrate the performance
and capability of the proposed prediction architecture.
