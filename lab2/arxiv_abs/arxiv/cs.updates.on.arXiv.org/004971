We address the problem of simulating an arbitrary binary interactive first-order Markovian protocol
over a pair of binary symmetric channels with crossover probability $\varepsilon$. We are interested
in the achievable rates of reliable simulation, i.e., in characterizing the smallest possible
blowup in communications such that a vanishing error probability (in the protocol length) can be
attained. Whereas for general interactive protocols the output of each party may depend on all previous
outputs of its counterpart, in a (first-order) Markovian protocol this dependence is limited to
the last observed output only. Previous works in the field discuss broader families of protocols
but assess the achievable rates only at the limit where $\varepsilon\to0$. In this paper, we prove
that the one-way Shannon capacity, $1-h(\varepsilon)$, can be achieved for any binary first-order
Markovian protocol. This surprising result, is to the best of our knowledge, the first example in
which non-trivial interactive protocol can be simulated in the Shannon capacity. We give two capacity
achieving coding schemes, which both divide the protocol into independent blocks, and implement
vertical block coding. The first scheme is based on a random separation into blocks with variable
lengths. The second scheme is based on a deterministic separation into blocks, and efficiently
predicting their last transmission. The prediction can be regarded as a binary pointer jumping
game, for which we show that the final step can be calculated with $O(\log m)$ bits, where $m$ is the
number of rounds in the game. We conclude the work by discussing possible extensions of the result
to higher order models.
