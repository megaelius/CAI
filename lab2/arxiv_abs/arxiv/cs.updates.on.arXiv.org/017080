Knowledge tracing (KT) has recently been an active research area of computational pedagogy. The
task is to model students mastery level of knowledge based on their responses to the questions in
the past, as well as predict the probabilities that they correctly answer subsequent questions
in the future. A good KT model can not only make students timely aware of their knowledge states, but
also help teachers develop better personalized teaching plans for students. KT tasks were historically
solved using statistical modeling methods such as Bayesian inference and factor analysis, but
recent advances in deep learning have led to the successive proposals that leverage deep neural
networks, including long short-term memory networks, memory-augmented networks and self-attention
networks. While those deep models demonstrate superior performance over the traditional approaches,
they all neglect more or less the impact on knowledge states of the most recent questions answered
by students. The forgetting curve theory states that human memory retention declines over time,
therefore knowledge states should be mostly affected by the recent questions. Based on this observation,
we propose a Convolutional Knowledge Tracing (CKT) model in this paper. In addition to modeling
the long-term effect of the entire question-answer sequence, CKT also strengthens the short-term
effect of recent questions using 3D convolutions, thereby effectively modeling the forgetting
curve in the learning process. Extensive experiments show that CKT achieves the new state-of-the-art
in predicting students performance compared with existing models. Using CKT, we gain 1.55 and 2.03
improvements in terms of AUC over DKT and DKVMN respectively, on the ASSISTments2009 dataset. And
on the ASSISTments2015 dataset, the corresponding improvements are 1.01 and 1.96 respectively.
