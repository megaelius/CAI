This paper presents a small world networks generative model and a labeling algorithm for networks
generated by this model. In the context of routing messages in networks, labeling algorithms process
a network assigning labels, that are addresses, to the nodes. Our model is based on Kleinberg model,
generating a $2$-dimensional torus with additional random undirected long-range edges. The Kleinberg
routing algorithm can forward messages in these networks, but it needs the vertices labels, that
are positions in a $n\times n$ lattice, to make routing decisions. Finding these labels when they
are not known a priori is a problem of routing in small world networks and labeling algorithms are
possible solutions. The design of our labeling algorithm uses the approach of searching for induced
$4$-cycles to find the underlying torus. However, the generated graph may have $4$-cycles with
edges not in this torus. We show that the probability of these cycles appearing in a vertex is O$\left(\log^{-1}n\right)$.
This property allows the long-range edges removing through the detection of lattice patterns on
combinations of $4$-cycles, and the running of a breadth-first search in the resulting graph. Our
labeling algorithm labels almost all vertices in O$(|V|)$ expected time, where $|V|=n^2$. We also
present a compact routing scheme, that is a combination of a preprocessing algorithm, that generates
sub-linear structures per vertex, and a routing algorithm, that uses these structures for routing
messages through paths with bounded length. Our preprocessing algorithm generates structures
with expected size of O$(\log n)$ bits per vertex in expected time O$(|V|)$. The Kleinberg routing
algorithm uses these structures, running in expected constant time in each vertex and performing
an expected number of forwards O$\left(\log^2 n\right)$.
