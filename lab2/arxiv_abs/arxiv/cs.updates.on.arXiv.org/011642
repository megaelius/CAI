In distortion-based analysis of social choice rules over metric spaces, one assumes that all voters
and candidates are jointly embedded in a common metric space. Voters rank candidates by non-decreasing
distance. The mechanism, receiving only this ordinal (comparison) information, should select
a candidate approximately minimizing the sum of distances from all voters. It is known that while
the Copeland rule and related rules guarantee distortion at most 5, many other standard voting rules,
such as Plurality, Veto, or $k$-approval, have distortion growing unboundedly in the number $n$
of candidates. Plurality, Veto, or $k$-approval with small $k$ require less communication from
the voters than all deterministic social choice rules known to achieve constant distortion. This
motivates our study of the tradeoff between the distortion and the amount of communication in deterministic
social choice rules. We show that any one-round deterministic voting mechanism in which each voter
communicates only the candidates she ranks in a given set of $k$ positions must have distortion at
least $\frac{2n-k}{k}$; we give a mechanism achieving an upper bound of $O(n/k)$, which matches
the lower bound up to a constant. For more general communication-bounded voting mechanisms, in
which each voter communicates $b$ bits of information about her ranking, we show a slightly weaker
lower bound of $\Omega(n/b)$ on the distortion. For randomized mechanisms, it is known that Random
Dictatorship achieves expected distortion strictly smaller than 3, almost matching a lower bound
of $3-\frac{2}{n}$ for any randomized mechanism that only receives each voter's top choice. We
close this gap, by giving a simple randomized social choice rule which only uses each voter's first
choice, and achieves expected distortion $3-\frac{2}{n}$.
