We study an algorithm for approximating the multivariate independence polynomial $Z(\mathbf{z})$,
with negative and complex arguments, an object that has strong connections to combinatorics and
to statistical physics. In particular, the independence polynomial with negative arguments,
$Z(-\mathbf{p})$, determines the Shearer region, the maximal region of probabilities to which
the Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) can be extended (Shearer 1985). In statistical physics, complex zeros
of the independence polynomial relate to existence of phase transitions. Our main result is a deterministic
algorithm to compute approximately the independence polynomial in any root-free complex polydisc
centered at the origin. Our algorithm is essentially the same as Weitz's algorithm for positive
parameters up to the tree uniqueness threshold, and the core of our analysis is a novel multivariate
form of the correlation decay technique, which can handle non-uniform complex parameters. In particular,
in the univariate real setting our work implies that Weitz's algorithm works in an interval between
two critical points $(\lambda'_c(d), \lambda_c(d))$, and outside of this interval an approximation
of $Z(\mathbf{z})$ is known to be NP-hard. As an application, we give a sub-exponential time algorithm
for testing approximate membership in the Shearer region. We also give a new rounding based deterministic
algorithm for Shearer's lemma (an extension of the LLL), which, however, runs in sub-exponential
time. On the hardness side, we prove that evaluating $Z(\mathbf{z})$ at an arbitrary point in Shearer's
region, and testing membership in Shearer's region, are #P-hard problems. We also establish the
best possible dependence of the exponent of the run time of Weitz's correlation decay technique
in the negative regime on the distance to the boundary of the Shearer region.
