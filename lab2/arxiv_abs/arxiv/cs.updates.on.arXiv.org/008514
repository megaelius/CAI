Numerous methods for crafting adversarial examples were proposed recently with high attack success
rate. Most of the existing works normalize images into a continuous vector, domain firstly, and
then craft adversarial examples in the continuous vector space. However, "adversarial" examples
may become benign after de-normalizing them back into discrete integer domain, known as the discretization
problem. The discretization problem was mentioned in some work, but was despised and have received
relatively little attention. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of this discretization
problem. We theoretically analyzed 34 representative methods and empirically studied 20 representative
open source tools for crafting discretization images. Our findings reveal that almost all of existing
works suffer from the discretization problem and the problem is far more serious than we thought.
This suggests that the discretization problem should be taken into account when crafting adversarial
examples. As a first step towards addressing the discretization problem, we propose a black-box
attack method to encode the adversarial example searching problem as a derivative-free optimization
problem. Our method is able to craft "real'' adversarial images by derivative-free search on the
discrete integer domain. Experimental results show that our method achieves significantly higher
attack success rates on the discrete integer domain than most of the other tools, no matter white-box
or black-box. Moreover, our method is able to handle any model that is not differentiable and we successfully
break the winner of NIPS 17 competition on defense with a 95\% success rate.
