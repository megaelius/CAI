In the last decades, large datasets of fundus photographs have been collected in diabetic retinopathy
(DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these datasets were used to train automatic detectors
for DR and a few other frequent pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits
the adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions that ophthalmologists
currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The reason is that
standard deep learning requires too many examples of these conditions. However, this limitation
can be addressed with few-shot learning, a machine learning paradigm where a classifier has to generalize
to a new category not seen in training, given only a few examples of this category. This paper presents
a new few-shot learning framework that extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained
for frequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare condition detection.
It is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive photographs containing the same anomalies
as similar, even though these CNNs were trained to detect unrelated conditions. This observation
was based on the t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our probabilistic
model. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 screening examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network
show that 37 conditions, out of 41, can be detected with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than
0.8 (average AUC: 0.938). In particular, this framework significantly outperforms other frameworks
for detecting rare conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and Siamese networks,
another few-shot learning solution. We expect these richer predictions to trigger the adoption
of automated eye pathology screening, which will revolutionize clinical practice in ophthalmology.
