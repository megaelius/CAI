Privacy-preserving recommendations are recently gaining momentum, since the decentralized
user data is increasingly harder to collect, by recommendation service providers, due to the serious
concerns over user privacy and data security. This situation is further exacerbated by the strict
government regulations such as Europe's General Data Privacy Regulations(GDPR). Federated Learning(FL)
is a newly developed privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm to bridge data repositories
without compromising data security and privacy. Thus many federated recommendation(FedRec)
algorithms have been proposed to realize personalized privacy-preserving recommendations.
However, existing FedRec algorithms, mostly extended from traditional collaborative filtering(CF)
method, cannot address cold-start problem well. In addition, their performance overhead w.r.t.
model accuracy, trained in a federated setting, is often non-negligible comparing to centralized
recommendations. This paper studies this issue and presents FL-MV-DSSM, a generic content-based
federated multi-view recommendation framework that not only addresses the cold-start problem,
but also significantly boosts the recommendation performance by learning a federated model from
multiple data source for capturing richer user-level features. The new federated multi-view setting,
proposed by FL-MV-DSSM, opens new usage models and brings in new security challenges to FL in recommendation
scenarios. We prove the security guarantees of \xxx, and empirical evaluations on FL-MV-DSSM and
its variations with public datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. Our codes will be released
if this paper is accepted.
