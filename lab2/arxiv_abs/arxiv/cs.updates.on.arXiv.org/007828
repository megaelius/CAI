Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have recently become one of the most powerful tools for graph
analytics tasks in numerous applications, ranging from social networks and natural language processing
to bioinformatics and chemoinformatics, thanks to their ability to capture the complex relationships
between concepts. At present, the vast majority of GCNs use a neighborhood aggregation framework
to learn a continuous and compact vector, then performing a pooling operation to generalize graph
embedding for the classification task. These approaches have two disadvantages in the graph classification
task: (1)when only the largest sub-graph structure ($k$-hop neighbor) is used for neighborhood
aggregation, a large amount of early-stage information is lost during the graph convolution step;
(2) simple average/sum pooling or max pooling utilized, which loses the characteristics of each
node and the topology between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called, dual attention
graph convolutional networks (DAGCN) to address these problems. DAGCN automatically learns the
importance of neighbors at different hops using a novel attention graph convolution layer, and
then employs a second attention component, a self-attention pooling layer, to generalize the graph
representation from the various aspects of a matrix graph embedding. The dual attention network
is trained in an end-to-end manner for the graph classification task. We compare our model with state-of-the-art
graph kernels and other deep learning methods. The experimental results show that our framework
not only outperforms other baselines but also achieves a better rate of convergence.
