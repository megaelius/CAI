Objective: Mining the data contained within Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can potentially
generate a greater understanding of medication effects in the real world, complementing what we
know from Randomised control trials (RCTs). We Propose a text mining approach to detect adverse
events and medication episodes from the clinical text to enhance our understanding of adverse effects
related to Clozapine, the most effective antipsychotic drug for the management of treatment-resistant
schizophrenia, but underutilised due to concerns over its side effects. Material and Methods:
We used data from de-identified EHRs of three mental health trusts in the UK (>50 million documents,
over 500,000 patients, 2835 of which were prescribed Clozapine). We explored the prevalence of
33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission type three months before
and after the patients started Clozapine treatment. We compared the prevalence of adverse effects
with those reported in the Side Effects Resource (SIDER) where possible. Results: Sedation, fatigue,
agitation, dizziness, hypersalivation, weight gain, tachycardia, headache, constipation and
confusion were amongst the highest recorded Clozapine adverse effect in the three months following
the start of treatment. Higher percentages of all adverse effects were found in the first month of
Clozapine therapy. Using a significance level of (p< 0.05) out chi-square tests show a significant
association between most of the ADRs in smoking status and hospital admissions and some in gender
and age groups. Further, the data was combined from three trusts, and chi-square tests were applied
to estimate the average effect of ADRs in each monthly interval. Conclusion: A better understanding
of how the drug works in the real world can complement clinical trials and precision medicine.
