Person re-identification (person Re-Id) aims to retrieve the pedestrian images of a same person
that captured by disjoint and non-overlapping cameras. Lots of researchers recently focuse on
this hot issue and propose deep learning based methods to enhance the recognition rate in a supervised
or unsupervised manner. However, two limitations that cannot be ignored: firstly, compared with
other image retrieval benchmarks, the size of existing person Re-Id datasets are far from meeting
the requirement, which cannot provide sufficient pedestrian samples for the training of deep model;
secondly, the samples in existing datasets do not have sufficient human motions or postures coverage
to provide more priori knowledges for learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised
pose augmentation cross-view person Re-Id scheme called PAC-GAN to overcome these limitations.
We firstly present the formal definition of cross-view pose augmentation and then propose the framework
of PAC-GAN that is a novel conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) based approach to
improve the performance of unsupervised corss-view person Re-Id. Specifically, The pose generation
model in PAC-GAN called CPG-Net is to generate enough quantity of pose-rich samples from original
image and skeleton samples. The pose augmentation dataset is produced by combining the synthesized
pose-rich samples with the original samples, which is fed into the corss-view person Re-Id model
named Cross-GAN. Besides, we use weight-sharing strategy in the CPG-Net to improve the quality
of new generated samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first try to enhance the unsupervised
cross-view person Re-Id by pose augmentation, and the results of extensive experiments show that
the proposed scheme can combat the state-of-the-arts.
