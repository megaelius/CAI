We present a novel computational framework for diffusive-reactive systems that satisfies the
non-negative constraint and maximum principles on general computational grids. The governing
equations for the concentration of reactants and product are written in terms of tensorial diffusion-reaction
equations. % We restrict our studies to fast irreversible bimolecular reactions. If one assumes
that the reaction is diffusion-limited and all chemical species have the same diffusion coefficient,
one can employ a linear transformation to rewrite the governing equations in terms of invariants,
which are unaffected by the reaction. This results in two uncoupled tensorial diffusion equations
in terms of these invariants, which are solved using a novel non-negative solver for tensorial diffusion-type
equations. The concentrations of the reactants and the product are then calculated from invariants
using algebraic manipulations. The novel aspect of the proposed computational framework is that
it will always produce physically meaningful non-negative values for the concentrations of all
chemical species. Several representative numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
robustness, convergence, and the numerical performance of the proposed computational framework.
We will also compare the proposed framework with other popular formulations. In particular, we
will show that the Galerkin formulation (which is the standard single-field formulation) does
not produce reliable solutions, and the reason can be attributed to the fact that the single-field
formulation does not guarantee non-negative solutions. We will also show that the clipping procedure
(which produces non-negative solutions but is considered as a variational crime) does not give
accurate results when compared with the proposed computational framework.
