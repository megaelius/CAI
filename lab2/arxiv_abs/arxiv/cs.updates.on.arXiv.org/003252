For a developing nation, deploying big data (BD) technology and introducing data science in higher
education is a challenge. A pessimistic scenario is: Mis-use of data in many possible ways, waste
of trained manpower, poor BD certifications from institutes, under-utilization of resources,
disgruntled management staff, unhealthy competition in the market, poor integration with existing
technical infrastructures. Also, the questions in the minds of students, scientists, engineers,
teachers and managers deserve wider attention. Besides the stated perceptions and analyses perhaps
ignoring socio-political and scientific temperaments in developing nations, the following questions
arise: How did the BD phenomenon naturally occur, post technological developments in Computer
and Communications Technology and how did different experts react to it? Are academicians elsewhere
agreeing on the fact that BD is a new science? Granted that big data science is a new science what are
its foundations as compared to conventional topics in Physics, Chemistry or Biology? Or, is it similar
to astronomy or nuclear science? What are the technological and engineering implications and how
these can be advantageously used to augment business intelligence, for example? Will the industry
adopt the changes due to tactical advantages? How can BD success stories be carried over elsewhere?
How will BD affect the Computer Science and other curricula? How will BD benefit different segments
of our society on a large scale? To answer these, an appreciation of the BD as a science and as a technology
is necessary. This paper presents a quick BD overview, relying on the contemporary literature;
it addresses: characterizations of BD and the BD people, the background required for the students
and teachers to join the BD bandwagon, the management challenges in embracing BD.
