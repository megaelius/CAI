We develop a new sequential rate distortion function to compute lower bounds on the average length
of all causal prefix free codes for partially observable multivariate Markov processes with mean-squared
error distortion constraint. Our information measure is characterized by a variant of causally
conditioned directed information and it is utilized in various applications examples. First,
it is used to optimally characterize a finite dimensional optimization problem for partially observable
multivariate Gauss-Markov processes and to obtain the optimal linear policies that achieve the
solution of this problem. Under the assumption that all matrices commute by pairs, we show that our
problem can be cast as a convex optimization problem and achieves its lower rates. We also derive
sufficient conditions which ensure that our assumption holds. Then, we compute the optimization
problem by solving the KKT conditions and deriving a non-trivial reverse-waterfilling algorithm
that we also implement. If our assumption is not met, then, one can still use it to derive sub-optimal
waterfilling solutions on the obtained finite dimensional optimization problem. For scalar-valued
Gauss-Markov processes with additional observations noise, we derive a new closed form solution
and we compared it with the analytical solution obtained for scalar-valued Gauss-Markov processes
to infer about the rate loss due to having the additional observations noise. For partially observable
time-invariant Markov processes (without observations noise) driven by an additive i.i.d. non-Gaussian
system's noise process, we recover using an alternative approach and thus strengthening a recent
result by Kostina and Hassibi in [1, Theorem 9] whereas for time-invariant parallel and spatially
identically distributed Markov processes driven by additive non-Gaussian noise process we also
derive new analytical lower bounds.
