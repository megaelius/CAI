This paper studies a wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system, where a dedicated energy
transmitter (ET) uses the radio-frequency (RF) signal enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) to
charge wireless devices for sustainable computation. In such a system, we present a new user cooperation
approach to improve the computation performance of active devices, in which surrounding idle devices
are enabled as helpers to use their opportunistically harvested wireless energy from the ET to help
remotely execute active users' computation tasks. In particular, we consider a basic scenario
with one user (with computation tasks to execute) and multiple helpers, in which the user can partition
the computation tasks into various parts for local execution and computation offloading to helpers,
respectively. Both the user and helpers are subject to the so-called energy neutrality constraints,
such that their energy consumption does not exceed the respective energy harvested from the ET.
Under this setup and considering a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) based computation
offloading protocol, we maximize the computation rate (i.e., the number of computation bits over
a particular time block) of the user, by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming at the
ET, as well as the communication and computation resource allocations at both the user and helpers.
By leveraging the Lagrange duality method, we present the optimal solution to this problem in a semi-closed
form. Numerical results show that the proposed wireless powered user cooperative computation
design significantly improves the computation rate at the user, as compared to conventional schemes
without such cooperation.
