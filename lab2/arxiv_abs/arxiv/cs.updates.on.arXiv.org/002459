The rise of deep learning in recent years has brought with it increasingly clever optimization methods
to deal with complex, non-linear loss functions. These methods are often designed with convex optimization
in mind, but have been shown to work well in practice even for the highly non-convex optimization
associated with neural networks. However, one significant drawback of these methods when they
are applied to deep learning is that the magnitude of the update step is sometimes disproportionate
to the magnitude of the weights (much smaller or larger), leading to training instabilities such
as vanishing and exploding gradients. An idea to combat this issue is gradient descent with proportional
updates. Gradient descent with proportional updates was introduced in 2017. It was independently
developed by You et al (Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) algorithm) and by Abu-El-Haija
(PercentDelta algorithm). The basic idea of both of these algorithms is to make each step of the gradient
descent proportional to the current weight norm and independent of the gradient magnitude. It is
common in the context of new optimization methods to prove convergence or derive regret bounds under
the assumption of Lipschitz continuity and convexity. However, even though LARS and PercentDelta
were shown to work well in practice, there is no theoretical analysis of the convergence properties
of these algorithms. Thus it is not clear if the idea of gradient descent with proportional updates
is used in the optimal way, or if it could be improved by using a different norm or specific learning
rate schedule, for example. Moreover, it is not clear if these algorithms can be extended to other
problems, besides neural networks. We attempt to answer these questions by establishing the theoretical
analysis of gradient descent with proportional updates, and verifying this analysis with empirical
examples.
