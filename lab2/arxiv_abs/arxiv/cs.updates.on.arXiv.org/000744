Many aspects of macroevolutionary theory and our knowledge of biotic responses to global environmental
change derive from literature-based compilations of paleontological data. Although major features
in the macroevolutionary history of life, notably long-term patterns of biodiversity, are similar
across compilations, critical assessments of synthetic databases have been limited to the enumeration
of taxonomic and geochronological errors in single lineages. Existing databases also leverage
a small fraction of relevant published knowledge and are difficult to extend with new data types.
Here, we develop a statistical machine reading and learning system, PaleoDeepDive, to automatically
find and extract data from the text, tables, and figures of publications. We show that PaleoDeepDive
requires comparatively little training data to perform comparably to humans in many complex data
extraction tasks, and then deploy the system to extend the human-constructed Paleobiology Database
to include nearly ten times more journal articles. Large-scale Phanerozoic taxonomic diversity
and genus-level extinction and origination patterns are robust, even when derived from different
bodies of literature. Unlike traditional databases, PaleoDeepDive produces a probabilistic
database that improves as new information is added and that is extendable to include data not previously
accessible on large scales, including morphological data in biological illustrations. Although
literature-based compilations will always be subject to errors caused by inconsistent and erroneous
data reporting, our high quality machine-reading approach to data synthesis and integration brings
within reach questions that are now underdetermined and does so in ways that may stimulate new modes
of inquiry.
