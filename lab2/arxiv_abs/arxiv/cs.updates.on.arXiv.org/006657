The objective assessment of the prestige of an academic institution is a difficult and hotly debated
task. In the last few years, different types of University Rankings have been proposed to quantify
the excellence of different research institutions in the world. Albeit met with criticism in some
cases, the relevance of university rankings is being increasingly acknowledged: indeed, rankings
are having a major impact on the design of research policies, both at the institutional and governmental
level. Yet, the debate on what rankings are {\em exactly} measuring is enduring. Here, we address
the issue by measuring a quantitive and reliable proxy of the academic reputation of a given institution
and by evaluating its correlation with different university rankings. Specifically, we study
citation patterns among universities in five different Web of Science Subject Categories and use
the \pr~algorithm on the five resulting citation networks. The rationale behind our work is that
scientific citations are driven by the reputation of the reference so that the PageRank algorithm
is expected to yield a rank which reflects the reputation of an academic institution in a specific
field. Our results allow to quantifying the prestige of a set of institutions in a certain research
field based only on hard bibliometric data. Given the volume of the data analysed, our findings are
statistically robust and less prone to bias, at odds with ad--hoc surveys often employed by ranking
bodies in order to attain similar results. Because our findings are found to correlate extremely
well with the ARWU Subject rankings, the approach we propose in our paper may open the door to new,
Academic Ranking methodologies that go beyond current methods by reconciling the qualitative
evaluation of Academic Prestige with its quantitative measurements via publication impact.
