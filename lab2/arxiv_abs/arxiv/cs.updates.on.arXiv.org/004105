The problem of mismatched decoding with an additive metric $q$ for a discrete memoryless channel
$W$ is addressed. The "product-space" improvement of the random coding lower bound on the mismatch
capacity, $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$, was introduced by Csisz\'ar and Narayan. We study two kinds of
decoders. The {\it $\delta$-margin mismatched decoder} outputs a message whose metric with the
channel output exceeds that of all the other codewords by at least $\delta$. The {\it $\tau$-threshold
decoder} outputs a single message whose metric with the channel output exceeds a threshold $\tau$.
Both decoders declare an error if they fail to find a message that meets the requirement. It is assumed
that $q$ is bounded. It is proved that $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$ is equal to the mismatch capacity with
a constant margin decoder. We next consider sequences of $P$-constant composition codebooks,
whose empirical distribution of the codewords are at least $o(n^{-1/2})$ close in the $L_1$ distance
sense to $P$. Using the Central Limit Theorem, it is shown that for such sequences of codebooks the
supremum of achievable rates with constant threshold decoding is upper bounded by the supremum
of the achievable rates with a constant margin decoder, and therefore also by $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$.
Further, a soft converse is proved stating that if the average probability of error of a sequence
of codebooks converges to zero sufficiently fast, the rate of the code sequence is upper bounded
by $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$. In particular, if $q$ is a bounded rational metric, and the average probability
of error converges to zero faster than $O(n^{-1})$, then $R\leq C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$. Finally,
a max-min multi-letter upper bound on the mismatch capacity that bears some resemblance to $C_q^{(\infty)}(W)$
is presented.
