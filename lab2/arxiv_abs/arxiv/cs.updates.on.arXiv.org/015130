We are witnessing a proliferation of textured 3D models captured from the real world with automatic
photo-reconstruction tools. Digital 3D models of this class come with a unique set of characteristics
and defects -- especially concerning their parametrization -- setting them starkly apart from
3D models originating from other, more traditional, sources. We study this class of 3D models by
collecting a significant number of representatives and quantitatively evaluating their quality
according to several metrics. These include a new invariant metric we design to assess the fragmentation
of the UV map, one of the main weaknesses hindering the usability of these models. Our results back
the widely shared notion that such models are not fit for direct use in downstream applications (such
as videogames), and require challenging processing steps. Regrettably, existing automatic geometry
processing tools are not always up to the task: for example, we verify that available tools for UV
optimization often fail due mesh inconsistencies, geometric and topological noise, excessive
resolution, or other factors; moreover, even when an output is produced, it is rarely a significant
improvement over the input (according to the aforementioned measures). Therefore, we argue that
further advancements are required specifically targeted at this class of models. Towards this
goal, we share the models we collected in the form of a new public repository, Real-World Textured
Things (RWTT), a benchmark to systematic field-test and compare algorithms. RWTT consists of 568
carefully selected textured 3D models representative of all the main modern off-the-shelf photo-reconstruction
tools. The repository is available at this http URL and is browsable by metadata collected during
experiments, and comes with a tool, TexMetro, providing the same set of measures for generic UV mapped
datasets.
