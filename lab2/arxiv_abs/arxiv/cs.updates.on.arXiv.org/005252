Advances in micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) techniques enable inertial measurements units
(IMUs) to be small, cheap, energy efficient, and widely used in smartphones, robots, and drones.
Exploiting inertial data for accurate and reliable navigation and localization has attracted
significant research and industrial interest, as IMU measurements are completely ego-centric
and generally environment agnostic. Recent studies have shown that the notorious issue of drift
can be significantly alleviated by using deep neural networks (DNNs), e.g. IONet. However, the
lack of sufficient labelled data for training and testing various architectures limits the proliferation
of adopting DNNs in IMU-based tasks. In this paper, we propose and release the Oxford Inertial Odometry
Dataset (OxIOD), a first-of-its-kind data collection for inertial-odometry research, with all
sequences having ground-truth labels. Our dataset contains 158 sequences totalling more than
42 km in total distance, much larger than previous inertial datasets. Another notable feature of
this dataset lies in its diversity, which can reflect the complex motions of phone-based IMUs in
various everyday usage. The measurements were collected with four different attachments (handheld,
in the pocket, in the handbag and on the trolley), four motion modes (halting, walking slowly, walking
normally, and running), five different users, four types of off-the-shelf consumer phones, and
large-scale localization from office buildings. Deep inertial tracking experiments were conducted
to show the effectiveness of our dataset in training deep neural network models and evaluate learning-based
and model-based algorithms. The OxIOD Dataset is available at: this http URL
