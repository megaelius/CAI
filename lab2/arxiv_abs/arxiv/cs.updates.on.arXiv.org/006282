Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their variants are usually trained by contrastive divergence
(CD) learning, but the training procedure is an unsupervised learning approach, without any guidances
of the background knowledge. To enhance the expression ability of traditional RBMs, in this paper,
we propose pairwise constraints restricted Boltzmann machine with Gaussian visible units (pcGRBM)
model, in which the learning procedure is guided by pairwise constraints and the process of encoding
is conducted under these guidances. The pairwise constraints are encoded in hidden layer features
of pcGRBM. Then, some pairwise hidden features of pcGRBM flock together and another part of them
are separated by the guidances. In order to deal with real-valued data, the binary visible units
are replaced by linear units with Gausian noise in the pcGRBM model. In the learning process of pcGRBM,
the pairwise constraints are iterated transitions between visible and hidden units during CD learning
procedure. Then, the proposed model is inferred by approximative gradient descent method and the
corresponding learning algorithm is designed in this paper. In order to compare the availability
of pcGRBM and traditional RBMs with Gaussian visible units, the features of the pcGRBM and RBMs hidden
layer are used as input 'data' for K-means, spectral clustering (SP) and affinity propagation (AP)
algorithms, respectively. A thorough experimental evaluation is performed with sixteen image
datasets of Microsoft Research Asia Multimedia (MSRA-MM). The experimental results show that
the clustering performance of K-means, SP and AP algorithms based on pcGRBM model are significantly
better than traditional RBMs. In addition, the pcGRBM model for clustering task shows better performance
than some semi-supervised clustering algorithms.
