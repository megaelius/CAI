Energy proportionality is the key design goal followed by architects of modern multicore CPUs.
One of its implications is that optimization of an application for performance will also optimize
it for energy. In this work, we show that energy proportionality does not hold true for multicore
CPUs. This finding creates the opportunity for bi-objective optimization of applications for
performance and energy. We propose and study the first application-level method for bi-objective
optimization of multithreaded data-parallel applications for performance and energy. The method
uses two decision variables, the number of identical multithreaded kernels (threadgroups) executing
the application and the number of threads in each threadgroup, with the workload always partitioned
equally between the threadgroups. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of the method
using four highly optimized multithreaded data-parallel applications, 2D fast Fourier transform
based on FFTW and Intel MKL, and dense matrix-matrix multiplication using OpenBLAS and Intel MKL.
Four modern multicore CPUs are used in the experiments. The experiments show that optimization
for performance alone results in the increase in dynamic energy consumption by up to 89% and optimization
for dynamic energy alone degrades the performance by up to 49%. By solving the bi-objective optimization
problem, the method determines up to 11 globally Pareto-optimal solutions. Finally, we propose
a qualitative dynamic energy model employing performance monitoring counters as parameters,
which we use to explain the discovered energy nonproportionality and the Pareto-optimal solutions
determined by our method. The model shows that the energy nonproportionality in our case is due to
the activity of the data translation lookaside buffer (dTLB), which is disproportionately energy
expensive.
