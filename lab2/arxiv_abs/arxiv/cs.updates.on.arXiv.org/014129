Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is a problem related to the field of machine listening whose
objective is to classify/tag an audio clip in a predefined label describing a scene location. Interest
in this topic has grown so much over the years that an annual international challenge (Dectection
and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events) is held to propose novel solutions. Solutions
to these problems often incorporate different methods such as data augmentation or with an ensemble
of various models. Although the main line of research in the state-of-the-art usually implements
these methods, considerable improvements and state-of-the-art results can also be achieved only
by modifying the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work we propose
two novel squeeze-excitation blocks to improve the accuracy of an ASC framework by modifying the
architecture of the residual block in a CNN together with an analysis of several state-of-the-art
blocks. The main idea of squeeze-excitation blocks is to learn spatial and channel-wise feature
maps independently instead of jointly as standard CNNs do. This is done by some global grouping operators,
linear operators and a final calibration between the input of the block and the relationships obtained
by that block. The behavior of the block that implements these operators and, therefore, the entire
neural network can be modified depending on the input to the block, the residual configurations
and the non-linear activations, that is, at what point of the block they are performed. The analysis
has been carried out using TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2019 dataset presented in DCASE 2019 edition.
All configurations discussed in this document exceed baseline proposed by DCASE organization
by 13% percentage points. In turn, the novel configurations proposed in this paper exceed the residual
configuration proposed in previous works.
