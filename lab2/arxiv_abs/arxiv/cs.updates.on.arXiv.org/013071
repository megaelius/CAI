Perhaps the most ambitious scientific quest in human history is the creation of general artificial
intelligence, which roughly means AI that is as smart or smarter than humans. The dominant approach
in the machine learning community is to attempt to discover each of the pieces required for intelligence,
with the implicit assumption that some future group will complete the Herculean task of figuring
out how to combine all of those pieces into a complex thinking machine. I call this the "manual AI approach".
This paper describes another exciting path that ultimately may be more successful at producing
general AI. It is based on the clear trend in machine learning that hand-designed solutions eventually
are replaced by more effective, learned solutions. The idea is to create an AI-generating algorithm
(AI-GA), which automatically learns how to produce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for
the approach: (1) meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms themselves,
and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that either approach could produce
general AI first, and both are scientifically worthwhile irrespective of which is the fastest path.
Because both are promising, yet the ML community is currently committed to the manual approach,
I argue that our community should increase its research investment in the AI-GA approach. To encourage
such research, I describe promising work in each of the Three Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific
safety and ethical considerations. Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because
it is inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a simple algorithm
can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian evolution produced human intelligence),
I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs should be considered a new grand challenge of computer science
research.
