The objective of this paper is to develop a global non-intrusive Parametric Model Order Reduction
(PMOR) methodology for the problem of changing well locations in an oil field, that can eventually
be used for well placement optimization to gain significant computational savings. In this work,
we propose a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based PMOR strategy that is non-intrusive to
the simulator source code and hence extends its applicability to any commercial simulator. The
non-intrusiveness of the proposed technique stems from formulating a novel Machine Learning (ML)
based framework used with POD. The features of ML model are designed such that they take into consideration
the temporal evolution of the state solutions and thereby avoiding simulator access for time dependency
of the solutions. We represent well location changes as a parameter by introducing geometry-based
features and flow diagnostics inspired physics-based features. An error correction model based
on reduced model solutions is formulated later to correct for discrepancies in the state solutions
at well gridblocks. It was observed that the global PMOR could predict the overall trend in pressure
and saturation solutions at the well blocks but some bias was observed that resulted in discrepancies
in prediction of quantities of interest (QoI). Thus, the error correction model that considers
the physics based reduced model solutions as features, proved to reduce the error in QoI significantly.
This workflow is applied to a heterogeneous channelized reservoir that showed good solution accuracies
and speed-ups of 50x-100x were observed for different cases considered. The method is formulated
such that all the simulation time steps are independent and hence can make use of parallel resources
very efficiently and also avoid stability issues that can result from error accumulation over timesteps.
