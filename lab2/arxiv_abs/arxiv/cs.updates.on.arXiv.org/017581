Due to a resource-constrained environment, network compression has become an important part of
deep neural networks research. In this paper, we propose a new compression method, \textit{Inter-Layer
Weight Prediction} (ILWP) and quantization method which quantize the predicted residuals between
the weights in all convolution layers based on an inter-frame prediction method in conventional
video coding schemes. Furthermore, we found a phenomenon \textit{Smoothly Varying Weight Hypothesis}
(SVWH) which is that the weights in adjacent convolution layers share strong similarity in shapes
and values, i.e., the weights tend to vary smoothly along with the layers. Based on SVWH, we propose
a second ILWP and quantization method which quantize the predicted residuals between the weights
in adjacent convolution layers. Since the predicted weight residuals tend to follow Laplace distributions
with very low variance, the weight quantization can more effectively be applied, thus producing
more zero weights and enhancing the weight compression ratio. In addition, we propose a new \textit{inter-layer
loss} for eliminating non-texture bits, which enabled us to more effectively store only texture
bits. That is, the proposed loss regularizes the weights such that the collocated weights between
the adjacent two layers have the same values. Finally, we propose an ILWP with an inter-layer loss
and quantization method. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves
a much higher weight compression rate at the same accuracy level compared with the previous quantization-based
compression methods in deep neural networks.
