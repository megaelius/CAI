Scalable user- and application-aware resource allocation for heterogeneous applications sharing
an enterprise network is still an unresolved problem. The main challenges are: (i) How to define
user- and application-aware shares of resources? (ii) How to determine an allocation of shares
of network resources to applications? (iii) How to allocate the shares per application in heterogeneous
networks at scale? In this paper we propose solutions to the three challenges and introduce a system
design for enterprise deployment. Defining the necessary resource shares per application is hard,
as the intended use case and user's preferences influence the resource demand. Utility functions
based on user experience enable a mapping of network resources in terms of throughput and latency
budget to a common user-level utility scale. A multi-objective MILP is formulated to solve the throughput-
and delay-aware embedding of each utility function for a max-min fairness criteria. The allocation
of resources in traditional networks with policing and scheduling cannot distinguish large numbers
of classes. We propose a resource allocation system design for enterprise networks based on Software-Defined
Networking principles to achieve delay-constrained routing in the network and application pacing
at the end-hosts. The system design is evaluated against best effort networks with applications
competing for the throughput of a constrained link. The competing applications belong to the five
application classes web browsing, file download, remote terminal work, video streaming, and Voice-over-IP.
The results show that the proposed methodology improves the minimum and total utility, minimizes
packet loss and queuing delay at bottlenecks, establishes fairness in terms of utility between
applications, and achieves predictable application performance at high link utilization.
