We study the complexity of approximating the Ising and Tutte partition functions with complex parameters.
Our results are motivated by the study of the quantum complexity classes BQP and IQP. Recent results
show how to encode quantum computations as partition functions. These results rely on interesting
and deep results about quantum computation in order to obtain hardness results about the difficulty
of (classically) evaluating the partition functions. The main motivation for this paper is to go
the other way around. Partition functions are combinatorial in nature and classifying the difficulty
of approximating these partition functions does not require a detailed understanding of quantum
computation. Using combinatorial arguments, we give a full classification of the complexity of
multiplicatively approximating the norm of the partition function for complex edge interactions.
We also classify the complexity of additively approximating the argument of the partition function
(and of approximating the partition function according to a natural complex metric). Using our
classifications, we then revisit the connections to quantum computation, drawing conclusions
that are different from (and incomparable to) the results in the quantum complexity literature.
We show that strong simulation of IQP within any constant factor is #P-hard, even for the restricted
class of circuits studied by Bremner et al. We also show that computing the sign of the Tutte polynomial
is #P-hard at a certain point related to the simulation of BQP. Finally, motivated by further BQP-hardness
results, we study the problem of approximating the norm of the Ising partition function in the presence
of external fields. We give a complete dichotomy for the case in which the parameters are roots of
unity. Previous results were known just for a few such points, and we strengthen these results from
BQP-hardness to #P-hardness.
