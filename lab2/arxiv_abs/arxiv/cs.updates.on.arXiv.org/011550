Human in-the-loop quality assurance (QA) is typically performed after medical image segmentation
to ensure that the systems are performing as intended, as well as identifying and excluding outliers.
By performing QA on large-scale, previously unlabeled testing data, categorical QA scores can
be generatedIn this paper, we propose a semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation deep neural
network consisting of a traditional segmentation model generator and a QA involved discriminator.
A large-scale dataset of 2027 volumes are used to train the generator, whose 2-D montage images and
segmentation mask with QA scores are used to train the discriminator. To generate the QA scores,
the 2-D montage images were reviewed manually and coded 0 (success), 1 (errors consistent with published
performance), and 2 (gross failure). Then, the ResNet-18 network was trained with 1623 montage
images in equal distribution of all three code labels and achieved an accuracy 94% for classification
predictions with 404 montage images withheld for the test cohort. To assess the performance of using
the QA supervision, the discriminator was used as a loss function in a multi-organ segmentation
pipeline. The inclusion of QA-loss function boosted performance on the unlabeled test dataset
from 714 patients to 951 patients over the baseline model. Additionally, the number of failures
decreased from 606 (29.90%) to 402 (19.83%). The contributions of the proposed method are threefold:
We show that (1) the QA scores can be used as a loss function to perform semi-supervised learning for
unlabeled data, (2) the well trained discriminator is learnt by QA score rather than traditional
true/false, and (3) the performance of multi-organ segmentation on unlabeled datasets can be fine-tuned
with more robust and higher accuracy than the original baseline method.
