Detecting the anomaly behaviors such as network failure or Internet intentional attack in the large-scale
Internet is a vital but challenging task. While numerous techniques have been developed based on
Internet traffic in past years, anomaly detection for structured datasets by complex network have
just been of focus recently. In this paper, a anomaly detection method for large-scale Internet
topology is proposed by considering the changes of network crashes. In order to quantify the dynamic
changes of Internet topology, the network path changes coefficient(NPCC) is put forward which
will highlight the Internet abnormal state after it is attacked continuously. Furthermore we proposed
the decision function which is inspired by Fibonacci Sequence to determine whether the Internet
is abnormal or not. That is the current Internet is abnormal if its NPCC is beyond the normal domain
which structured by the previous k NPCCs of Internet topology. Finally the new Internet anomaly
detection method was tested over the topology data of three Internet anomaly events. The results
show that the detection accuracy of all events are over 97%, the detection precision of each event
are 90.24%, 83.33% and 66.67%, when k = 36. According to the experimental values of the index F_1,
we found the the better the detection performance is, the bigger the k is, and our method has better
performance for the anomaly behaviors caused by network failure than that caused by intentional
attack. Compared with traditional anomaly detection, our work may be more simple and powerful for
the government or organization in items of detecting large-scale abnormal events.
