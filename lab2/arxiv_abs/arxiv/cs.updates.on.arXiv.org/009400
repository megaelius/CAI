Let $k,n,m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ integers such that $k\leq n \leq m$, let $\mathrm{G}_{n,k}\in \mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n$
be a Delsarte-Gabidulin code. Wachter-Zeh proven that codes belonging to this family cannot be
efficiently list decoded for any radius $\tau$, providing $\tau$ is large enough. This achievement
essentially relies on proving a lower bound for the list size of some specific words in $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n
\setminus \mathrm{G}_{n,k}$. In 2016, Raviv and Wachter-Zeh improved this bound in a special case,
i.e. when $n\mid m$. As a consequence, they were able to detect infinite families of Delsarte-Gabidulin
codes that cannot be efficiently list decoded at all. In this article we determine similar lower
bounds for Maximum Rank Distance codes belonging to a wider class of examples, containing Generalized
Gabidulin codes, Generalized Twisted Gabidulin codes, and examples recently described by the
first author and Yue Zhou. By exploiting arguments suchlike those used in the above mentioned papers,
when $n\mid m$, we also show infinite families of generalized Gabidulin codes that cannot be list
decoded efficiently at any radius greater than or equal to $\left\lfloor \frac{d-1}2 \right\rfloor+1$,
where $d$ is its minimum distance. Nonetheless, in all other examples belonging to above mentioned
class, we detect infinite families that cannot be list decoded efficiently at any radius greater
than or equal to $\left\lfloor \frac{d-1}2 \right\rfloor+2$, where $d$ is its minimum distance.
Finally, relying on the properties of a set of subspace trinomials recently presented by McGuire
and Mueller, we are able to prove that any rank metric code of $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n$ of order $q^{kn}$
with $n$ dividing $m$, such that $4n-3$ is a square in $\mathbb{Z}$ and containing $\mathrm{G}_{n,2}$,
is not efficiently list decodable at some values of the radius $\tau$.
