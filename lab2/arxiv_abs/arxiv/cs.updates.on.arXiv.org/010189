Effective and powerful methods for denoising real electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are important
for wearable sensors and devices. Deep Learning (DL) models have been used extensively in image
processing and other domains with great success but only very recently have been used in processing
ECG signals. This paper presents several DL models namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) together with the more conventional
filtering methods (low pass filtering, high pass filtering, Notch filtering) and the standard
wavelet-based technique for denoising EEG signals. These methods are trained, tested and evaluated
on different synthetic and real ECG datasets taken from the MIT PhysioNet database and for different
simulation conditions (i.e. various lengths of the ECG signals, single or multiple records). The
results show the CNN model is a performant model that can be used for off-line denoising ECG applications
where it is satisfactory to train on a clean part of an ECG signal from an ECG record, and then to test
on the same ECG signal, which would have some high level of noise added to it. However, for real-time
applications or near-real time applications, this task becomes more cumbersome, as the clean part
of an ECG signal is very probable to be very limited in size. Therefore the solution put forth in this
work is to train a CNN model on 1 second ECG noisy artificial multiple heartbeat data (i.e. ECG at effort),
which was generated in a first instance based on few sequences of real signal heartbeat ECG data (i.e.
ECG at rest). Afterwards it would be possible to use the trained CNN model in real life situations
to denoise the ECG signal.
