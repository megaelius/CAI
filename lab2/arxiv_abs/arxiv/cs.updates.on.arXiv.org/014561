We study a constrained shortest path problem in group-labeled graphs with nonnegative edge length,
called the shortest non-zero path problem. Depending on the group in question, this problem includes
two types of tractable variants in undirected graphs: one is the parity-constrained shortest path/cycle
problem, and the other is computing a shortest noncontractible cycle in surface-embedded graphs.
For the shortest non-zero path problem with respect to finite abelian groups, Kobayashi and Toyooka
(2017) proposed a randomized, pseudopolynomial-time algorithm via permanent computation. For
a slightly more general class of groups, Yamaguchi (2016) showed a reduction of the problem to the
weighted linear matroid parity problem. In particular, some cases are solved in strongly polynomial
time via the reduction with the aid of a deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted
linear matroid parity problem developed by Iwata and Kobayashi (2017), which generalizes a well-known
fact that the parity-constrained shortest path problem is solved via weighted matching. In this
paper, as the first general solution independent of the group, we present a rather simple, deterministic,
and strongly polynomial-time algorithm for the shortest non-zero path problem. The algorithm
is based on Dijkstra's algorithm for the unconstrained shortest path problem and Edmonds' blossom
shrinking technique in matching algorithms, and clarifies a common tractable feature behind the
parity and topological constraints in the shortest path/cycle problem. Furthermore, we demonstrate
a faster algorithm without explicit blossom shrinking together with a dual linear programming
formulation of the equivalent problem like potential maximization for the unconstrained shortest
path problem.
