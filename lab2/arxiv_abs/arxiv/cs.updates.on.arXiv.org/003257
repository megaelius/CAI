Due to the large volume of heterogeneous data provided by both the customer and the grid side, a big
data visualization platform is built to discover the hidden useful knowledge for smart grid (SG)
operation, control and situation awareness. An open source cluster computing framework based
on Apache Spark is considering to discover the hidden knowledge of the bag-data. And the data is transmitted
with a Open System Interconnection (OSI) model to the data visualization platform in a high-speed
communication architecture. Google Earth and global geographic information system (GIS) are
used to design the visualization platform and realize the result with the test bench. The alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to compute the optimal power flow in distributed
manner. The proposed network reconfiguration is solved in parallel manner with the limited switches
and the strong computing capability. Further more, a multi-timescale operation approach is modeled
with a three-phase distributed system, which consists the hourly scheduling at substation level
and the minutes power flow operation at feeder level. The system cost with renewable generation
is minimized at the substation level. The given error distribution model of renewable generation
is simulated with a chance constraint, and the derived deterministic form is modeled with Gaussian
mixture model (GMM) with genetic algorithm-based expectationmaximization (GAEM). The system
cost is further reduced with the OPF in real-time (RT) scheduling. The semidefinite programming
(SDP) is used to relax the nonconvexity of the three-phase unbalanced distribution system into
a convex problem, which make sure to achieve the global optimal result. In the parallel manner, the
ADMM is realizing getting the results in a short time.
