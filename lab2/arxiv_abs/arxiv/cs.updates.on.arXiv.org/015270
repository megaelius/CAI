Nowadays, it has become a basic need to reuse existing Application Programming Interface (API),
Class Libraries, and frameworks for rapid software development. Software developers often reuse
this by calling the respective APIs or libraries. But in doing so, developers usually encounter
different problems in searching for appropriate code snippets. In most cases, API and Libraries
are complex and not well structured or well documented. Online search engine consumes time in searching,
yet match is not that relevant and representation is not good. To get a suggestion according to the
query we can find that snippet online using search engines or code search engines. In some cases database
dependent searching and remote web server based mined repository searching bring a problem to the
developers. Finding an API recommendation on code search engine often deal with extra-large files
that eventually slow down the software development process. We have searched for a solution throughout
our work and tried to bring a better outcome. As an alternative action, we have implemented a system
what we call Enhancing Software Development Process (ESDP) tool that is able to provide an efficient
and working integrated environment to the developers with a better abstraction and representation
of the search results and programmers need to be derived from the source codes. We also have built
and applied an XML based enriched repository to get a recommendation from the mined repository on
the client-side without interacting with the internet-dependent server to save complications
and times. We provide the most relevant code skeletons or mapping to programmers or developers using
graph-based representation.
