Maintaining a resilient computer network is a delicate task with conflicting priorities. Flows
should be served while controlling risk due to attackers. Configuration is time intensive and largely
static until a major new vulnerability forces change. Tools exist to check network reachability
(Khurshid et al., NSDI 2013) and risk using (probabilistic) attack graphs (Sheyner et al., IEEE
S\&P 2002). However, these tools are not designed to fashion configurations that simultaneously
satisfy multiple properties. We introduce FASHION: a linear optimizer that fashions network configurations
that balance functionality and security requirements. FASHION formalizes functionality as a
multi-commodity flow problem with side-constraints. FASHION's primary technical contribution
is formulating an approximation of network risk that can be solved using a binary integer program.
The approximation linearly combines two measures. One measure is the impact of the set of nodes the
attacker can reach in the attack graph (ignoring probability). The second is the maximum probability
path in the attack graph. FASHION is evaluated on data center networks. The evaluation synthesizes
attack graphs on the fat tree topology with up to 128 hosts and 81 network devices. FASHION usually
outputs a solution in under 10 minutes, allowing response to short term changes in functionality
or security. Solutions are monotonic for all observed experiments: as one increases weight on the
security objective, the actual risk, as evaluated by a probabilistic attack graph analysis, never
increases. FASHION outputs a set of software-defined networking rules consumable by a Frenetic
controller (Foster et al., ICFP 2011). FASHION allows an enterprise to automatically reconfigure
their network upon a change in functionality (shift in user demand) or security (publication or
patching of a vulnerability).
