The dynamics of symbolic systems, such as multidimensional subshifts of finite type or cellular
automata, are known to be closely related to computability theory. In particular, the appropriate
tools to describe and classify topological entropy for this kind of systems turned out to be of computational
nature. Part of the great importance of these symbolic systems relies on the role they have played
in understanding more general systems over non-symbolic spaces. The aim of this article is to investigate
topological entropy from a computability point of view in this more general, not necessarily symbolic
setting. In analogy to effective subshifts, we consider computable maps over effective compact
sets in general metric spaces, and study the computability properties of their topological entropies.
We show that even in this general setting, the entropy is always a $\Sigma_2$-computable number.
We then study how various dynamical and analytical constrains affect this upper bound, and prove
that it can be lowered in different ways depending on the constraint considered. In particular,
we obtain that all $\Sigma_2$-computable numbers can already be realized within the class of surjective
computable maps over $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, but that this bound decreases to $\Pi_{1}$(or upper)-computable
numbers when restricted to expansive maps. On the other hand, if we change the geometry of the ambient
space from the symbolic $\{0,1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ to the unit interval $[0,1]$, then we find a quite
different situation -- we show that the possible entropies of computable systems over $[0,1]$ are
exactly the $\Sigma_{1}$(or lower)-computable numbers and that this characterization switches
down to precisely the computable numbers when we restrict the class of system to the quadratic family.
