Objective: Multimodal measurements of the same phenomena provide complementary information
and highlight different perspectives, albeit each with their own limitations. A focus on a single
modality may lead to incorrect inferences, which is especially important when a studied phenomenon
is a disease. In this paper, we introduce a method that takes advantage of multimodal data in addressing
the hypotheses of disconnectivity and dysfunction within schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: We start
with estimating and visualizing links within and among extracted multimodal data features using
a Gaussian graphical model (GGM). We then propose a modularity-based method that can be applied
to the GGM to identify links that are associated with mental illness across a multimodal data set.
Through simulation and real data, we show our approach reveals important information about disease-related
network disruptions that are missed with a focus on a single modality. We use functional MRI (fMRI),
diffusion MRI (dMRI), and structural MRI (sMRI) to compute the fractional amplitude of low frequency
fluctuations (fALFF), fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter (GM) concentration maps. These
three modalities are analyzed using our modularity method. Results: Our results show missing links
that are only captured by the cross-modal information that may play an important role in disconnectivity
between the components. Conclusion: We identified multimodal (fALFF, FA and GM) disconnectivity
in the default mode network area in patients with SZ, which would not have been detectable in a single
modality. Significance: The proposed approach provides an important new tool for capturing information
that is distributed among multiple imaging modalities.
