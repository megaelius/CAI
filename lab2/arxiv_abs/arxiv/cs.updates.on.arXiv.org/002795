In this paper we propose and study the problem of trajectory-driven influential billboard placement:
given a set of billboards $U$ (each associated with a location and a cost), a database of trajectories
$\mathcal{T}$ and a budget $L$, the goal is to find a set of billboards within the budget so that the
placed ad can influence the largest number of trajectories. One core challenge is that multiple
billboards have influence overlap on trajectories and it is critical to identify and reduce the
influence overlap. Two more constraints on top of this challenge, i.e., the budget constraint and
non-uniform costs associated with each billboard, make this optimization problem more intricate.
We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose an enumeration based algorithm with $(1-1/e)$ approximation
ratio and $O(|\mathcal{T}|\cdot|U|^{5})$ time complexity, where $|\mathcal{T}|$ and $|U|$
are the number of trajectories and billboards respectively. By exploiting the locality property
of billboards influence, we propose a partition-based framework \psel. \psel partitions $U$ into
a set of small clusters, computes the locally influential billboards for each cluster, and merges
the local billboards to generate the globally influential billboards of $U$. As a result, the computation
cost is reduced to $O(|\mathcal{T}|\cdot|C_m|^5)$, where $|C_m|$ is the cardinality of the largest
partition in $U$. Furthermore, we propose a \bbsel method to further prune billboards with low marginal
influence; \bbsel significantly reduces the practical cost of \psel while achieving the same approximation
ratio as \psel. Experiments on real datasets show that our method achieves high influence and efficiency.
