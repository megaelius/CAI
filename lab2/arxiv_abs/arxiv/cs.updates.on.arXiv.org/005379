Background: HIV treatment prescription is a complex process; clinical decision support systems
(CDSS) can assist clinicians to choose optimal treatments. These support systems are based on clinical
trials and expert knowledge; however, the amount of data available to these systems is limited.
For this reason, CDSSs could be significantly improved by using the knowledge obtained by treating
HIV patients. This knowledge is mainly contained in patient records, whose usage is restricted
due to privacy and confidentiality constraints. Methods: A treatment effectiveness measure,
containing valuable information for HIV treatment prescription, was defined and a method to extract
this measure from patient records was developed. This method uses an advanced cryptographic technology,
known as secure Multiparty Computation (henceforth referred to as MPC), to preserve the privacy
of the patient records and the confidentiality of the clinicians' decisions. Results: Our solution
enables to compute the effectiveness measure of an HIV treatment based on patient records, while
preserving privacy. Moreover, clinicians are not burdened with the computational and communication
costs introduced by the privacy-preserving techniques that are used. Our system is able to compute
the effectiveness of 100 treatments for a specific patient in less than 24 minutes, querying a database
containing 20,000 patient records. Conclusion: This paper presents a novel and efficient HIV clinical
decision support system, that harnesses the potential and insights acquired from treatment data,
while preserving the privacy of patient records and the confidentiality of clinician decisions.
