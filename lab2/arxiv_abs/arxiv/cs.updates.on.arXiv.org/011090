The National Library of Finland has digitized the historical newspapers published in Finland between
1771 and 1910. This collection contains approximately 1.95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish.
Finnish part of the collection consists of about 2.40 billion words. The National Library's Digital
Collections are offered via the digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi web service, also known as Digi. Part
of the newspaper material (from 1771 to 1874) is also available freely downloadable in The Language
Bank of Finland provided by the FINCLARIN consortium. The collection can also be accessed through
the Korp environment that has been developed by Spr{\aa}kbanken at the University of Gothenburg
and extended by FINCLARIN team at the University of Helsinki to provide concordances of text resources.
A Cranfield style information retrieval test collection has also been produced out of a small part
of the Digi newspaper material at the University of Tampere. Quality of OCRed collections is an important
topic in digital humanities, as it affects general usability and searchability of collections.
There is no single available method to assess quality of large collections, but different methods
can be used to approximate quality. This paper discusses different corpus analysis style methods
to approximate overall lexical quality of the Finnish part of the Digi collection. Methods include
usage of parallel samples and word error rates, usage of morphological analyzers, frequency analysis
of words and comparisons to comparable edited lexical data. Our aim in the quality analysis is twofold:
firstly to analyze the present state of the lexical data and secondly, to establish a set of assessment
methods that build up a compact procedure for quality assessment after e.g. new OCRing or post correction
of the material. In the discussion part of the paper we shall synthesize results of our different
analyses.
