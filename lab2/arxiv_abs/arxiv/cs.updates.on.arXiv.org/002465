We propose the notion of {\it resistance of a graph} as an accompanying notion of the structure entropy
to measure the force of the graph to resist cascading failure of strategic virus attacks. We show
that for any connected network $G$, the resistance of $G$ is $\mathcal{R}(G)=\mathcal{H}^1(G)-\mathcal{H}^2(G)$,
where $\mathcal{H}^1(G)$ and $\mathcal{H}^2(G)$ are the one- and two-dimensional structure
entropy of $G$, respectively. According to this, we define the notion of {\it security index of a
graph} to be the normalized resistance, that is, $\theta (G)=\frac{\mathcal{R}(G)}{\mathcal{H}^1(H)}$.
We say that a connected graph is an $(n,\theta)$-{\it resistor graph}, if $G$ has $n$ vertices and
has security index $\theta (G)\geq\theta$. We show that trees and grid graphs are $(n,\theta)$-resistor
graphs for large constant $\theta$, that the graphs with bounded degree $d$ and $n$ vertices, are
$(n,\frac{2}{d}-o(1))$-resistor graphs, and that for a graph $G$ generated by the security model
\cite{LLPZ2015, LP2016}, with high probability, $G$ is an $(n,\theta)$-resistor graph, for a
constant $\theta$ arbitrarily close to $1$, provided that $n$ is sufficiently large. To the opposite
side, we show that expander graphs are not good resistor graphs, in the sense that, there is a global
constant $\theta_0<1$ such that expander graphs cannot be $(n,\theta)$-resistor graph for any
$\theta\geq\theta_0$. In particular, for the complete graph $G$, the resistance of $G$ is a constant
$O(1)$, and hence the security index of $G$ is $\theta (G)=o(1)$. Finally, we show that for any simple
and connected graph $G$, if $G$ is an $(n, 1-o(1))$-resistor graph, then there is a large $k$ such
that the $k$-th largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$ is $o(1)$, giving rise to an algebraic
characterization for the graphs that are secure against intentional virus attack.
