Since the development of transport systems, humans have exploited ground-level, below-ground,
and high-altitude spaces for transportation purposes. However, with the increasing burden of
expanding populations and rapid urbanization in recent decades, public transportation systems
and freight traffic are suffering huge pressure, plaguing local governments and straining economies.
Engineers and researchers have started to re-examine, propose, and develop the underused near-ground
spaces (NGS) for transportation purposes. For instance, flying cars, which are not a totally novel
idea, aim at solving the traffic congestion problem and releasing the strains on existing city transport
networks by utilizing unoccupied NGS. Flying cars differ from traditional grounded transportation
systems that are entirely limited by their physical space, such as trains on tracks or automobiles
on roads. Flying cars do not occupy or compete for high-altitude spaces used by air traffic for long-distance
transfer. However, there is a clear lack of specific literature on flying cars and flying car transportation
systems (FCTS), which this paper aims to address by describing modern advances, techniques, and
challenges of FCTS. We explore the inherent nature of NGS transportation and devise useful proposals
to facilitate the construction and commercialization of FCTS. We begin with an introduction to
the increasing need for NGS transportation and we address the advantages of using flying cars. Next,
we present a brief overview of the history of the development of flying cars in terms of the historic
timeline and technique development. Then, we discuss and compare the state of the art in the design
of flying cars, including the take-off \& landing (TOL) modes, pilot modes, operation modes, and
power types, ...
