WiFi-based wireless networks defined in IEEE 802.11 standard are becoming important components,
because WiFi devices are widely used in laptops, smart phones and other mobile computing machines.
Also, recently naked-eye 3D mobile devices and various 3D-enabled laptops are gradually popular.
WiFi manufacturers are now faced with the opportunity to provide mobile 3D video streaming in WiFi
networks. Different from traditional single-view 3D videos, multi-view 3D videos allow users
to choose preferred view angles and thus are promising for new applications, such as free-viewpoint
television (FTV). Enabling multi-view 3D video services may also overwhelm the network when transmitting
all views of every video. Fortunately, depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) allows each mobile
client to synthesize the desired view from a nearby left view and right view, so that not all views
of a video are necessary to be transmitted. Thus, no matter in which version of IEEE 802.11 now, presently
3D video multicast transmissions without DIBR are not efficient in WiFi network. Moreover, due
to collisions, channel errors, or different network conditions, for example, multirate and multichannel,
the transmitted views may be lost and each client may suffer different loss probability. In IEEE
802.11 without DIBR, the lost 3D view has to be retransmitted causing bandwidth consumption or even
may not be received for a long time. To reduce the bandwidth consumption and simultaneously ensure
each client have higher probability that it can see the view no matter directly received or synthesized,
we propose a distributed protocol with DIBR in WiFi network, called Multi-View Group Management
Protocol (MVGMP).
