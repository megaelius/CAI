The goal of serving and delighting customers in a personal and near human like manner is very high
on automation agendas of most Enterprises. Last few years, have seen huge progress in Natural Language
Processing domain which has led to deployments of conversational agents in many enterprises. Most
of the current industrial deployments tend to use Monolithic Single Agent designs that model the
entire knowledge and skill of the Domain. While this approach is one of the fastest to market, the
monolithic design makes it very hard to scale beyond a point. There are also challenges in seamlessly
leveraging many tools offered by sub fields of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval
in a single solution. The sub fields that can be leveraged to provide relevant information are, Question
and Answer system, Abstractive Summarization, Semantic Search, Knowledge Graph etc. Current
deployments also tend to be very dependent on the underlying Conversational AI platform (open source
or commercial) , which is a challenge as this is a fast evolving space and no one platform can be considered
future proof even in medium term of 3-4 years. Lately,there is also work done to build multi agent
solutions that tend to leverage a concept of master agent. While this has shown promise, this approach
still makes the master agent in itself difficult to scale. To address these challenges, we introduce
LPar, a distributed multi agent platform for large scale industrial deployment of polyglot, diverse
and inter-operable agents. The asynchronous design of LPar supports dynamically expandable domain.
We also introduce multiple strategies available in the LPar system to elect the most suitable agent
to service a customer query.
