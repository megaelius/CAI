The graph exploration problem requires a group of mobile robots, initially placed arbitrarily
on the nodes of a graph, to work collaboratively to explore the graph such that each node is eventually
visited by at least one robot. One important requirement of exploration is the {\em termination}
condition, i.e., the robots must know that exploration is completed. The problem of live exploration
of a dynamic ring using mobile robots was recently introduced in [Di Luna et al., ICDCS 2016]. In it,
they proposed multiple algorithms to solve exploration in fully synchronous and semi-synchronous
settings with various guarantees when $2$ robots were involved. They also provided guarantees
that with certain assumptions, exploration of the ring using two robots was impossible. An important
question left open was how the presence of $3$ robots would affect the results. In this paper, we try
to settle this question in a fully synchronous setting and also show how to extend our results to a
semi-synchronous setting. In particular, we present algorithms for exploration with explicit
termination using $3$ robots in conjunction with either (i) unique IDs of the robots and edge crossing
detection capability (i.e., two robots moving in opposite directions through an edge in the same
round can detect each other), or (ii) access to randomness. The time complexity of our deterministic
algorithm is asymptotically optimal. We also provide complementary impossibility results showing
that there does not exist any explicit termination algorithm for $2$ robots. The theoretical analysis
and comprehensive simulations of our algorithm show the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm
in dynamic rings. We also present an algorithm to achieve exploration with partial termination
using $3$ robots in the semi-synchronous setting.
