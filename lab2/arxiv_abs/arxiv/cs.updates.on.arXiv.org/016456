Low level image restoration is an integral component of modern artificial intelligence (AI) driven
camera pipelines. Most of these frameworks are based on deep neural networks which present a massive
computational overhead on resource constrained platform like a mobile phone. In this paper, we
propose several lightweight low-level modules which can be used to create a computationally low
cost variant of a given baseline model. Recent works for efficient neural networks design have mainly
focused on classification. However, low-level image processing falls under the image-to-image'
translation genre which requires some additional computational modules not present in classification.
This paper seeks to bridge this gap by designing generic efficient modules which can replace essential
components used in contemporary deep learning based image restoration networks. We also present
and analyse our results highlighting the drawbacks of applying depthwise separable convolutional
kernel (a popular method for efficient classification network) for sub-pixel convolution based
upsampling (a popular upsampling strategy for low-level vision applications). This shows that
concepts from domain of classification cannot always be seamlessly integrated into image-to-image
translation tasks. We extensively validate our findings on three popular tasks of image inpainting,
denoising and super-resolution. Our results show that proposed networks consistently output
visually similar reconstructions compared to full capacity baselines with significant reduction
of parameters, memory footprint and execution speeds on contemporary mobile devices.
