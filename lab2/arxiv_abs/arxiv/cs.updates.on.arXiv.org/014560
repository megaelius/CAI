As shown in (this http URL), the usual update modes of Boolean networks (BNs), including synchronous
and (generalized) asynchronous, fail to capture behaviors introduced by multivalued refinements.
Thus, update modes do not allow a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of biological systems,
as they may lead to reject valid BN models.This technical report lists the main definitions and properties
of the most permissive semantics of BNs introduced in this http URL This semantics meets with a correct
abstraction of any multivalued refinements, with any update mode. It subsumes all the usual updating
modes, while enabling new behaviors achievable by more concrete models. Moreover, it appears that
classical dynamical analyzes of reachability and attractors have a simpler computational complexity:-
reachability can be assessed in a polynomial number of iterations. The computation of iterations
is in NP in the very general case, and is linear when local functions are monotonic, or with some usual
representations of functions of BNs (binary decision diagrams, Petri nets, automata networks,
etc.). Thus, reachability is in P with locally-monotonic BNs, and P$^{\text{NP}}$ otherwise (instead
of being PSPACE-complete with update modes);- deciding wherever a configuration belongs to an
attractor is in coNP with locally-monotonic BNs, and coNP$^{\text{coNP}}$ otherwise (instead
of PSPACE-complete with update modes).Furthermore, we demonstrate that the semantics completely
captures any behavior achievable with any multilevel or ODE refinement of the BN; and the semantics
is minimal with respect to this model refinement criteria: to any most permissive trajectory, there
exists a multilevel refinement of the BN which can reproduce it.In brief, the most permissive semantics
of BNs enables a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of BNs, with a greater tractability than
previously introduced update modes.
