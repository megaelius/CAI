Operational Neural Networks (ONNs) have recently been proposed to address the well-known limitations
and drawbacks of conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as network homogeneity
with the sole linear neuron model. ONNs are heterogenous networks with a generalized neuron model
that can encapsulate any set of non-linear operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex
and multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training data. However,
Greedy Iterative Search (GIS) method, which is the search method used to find optimal operators
in ONNs takes many training sessions to find a single operator set per layer. This is not only computationally
demanding, but the network heterogeneity is also limited since the same set of operators will then
be used for all neurons in each layer. Moreover, the performance of ONNs directly depends on the operator
set library used, which introduces a certain risk of performance degradation especially when the
optimal operator set required for a particular task is missing from the library. In order to address
these issues and achieve an ultimate heterogeneity level to boost the network diversity along with
computational efficiency, in this study we propose Self-organized ONNs (Self-ONNs) with generative
neurons that have the ability to adapt (optimize) the nodal operator of each connection during the
training process. Therefore, Self-ONNs can have an utmost heterogeneity level required by the
learning problem at hand. Moreover, this ability voids the need of having a fixed operator set library
and the prior operator search within the library in order to find the best possible set of operators.
We further formulate the training method to back-propagate the error through the operational layers
of Self-ONNs.
