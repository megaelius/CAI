This study explores the extent to which bibliometric indicators based on counts of highly-cited
documents could be affected by the choice of data source. The initial hypothesis is that databases
that rely on journal selection criteria for their document coverage may not necessarily provide
an accurate representation of highly-cited documents across all subject areas, while inclusive
databases, which give each document the chance to stand on its own merits, might be better suited
to identify highly-cited documents. To test this hypothesis, an analysis of 2,515 highly-cited
documents published in 2006 that Google Scholar displays in its Classic Papers product is carried
out at the level of broad subject categories, checking whether these documents are also covered
in Web of Science and Scopus, and whether the citation counts offered by the different sources are
similar. The results show that a large fraction of highly-cited documents in the Social Sciences
and Humanities (8.6%-28.2%) are invisible to Web of Science and Scopus. In the Natural, Life, and
Health Sciences the proportion of missing highly-cited documents in Web of Science and Scopus is
much lower. Furthermore, in all areas, Spearman correlation coefficients of citation counts in
Google Scholar, as compared to Web of Science and Scopus citation counts, are remarkably strong
(.83-.99). The main conclusion is that the data about highly-cited documents available in the inclusive
database Google Scholar does indeed reveal significant coverage deficiencies in Web of Science
and Scopus in several areas of research. Therefore, using these selective databases to compute
bibliometric indicators based on counts of highly-cited documents might produce biased assessments
in poorly covered areas.
