The extraction of geological lineaments from digital satellite data is a fundamental application
in remote sensing. The location of geological lineaments such as faults and dykes are of interest
for a range of applications, particularly because of their association with hydrothermal mineralization.
Although a wide range of applications have utilized computer vision techniques, a standard workflow
for application of these techniques to mineral exploration is lacking. We present a framework for
extracting geological lineaments using computer vision techniques which is a combination of edge
detection and line extraction algorithms for extracting geological lineaments using optical
remote sensing data. It features ancillary computer vision techniques for reducing data dimensionality,
removing noise and enhancing the expression of lineaments. We test the proposed framework on Landsat
8 data of a mineral-rich portion of the Gascoyne Province in Western Australia using different dimension
reduction techniques and convolutional filters. To validate the results, the extracted lineaments
are compared to our manual photointerpretation and geologically mapped structures by the Geological
Survey of Western Australia (GSWA). The results show that the best correlation between our extracted
geological lineaments and the GSWA geological lineament map is achieved by applying a minimum noise
fraction transformation and a Laplacian filter. Application of a directional filter instead shows
a stronger correlation with the output of our manual photointerpretation and known sites of hydrothermal
mineralization. Hence, our framework using either filter can be used for mineral prospectivity
mapping in other regions where faults are exposed and observable in optical remote sensing data.
