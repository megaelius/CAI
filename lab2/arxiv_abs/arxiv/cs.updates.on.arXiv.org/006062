A body of literature has demonstrated that users' mental health conditions, such as depression
and anxiety, can be predicted from their social media language. There is still a gap in the scientific
understanding of how psychological stress is expressed on social media. Stress is one of the primary
underlying causes and correlates of chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions.
In this paper, we explore the language of psychological stress with a dataset of 601 social media
users, who answered the Perceived Stress Scale questionnaire and also consented to share their
Facebook and Twitter data. Firstly, we find that stressed users post about exhaustion, losing control,
increased self-focus and physical pain as compared to posts about breakfast, family-time, and
travel by users who are not stressed. Secondly, we find that Facebook language is more predictive
of stress than Twitter language. Thirdly, we demonstrate how the language based models thus developed
can be adapted and be scaled to measure county-level trends. Since county-level language is easily
available on Twitter using the Streaming API, we explore multiple domain adaptation algorithms
to adapt user-level Facebook models to Twitter language. We find that domain-adapted and scaled
social media-based measurements of stress outperform sociodemographic variables (age, gender,
race, education, and income), against ground-truth survey-based stress measurements, both at
the user- and the county-level in the U.S. Twitter language that scores higher in stress is also predictive
of poorer health, less access to facilities and lower socioeconomic status in counties. We conclude
with a discussion of the implications of using social media as a new tool for monitoring stress levels
of both individuals and counties.
