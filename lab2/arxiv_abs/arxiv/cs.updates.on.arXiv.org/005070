ESA operates the Sentinel-1 satellites, which provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of
Earth. Recorded Sentinel-1 data have shown a potential for remotely observing and monitoring local
conditions on broad acre fields. Remote sensing using Sentinel-1 have the potential to provide
daily updates on the current conditions in the individual fields and at the same time give an overview
of the agricultural areas in the region. Research depends on the ability of independent validation
of the presented results. In the case of the Sentinel-1 satellites, every researcher has access
to the same base dataset, and therefore independent validation is possible. Well documented research
performed with Sentinel-1 allow other research the ability to redo the experiments and either validate
or falsify presented findings. Based on current state-of-art research we have chosen to provide
a service for researchers in the agricultural domain. The service allows researchers the ability
to monitor local conditions by using the Sentinel-1 information combined with a priori knowledge
from broad acre fields. Correlating processed Sentinel-1 to the actual conditions is still a task
the individual researchers must perform to benefit from the service. In this paper, we presented
our methodology in translating sentinel-1 data to a level that is more accessible to researchers
in the agricultural field. The goal here was to make the data more easily available, so the primary
focus can be on correlating and comparing to measurements collected in the broadacre fields. We
illustrate the value of the service with three examples of the possible application areas. The presented
application examples are all based on Denmark, where we have processed all sentinel-1 scan from
since 2016.
