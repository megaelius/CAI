Coding diagnosis and procedures in medical records is a crucial process in the healthcare industry,
which includes the creation of accurate billings, receiving reimbursements from payers, and creating
standardized patient care records. In the United States, Billing and Insurance related activities
cost around $471 billion in 2012 which constitutes about 25% of all the U.S hospital spending. In
this paper, we report the performance of a natural language processing model that can map clinical
notes to medical codes, and predict final diagnosis from unstructured entries of history of present
illness, symptoms at the time of admission, etc. Previous studies have demonstrated that deep learning
models perform better at such mapping when compared to conventional machine learning models. Therefore,
we employed state-of-the-art deep learning method, ULMFiT on the largest emergency department
clinical notes dataset MIMIC III which has 1.2M clinical notes to select for the top-10 and top-50
diagnosis and procedure codes. Our models were able to predict the top-10 diagnoses and procedures
with 80.3% and 80.5% accuracy, whereas the top-50 ICD-9 codes of diagnosis and procedures are predicted
with 70.7% and 63.9% accuracy. Prediction of diagnosis and procedures from unstructured clinical
notes benefit human coders to save time, eliminate errors and minimize costs. With promising scores
from our present model, the next step would be to deploy this on a small-scale real-world scenario
and compare it with human coders as the gold standard. We believe that further research of this approach
can create highly accurate predictions that can ease the workflow in a clinical setting.
