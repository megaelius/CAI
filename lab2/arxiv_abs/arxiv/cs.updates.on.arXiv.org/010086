The convenient access to observational data enables learning causal effects draws without randomized
experiments, which draws increasing attention in many research areas such as economics, healthcare,
and education. For example, we can study how a medicine (treatment) would affect the health condition
(outcome) of a certain patient with electronic health records. To validate causal inference from
such data, we need to control confounding bias - the influence of variables which causally influence
both the treatment and the outcome. Existing work overwhelmingly relies on the unconfoundedness
assumption that there are all confounders can be measured. However, this assumption can be untenable.
In fact, an important fact ignored by the majority of existing work is that observational data can
come with network information that can be utilized to infer hidden confounders. For example, in
an observational study of the individual treatment effect of a medicine, instead of randomized
experiments, the medicine is assigned to individuals based on a series of factors. Some factors
(e.g., socioeconomic status) are challenging to measure and therefore become hidden confounders.
Fortunately, the socioeconomic status of an individual can be reflected by whom she is connected
in social networks. With this fact in mind, we aim to exploit the network structure to recognize patterns
of hidden confounders for the sake of learning causal effects from observational data. In this work,
we propose a novel causal inference framework, the network deconfounder, which learns representations
to unravel patterns of hidden confounders from the network structure. Empirically, we perform
extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the network deconfounder on various datasets.
