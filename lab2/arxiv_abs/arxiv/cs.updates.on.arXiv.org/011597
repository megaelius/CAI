GAN is a deep-learning based generative approach to generate contents such as images, languages
and speeches. Recently, studies have shown that GAN can also be applied to generative adversarial
attack examples to fool the machine-learning models. In comparison with the previous non-learning
adversarial example attack approaches, the GAN-based adversarial attack example approach can
generate the adversarial samples quickly using the GAN architecture every time facing a new sample
after training, but meanwhile needs to perturb the attack samples in great quantities, which results
in the unpractical application in reality. To address this issue, we propose a new approach, named
Few-Feature-Attack-GAN (FFA-GAN). FFA-GAN has a significant time-consuming advantage than
the non-learning adversarial samples approaches and a better non-zero-features performance
than the GANbased adversarial sample approaches. FFA-GAN can automatically generate the attack
samples in the black-box attack through the GAN architecture instead of the evolutional algorithms
or the other non-learning approaches. Besides, we introduce the mask mechanism into the generator
network of the GAN architecture to optimize the constraint issue, which can also be regarded as the
sparsity problem of the important features. During the training, the different weights of losses
of the generator are set in the different training phases to ensure the divergence of the two above
mentioned parallel networks of the generator. Experiments are made respectively on the structured
data sets KDD-Cup 1999 and CIC-IDS 2017, in which the dimensions of the data are relatively low, and
also on the unstructured data sets MNIST and CIFAR-10 with the data of the relatively high dimensions.
The results of the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed
approach.
