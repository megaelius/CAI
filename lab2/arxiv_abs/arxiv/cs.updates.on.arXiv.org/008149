Quantifying uncertainty in predictive simulations for real-world problems is of paramount importance
- and far from trivial, mainly due to the large number of stochastic parameters and significant computational
requirements. Adaptive sparse grid approximations are an established approach to overcome these
challenges. However, standard adaptivity is based on global information, thus properties such
as lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality or anisotropic coupling of the input directions,
which are common in practical applications, are not fully exploited. We propose a novel structure-exploiting
dimension-adaptive sparse grid approximation methodology using Sobol' decompositions in each
subspace to introduce a sensitivity scoring system to drive the adaptive process. By employing
local sensitivity information, we explore and exploit the anisotropic coupling of the stochastic
inputs as well as the lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality. The proposed approach is generic,
i.e., it can be formulated in terms of arbitrary approximation operators and point sets. In particular,
we consider sparse grid interpolation and pseudo-spectral projection constructed on (L)-Leja
sequences. The power and usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to the
analysis of gyrokinetic microinstabilities in fusion plasmas, one of the key scientific problems
in plasma physics and fusion research. In this context, it is shown that a 12D parameter space can
be scanned very efficiently, gaining more than an order of magnitude in computational cost over
the standard adaptive approach. Moreover, it allows for the uncertainty propagation and sensitivity
analysis in higher-dimensional plasma microturbulence problems, which would be almost impossible
to tackle with standard screening approaches.
