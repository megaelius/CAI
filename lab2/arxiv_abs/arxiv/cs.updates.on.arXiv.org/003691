We consider the load-balancing design for forwarding incoming flows to access points (APs) in high-density
wireless networks with both channel fading and flow-level dynamics, where each incoming flow has
a certain amount of service demand and leaves the system once its service request is complete (referred
as flow-level dynamic model). The efficient load-balancing design is strongly needed for supporting
high-quality wireless connections in high-density areas. Despite the presence of a variety of
earlier works on the design and analysis of the load-balancing schemes in wireless networks, there
does not exist a work on the load-balancing design in the realistic flow-level dynamic model. In
this work, we propose a Join-the-Least-Workload (JLW) Algorithm that always forwards the incoming
flows to the AP with the smallest workload in the presence of flow-level dynamics. However, our considered
flow-level dynamic model differs from traditional queueing model for wireless networks in the
following two aspects: (1) the dynamics of the flows is short-term and flows will leave the network
once they received the desired amount of service; (2) each individual flow faces an independent
channel fading. These differences pose significant challenges on the system performance analysis.
To tackle these challenges, we perform Lyapunov-drift-based analysis of the stochastic network
taking into account sharp flow-level dynamics. Our analysis reveals that our proposed JLW Algorithm
not only achieves maximum system throughput, but also minimizes the total system workload in heavy-traffic
regimes. Moreover, we observe from both our theoretical and simulation results that the mean total
workload performance under the proposed JLW Algorithm does not degrade as the number of APs increases,
which is strongly desirable in high-density wireless networks.
