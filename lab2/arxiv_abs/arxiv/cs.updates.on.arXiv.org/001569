Chest X-Rays (CXRs) are widely used for diagnosing abnormalities in the heart and lung area. Automatically
detecting these abnormalities with high accuracy could greatly enhance real world diagnosis processes.
Lack of standard publicly available dataset and benchmark studies, however, makes it difficult
to compare various detection methods. In order to overcome these difficulties, we have used a publicly
available Indiana CXR, JSRT and Shenzhen dataset and studied the performance of known deep convolutional
network (DCN) architectures on different abnormalities. We find that the same DCN architecture
doesn't perform well across all abnormalities. Shallow features or earlier layers consistently
provide higher detection accuracy compared to deep features. We have also found ensemble models
to improve classification significantly compared to single model. Combining these insight, we
report the highest accuracy on chest X-Ray abnormality detection on these datasets. We find that
for cardiomegaly detection, the deep learning method improves the accuracy by a staggering 17 percentage
point compared to rule based methods. We applied the techniques to the problem of tuberculosis detection
on a different dataset and achieved the highest accuracy. Our localization experiments using these
trained classifiers show that for spatially spread out abnormalities like cardiomegaly and pulmonary
edema, the network can localize the abnormalities successfully most of the time. One remarkable
result of the cardiomegaly localization is that the heart and its surrounding region is most responsible
for cardiomegaly detection, in contrast to the rule based models where the ratio of heart and lung
area is used as the measure. We believe that through deep learning based classification and localization,
we will discover many more interesting features in medical image diagnosis that are not considered
traditionally.
