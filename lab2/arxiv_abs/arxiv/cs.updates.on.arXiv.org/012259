Recent observations with varied schedules and types (moving average, snapshot, or regularly spaced)
can help to improve streamflow forecast but it is difficult to effectively integrate them. Based
on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested different formulations in a flexible
method we call data integration (DI) to integrate recently discharge measurements to improve forecast.
DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit.
DI can ubiquitously elevate streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a continental-scale
median Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.86. Integrating moving-average discharge, discharge
from a few days ago, or even average discharge of the last calendar month could all improve daily forecast.
It turned out, directly using lagged observations as inputs was comparable in performance to using
the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting
LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI, the original LSTM worked well in mountainous regions
and snow-dominated regions, but less so in regions with low discharge volumes (due to either low
precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity) and large inter-annual storage variability.
DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation: it greatly reduced baseflow bias
in groundwater-dominated western basins; it also improved the peaks for basins with dynamical
surface water storage, e.g., the Prairie Potholes or Great Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot
help high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks. There is much promise with a deep-learning-based
forecast paradigm due to its performance, automation, efficiency, and flexibility.
