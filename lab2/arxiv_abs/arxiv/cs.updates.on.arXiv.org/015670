Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated a great potential for automatically solving decision-making
problems in complex uncertain environments. RL proposes a computational approach that allows
learning through interaction in an environment with stochastic behavior, where agents take actions
to maximize some cumulative short-term and long-term rewards. Some of the most impressive results
have been shown in Game Theory where agents exhibited superhuman performance in games like Go or
Starcraft 2, which led to its gradual adoption in many other domains including Cloud Computing.
Therefore, RL appears as a promising approach for Autoscaling in Cloud since it is possible to learn
transparent (with no human intervention), dynamic (no static plans), and adaptable (constantly
updated) resource management policies. These are three important distinctive aspects to consider
in comparison with other widely used autoscaling policies that are defined as ad-hoc way or statically
computed as in solutions based on meta-heuristics. Particularly, workflow autoscaling exploits
the Cloud elasticity to optimize the execution of workflows according to given optimization criteria.
This is a decision-making problem that demands to decide when and how to scale-up/down computational
resources; and how to assign them to the upcoming processing workload. Such actions have to be taken
considering some optimization criteria in the Cloud, a dynamic and uncertain environment. Motivated
by this, many works apply RL to the autoscaling problem in Cloud. In this work, we survey exhaustively
those proposals from major venues, and uniformly compare them based on a set of proposed taxonomies.
We also discuss open problems and provide a prospect of future research in the area.
