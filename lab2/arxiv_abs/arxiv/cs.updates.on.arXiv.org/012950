Network slicing is considered one of the key enabling technologies for 5G due to its ability to customize
and "slice" a common resource to support diverse services and verticals.This paper introduces
a novel inter-operator network slicing framework in which multiple mobile network operators (MNOs)
can coordinate and jointly slice their accessible spectrum resources in both licensed and unlicensed
bands. For licensed band slicing, we propose an inter-operator spectrum aggregation method that
allows two or more MNOs to cooperate and share their licensed bands to support a common set of service
types. We then consider the sharing of unlicensed bands. Because all MNOs enjoy equal rights to accessing
these bands, we introduce the concept of right sharing for MNOs to share and trade their spectrum
access rights. We develop a {\em modified back-of-the-envelope (mBoE) method} for MNOs to evaluate
their {\em Value-of-Rights (VoR)} when coexisting with other wireless technologies. A {\em network
slicing game} based on the overlapping coalition formation game is formulated to investigate cooperation
between MNOs. We prove that our proposed game always has at least one stable slicing structure that
maximizes the social welfare. To implement our proposed framework without requiring MNOs to reveal
private information to other MNOs, we develop a distributed algorithm called D-ADMM-PVS. Performance
evaluation of our proposed framework is provided using a discrete-event simulator that is driven
by real MNO deployment scenarios based on over 400 base station locations deployed by two primary
cellular operators in the city of Dublin.Numerical results show that our proposed framework can
almost double the capacity for all supported services for each MNO in an urban setting.
