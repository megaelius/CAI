Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising Future Internet architecture to support content distribution.
Its inherent addressless routing paradigm brings valuable characteristics to improve the transmission
robustness and efficiency, e.g. users are enabled to download content from multiple providers
concurrently. However, multipath transmission NDN is different from that in Multipath TCP, i.e.
the "paths" in NDN are transparent to and uncontrollable by users. To this end, the user controls
the traffic on all transmission paths as an entirety, which leads to a noticeable problem of low bandwidth
utilization. In particular, the congestion of a certain path will trigger the traffic reduction
on the other transmission paths that are underutilized. Some solutions have been proposed by letting
routers balance the loads of different paths to avoid congesting a certain path prematurely. However,
the complexity of obtaining an optimal load balancing solution (of solving a Multi-Commodity Flow
problem) becomes higher with the increasing network size, which limits the universal NDN deployments.
This paper introduces a compromising solution - Path-specified Transport Protocol (PTP). PTP
supports both the label switching and the addressless routing schemes. Specifically, the label
switching scheme facilitates users to precisely control the traffic on each transmission path,
and the addressless routing scheme maintains the valuable feature of retrieving content from any
provider to guarantee robustness. As the traffic on a transmission path can be explicitly controlled
by consumers, load balancing is no longer needed in routers, which reduce the computational burden
of routers and consequently increase the system scalability. The experimental results show that
PTP significantly increases the users' downloading rates and improved the network throughput.
