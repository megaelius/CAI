Understanding the long-term impact that changes in a city's transportation infrastructure have
on its spatial interactions remains a challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the real
impact may not be revealed in static or aggregated mobility measures, as these are remarkably robust
to perturbations, potentially inducing urban planners to underestimate the effect of such infrastructures
on the fabric of the city. More generally, the lack of longitudinal, cross-sectional data demonstrating
the evolution of spatial interactions at a meaningful urban scale also hinders us from evaluating
the sensitivity of movement indicators, limiting our capacity to understand the evolution of urban
mobility in depth. Using very large mobility records distributed over three years we quantify the
impact of the completion of a metro line extension: the circle line (CCL) in Singapore. We find that
the commonly used movement indicators are almost identical before and after the project was completed.
However, in comparing the temporal community structure across years, we do observe significant
differences in the spatial reorganization of the affected geographical areas. The completion
of CCL established better connectivity between southern and western areas in Singapore, reducing
the mutability of the nearby regions significantly. These changes in locality are dynamic, and
characterized by the rate at which geographical areas change community membership over short time-scales,
offering us a different approach to identify and analyze the long-term impact of new infrastructures
on cities and their evolution dynamics.
