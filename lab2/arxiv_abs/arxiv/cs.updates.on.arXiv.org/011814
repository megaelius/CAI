Background: Haplotypes, the ordered lists of single nucleotide variations that distinguish chromosomal
sequences from their homologous pairs, may reveal an individual's susceptibility to hereditary
and complex diseases and affect how our bodies respond to therapeutic drugs. Reconstructing haplotypes
of an individual from short sequencing reads is an NP-hard problem that becomes even more challenging
in the case of polyploids. While increasing lengths of sequencing reads and insert sizes {\color{black}
helps improve accuracy of reconstruction}, it also exacerbates computational complexity of the
haplotype assembly task. This has motivated the pursuit of algorithmic frameworks capable of accurate
yet efficient assembly of haplotypes from high-throughput sequencing data. Results: We propose
a novel graphical representation of sequencing reads and pose the haplotype assembly problem as
an instance of community detection on a spatial random graph. To this end, we construct a graph where
each read is a node with an unknown community label associating the read with the haplotype it samples.
Haplotype reconstruction can then be thought of as a two-step procedure: first, one recovers the
community labels on the nodes (i.e., the reads), and then uses the estimated labels to assemble the
haplotypes. Based on this observation, we propose ComHapDet - a novel assembly algorithm for diploid
and ployploid haplotypes which allows both bialleleic and multi-allelic variants. Conclusions:
Performance of the proposed algorithm is benchmarked on simulated as well as experimental data
obtained by sequencing Chromosome $5$ of tetraploid biallelic \emph{Solanum-Tuberosum} (Potato).
The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and that it compares favorably with
the existing techniques.
