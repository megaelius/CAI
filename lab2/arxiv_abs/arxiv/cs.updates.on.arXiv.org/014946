Precipitation data from rain gauges is fundamental across many lines of enquiry within hydrology
and environmental science. A widespread problem with data sourced from remote sensors is that of
missing data and gaps in established datasets. The accurate recovery of missing data is critical
to maximise information gain from data sources, with requirements for environmental data at high
temporal resolution ever increasing. Precipitation data collected at sub-hourly resolution
represents specific challenges for data recovery by being largely stochastic in nature and highly
unbalanced in duration of rain vs non-rain. Here we present a two-step analysis utilising current
machine learning techniques for imputing precipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by
devolving the task into (a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the
absolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in the UK, this machine
learning process produces more accurate predictions for recovering precipitation data than an
established surface fitting technique utilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available
features for the training of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the integration
of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain gauges providing the highest performance.
This method informs machine learning models by utilising information in concurrently collected
environmental data to make accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear
relationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at sub-hourly resolutions.
Such pipelines for data recovery can be developed and deployed for highly automated and near instantaneous
imputation of missing values in ongoing datasets at high temporal resolutions.
