Learning theories emphasize the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators in curricula,
and games are a promising way to provide both while constructing the game and presenting or sharing
it in public or with a community. New technologies and the emerging mobile gaming sector further
the case that learning should be promoted everywhere and anytime. What seems to be a promising opportunity
for all pupils to learn coding in an entertaining way raises the question of whether such game based
concepts also help to fix the gender gap of women in IT related fields. Gender differences are already
present in secondary schools. These are the years where first career choices but also low levels
of participation in technical subjects occur. To address this gender bias, a goal of the European
project No One Left Behind (NOLB) was to integrate Pocket Code, an app developed by Catrobat, a free
open source non-profit project at the University of Technology in Graz/Austria, into different
school subjects, thus making coding more accessible and attractive to female pupils. During the
period of this project (2015-2017), teachers were supported to guide their pupils in the learning
processes by constructing ideas and realizing them through game design. For this paper an analysis
of submitted programs according to their game design has been performed. In detail, the evaluation
considered formal game elements, gaming structures, and used graphics, as well as Pocket Code specific
aspects. The programs analysis showed commonly used design patterns by genders and suggests preferred
game design characteristics of female teenagers. This analysis helps to build a more creative and
inclusive Game Development-Based Learning (GDBL) environment that provides room for self-expression
and inspires by building on intrinsic and extrinsic motivators by constructing personal experiences.
