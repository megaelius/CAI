In e-commerce, product content, especially product images have a significant influence on a customer's
journey from product discovery to evaluation and finally, purchase decision. Since many e-commerce
retailers sell items from other third-party marketplace sellers besides their own, the content
published by both internal and external content creators needs to be monitored and enriched, wherever
possible. Despite guidelines and warnings, product listings that contain offensive and non-compliant
images continue to enter catalogs. Offensive and non-compliant content can include a wide range
of objects, logos, and banners conveying violent, sexually explicit, racist, or promotional messages.
Such images can severely damage the customer experience, lead to legal issues, and erode the company
brand. In this paper, we present a machine learning driven offensive and non-compliant image detection
system for extremely large e-commerce catalogs. This system proactively detects and removes such
content before they are published to the customer-facing website. This paper delves into the unique
challenges of applying machine learning to real-world data from retail domain with hundreds of
millions of product images. We demonstrate how we resolve the issue of non-compliant content that
appears across tens of thousands of product categories. We also describe how we deal with the sheer
variety in which each single non-compliant scenario appears. This paper showcases a number of practical
yet unique approaches such as representative training data creation that are critical to solve
an extremely rarely occurring problem. In summary, our system combines state-of-the-art image
classification and object detection techniques, and fine tunes them with internal data to develop
a solution customized for a massive, diverse, and constantly evolving product catalog.
