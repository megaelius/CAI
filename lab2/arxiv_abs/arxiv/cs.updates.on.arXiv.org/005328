Tablet computers are becoming ubiquitously available at home or school for young children to complement
education or entertainment. However, parents of children aged 6-11 often believe that children
are too young to face or comprehend online privacy issues, and often take a protective approach to
restrict or monitor what children can access online, instead of discussing privacy issues with
children. Parents work hard to protect their children's online safety. However, little is known
how much parents are aware of the risks associated with the implicit personal data collection by
the first- or third-party companies behind the mobile `apps' used by their children, and hence how
well parents can safeguard their children from this kind of risks. Parents have always been playing
a pivotal role in mitigating children's interactions with digital technologies --- from TV to game
consoles, to personal computers --- but the rapidly changing technologies are posing challenges
for parents to keep up with. There is a pressing need to understand how much parents are aware of privacy
risks concerning the use of tablets and how they are managing them for their primary school-aged
young children. At the same time, we must also reach out to the children themselves, who are on the
frontline of these technologies, to learn how capable they are to recognise risks and how well they
are supported by their parents to cope with these risks. Therefore, in the summer of 2017, we conducted
face-to-face interviews with 12 families in Oxfordshire and an online survey with 250 parents.
This report summarises our key findings of these two studies.
