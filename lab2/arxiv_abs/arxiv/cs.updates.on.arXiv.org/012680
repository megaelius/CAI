Cyber hygiene measures are often recommended for strengthening an organization's security posture,
especially for protecting against social engineering attacks that target the human element. However,
the related recommendations are typically the same for all organizations and their employees,
regardless of the nature and the level of risk for different groups of users. Building upon an existing
cybersecurity investment model, this paper presents a tool for optimal selection of cyber hygiene
safeguards, which we refer as the Optimal Safeguards Tool. The model combines game theory and combinatorial
optimization taking into account the probability of each user group to being attacked, the value
of assets accessible by each group, and the efficacy of each control for a particular group. The model
considers indirect cost as the time employees could require for learning and training against an
implemented control. Utilizing a game-theoretic framework to support the Knapsack optimization
problem permits us to optimally select safeguards' application levels minimizing the aggregated
expected damage within a security investment budget. We evaluate OST in a healthcare domain use
case. The Critical Internet Security Control group 17 for implementing security awareness and
training programs for employees belonging to the ICT, clinical and administration personnel of
a hospital. We compare the strategies implemented by OST against alternative common-sense defending
approaches for three different types of attackers: Nash, Weighted and Opportunistic. Nash defending
strategies are consistently better than the competing strategies for all attacker types with a
minor exception where the Nash defending strategy performs at least as good as other common-sense
approaches.
