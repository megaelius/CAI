In the seminal work "Pomset logic: A noncommutative extension of classical linear logic" Retor\'e
introduced Pomset logic, an extension of linear logic with a self-dual noncommutative connective.
Pomset logic is defined by means of proof-nets, later a deep inference system BV was designed for
this extension, but equivalence of system has not been proven up to now. As for a sequent calculus
formulation, it has not been known for either of these logics, and there are convincing arguments
that such a sequent calculus in the usual sense simply does not exist for them. In an on-going work
on semantics we discovered a system similar to Pomset logic, where a noncommutative connective
is no longer self-dual. Pomset logic appears as a degeneration, when the class of models is restricted.
This will be shown in a forthcoming paper. Motivated by these semantic considerations, in the current
work we define a semicommutative multiplicative linear logic, which is multiplicative linear
logic extended with two nonisomorphic noncommutative connectives (not to be confused with very
different Abrusci-Ruet noncommutative logic). We develop a syntax of proof-nets and show how this
logic degenerates to Pomset logic. However, a more important problem than just finding yet another
noncommutative logic is finding a sequent calculus for this logic. We introduce decorated sequents,
which are sequents equipped with an extra structure of a binary relation of reachability on formulas.
We define a decorated sequent calculus for semicommutative logic and prove that it is cut-free,
sound and complete. This is adapted to "degenerate" variations, including Pomset logic. Thus,
in particular, we give a (sort of) sequent calculus formulation for Pomset logic, which is one of
the key results of the paper.
