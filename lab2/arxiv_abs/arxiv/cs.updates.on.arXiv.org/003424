The extensive use of social media for sharing and obtaining information has resulted in the development
of topic detection models to facilitate the comprehension of the overwhelming amount of short and
distributed posts. Probabilistic topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet allocation, represent
topics as sets of terms that are useful for many automated processes. However, the determination
of what a topic is about is left as a further task. Alternatively, techniques that produce summaries
are human comprehensible, but less suitable for automated processing. This work proposes an approach
that utilizes Linked Open Data (LOD) resources to extract semantically represented topics from
collections of microposts. The proposed approach utilizes entity linking to identify the elements
of topics from microposts. The elements are related through co-occurrence graphs, which are processed
to yield topics. The topics are represented using an ontology that is introduced for this purpose.
A prototype of the approach is used to identify topics from 11 datasets consisting of more than one
million posts collected from Twitter during various events, such as the 2016 US election debates
and the death of Carrie Fisher. The characteristics of the approach and more than 5 thousand generated
topics are described in detail. A human evaluation of topics from 30 randomly selected intervals
resulted in a precision of 81.0% and F1 score of 93.3%. Furthermore, they are compared with topics
generated from the same datasets with two different kinds of topic models. The potentials of semantic
topics in revealing information, that is not otherwise easily observable, is demonstrated with
semantic queries of various complexities.
