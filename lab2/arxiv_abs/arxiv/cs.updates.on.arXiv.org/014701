Distributed graph filters have found applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to solve
distributed tasks such as consensus, signal denoising, and reconstruction. However, when employed
over WSN, the graph filters should deal with the network limited energy, processing, and communication
capabilities. Quantization plays a fundamental role to improve the latter but its effects on distributed
graph filtering are little understood. WSNs are also prone to random link losses due to noise and
interference. The filter output is affected by both the quantization error and the topological
randomness error, which, if it is not properly accounted in the filter design phase, may lead to an
accumulated error through the filtering iterations and significantly degrade the performance.
In this paper, we analyze how quantization affects distributed graph filtering over both time-invariant
and time-varying graphs. We bring insights on the quantization effects for the two most common graph
filters: the finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph filter.
We devise theoretical performance guarantees on the filter performance when the quantization
stepsize is fixed or changes dynamically over the filtering iterations. For FIR filters, we show
that a dynamic quantization stepsize leads to more control on the quantization noise than the fixed-stepsize
quantization. For ARMA graph filters, we show that decreasing the quantization stepsize over the
iterations reduces the quantization noise to zero at the steady-state. In addition, we propose
robust filter design strategies that minimize the quantization noise for both time-invariant
and time-varying networks. Numerical experiments on synthetic and two real data sets corroborate
our findings and show the different trade-offs between quantization bits, filter order, and robustness
to topological randomness.
