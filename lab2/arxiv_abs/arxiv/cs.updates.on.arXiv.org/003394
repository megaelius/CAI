Since the 1990s, the number of personal computing devices has exploded. Today we collectively own
billions of devices whose computing resources are underused the majority of the time. These resources
are either time-consuming to leverage or not supported by other mainstream distributed computing
approaches. We propose to revisit volunteer computing, where volunteers from around the world
contribute the computing resources of their devices for high-profile projects, with a more personal
focus along these main dimensions: nature, scope, and length of the project tasks; relationship
with the volunteers; ownership of the participating devices; and ownership and complexity of the
platform and technologies. We present our position in contrast to other popular distributed computing
approaches, in order of increasing similarity. Our approach is both original and it highlights
the historical lack of focus on the limiting effects of complexity on the computing platforms: this
complexity limits the ability of their users to deploy and repurpose the platforms in evolving contexts.
To show the viability of the approach we implemented Pando, a personal volunteer computing platform
for the Web. This tool now enables scientists and programmers to quickly use their personal devices
and those of their friends for accelerating their computations by writing a single JavaScript function.
It can be described with only a few abstractions. Tools built for personal volunteer computing,
such as Pando, may reduce the need for acquiring additional devices, and therefore reduce pressure
on resources needed to produce them, because they tap in the abundance of computing resources that
already exist. Moreover, they may spread the benefits of computing more evenly by serving the needs
of communities and individuals that are not served by other mainstream approaches.
