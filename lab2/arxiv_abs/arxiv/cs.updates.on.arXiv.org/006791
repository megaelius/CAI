We evaluate the impact of probabilistically-constructed digital identity data collected from
Sep. to Dec. 2017 (approx.), in the context of Lookalike-targeted campaigns. The backbone of this
study is a large set of probabilistically-constructed "identities", represented as small bags
of cookies and mobile ad identifiers with associated metadata, that are likely all owned by the same
underlying user. The identity data allows to generate "identity-based", rather than "identifier-based",
user models, giving a fuller picture of the interests of the users underlying the identifiers. We
employ off-policy techniques to evaluate the potential of identity-powered lookalike models
without incurring the risk of allowing untested models to direct large amounts of ad spend or the
large cost of performing A/B tests. We add to historical work on off-policy evaluation by noting
a significant type of "finite-sample bias" that occurs for studies combining modestly-sized datasets
and evaluation metrics involving rare events (e.g., conversions). We illustrate this bias using
a simulation study that later informs the handling of inverse propensity weights in our analyses
on real data. We demonstrate significant lift in identity-powered lookalikes versus an identity-ignorant
baseline: on average ~70% lift in conversion rate. This rises to factors of ~(4-32)x for identifiers
having little data themselves, but that can be inferred to belong to users with substantial data
to aggregate across identifiers. This implies that identity-powered user modeling is especially
important in the context of identifiers having very short lifespans (i.e., frequently churned
cookies). Our work motivates and informs the use of probabilistically-constructed identities
in marketing. It also deepens the canon of examples in which off-policy learning has been employed
to evaluate the complex systems of the internet economy.
