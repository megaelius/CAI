The goal in {\em reconfiguration problems} is to compute a {\em gradual transformation} between
two feasible solutions of a problem such that all intermediate solutions are also feasible. In the
{\em Matching Reconfiguration Problem} (MRP), proposed in a pioneering work by Ito et al.\ from
2008, we are given a graph $G$ and two matchings $M$ and $M'$, and we are asked whether there is a sequence
of matchings in $G$ starting with $M$ and ending at $M'$, each resulting from the previous one by either
adding or deleting a single edge in $G$, without ever going through a matching of size $< \min\{|M|,|M'|\}-1$.
Ito et al.\ gave a polynomial time algorithm for the problem. In this paper we introduce a natural
generalization of the MRP that depends on an integer parameter $\Delta \ge 1$: here we are allowed
to make $\Delta$ changes to the current solution rather than 1 at each step of the {transformation
procedure}. There is always a valid sequence of matchings transforming $M$ to $M'$ if $\Delta$ is
sufficiently large, and naturally we would like to minimize $\Delta$. We first devise an optimal
transformation procedure for unweighted matching with $\Delta = 3$, and then extend it to weighted
matchings to achieve asymptotically optimal guarantees. The running time of these procedures
is linear. We further demonstrate the applicability of this generalized problem to dynamic graph
matchings. In this area, the number of changes to the maintained matching per update step (the \emph{recourse
bound}) is an important quality measure. Nevertheless, the \emph{worst-case} recourse bounds
of almost all known dynamic matching algorithms are prohibitively large, much larger than the corresponding
update times. We fill in this gap via a surprisingly simple black-box reduction: Any dynamic algorithm
