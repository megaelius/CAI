We analyze ecological systems that are influenced by random environmental fluctuations. We first
provide general conditions which ensure that the species coexist and the system converges to a unique
invariant probability measure (stationary distribution). Since it is usually impossible to characterize
this invariant probability measure analytically, we develop a powerful method for numerically
approximating invariant probability measures. This allows us to shed light upon how the various
parameters of the ecosystem impact the stationary distribution. We analyze different types of
environmental fluctuations. At first we study ecosystems modeled by stochastic differential
equations. In the second setting we look at piecewise deterministic Markov processes. These are
processes where one follows a system of differential equations for a random time, after which the
environmental state changes, and one follows a different set of differential equations -- this
procedure then gets repeated indefinitely. Finally, we look at stochastic differential equations
with switching, which take into account both the white noise fluctuations and the random environmental
switches. Many natural systems exhibit dynamics on multiple time scales. We study how different
time scales can influence our persistence results. As applications of our theoretical and numerical
analysis, we look at competitive Lotka--Volterra, Beddington-DeAngelis predator-prey, and
rock-paper-scissors dynamics. We highlight new biological insights by analyzing the stationary
distributions of the ecosystems and by seeing how various types of environmental fluctuations
influence the long term fate of populations.
