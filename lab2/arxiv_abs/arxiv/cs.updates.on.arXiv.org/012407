Ubiquitous sensors and smart devices from factories and communities are generating massive amounts
of data, and ever-increasing computing power is driving the core of computation and services from
the cloud to the edge of the network. As an important enabler broadly changing people's lives, from
face recognition to ambitious smart factories and cities, developments of artificial intelligence
(especially deep learning, DL) based applications and services are thriving. However, due to efficiency
and latency issues, the current cloud computing service architecture hinders the vision of "providing
artificial intelligence for every person and every organization at everywhere". Thus, unleashing
DL services using resources at the network edge near the data sources has emerged as a desirable solution.
Therefore, edge intelligence, aiming to facilitate the deployment of DL services by edge computing,
has received significant attention. In addition, DL, as the representative technique of artificial
intelligence, can be integrated into edge computing frameworks to build intelligent edge for dynamic,
adaptive edge maintenance and management. With regard to mutually beneficial edge intelligence
and intelligent edge, this paper introduces and discusses: 1) the application scenarios of both;
2) the practical implementation methods and enabling technologies, namely DL training and inference
in the customized edge computing framework; 3) existing challenges and future trends of more pervasive
and fine-grained intelligence. We believe that by consolidating information scattered across
the communication, networking, and DL areas, this survey can help readers to understand the connections
between enabling technologies while promoting further discussions on the fusion of edge intelligence
and intelligent edge, i.e., Edge DL.
