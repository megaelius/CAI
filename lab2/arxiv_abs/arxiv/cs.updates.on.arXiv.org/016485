Search advertising, a popular method for online marketing, has been employed to improve health
by eliciting positive behavioral change. However, writing effective advertisements requires
expertise and experimentation, which may not be available to health authorities wishing to elicit
such changes, especially when dealing with public health crises such as epidemic outbreaks. Here
we develop a framework, comprised of two neural networks models, that automatically generate ads.
First, it employs a generator model, which create ads from web pages. It then employs a translation
model, which transcribes ads to improve performance. We trained the networks using 114K health-related
ads shown on Microsoft Advertising. We measure ads performance using the click-through rates (CTR).
Our experiments show that the generated advertisements received approximately the same CTR as
human-authored ads. The marginal contribution of the generator model was, on average, 28\% lower
than that of human-authored ads, while the translator model received, on average, 32\% more clicks
than human-authored ads. Our analysis shows that the translator model produces ads reflecting
higher values of psychological attributes associated with a user action, including higher valance
and arousal, and more calls-to-actions. In contrast, levels of these attributes in ads produced
by the generator model are similar to those of human-authored ads. Our results demonstrate the ability
to automatically generate useful advertisements for the health domain. We believe that our work
offers health authorities an improved ability to nudge people towards healthier behaviors while
saving the time and cost needed to build effective advertising campaigns.
