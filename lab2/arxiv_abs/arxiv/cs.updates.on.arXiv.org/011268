We study the NP-hard \textsc{$k$-Sparsest Cut} problem ($k$SC) in which, given an undirected graph
$G = (V, E)$ and a parameter $k$, the objective is to partition vertex set into $k$ subsets whose maximum
edge expansion is minimized. Herein, the edge expansion of a subset $S \subseteq V$ is defined as
the sum of the weights of edges exiting $S$ divided by the number of vertices in $S$. Another problem
that has been investigated is \textsc{$k$-Small-Set Expansion} problem ($k$SSE), which aims
to find a subset with minimum edge expansion with a restriction on the size of the subset. We extend
previous studies on $k$SC and $k$SSE by inspecting their parameterized complexity. On the positive
side, we present two FPT algorithms for both $k$SSE and 2SC problems where in the first algorithm
we consider the parameter treewidth of the input graph and uses exponential space, and in the second
we consider the parameter vertex cover number of the input graph and uses polynomial space. Moreover,
we consider the unweighted version of the $k$SC problem where $k \geq 2$ is fixed and proposed two
FPT algorithms with parameters treewidth and vertex cover number of the input graph. We also propose
a randomized FPT algorithm for $k$SSE when parameterized by $k$ and the maximum degree of the input
graph combined. Its derandomization is done efficiently. \noindent On the negative side, first
we prove that for every fixed integer $k,\tau\geq 3$, the problem $k$SC is NP-hard for graphs with
vertex cover number at most $\tau$. We also show that $k$SC is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the
treewidth of the input graph and the number~$k$ of components combined using a reduction from \textsc{Unary
Bin Packing}. Furthermore, we prove that $k$SC remains NP-hard for graphs with maximum degree three
and also graphs with degeneracy two. Finally, we prove that the unweighted $k$SSE is W[1]-hard for
the parameter $k$.
