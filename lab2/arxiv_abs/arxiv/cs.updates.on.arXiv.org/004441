In this paper, we propose an image re-sampling compression method by learning virtual codec network
(VCN) to resolve the non-differentiable problem of quantization function for image compression.
Here, the image re-sampling not only refers to image full-resolution re-sampling but also low-resolution
re-sampling. We generalize this method for standard-compliant image compression (SCIC) framework
and deep neural networks based compression (DNNC) framework. Specifically, an input image is measured
by re-sampling network (RSN) network to get re-sampled vectors. Then, these vectors are directly
quantized in the feature space in SCIC, or discrete cosine transform coefficients of these vectors
are quantized to further improve coding efficiency in DNNC. At the encoder, the quantized vectors
or coefficients are losslessly compressed by arithmetic coding. At the receiver, the decoded vectors
are utilized to restore input image by image decoder network (IDN). In order to train RSN network
and IDN network together in an end-to-end fashion, our VCN network intimates projection from the
re-sampled vectors to the IDN-decoded image. As a result, gradients from IDN network to RSN network
can be approximated by VCN network's gradient. Because dimension reduction can be further achieved
by quantization in some dimensional space after image re-sampling within auto-encoder architecture,
we can well initialize our networks from pre-trained auto-encoder networks. Through extensive
experiments and analysis, it is verified that the proposed method has more effectiveness and versatility
than many state-of-the-art approaches.
