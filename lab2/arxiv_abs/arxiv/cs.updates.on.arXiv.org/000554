A subfamily ${\cal F}'$ of a set family ${\cal F}$ is said to $q$-{\em represent} ${\cal F}$ if for
every $A \in {\cal F}$ and $B$ of size $q$ such that $A \cap B = \emptyset$ there exists a set $A' \in {\cal
F}'$ such that $A' \cap B = \emptyset$. In this paper, we consider the efficient computation of $q$-representative
sets for {\em product} families ${\cal F}$. A family ${\cal F}$ is a product family if there exist
families ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$ such that ${\cal F} = \{A \cup B~:~A \in {\cal A}, B \in {\cal B},
A \cap B = \emptyset\}$. Our main technical contribution is an algorithm which given ${\cal A}$,
${\cal B}$ and $q$ computes a $q$-representative family ${\cal F}'$ of ${\cal F}$. The running time
of our algorithm is sublinear in $|{\cal F}|$ for many choices of ${\cal A}$, ${\cal B}$ and $q$ which
occur naturally in several dynamic programming algorithms. We also give an algorithm for the computation
of $q$-representative sets for product families ${\cal F}$ in the more general setting where $q$-representation
also involves independence in a matroid in addition to disjointness. This algorithm considerably
outperforms the naive approach where one first computes ${\cal F}$ from ${\cal A}$ and ${\cal B}$,
and then computes the $q$-representative family ${\cal F}'$ from ${\cal F}$. We give two applications
of our new algorithms for computing $q$-representative sets for product families. The first is
a $3.8408^{k}n^{O(1)}$ deterministic algorithm for the Multilinear Monomial Detection ($k$-MlD)
problem. The second is a significant improvement of deterministic dynamic programming algorithms
for "connectivity problems" on graphs of bounded treewidth.
