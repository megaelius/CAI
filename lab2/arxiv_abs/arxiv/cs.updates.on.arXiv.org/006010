This paper is a survey and an analysis of different ways of using deep learning (deep artificial neural
networks) to generate musical content. We propose a methodology based on five dimensions for our
analysis: - Objective - What musical content is to be generated? E.g., melody, polyphony, accompaniment
and counterpoint - For what destination and for what use? To be performed by a human(s) or by a machine.
- Representation - What are the concepts to be manipulated? E.g., waveform, spectrogram, note,
chord, meter, and beat - What format is to be used? E.g., MIDI, piano roll and text - How will the representation
be encoded? E.g., scalar, one-hot, and many-hot. - Architecture - What type of deep neural network
is to be used? E.g., feedforward network, recurrent network, autoencoder, and generative adversarial
networks. - Challenges - What are the limitations\index and open challenges? E.g., variability,
interactivity and creativity. - Strategy - How do we model and control the process of generation?
E.g., single-step feedforward, decoder feedforward, sampling and input manipulation. For each
dimension, we conduct a comparative analysis of various models and techniques and we propose some
tentative multidimensional typology. This typology is bottom-up, based on the analysis of many
existing deep-learning based systems for music generation selected from the relevant literature.
These systems are described in this survey/analysis and are used to exemplify the various choices
of objective, representation, architecture, challenges and strategies. The final part of the
paper includes some discussion and some prospects. This paper is a simplified (weak DRM) version
