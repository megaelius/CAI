We consider the problem faced by a recommender system which seeks to offer a user with unknown preferences
an item. Before making a recommendation, the system has the opportunity to elicit the user's preferences
by making queries. Each query corresponds to a pairwise comparison between items. We take the point
of view of either a risk averse or regret averse recommender system which only possess set-based
information on the user utility function. We investigate: a) an offline elicitation setting, where
all queries are made at once, and b) an online elicitation setting, where queries are selected sequentially
over time. We propose exact robust optimization formulations of these problems which integrate
the elicitation and recommendation phases and study the complexity of these problems. For the offline
case, where the problem takes the form of a two-stage robust optimization problem with decision-dependent
information discovery, we provide an enumeration-based algorithm and also an equivalent reformulation
in the form of a mixed-binary linear program which we solve via column-and-constraint generation.
For the online setting, where the problem takes the form of a multi-stage robust optimization problem
with decision-dependent information discovery, we propose a conservative solution approach.
We evaluate the performance of our methods on both synthetic data and real data from the Homeless
Management Information System. We simulate elicitation of the preferences of policy-makers in
terms of characteristics of housing allocation policies to better match individuals experiencing
homelessness to scarce housing resources. Our framework is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art
techniques from the literature.
