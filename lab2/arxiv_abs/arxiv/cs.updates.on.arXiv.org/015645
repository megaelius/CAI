In this paper, we study the condition number of a random Toeplitz matrix. Since a Toeplitz matrix
is a diagonal constant matrix, its rows or columns cannot be stochastically independent. This situation
does not permit us to use the classic strategy to analyze its minimum singular value when all the entries
of a random matrix are stochastically independent. Using Cauchy Interlacing Theorem as a decoupling
technique, we can break the stochastic dependence of the structure of the Toeplitz matrix and reduce
the problem to analyze the extreme singular values of a random circulant matrix. Among our results,
we show the condition number of non--symmetric random Toeplitz matrix of dimension $n$ under the
existence of moment generating function of the random entries is $\kappa\left(\mathcal{T}_n\right)
= \mbox{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon} n^{\rho+1/2} \left(\log n\right)^{1/2} \right)$ with
probability $1-\mbox{O}\left((\varepsilon^2 + \varepsilon) n^{-2\rho} + n^{-1/2+\scriptstyle{o}(1)}\right)$
for any $\varepsilon >0$, $\rho\in(0,1/4)$. Moreover, if the random entries only have the second
moment, we have $\kappa\left(\mathcal{T}_n\right) = \mbox{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon}
n^{\rho+1/2} \log n\right)$ with probability $1-\mbox{O}\left((\varepsilon^2 + \varepsilon)
n^{-2\rho} + \left(\log n\right)^{-1/2}\right)$. Also, Cauchy Interlacing Theorem permits
to analyze the condition number of a symmetric random Toeplitz matrix. In this case, the condition
number $\kappa\left( \mathcal{T}^{sym}_n\right) = \mbox{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}
n^{1.01} \left(\log n\right)^{1/2}\right)$ with probability $1- \mbox{O}\left( \varepsilon
n^{-1/10} + n^{-77/300+\scriptstyle{o}(1)}\right)$, when the random entries have moment generating
function. Additionally, we show that the results on the random Toeplitz matrices hold for random
Hankel matrices.
