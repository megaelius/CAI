Password authentication suffers from the well-known tradeoff between security and usability.
Secure passwords are difficult for users to remember, and memorable passwords are often easy to
guess. SPARse Two-dimensional AuthenticatioN (SPARTAN) allows users to input their textual passwords
in a two-dimensional grid instead of a linear textbox. This interface enables relatively short
passwords to have a higher calculated level of security due to the need for an attacker to determine
both the text of the password and the location of each character in the grid. We created a SPARTAN prototype
and conducted a preliminary user study to evaluate the actual usability and security of the SPARTAN
interface compared to the linear password entry interface. We find that while user-created SPARTAN
passwords tend to be shorter than their linear counterparts, the calculated security of user-created
SPARTAN passwords is higher than that of user-created linear passwords. We also asked participants
to complete a survey on the usability of the SPARTAN interface and identified some areas of improvement,
while prototype interaction provided evidence of users becoming more familiar with SPARTAN over
time. Finally, we performed an investigation into password-cracking tools, and assert that SPARTAN
passwords require more resources to crack than their linear counterparts. These findings suggest
that SPARTAN is a promising alternative to linear passwords from a security standpoint. Usability
of the interface and memorability of SPARTAN passwords is an interesting research question and
should be further investigated in future work.
