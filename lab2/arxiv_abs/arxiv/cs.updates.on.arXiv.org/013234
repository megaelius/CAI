We focus on electromagnetoencephalography imaging of the neural activity and, in particular,
finding a robust estimate for the primary current distribution via the hierarchical Bayesian model
(HBM). Our aim is to develop a reasonably fast maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation technique which
would be applicable for both superficial and deep areas without specific a priori knowledge of the
number or location of the activity. To enable source distinguishability for any depth, we introduce
a randomized multiresolution scanning (RAMUS) approach in which the MAP estimate of the brain activity
is varied during the reconstruction process. RAMUS aims to provide a robust and accurate imaging
outcome for the whole brain, while maintaining the computational cost on an appropriate level.
The inverse gamma (IG) distribution is applied as the primary hyperprior in order to achieve an optimal
performance for the deep part of the brain. In this proof-of-the-concept study, we consider the
detection of simultaneous thalamic and somatosensory activity via numerically simulated data
modeling the 14-20 ms post-stimulus somatosensory evoked potential and field response to electrical
wrist stimulation. Both a spherical and realistic model are utilized to analyze the source reconstruction
discrepancies. In the numerically examined case, RAMUS was observed to enhance the visibility
of deep components and also marginalizing the random effects of the discretization and optimization
without a remarkable computation cost. A robust and accurate MAP estimate for the primary current
density was obtained in both superficial and deep parts of the brain.
