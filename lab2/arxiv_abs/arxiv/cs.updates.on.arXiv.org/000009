We consider the problem of secure unicast transmission between two nodes in a directed graph, where
an adversary eavesdrops/jams a subset of nodes. This adversarial setting is in contrast to traditional
ones where the adversary controls a subset of links. In particular, we study, in the main, the class
of routing-only schemes (as opposed to those allowing coding inside the network). Routing-only
schemes usually have low implementation complexity, yet a characterization of the rates achievable
by such schemes was open prior to this work. We first propose an LP based solution for secure communication
against eavesdropping, and show that it is information-theoretically rate-optimal among all
routing-only schemes. The idea behind our design is to balance information flow in the network so
that no subset of nodes observe "too much" information. Interestingly, we show that the rates achieved
by our routing-only scheme are always at least as good as, and sometimes better, than those achieved
by "na\"ive" network coding schemes (i.e. the rate-optimal scheme designed for the traditional
scenario where the adversary controls links in a network rather than nodes.) We also demonstrate
non-trivial network coding schemes that achieve rates at least as high as (and again sometimes better
than) those achieved by our routing schemes, but leave open the question of characterizing the optimal
rate-region of the problem under all possible coding schemes. We then extend these routing-only
schemes to the adversarial node-jamming scenarios and show similar results. During the journey
of our investigation, we also develop a new technique that has the potential to derive non-trivial
bounds for general secure-communication schemes.
