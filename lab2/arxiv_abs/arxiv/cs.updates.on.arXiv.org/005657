Recent advances in distribution-level phasor measurement unit (D-PMU) technology have enabled
the use of voltage phase angle measurements for direct load sharing control in distribution-level
microgrid interconnections with high penetration of renewable distributed energy resources
(DERs). In particular, D-PMU enabled voltage angle droop control has the potential to enhance stability
and transient performance in such microgrid interconnections. However, these angle droop control
designs are vulnerable to D-PMU angle measurement losses that frequently occur due to the unavailability
of a GPS signal for synchronization. In the event of such measurement losses, angle droop controlled
microgrid interconnections may suffer from poor performance and potentially lose stability.
In this paper, we propose a novel distributed mixed voltage angle and frequency droop control (D-MAFD)
framework to improve the reliability of angle droop controlled microgrid interconnections, thereby
promoting the application of distribution-level PMUs in real-time control. In this framework,
when the D-PMU phase angle measurement is lost at a microgrid, conventional frequency droop control
is temporarily used for primary control in place of angle droop control to guarantee stability.
We model the microgrid interconnection with this primary control architecture as a nonlinear switched
system and design distributed secondary controllers to guarantee transient stability of the network.
Further, we incorporate provable performance guarantees such as robustness to generation-load
mismatch and network topology changes in the distributed control design. We demonstrate the performance
of this control framework by simulation on a test 123-feeder distribution network.
