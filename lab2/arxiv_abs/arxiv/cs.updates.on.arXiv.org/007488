This thesis demonstrate the efficacy of designing and developing machine learning (ML) algorithms
to selected use cases that encompass many of the outstanding challenges in the field of experimental
high energy physics. Although simple implementations of neural networks and boosted decision
trees have been used in high energy physics for a long time, the field of ML has quickly evolved by devising
more complex, fast and stable implementations of learning algorithms. The complexity and power
of state-of-the-art deep learning far exceeds those of the learning algorithms implemented in
the CERN-developed \texttt{ROOT} library. All aspects of experimental high energy physics have
been and will continue being revolutionized by the software- and hardware-based technological
advances spearheaded by both academic and industrial research in other technical disciplines,
and the emergent trend of increased interdisciplinarity will soon reframe many scientific domains.
This thesis exemplifies this spirit of versatility and multidisciplinarity by bridging the gap
between ML and particle physics, and exploring original lines of work to modernize the reconstruction,
particle identification, simulation, and analysis workflows. This contribution documents a
collection of novel approaches to augment traditional domain-specific methods with modern, automated
techniques based on industry-standard, open-source libraries. Specifically, it contributes
to setting the state-of-the-art for impact parameter-based flavor tagging and di-Higgs searches
in the $\gamma \gamma b\bar{b} $ channel with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, it introduces and lays
the foundations for the use of generative adversarial networks for the simulation of particle showers
in calorimeters. These results substantiate the notion of ML powering particle physics in the upcoming
years and establish baselines for future applications.
