Recently, due to the genomic sequence analysis in several types of cancer, the genomic data based
on {\em copy number profiles} ({\em CNP} for short) are getting more and more popular. A CNP is a vector
where each component is a non-negative integer representing the number of copies of a specific gene
or segment of interest. In this paper, we present two streams of results. The first is the negative
results on two open problems regarding the computational complexity of the Minimum Copy Number
Generation (MCNG) problem posed by Qingge et al. in 2018. It was shown by Qingge et al. that the problem
is NP-hard if the duplications are tandem and they left the open question of whether the problem remains
NP-hard if arbitrary duplications are used. We answer this question affirmatively in this paper;
in fact, we prove that it is NP-hard to even obtain a constant factor approximation. We also prove
that the parameterized version is W[1]-hard, answering another open question by Qingge et al. The
other result is positive and is based on a new (and more general) problem regarding CNP's. The \emph{Copy
Number Profile Conforming (CNPC)} problem is formally defined as follows: given two CNP's $C_1$
and $C_2$, compute two strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ with $cnp(S_1)=C_1$ and $cnp(S_2)=C_2$ such that
the distance between $S_1$ and $S_2$, $d(S_1,S_2)$, is minimized. Here, $d(S_1,S_2)$ is a very
general term, which means it could be any genome rearrangement distance (like reversal, transposition,
and tandem duplication, etc). We make the first step by showing that if $d(S_1,S_2)$ is measured
by the breakpoint distance then the problem is polynomially solvable.
