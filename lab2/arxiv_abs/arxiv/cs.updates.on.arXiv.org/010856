Various types of communication networks are constantly emerging to improve the connectivity services
and facilitate the interconnection of various types of devices. This involves the development
of several technologies, such as device-to-device communications, wireless sensor networks
and vehicular communications. The various services provided have heterogeneous requirements
on the quality metrics such as throughput, end-to-end latency and jitter. Furthermore, different
network technologies have inherently heterogeneous restrictions on resources, e.g., power,
interference management requirements, computational capabilities, etc. As a result, different
network operations such as spectrum management, routing, power control and offloading need to
be performed differently. Mathematical optimization techniques have always been at the heart
of such design problems to formulate and propose computationally efficient solution algorithms.
One of the existing powerful techniques of mathematical optimization is Benders decomposition
(BD), which is the focus of this article. Here, we briefly review different BD variants that have
been applied in various existing network types and different design problems. These main variants
are the classical, the combinatorial, the multi-stage, and the generalized BD. We discuss compelling
BD applications for various network types including heterogeneous cellular networks, infrastructure
wired wide area networks, smart grids, wireless sensor networks, and wireless local area networks.
Mainly, our goal is to assist the readers in refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology
of this powerful optimization technique in the context of future networks. We also discuss the BD
challenges and the prospective ways these can be addressed when applied to communication networks'
design problems.
