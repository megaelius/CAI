Information networks are becoming increasingly popular to capture complex relationships across
various disciplines, such as social networks, citation networks, and biological networks. The
primary challenge in this domain is measuring similarity or distance between networks based on
topology. However, classical graph-theoretic measures are usually local and mainly based on differences
between either node or edge measurements or correlations without considering the topology of networks
such as the connected components or holes. In recent years, mathematical tools and deep learning
based methods have become popular to extract the topological features of networks. Persistent
homology (PH) is a mathematical tool in computational topology that measures the topological features
of data that persist across multiple scales with applications ranging from biological networks
to social networks. In this paper, we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area
of using PH on complex network science. We give a brief mathematical background on PH, review different
methods (i.e. filtrations) to define PH on networks and highlight different algorithms and applications
where PH is used in solving network mining problems. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to
describe these recent approaches and emphasize major conceptual distinctions. We conclude with
directions for future work. We focus our review on recent approaches that get significant attention
in the mathematics and data mining communities working on network data. We believe our summary of
the analysis of PH on networks will provide important insights to researchers in applied network
science.
