Metadata-the machine-readable descriptions of the data-are increasingly seen as crucial for
describing the vast array of biomedical datasets that are currently being deposited in public repositories.
While most public repositories have firm requirements that metadata must accompany submitted
datasets, the quality of those metadata is generally very poor. A key problem is that the typical
metadata acquisition process is onerous and time consuming, with little interactive guidance
or assistance provided to users. Secondary problems include the lack of validation and sparse use
of standardized terms or ontologies when authoring metadata. There is a pressing need for improvements
to the metadata acquisition process that will help users to enter metadata quickly and accurately.
In this paper we outline a recommendation system for metadata that aims to address this challenge.
Our approach uses association rule mining to uncover hidden associations among metadata values
and to represent them in the form of association rules. These rules are then used to present users
with real-time recommendations when authoring metadata. The novelties of our method are that it
is able to combine analyses of metadata from multiple repositories when generating recommendations
and can enhance those recommendations by aligning them with ontology terms. We implemented our
approach as a service integrated into the CEDAR Workbench metadata authoring platform, and evaluated
it using metadata from two public biomedical repositories: US-based National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) BioSample and European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) BioSamples. The results
show that our approach is able to use analyses of previous entered metadata coupled with ontology-based
mappings to present users with accurate recommendations when authoring metadata.
