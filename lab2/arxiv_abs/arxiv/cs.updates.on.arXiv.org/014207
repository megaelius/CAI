The emerging area of computational pathology (CPath) is ripe ground for the application of deep
learning (DL) methods to healthcare due to the sheer volume of raw pixel data in whole-slide images
(WSIs) of cancerous tissue slides, generally of the order of $100K{\times}80K$ pixels. However,
it is imperative for the DL algorithms relying on nuclei-level details to be able to cope with data
from `the clinical wild', which tends to be quite challenging. We study, and extend recently released
PanNuke dataset consisting of more than 200,000 nuclei categorized into 5 clinically important
classes for the challenging tasks of detecting, segmenting and classifying nuclei in WSIs \footnote{Download
dataset here \href{https://jgamper.github.io/PanNukeDataset}{https://jgamper.github.io/PanNukeDataset}}
\cite{gamper_pannuke:_2019}. Previous pan-cancer datasets consisted of only up to 9 different
tissues and up to 21,000 unlabeled nuclei \cite{kumar2019multi} and just over 24,000 labeled nuclei
with segmentation masks \cite{graham_hover-net:_2019}. PanNuke consists of 19 different tissue
types from over 20,000 WSIs that have been semi-automatically annotated and quality controlled
by clinical pathologists, leading to a dataset with statistics similar to `the clinical wild' and
with minimal selection bias. We study the performance of segmentation and classification models
when applied to the proposed dataset and demonstrate the application of models trained on PanNuke
to whole-slide images. We provide comprehensive statistics about the dataset and outline recommendations
and research directions to address the limitations of existing DL tools when applied to real-world
CPath applications.
