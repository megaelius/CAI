Longitudinal patient data has the potential to improve clinical risk stratification models for
disease. However, chronic diseases that progress slowly over time are often heterogeneous in their
clinical presentation. Patients may progress through disease stages at varying rates. This leads
to pathophysiological misalignment over time, making it difficult to consistently compare patients
in a clinically meaningful way. Furthermore, patients present clinically for the first time at
different stages of disease. This eliminates the possibility of simply aligning patients based
on their initial presentation. Finally, patient data may be sampled at different rates due to differences
in schedules or missed visits. To address these challenges, we propose a robust measure of patient
similarity based on subsequence alignment. Compared to global alignment techniques that do not
account for pathophysiological misalignment, focusing on the most relevant subsequences allows
for an accurate measure of similarity between patients. We demonstrate the utility of our approach
in settings where longitudinal data, while useful, are limited and lack a clear temporal alignment
for comparison. Applied to the task of stratifying patients for risk of progression to probable
Alzheimer's Disease, our approach outperforms models that use only snapshot data (AUROC of 0.839
vs. 0.812) and models that use global alignment techniques (AUROC of 0.822). Our results support
the hypothesis that patients' trajectories are useful for quantifying inter-patient similarities
and that using subsequence matching and can help account for heterogeneity and misalignment in
longitudinal data.
