To tackle the expected enormous increase in mobile video traffic in cellular networks, an architecture
involving a base station along with caching femto stations (referred to as helpers), storing popular
files near users, has been proposed [1]. The primary benefit of caching is the enormous increase
in downloading rate when a popular file is available at helpers near a user requesting that file.
In this work, we explore a secondary benefit of caching in this architecture through the lens of index
coding. We assume a system with n users and constant number of caching helpers. Only helpers store
files, i.e. have side information. We investigate the following scenario: Each user requests a
distinct file that is not found in the set of helpers nearby. Users are served coded packets (through
an index code) by an omniscient base station. Every user decodes its desired packet from the coded
packets and the side information packets from helpers nearby. We assume that users can obtain any
file stored in their neighboring helpers without incurring transmission costs. With respect to
the index code employed, we investigate two achievable schemes: 1) XOR coloring based on coloring
of the side information graph associated with the problem and 2)Vector XOR coloring based on fractional
coloring of the side information graph. We show that the general problem reduces to a canonical problem
where every user is connected to exactly one helper under some topological constraints. For the
canonical problem, with constant number of helpers (k), we show that the complexity of computing
the best XOR/vector XOR coloring schemes are polynomial in the number of users n. The result exploits
a special complete bi-partite structure that the side information graphs exhibit for any finite
k.
