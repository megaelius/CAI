The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known and challenging combinatorial optimisation
problem. Its computational intractability has attracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate
satisfactory, if not optimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple unconventional
computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a virtual material approach. The morphological
adaptation behaviour of the material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of
particles moving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a set of data
points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations, and the blob is reduced in size
over time. As the blob shrinks it morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The
shrinkage process automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all cities. By
manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is elicited corresponding to a TSP
tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated datasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found
tours with a mean best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour length
of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an exact TSP solver. We examine
the insertion mechanism by which the blob constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations
of its performance, and discuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which
group points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially represented
mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between this method and previously suggested
models of human performance on the TSP and suggest possibilities for further improvement.
