PURPOSE: Literature review is a complex task, requiring the expert analysis of unstructured data.
Computational automation of this process presents a valuable opportunity for high throughput
knowledge extraction and meta analysis. Currently available methods are limited to the detection
of explicit and short-context relationships. We address this challenge with Gextext, which extracts
a knowledge graph of latent relationships directly from unstructured text. METHODS: Let C be a corpus
of n text chunks. Let V_target be a set of query terms and V_random a random selection of terms in C.
Let X indicate the occurrence of V_target and V_random in C. Gextext learns a graph G(V,E) by correlation
thresholding on the covariance matrix of X, where thresholds are estimated by the correlations
with randomly selected terms. Gextext was benchmarked against GloVE in tasks where embedding distance
matrices were correlated against real world similarity matrices. A general corpus was generated
from 5,000 randomly selected Wikipedia articles and a biomedical corpus from 961 research papers
on stroke. RESULTS: Embeddings generated by Gextext preserved relative geographical distances
between countries (Gextext: rho = 0.255, p < 2.22e-16; GloVE: rho = 0.086, p = 1.859e-09) and capital
cities (Gextext: rho = 0.282, p < 2.22e-16 ; Glove: rho = 0.093, p = 8.0805e-11). Gextext embeddings
organised drug names by shared target (Gextext: rho = 0.456, p < 2.22e-16; GloVE: rho = 0.091, p = 0.00087)
and stroke phenotypes by body system (Gextext: rho = 0.446, p < 2.22e-16; GloVE: rho = 0.129, p = 1.7464e-11).
CONCLUSIONS: Gextext extracts latent relationships from unstructured text, enabling fully unsupervised
automation of the literature review process.
