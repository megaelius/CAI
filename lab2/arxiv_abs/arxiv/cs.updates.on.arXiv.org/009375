We begin this chapter with the bold claim that it provides a neuroscientific explanation of the magic
of creativity. Creativity presents a formidable challenge for neuroscience. Neuroscience generally
involves studying what happens in the brain when someone engages in a task that involves responding
to a stimulus, or retrieving information from memory and using it the right way, or at the right time.
If the relevant information is not already encoded in memory, the task generally requires that the
individual make systematic use of information that is encoded in memory. But creativity is different.
It paradoxically involves studying how someone pulls out of their brain something that was never
put into it! Moreover, it must be something both new and useful, or appropriate to the task at hand.
The ability to pull out of memory something new and appropriate that was never stored there in the
first place is what we refer to as the magic of creativity. Even if we are so fortunate as to determine
which areas of the brain are active and how these areas interact during creative thought, we will
not have an answer to the question of how the brain comes up with solutions and artworks that are new
and appropriate. On the other hand, since the representational capacity of neurons emerges at a
level that is higher than that of the individual neurons themselves, the inner workings of neurons
is too low a level to explain the magic of creativity. Thus we look to a level that is midway between
gross brain regions and neurons. Since creativity generally involves combining concepts from
different domains, or seeing old ideas from new perspectives, we focus our efforts on the neural
mechanisms underlying the representation of concepts and ideas. Thus we ask questions about the
brain at the level that accounts for its representational capacity, i.e. at the level of distributed
aggregates of neurons.
