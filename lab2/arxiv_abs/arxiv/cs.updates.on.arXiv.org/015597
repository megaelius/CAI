Large-scale online password guessing attacks are wide-spread and continuously qualified as one
of the top cyber-security risks. The common method for mitigating the risk of online cracking is
to lock out the user after a fixed number ($K$) of consecutive incorrect login attempts. Selecting
the value of $K$ induces a classic security-usability trade-off. When $K$ is too large a hacker can
(quickly) break into a significant fraction of user accounts, but when $K$ is too low we will start
to annoy honest users by locking them out after a few mistakes. Motivated by the observation that
honest user mistakes typically look quite different than the password guesses of an online attacker,
we introduce DALock a {\em distribution aware} password lockout mechanism to reduce user annoyance
while minimizing user risk. As the name suggests, DALock is designed to be aware of the frequency
and popularity of the password used for login attacks while standard throttling mechanisms (e.g.,
$K$-strikes) are oblivious to the password distribution. In particular, DALock maintains an extra
"hit count" in addition to "strike count" for each user which is based on (estimates of) the cumulative
probability of {\em all} login attempts for that particular account. We empirically evaluate DALock
with an extensive battery of simulations using real world password datasets. In comparison with
the traditional $K$-strikes mechanism we find that DALock offers a superior security/usability
trade-off. For example, in one of our simulations we are able to reduce the success rate of an attacker
to $0.05\%$ (compared to $1\%$ for the $10$-strikes mechanism) whilst simultaneously reducing
the unwanted lockout rate for accounts that are not under attack to just $0.08\%$ (compared to $4\%$
for the $3$-strikes mechanism).
