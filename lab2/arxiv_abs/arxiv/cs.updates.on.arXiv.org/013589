Image segmentation is a fundamental research topic in image processing and computer vision. In
the last decades, researchers developed a large number of segmentation algorithms for various
applications. Amongst these algorithms, the Normalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely
applied due to its good performance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose
energy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation results of the existing
Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed similarity measure on the graph since this
measure is usually given empirically by users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation
results. In this paper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an adaptive
similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model combines the Parzen-Rosenblatt
window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut energy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational
framework. Our method can adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some
parameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a better similarity
measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide some mathematical interpretation
of the proposed adaptive similarity from multi-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization.
In addition, the regularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a robust
performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the similarity measure with a spatial
priori. The well-posed theory such as the existence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given
in the paper. Compared with some existing segmentation methods such as the traditional Ncut-based
model and the classical Chan-Vese model, the numerical experiments show that our method can provide
promising segmentation results.
