We address the problem of inferring an undirected graph from nodal observations, which are modeled
as non-stationary graph signals generated by local diffusion dynamics that depend on the structure
of the unknown network. Using the so-called graph-shift operator (GSO), which is a matrix representation
of the graph, we first identify the eigenvectors of the shift matrix from realizations of the diffused
signals, and then estimate the eigenvalues by imposing desirable properties on the graph to be recovered.
Different from the stationary setting where the eigenvectors can be obtained directly from the
covariance matrix of the observations, here we need to estimate first the unknown diffusion (graph)
filter -- a polynomial in the GSO that preserves the sought eigenbasis. To carry out this initial
system identification step, we exploit different sources of information on the arbitrarily-correlated
input signal driving the diffusion on the graph. We first explore the simpler case where the observations,
the input information, and the unknown graph filter are linearly related. We then address the case
where the relation is given by a system of matrix quadratic equations, which arises in pragmatic
scenarios where only the second-order statistics of the inputs are available. While such quadratic
filter identification problem boils down to a non-convex fourth order polynomial minimization,
we discuss identifiability conditions, propose efficient algorithms to approximate the solution
and analyze their performance. Numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed topology
inference algorithms in recovering brain, social and urban transportation networks using synthetic
and real-world signals.
