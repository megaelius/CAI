Analysis and recognition of driving styles are profoundly important to intelligent transportation
and vehicle calibration. This paper presents a novel driving style analysis framework using the
primitive driving patterns learned from naturalistic driving data. In order to achieve this, first,
a Bayesian nonparametric learning method based on a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is introduced
to extract primitive driving patterns from time series driving data without prior knowledge of
the number of these patterns. In the Bayesian nonparametric approach, we utilize a hierarchical
Dirichlet process (HDP) instead of learning the unknown number of smooth dynamical modes of HSMM,
thus generating the primitive driving patterns. Each primitive pattern is clustered and then labeled
using behavioral semantics according to drivers' physical and psychological perception thresholds.
For each driver, 75 primitive driving patterns in car-following scenarios are learned and semantically
labeled. In order to show the HDP-HSMM's utility to learn primitive driving patterns, other two
Bayesian nonparametric approaches, HDP-HMM and sticky HDP-HMM, are compared. The naturalistic
driving data of 18 drivers were collected from the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment
(SPDM) database. The individual driving styles are discussed according to distribution characteristics
of the learned primitive driving patterns and also the difference in driving styles among drivers
are evaluated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The experiment results demonstrate that
the proposed primitive pattern-based method can allow one to semantically understand driver behaviors
and driving styles.
