In sponsored search, advertisement (shortly ad) slots are usually sold by a search engine to an advertiser
through an auction mechanism in which advertisers bid on keywords. In theory, an auction mechanism
encourages advertisers to truthfully bid for keywords. However, keyword auctions have a number
of problems including: the uncertainty in payment prices for advertisers; the volatility in the
search engine's revenue; and the weak loyalty between advertiser and search engine. In this paper
we propose a special ad option contract that alleviates these problems. In our proposal, an advertiser
can purchase an option in advance from a search engine by paying an upfront fee, known as the option
price. He/she then has the right, but no obligation, to then purchase among the pre-defined set of
keywords at fixed cost-per-clicks (CPCs) for a specified number of clicks in a specified period
of time. The proposed option is closely related to a special exotic option in finance that contains
multiple underlying assets (multi-keyword) and is also multi-exercisable (multi-click). There
are several benefits of this novel structure: advertisers can have increased certainty in sponsored
search; the search engine can raise the advertisers' loyalty as well as obtain a stable and increased
revenue over time. The proposed ad option can be implemented in conjunction with traditional keyword
auctions. As such, the option price and corresponding fixed CPCs must be set such that there is no
arbitrage. Therefore, we discuss the option pricing methods tailored to sponsored search that
deal with the spot CPCs of targeted keywords in the generalized second price (GSP) auction. Our experimental
results with the real sponsored search data validate the development and demonstrate that, compared
to only keyword auctions, a search engine can have an increased expected revenue by selling an ad
option.
