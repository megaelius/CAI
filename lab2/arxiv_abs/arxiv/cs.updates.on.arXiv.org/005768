An increasing amount of information today is generated, exchanged, and stored digitally. This
also includes long-lived and highly sensitive information (e.g., electronic health records,
governmental documents) whose integrity and confidentiality must be protected over decades or
even centuries. While there is a vast amount of cryptography-based data protection schemes, only
few are designed for long-term protection. Recently, Braun et al. (AsiaCCS'17) proposed the first
long-term protection scheme that provides renewable integrity protection and information-theoretic
confidentiality protection. However, computation and storage costs of their scheme increase
significantly with the number of stored data items. As a result, their scheme appears suitable only
for protecting databases with a small number of relatively large data items, but unsuitable for
databases that hold a large number of relatively small data items (e.g., medical record databases).
In this work, we present a solution for efficient long-term integrity and confidentiality protection
of large datasets consisting of relatively small data items. First, we construct a renewable vector
commitment scheme that is information-theoretically hiding under selective decommitment. We
then combine this scheme with renewable timestamps and information-theoretically secure secret
sharing. The resulting solution requires only a single timestamp for protecting a dataset while
the state of the art requires a number of timestamps linear in the number of data items. We implemented
our solution and measured its performance in a scenario where 12 000 data items are aggregated, stored,
protected, and verified over a time span of 100 years. Our measurements show that our new solution
completes this evaluation scenario an order of magnitude faster than the state of the art.
