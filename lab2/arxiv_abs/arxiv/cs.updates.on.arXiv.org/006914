One component of precision medicine is to construct prediction models with their predictive ability
as high as possible, e.g. to enable individual risk prediction. In genetic epidemiology, complex
diseases have a polygenic basis and a common assumption is that biological and genetic features
affect the outcome under consideration via interactions. In the case of omics data, the use of standard
approaches such as generalized linear models may be suboptimal and machine learning methods are
appealing to make individual predictions. However, most of these algorithms focus mostly on main
or marginal effects of the single features in a dataset. On the other hand, the detection of interacting
features is an active area of research in the realm of genetic epidemiology. One big class of algorithms
to detect interacting features is based on the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). Here,
we extend the model-based MDR (MB-MDR), a powerful extension of the original MDR algorithm, to enable
interaction empowered individual prediction. Using a comprehensive simulation study we show
that our new algorithm can use information hidden in interactions more efficiently than two other
state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the Random Forest and Elastic Net, and clearly outperforms
these if interactions are present. The performance of these algorithms is comparable if no interactions
are present. Further, we show that our new algorithm is applicable to real data by comparing the performance
of the three algorithms on a dataset of rheumatoid arthritis cases and healthy controls. As our new
algorithm is not only applicable to biological/genetic data but to all datasets with discrete features,
it may have practical implications in other applications as well, and we made our method available
as an R package.
