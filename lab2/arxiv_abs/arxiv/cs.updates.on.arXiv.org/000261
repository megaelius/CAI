As wireless video transmission is the fastest-growing form of data traffic, methods for spectrally
efficient video on-demand wireless streaming are essential to service providers and users alike.
A key property of video on-demand is the asynchronous content reuse, such that a few dominant videos
account for a large part of the traffic, but are viewed by users at different times. Caching of content
on devices in conjunction with D2D communications allows to exploit this property, and provide
a network throughput that is significantly in excess of both the conventional approach of unicasting
from the base station and the traditional D2D networks for regular data traffic. This paper presents
in a semi-tutorial concise form some recent results on the throughput scaling laws of wireless networks
with caching and asynchronous content reuse, contrasting the D2D approach with a competing approach
based on combinatorial cache design and network coded transmission from the base station (BS) only,
referred to as coded multicasting. Interestingly, the spatial reuse gain of the former and the coded
multicasting gain of the latter yield, somehow surprisingly, the same near-optimal throughput
behavior in the relevant regime where the number of video files in the library is smaller than the
number of streaming users. Based on our recent theoretical results, we propose a holistic D2D system
design that incorporates traditional microwave (2 GHz) as well as millimeter-wave D2D links; the
direct connections to the base station can be used to provide those rare video requests that cannot
be found in local caches. We provide extensive simulations under a variety of system settings, and
compare our scheme with other existing schemes by the BS. We show that, despite the similar behavior
of the scaling laws, the proposed D2D approach offers very significant throughput gains with respect
to the BS-only schemes.
