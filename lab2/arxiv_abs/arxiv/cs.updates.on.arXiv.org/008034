Community detection is a discovery tool used by network scientists to analyze the structure of real-world
networks. It seeks to identify natural divisions that may exist in the input networks that partition
the vertices into coherent modules (or communities). While this problem space is rich with efficient
algorithms and software, most of this literature caters to the static use-case where the underlying
network does not change. However, many emerging real-world use-cases give rise to a need to incorporate
dynamic graphs as inputs. In this paper, we present a fast and efficient incremental approach toward
dynamic community detection. The key contribution is a generic technique called $\Delta-screening$,
which examines the most recent batch of changes made to an input graph and selects a subset of vertices
to reevaluate for potential community (re)assignment. This technique can be incorporated into
any of the community detection methods that use modularity as its objective function for clustering.
For demonstration purposes, we incorporated the technique into two well-known community detection
tools. Our experiments demonstrate that our new incremental approach is able to generate performance
speedups without compromising on the output quality (despite its heuristic nature). For instance,
on a real-world network with 63M temporal edges (over 12 time steps), our approach was able to complete
in 1056 seconds, yielding a 3x speedup over a baseline implementation. In addition to demonstrating
the performance benefits, we also show how to use our approach to delineate appropriate intervals
of temporal resolutions at which to analyze an input network.
