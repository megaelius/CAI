Metal artifact reduction (MAR) is a challenging problem in computed tomography (CT) imaging. A
popular class of MAR methods replace sinogram measurements that are corrupted by metal with artificial
data. While these ``projection completion'' approaches are successful in eliminating severe
artifacts, secondary artifacts may be introduced by the artificial data. In this paper, we propose
an approach which uses projection completion to generate a prior image, which is then incorporated
into an iterative reconstruction algorithm based on the superiorization framework. The prior
image is reconstructed using normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR), a popular projection
completion approach. The iterative algorithm is a modified version of the simultaneous algebraic
reconstruction technique (SART), which reduces artifacts by incorporating a polyenergetic forward
model, least-squares weighting, and superiorization. The penalty function used for superiorization
is a weighted average between a total variation (TV) term and a term promoting similarity with the
prior image, similar to penalty functions used in prior image constrained compressive sensing.
Because the prior is largely free of severe metal artifacts, these artifacts are discouraged from
arising during iterative reconstruction; additionally, because the iterative approach uses
the original projection data, it is able to recover information that is lost during the NMAR process.
We perform numerical experiments modeling a simple geometric object, as well as several more realistic
scenarios such as metal pins, bilateral hip implants, and dental fillings placed within an anatomical
phantom. The proposed iterative algorithm is largely successful at eliminating severe metal artifacts
as well as secondary artifacts introduced by the NMAR process, especially lost edges of bone structures
in the neighborhood of the metal regions.
