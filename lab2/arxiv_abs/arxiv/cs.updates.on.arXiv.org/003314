Sponsored search is an indispensable business model and a major revenue contributor of almost all
the search engines. From the advertisers' side, participating in ranking the search results by
paying for the sponsored search advertisement to attract more awareness and purchase facilitates
their commercial goal. From the users' side, presenting personalized advertisement reflecting
their propensity would make their online search experience more satisfactory. Sponsored search
platforms rank the advertisements by a ranking function to determine the list of advertisements
to show and the charging price for the advertisers. Hence, it is crucial to find a good ranking function
which can simultaneously satisfy the platform, the users and the advertisers. Moreover, advertisements
showing positions under different queries from different users may associate with advertisement
candidates of different bid price distributions and click probability distributions, which requires
the ranking functions to be optimized adaptively to the traffic characteristics. In this work,
we proposed a generic framework to optimize the ranking functions by deep reinforcement learning
methods. The framework is composed of two parts: an offline learning part which initializes the
ranking functions by learning from a simulated advertising environment, allowing adequate exploration
of the ranking function parameter space without hurting the performance of the commercial platform.
An online learning part which further optimizes the ranking functions by adapting to the online
data distribution. Experimental results on a large-scale sponsored search platform confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed method.
