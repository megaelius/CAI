The hyperspectral image (HSI) unmixing task is essentially an inverse problem, which is commonly
solved by optimization algorithms under a predefined (non-)linear mixture model. Although these
optimization algorithms show impressive performance, they are very computational demanding
as they often rely on an iterative updating scheme. Recently, the rise of neural networks has inspired
lots of learning based algorithms in unmixing literature. However, most of them lack of interpretability
and require a large training dataset. One natural question then arises: can one leverage the model
based algorithm and learning based algorithm to achieve interpretable and fast algorithm for HSI
unmixing problem? In this paper, we propose two novel network architectures, named U-ADMM-AENet
and U-ADMM-BUNet, for abundance estimation and blind unmixing respectively, by combining the
conventional optimization-model based unmixing method and the rising learning based unmixing
method. We first consider a linear mixture model with sparsity constraint, then we unfold Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to construct the unmixing network structures.
We also show that the unfolded structures can find corresponding interpretations in machine learning
literature, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed methods. Benefit from the
interpretation, the proposed networks can be initialized by incorporating prior information
about the HSI data. Different from traditional unfolding networks, we propose a new training strategy
for proposed networks to better fit in the HSI applications. Extensive experiments show that the
proposed methods can achieve much faster convergence and competitive performance even with very
small size of training data, when compared with state-of-art algorithms.
