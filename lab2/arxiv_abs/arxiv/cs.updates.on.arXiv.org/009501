In communication networks secrecy constraints usually incur an extra limit in capacity or generalized
degrees-of-freedom (GDoF), in the sense that a penalty in capacity or GDoF is incurred due to the
secrecy constraints. Over the past decades a significant amount of effort has been made by the researchers
to understand the limits of secrecy constraints in communication networks. In this work, we focus
on how to remove the secrecy constraints in communication networks, i.e., how to remove the GDoF
penalty due to secrecy constraints. We begin with three basic settings: a two-user symmetric Gaussian
interference channel with confidential messages, a symmetric Gaussian wiretap channel with a
helper, and a two-user symmetric Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel. Interestingly, in
this work we show that adding common randomness at the transmitters can totally remove the penalty
in GDoF or GDoF region of the three settings considered here. The results reveal that adding common
randomness at the transmitters is a powerful way to remove the secrecy constraints in communication
networks in terms of GDoF performance. Common randomness can be generated offline. The role of the
common randomness is to jam the information signal at the eavesdroppers, without causing too much
interference at the legitimate receivers. To accomplish this role, a new method of Markov chain-based
interference neutralization is proposed in the achievability schemes utilizing common randomness.
From the practical point of view, we hope to use less common randomness to remove secrecy constraints
in terms of GDoF performance. With this motivation, for most of the cases we characterize the minimal
GDoF of common randomness to remove secrecy constraints, based on our derived converses and achievability.
