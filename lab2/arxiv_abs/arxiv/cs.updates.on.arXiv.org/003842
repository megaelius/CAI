We consider the computational complexity of reconfiguration problems, in which one is given two
combinatorial configurations satisfying some constraints, and is asked to transform one into
the other using elementary transformations, while satisfying the constraints at all times. Such
problems appear naturally in many contexts, such as model checking, motion planning, enumeration
and sampling, and recreational mathematics. We provide hardness results for problems in this family,
in which the constraints and operations are particularly simple. More precisely, we prove the PSPACE-completeness
of the following decision problems: $\bullet$ Given two satisfying assignments to a planar monotone
instance of Not-All-Equal 3-SAT, can one assignment be transformed into the other by single variable
`flips' (assignment changes), preserving satisfiability at every step? $\bullet$ Given two subsets
of a set S of integers with the same sum, can one subset be transformed into the other by adding or removing
at most three elements of S at a time, such that the intermediate subsets also have the same sum? $\bullet$
Given two points in $\{0,1\}^n$ contained in a polytope P specified by a constant number of linear
inequalities, is there a path in the n-hypercube connecting the two points and contained in P? These
problems can be interpreted as reconfiguration analogues of standard problems in NP. Interestingly,
the instances of the NP problems that appear as input to the reconfiguration problems in our reductions
can be shown to lie in P. In particular, the elements of S and the coefficients of the inequalities
defining P can be restricted to have logarithmic bit-length.
