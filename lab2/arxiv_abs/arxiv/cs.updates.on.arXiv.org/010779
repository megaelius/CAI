In the SetDisjointness problem, a collection of $m$ sets $S_1,S_2,...,S_m$ from some universe
$U$ is preprocessed in order to answer queries on the emptiness of the intersection of some two query
sets from the collection. In the SetIntersection variant, all the elements in the intersection
of the query sets are required to be reported. These are two fundamental problems that were considered
in several papers from both the upper bound and lower bound perspective. Several conditional lower
bounds for these problems were proven for the tradeoff between preprocessing and query time or the
tradeoff between space and query time. Moreover, there are several unconditional hardness results
for these problems in some specific computational models. The fundamental nature of the SetDisjointness
and SetIntersection problems makes them useful for proving the conditional hardness of other problems
from various areas. However, the universe of the elements in the sets may be very large, which may
cause the reduction to some other problems to be inefficient and therefore it is not useful for proving
their conditional hardness. In this paper, we prove the conditional hardness of SetDisjointness
and SetIntersection with bounded universe. This conditional hardness is shown for both the interplay
between preprocessing and query time and the interplay between space and query time. Moreover,
we present several applications of these new conditional lower bounds. These applications demonstrates
the strength of our new conditional lower bounds as they exploit the limited universe size. We believe
that this new framework of conditional lower bounds with bounded universe can be useful for further
significant applications.
