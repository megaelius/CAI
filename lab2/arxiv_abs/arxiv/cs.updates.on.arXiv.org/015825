Nowadays, working from home (WFH) has become a popular work arrangement due to its many potential
benefits for both companies and employees (e.g., increasing job satisfaction and retention of
employees). Many previous studies have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity
of employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis method such as survey
and interview, and the studied participants do not work from home for a long continuing time. Due
to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their
employees to work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working from
home affects their productivity. In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity
between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a dataset
of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one of the largest IT companies in China. In total,
we collected approximately four thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working
days. Out of these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due to COVID-19
pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity in terms
of different metrics, e.g., the number of builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working
from home has different impacts on projects with different characteristics including programming
language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has a negative impact on developer
productivity for large projects. Additionally, we find that productivity varies for different
developers. Based on these findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand
some reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.
