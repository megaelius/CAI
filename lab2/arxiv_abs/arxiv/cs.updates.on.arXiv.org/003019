Complex numerical weather prediction models incorporate a variety of physical processes, each
described by multiple alternative physical schemes with specific parameters. The selection of
the physical schemes and the choice of the corresponding physical parameters during model configuration
can significantly impact the accuracy of model forecasts. There is no combination of physical schemes
that works best for all times, at all locations, and under all conditions. It is therefore of considerable
interest to understand the interplay between the choice of physics and the accuracy of the resulting
forecasts under different conditions. This paper demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques
to study the uncertainty in numerical weather prediction models due to the interaction of multiple
physical processes. The first problem addressed herein is the estimation of systematic model errors
in output quantities of interest at future times, and the use of this information to improve the model
forecasts. The second problem considered is the identification of those specific physical processes
that contribute most to the forecast uncertainty in the quantity of interest under specified meteorological
conditions. The discrepancies between model results and observations at past times are used to
learn the relationships between the choice of physical processes and the resulting forecast errors.
Numerical experiments are carried out with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The
output quantity of interest is the model precipitation, a variable that is both extremely important
and very challenging to forecast. The physical processes under consideration include various
micro-physics schemes, cumulus parameterizations, short wave, and long wave radiation schemes.
The experiments demonstrate the strong potential of machine learning approaches to aid the study
of model errors.
