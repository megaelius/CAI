We present a general method for constructing radar transmit pulse trains and receive filters for
which the radar point-spread function in delay and Doppler (radar cross-ambiguity function) is
essentially free of range sidelobes inside a Doppler interval around the zero-Doppler axis. The
transmit and receive pulse trains are constructed by coordinating the transmission of a pair of
Golay complementary waveforms across time according to zeros and ones in a binary sequence $P$.
In the receive pulse train filter, each waveform is weighted according to an element from another
sequence $Q$. We show that the spectrum of essentially the product of $P$ and $Q$ sequences controls
the size of the range sidelobes of the cross-ambiguity function. We annihilate the range sidelobes
at low Doppler by designing the $(P,Q)$ pairs such that their products have high-order spectral
nulls around zero Doppler. We specify the subspace, along with a basis, for such sequences, thereby
providing a general way of constructing $(P,Q)$ pairs. At the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) at the receiver output, for a single point target in white noise, depends only on the choice
of $Q$. By jointly designing the transmit-receive sequences $(P,Q)$, we can maximize the output
SNR subject to achieving a given order of the spectral null. The proposed $(P,Q)$ constructions
can also be extended to sequences consisting of more than two complementary waveforms; this is done
explicitly for a library of Golay complementary quads. Finally, we extend the construction of $(P,Q)$
pairs to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar, by designing transmit-receive pairs
of paraunitary waveform matrices whose matrix-valued cross-ambiguity function is essentially
free of range sidelobes inside a Doppler interval around the zero-Doppler axis.
