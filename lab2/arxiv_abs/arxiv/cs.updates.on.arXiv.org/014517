In this paper, we propose a unified and high order accurate fully-discrete one-step ADER Discontinuous
Galerkin method for the simulation of linear seismic waves in the sea bottom that are generated by
the propagation of free surface water waves. A hyperbolic reformulation of the Serre-Green-Naghdi
model for nonlinear dispersive free surface flows is coupled with a first order velocity-stress
formulation for linear elastic wave propagation in the sea bottom. Cartesian non-conforming meshes
are defined and the coupling is achieved by an appropriate time-dependent pressure boundary condition
in the three-dimensional domain for the elastic wave propagation, where the pressure is a combination
of hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic pressure in the water column above the sea bottom. The use of
a first order hyperbolic reformulation of the nonlinear dispersive free surface flow model leads
to a straightforward coupling with the linear seismic wave equations, which are also written in
first order hyperbolic form. It furthermore allows the use of explicit time integrators with a rather
generous CFL-type time step restriction associated with the dispersive water waves, compared
to numerical schemes applied to classical dispersive models. Since the two systems employed are
written in the same form of a first order hyperbolic system they can also be efficiently solved in
a unique numerical framework. We choose the family of arbitrary high order accurate discontinuous
Galerkin finite element schemes. The developed methodology is carefully assessed by first considering
several benchmarks for each system separately showing a good agreement with exact and numerical
reference solutions. Finally, also coupled test cases are addressed. Throughout this paper we
assume the elastic deformations in the solid to be sufficiently small so that their influence on
the free surface water waves can be neglected.
