Visual target tracking is one of the most sought-after yet challenging research topics in computer
vision. Given the ill-posed nature of the problem and its popularity in a broad range of real-world
scenarios, a number of large-scale benchmark datasets have been established, on which considerable
methods have been developed and demonstrated with significant progress in recent years -- predominantly
by recent deep learning (DL)-based methods. This survey aims to systematically investigate the
current DL-based visual tracking methods, benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics. It also
extensively evaluates and analyzes the leading visual tracking methods. First, the fundamental
characteristics, primary motivations, and contributions of DL-based methods are summarized
from six key aspects of: network architecture, network exploitation, network training for visual
tracking, network objective, network output, and the exploitation of correlation filter advantages.
Second, popular visual tracking benchmarks and their respective properties are compared, and
their evaluation metrics are summarized. Third, the state-of-the-art DL-based methods are comprehensively
examined on a set of well-established benchmarks of OTB2013, OTB2015, VOT2018, and LaSOT. Finally,
by conducting critical analyses of these state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively,
their pros and cons under various common scenarios are investigated. It may serve as a gentle use
guide for practitioners to weigh on when and under what conditions to choose which method(s). It
also facilitates a discussion on ongoing issues and sheds light on promising research directions.
