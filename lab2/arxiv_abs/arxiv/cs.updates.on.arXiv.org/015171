Blockchain Sharding is a blockchain performance enhancement approach. By splitting a blockchain
into several parallel-run committees (shards), it helps increase transaction throughput, reduce
resources required, and increase reward expectation for participants. Recently, several flexible
sharding methods that can tolerate up to $n/2$ Byzantine nodes ($n/2$ security level) have been
proposed. However, these methods suffer from two main drawbacks. First, in a non-sharding blockchain,
nodes can have different weight (power or stake) to create a consensus. So an adversary needs to control
half of the overall weight of the system in order for a piece of faulty information to be accepted into
the blockchain ($p/2$ security level). In blockchain sharding, all nodes carry the same weight.
Thus, it is only under the assumption that the honest participants are creating as many nodes as they
can that a $n/2$ security level blockchain sharding reaches the $p/2$ security level. Secondly,
when some nodes leave the system, other nodes need to be reassigned, frequently, from shard to shard
in order to maintain the security level of the system. In this paper, we present Multichain MWPoW,
a $p/2$ security level blockchain sharding architecture that does not require honest participants
to create multiple nodes and requires less node reassignment when some nodes leave the system. It
combines the Multiple Winners Proof of Work consensus protocol (MWPoW) with the flexibility of
$n/2$ blockchain sharding. Our experiments show that Multichain MWPoW outperforms existing blockchain
sharding approaches in terms of security, transaction throughput and flexibility.
