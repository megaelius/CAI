In the last few months, the novel COVID19 pandemic has spread all over the world. Due to its easy transmission,
developing techniques to accurately and easily identify the presence of COVID19 and distinguish
it from other forms of flu and pneumonia is crucial. Recent research has shown that the chest Xrays
of patients suffering from COVID19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography. However,
those approaches are closed source and not made available to the research community for re-producibility
and gaining deeper insight. The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets
and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID19 cases
from other pneumonia cases. Our work utilizes state of the art training techniques including progressive
resizing, cyclical learning rate finding and discriminative learning rates to training fast and
accurate residual neural networks. Using these techniques, we showed the state of the art results
on the open-access COVID-19 dataset. This work presents a 3-step technique to fine-tune a pre-trained
ResNet-50 architecture to improve model performance and reduce training time. We call it COVIDResNet.
This is achieved through progressively re-sizing of input images to 128x128x3, 224x224x3, and
229x229x3 pixels and fine-tuning the network at each stage. This approach along with the automatic
learning rate selection enabled us to achieve the state of the art accuracy of 96.23% (on all the classes)
on the COVIDx dataset with only 41 epochs. This work presented a computationally efficient and highly
accurate model for multi-class classification of three different infection types from along with
Normal individuals. This model can help in the early screening of COVID19 cases and help reduce the
burden on healthcare systems.
