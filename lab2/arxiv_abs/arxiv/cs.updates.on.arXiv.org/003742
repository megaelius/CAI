Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays a very important role in drug development and drug
discovery. Biochemical experiments or \textit{in vitro} methods are very expensive, laborious
and time-consuming. Therefore, \textit{in silico} approaches including docking simulation
and machine learning have been proposed to solve this problem. In particular, machine learning
approaches have attracted increasing attentions recently. However, in addition to the known drug-target
interactions, most of the machine learning methods require extra characteristic information
such as chemical structures, genome sequences, binding types and so on. Whenever such information
is not available, they may perform poor. Very recently, the similarity-based link prediction methods
were extended to bipartite networks, which can be applied to solve the DTI prediction problem by
using topological information only. In this work, we propose a method based on low-rank matrix projection
to solve the DTI prediction problem. On one hand, when there is no extra characteristic information
of drugs or targets, the proposed method utilizes only the known interactions. On the other hand,
the proposed method can also utilize the extra characteristic information when it is available
and the performances will be remarkably improved. Moreover, the proposed method can predict the
interactions associated with new drugs or targets of which we know nothing about their associated
interactions, but only some characteristic information. We compare the proposed method with ten
baseline methods, e.g., six similarity-based methods that utilize only the known interactions
and four methods that utilize the extra characteristic information. The datasets and codes implementing
the simulations are available at https://github.com/rathapech/DTI_LMP.
