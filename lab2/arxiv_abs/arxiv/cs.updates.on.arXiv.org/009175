It is difficult to conduct training and evaluate workers' postural performance by using the actual
job site environment due to safety concerns. Virtual reality (VR) provides an alternative to create
immersive working environments without significant safety concerns. Working on elevated surfaces
is a dangerous scenario, which may lead to gait and postural instability and, consequently, a serious
fall. Previous studies showed that VR is a promising tool for measuring the impact of height on the
postural sway. However, most of these studies used the treadmill as the walking locomotion apparatus
in a virtual environment (VE). This paper was focused on natural walking locomotion to reduce the
inherent postural perturbations of VR devices. To investigate the impact of virtual height on gait
characteristics and keep the level of realism and feeling of presence at their highest, we enhanced
the first-person-character model with "virtual legs". Afterward, we investigated its effect
on the gait parameters of the participants with and without the presence of height. To that end, twelve
healthy adults were asked to walk on a virtual loop path once at the ground level and once at the 17th
floor of an unfinished structure. By quantitatively comparing the participants' gait pattern
results, we observed a decrease in the stride length and increase in the gait duration of the participants
exposed to height. At the ground level, the use of the enhanced model reduced participants' average
stride length and height. The results of this study help us understand users' behaviors when they
were exposed to elevated surfaces and establish a firm ground for gait stability analysis for the
future height-related VR studies. We expect this developed VR platform can generate reliable results
of VR application in more construction safety studies.
