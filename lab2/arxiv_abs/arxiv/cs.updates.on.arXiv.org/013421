In this paper, we propose a novel control architecture, inspired from neuroscience, for adaptive
control of continuous-time systems. A key objective explored in this paper is to design control
architectures and algorithms that can learn and adapt quickly to changes that are even abrupt. The
proposed architecture, in the setting of standard neural network (NN) based adaptive control,
augments an external working memory to the NN. The proposed architecture, in the setting of standard
neural network (NN) based adaptive control, augments an {\it external working memory} to the NN.
The external working memory, through a write operation, stores recently observed feature vectors
from the hidden layer of the NN and can update this information quickly if it becomes less relevant
after abrupt changes. The controller modifies the final control signal by retrieving information
from the working memory. The use of external working memory is aimed at improving the context thereby
inducing the learning system to search in a particular direction. This directed learning allows
the learning system to find a good approximation of the unknown function even after abrupt changes
quickly.We consider two classes of controllers for concrete development of our ideas (i) a model
reference NN adaptive controller for linear systems with matched uncertainty (ii) robot arm controller.
We prove that the resulting controllers lead to Uniformly Ulitmately Bounded (UUB) stable closed
loop systems. We provide a detailed illustration of the working of this learning mechanism through
a simple example. We also provide proof for a simpler estimation problem for how memory augmentation
improves estimation within less number of iterations. Through extensive simulations and specific
metrics we show that memory augmentation improves learning significantly even when the system
undergoes sudden changes.
