Deep learning based methods, such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN), have demonstrated their
efficiency in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. These methods can automatically learn
spectral-spatial discriminative features within local patches. However, for each pixel in an
HSI, it is not only related to its nearby pixels but also has connections to pixels far away from itself.
Therefore, to incorporate the long-range contextual information, a deep fully convolutional
network (FCN) with an efficient non-local module, named ENL-FCN, is proposed for HSI classification.
In the proposed framework, a deep FCN considers an entire HSI as input and extracts spectral-spatial
information in a local receptive field. The efficient non-local module is embedded in the network
as a learning unit to capture the long-range contextual information. Different from the traditional
non-local neural networks, the long-range contextual information is extracted in a specially
designed criss-cross path for computation efficiency. Furthermore, by using a recurrent operation,
each pixel's response is aggregated from all pixels of HSI. The benefits of our proposed ENL-FCN
are threefold: 1) the long-range contextual information is incorporated effectively, 2) the efficient
module can be freely embedded in a deep neural network in a plug-and-play fashion, and 3) it has much
fewer learning parameters and requires less computational resources. The experiments conducted
on three popular HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
classification performance with lower computational cost in comparison with several leading
deep neural networks for HSI.
