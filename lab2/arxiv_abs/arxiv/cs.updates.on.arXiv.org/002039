We investigate relations between $(+,\diamond)$ vector products for binary integer functions
$\diamond$. We show that there exists a broad class of products equivalent under one-to-polylog
reductions to the computation of the Hamming distance. Examples include: the dominance product,
the threshold product and $\ell_{2p+1}$ distances for constant $p$. Our result has the following
consequences: The following All Pairs- problems are of the same complexity (up to polylog factors)
for $n$ vectors in $Z^d$: computing Hamming Distance, $\ell_{2p+1}$ Distance, Threshold Products
and Dominance Products. As a consequence, Yuster's~(SODA'09) algorithm improves not only Matou\v{s}ek's
(IPL'91), but also the results of Indyk, Lewenstein, Lipsky and Porat (ICALP'04) and Min, Kao and
Zhu (COCOON'09). Obtain by reduction algorithms for All Pairs $\ell_3,\ell_5,\dots$ Distances
are new. The following Pattern Matching problems are of the same complexity (up to polylog factors)
for a text of length $n$ and a pattern of length $m$: Hamming Distance, Less-than, Threshold and $\ell_{2p+1}$.
For all of them the current best upper bounds are $\mathcal{O}(n\sqrt{m \log m})$ time due to results
of Abrahamson (SICOMP'87), Amir and Farach (Ann.~Math.~Artif.~Intell.'91), Atallah and Duket
(IPL'11), Clifford, Clifford and Iliopoulous (CPM'05) and Amir, Lipsky, Porat and Umanski (CPM'05).
The obtained algorithms for $\ell_3,\ell_5,\dots$ Pattern Matchings are new. We also show that
the complexity of All Pairs Hamming Distances is within a polylog factor from $sparse(n,d^2,n;nd,nd)$,
where $sparse(a,b,c;m_1,m_2)$ is the time of multiplying sparse matrices of size $a\times b$ and
$b\times c$, with $m_1$ and $m_2$ nonzero entries. This means that the current upperbounds by Yuster
cannot be improved without improving the sparse matrix multiplication algorithm by Yuster and
Zwick~(ACM TALG'05) and vice versa.
