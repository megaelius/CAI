Social media sites are becoming a key factor in politics. These platforms are easy to manipulate
for the purpose of distorting information space to confuse and distract voters. It is of paramount
importance for social media platforms, users engaged with online political discussions, as well
as government agencies to understand the dynamics on social media, and identify malicious groups
engaging in misinformation campaigns and thus polluting the general discourse around a topic of
interest. Past works to identify such disruptive patterns are mostly focused on analyzing user-generated
content such as tweets. In this study, we take a holistic approach and propose SGP to provide an informative
birds eye view of all the activities in these social media sites around a broad topic and detect coordinated
groups suspicious of engaging in misinformation campaigns. To show the effectiveness of SGP, we
deploy it to provide a concise overview of polluting activity on Twitter around the upcoming 2019
Canadian Federal Elections, by analyzing over 60 thousand user accounts connected through 3.4
million connections and 1.3 million hashtags. Users in the polluting groups detected by SGP-flag
are over 4x more likely to become suspended while majority of these highly suspicious users detected
by SGP-flag escaped Twitter's suspending algorithm. Moreover, while few of the polluting hashtags
detected are linked to misinformation campaigns, SGP-sig also flags others that have not been picked
up on. More importantly, we also show that a large coordinated set of right-winged conservative
groups based in the US are heavily engaged in Canadian politics.
