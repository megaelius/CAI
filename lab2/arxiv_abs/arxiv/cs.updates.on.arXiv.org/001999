In this work, we present online and differentially private optimization algorithms for a large
family of nonconvex functions. This family consists of piecewise Lipschitz functions, which are
ubiquitous across diverse domains. For example, problems in computational economics and algorithm
configuration (also known as parameter tuning) often reduce to maximizing piecewise Lipschitz
functions. These functions are challenging to optimize privately and online since a small error
can push an optimal point into a nonoptimal region. We introduce a sufficient and general dispersion
condition on these functions that ensures well-known private and online algorithms have strong
utility guarantees. We show that several important problems from computational economics and
algorithm configuration reduce to optimizing functions that satisfy this condition. We apply
our results to obtain private and online algorithms for these problems. We thus answer several open
questions: Cohen-Addad and Kanade ['17] asked how to optimize piecewise Lipschitz functions online
and Gupta and Roughgarden ['17] asked what algorithm configuration problems can be solved online
with no regret algorithms. In algorithm configuration, the goal is to tune an algorithm's parameters
to optimize its performance over a specific application domain. We analyze greedy techniques for
subset selection problems and SDP-rounding schemes for problems that can be formulated as integer
quadratic programs. In mechanism design and other pricing problems, the goal is to use information
about past consumers to design auctions and set prices that extract high profit from future consumers.
We analyze the classic classes of second price auctions with reserves and posted price mechanisms.
For all of these settings, our general technique implies strong utility bounds in the private setting
and strong regret bounds in the online learning setting.
