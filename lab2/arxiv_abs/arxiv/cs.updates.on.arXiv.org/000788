The rotor-router model, also called the Propp machine, was introduced as a deterministic alternative
to the random walk. In this model, a group of identical tokens are initially placed at nodes of the
graph. Each node maintains a cyclic ordering of the outgoing arcs, and during consecutive turns
the tokens are propagated along arcs chosen according to this ordering in round-robin fashion.
The behavior of the model is fully deterministic. Yanovski et al. (2003) proved that a single rotor-router
walk on any graph with $m$ edges and diameter $D$ stabilizes to a traversal of an Eulerian circuit
on the set of all $2m$ directed arcs on the edge set of the graph, and that such periodic behaviour of
the system is achieved after an initial transient phase of at most $2mD$ steps. The case of multiple
parallel rotor-routers was studied experimentally, leading Yanovski et al. to the conjecture
that a system of $k>1$ parallel walks also stabilizes with a period of length at most $2m$ steps.
In this work we disprove this conjecture, showing that the period of parallel rotor-router walks
can in fact, be exponential in the size of graph. On the positive side, we provide a characterization
of the periodic behavior of parallel router walks, in terms of a structural property of stable states
called a subcycle decomposition. This property provides us the tools to efficiently detect whether
a given system configuration corresponds to the transient or to the limit behaviour of the system.
Moreover, we provide a polynomial upper bound of $O(m^4D^2 + mD\log k)$ on the number of steps it takes
for the system to stabilize. Thus, we are able to predict any future behavior of the system using an
algorithm that takes polynomial time and space. In addition, we show that there exists a separation
between the stabilization time of the single-walk and multiple-walk rotor-router systems, and
that for some graphs the latter can be asymptotically larger even for the case of $k=2$ walks.
