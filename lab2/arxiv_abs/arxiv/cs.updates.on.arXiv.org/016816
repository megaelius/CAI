Estimation of the soil organic carbon content is of utmost importance in understanding the chemical,
physical, and biological functions of the soil. This study proposes machine learning algorithms
of support vector machines, artificial neural networks, regression tree, random forest, extreme
gradient boosting, and conventional deep neural network for advancing prediction models of SOC.
Models are trained with 1879 composite surface soil samples, and 105 auxiliary data as predictors.
The genetic algorithm is used as a feature selection approach to identify effective variables.
The results indicate that precipitation is the most important predictor driving 15 percent of SOC
spatial variability followed by the normalized difference vegetation index, day temperature
index of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, multiresolution valley bottom flatness
and land use, respectively. Based on 10 fold cross validation, the DNN model reported as a superior
algorithm with the lowest prediction error and uncertainty. In terms of accuracy, DNN yielded a
mean absolute error of 59 percent, a root mean squared error of 75 percent, a coefficient of determination
of 0.65, and Lins concordance correlation coefficient of 0.83. The SOC content was the highest in
udic soil moisture regime class with mean values of 4 percent, followed by the aquic and xeric classes,
respectively. Soils in dense forestlands had the highest SOC contents, whereas soils of younger
geological age and alluvial fans had lower SOC. The proposed DNN is a promising algorithm for handling
large numbers of auxiliary data at a province scale, and due to its flexible structure and the ability
to extract more information from the auxiliary data surrounding the sampled observations, it had
high accuracy for the prediction of the SOC baseline map and minimal uncertainty.
