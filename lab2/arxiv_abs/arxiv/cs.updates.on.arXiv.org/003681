Replication studies are essential for validation of new methods, and are crucial to maintain the
high standards of scientific publications, and to use the results in practice. We have attempted
to replicate the main method in 'Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection
of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs' published in JAMA 2016; 316(22). We re-implemented
the method since the source code is not available, and we used publicly available data sets. The original
study used non-public fundus images from EyePACS and three hospitals in India for training. We used
a different EyePACS data set from Kaggle. The original study used the benchmark data set Messidor-2
to evaluate the algorithm's performance. We used the similar Messidor-Original data. In the original
study, ophthalmologists re-graded all images for diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and image
gradability. There was one diabetic retinopathy grade per image for our data sets, and we assessed
image gradability ourselves. Hyper-parameter settings for training and validation were not described
in the original study. We were not able to replicate the original study. Our algorithm's area under
the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.74 on the Kaggle EyePACS test set and 0.59 on Messidor-Original
did not come close to the reported AUC of 0.99 in the original study. This may be caused by the use of
a single grade per image, or different hyper-parameter settings. By changing the pre-processing
methods, our replica algorithm's AUC increased to 0.94 and 0.82, respectively. This study shows
the challenges of replicating deep learning, and the need for more replication studies to validate
deep learning methods, especially for medical image analysis. Our source code and instructions
