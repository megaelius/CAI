Performance and energy are the two most important objectives for optimisation on modern parallel
platforms. Latest research demonstrated the importance of workload distribution as a decision
variable in the bi-objective optimisation for performance and energy on homogeneous multicore
clusters. We show in this work that bi-objective optimisation for performance and energy on heterogeneous
processors results in a large number of Pareto-optimal optimal solutions (workload distributions)
even in the simple case of linear performance and energy profiles. We then study performance and
energy profiles of real-life data-parallel applications and find that their shapes are non-linear,
complex and non-smooth. We, therefore, propose an efficient and exact global optimisation algorithm,
which takes as an input most general discrete performance and dynamic energy profiles of the heterogeneous
processors and solves the bi-objective optimisation problem. The algorithm is also used as a building
block to solve the bi-objective optimisation problem for performance and total energy. We also
propose a novel methodology to build discrete dynamic energy profiles of individual computing
devices, which are input to the algorithm. The methodology is based purely on system-level measurements
and addresses the fundamental challenge of accurate component-level energy modelling of a hybrid
data-parallel application running on a heterogeneous platform integrating CPUs and accelerators.
We experimentally validate the proposed method using two data-parallel applications, matrix
multiplication and 2D fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT).
