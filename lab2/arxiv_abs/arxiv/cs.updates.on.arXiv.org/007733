We will present a new general framework for robust and adaptive control that allows for distributed
and scalable learning and control of large systems of interconnected linear subsystems. The control
method is demonstrated for a linear time-invariant system with bounded parameter uncertainties,
disturbances and noise. The presented scheme continuously collects measurements to reduce the
uncertainty about the system parameters and adapts dynamic robust controllers online in a stable
and performance-improving way. A key enabler for our approach is choosing a time-varying dynamic
controller implementation, inspired by recent work on System Level Synthesis. We leverage a new
robustness result for this implementation to propose a general robust adaptive control algorithm.
In particular, the algorithm allows us to impose communication and delay constraints on the controller
implementation and is formulated as a sequence of robust optimization problems that can be solved
in a distributed manner. The proposed control methodology performs particularly well when the
interconnection between systems is sparse and the dynamics of local regions of subsystems depend
only on a small number of parameters. As we will show on a five-dimensional exemplary chain-system,
the algorithm can utilize system structure to efficiently learn and control the entire system while
respecting communication and implementation constraints. Moreover, although current theoretical
results require the assumption of small initial uncertainties to guarantee robustness, we will
present simulations that show good closed-loop performance even in the case of large uncertainties,
which suggests that this assumption is not critical for the presented technique and future work
will focus on providing less conservative guarantees.
