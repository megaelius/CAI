Advances in vehicular communication technologies are expected to facilitate cooperative driving
in the future. Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are able to collaboratively plan and execute
driving maneuvers by sharing their perceptual knowledge and future plans. In this paper, we present
an architecture for autonomous navigation of tight multi-lane platoons travelling on public roads.
Using the proposed approach, CAVs are able to form single or multi-lane platoons of various geometrical
configurations. They are able to reshape and adjust their configurations according to changes
in the environment. The proposed architecture consists of three main components: an online decision-maker,
an offline motion planner and an online path-follower. The decision-maker selects the desired
platoon configuration based on real-time information about the surrounding traffic. The motion
planner uses an optimization-based approach for cooperative formation and reconfiguration in
tight spaces. The motion planner uses a Model Predictive Control scheme to plan smooth, dynamically
feasible and collision-free trajectories for all the vehicles within the platoon. The paper addresses
online computation limitations by employing a family of maneuvers pre-computed offline and stored
on the vehicles' control units to be executed by a low-level path-following feedback controller
in real-time based on the selected desired configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through simulations of three case studies: 1) formation reconfiguration 2) obstacle
avoidance, and 3) bench-marking against behavior-based planning in which the desired formation
is achieved using a sequence of motion primitives. Videos and software can be found online here https://github.com/RoyaFiroozi/Centralized-Planning.
