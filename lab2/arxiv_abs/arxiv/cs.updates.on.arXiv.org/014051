The era of "data deluge" has sparked renewed interest in graph-based learning methods and their
widespread applications ranging from sociology and biology to transportation and communications.
In this context of graph-aware methods, the present paper introduces a tensor-graph convolutional
network (TGCN) for scalable semi-supervised learning (SSL) from data associated with a collection
of graphs, that are represented by a tensor. Key aspects of the novel TGCN architecture are the dynamic
adaptation to different relations in the tensor graph via learnable weights, and the consideration
of graph-based regularizers to promote smoothness and alleviate over-parameterization. The
ultimate goal is to design a powerful learning architecture able to: discover complex and highly
nonlinear data associations, combine (and select) multiple types of relations, scale gracefully
with the graph size, and remain robust to perturbations on the graph edges. The proposed architecture
is relevant not only in applications where the nodes are naturally involved in different relations
(e.g., a multi-relational graph capturing family, friendship and work relations in a social network),
but also in robust learning setups where the graph entails a certain level of uncertainty, and the
different tensor slabs correspond to different versions (realizations) of the nominal graph.
Numerical tests showcase that the proposed architecture achieves markedly improved performance
relative to standard GCNs, copes with state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, and leads to remarkable
SSL performance over protein-to-protein interaction networks.
