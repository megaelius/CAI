In multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR), persistent scatterer (PS) pixels are used to
estimate geophysical parameters, essentially deformation. Conventionally, PS pixels are selected
on the basis of the estimated noise present in the spatially uncorrelated phase component along
with look-angle error in a temporal interferometric stack. In this study, two deep learning architectures,
namely convolutional neural network for interferometric semantic segmentation (CNN-ISS) and
convolutional long short term memory network for interferometric semantic segmentation (CLSTM-ISS),
based on learning spatial and spatio-temporal behaviour respectively, were proposed for selection
of PS pixels. These networks were trained to relate the interferometric phase history to its classification
into phase stable (PS) and phase unstable (non-PS) measurement pixels using ~10,000 real world
interferometric images of different study sites containing man-made objects, forests, vegetation,
uncropped land, water bodies, and areas affected by lengthening, foreshortening, layover and
shadowing. The networks were trained using training labels obtained from the Stanford method for
Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (StaMPS) algorithm. However, pixel selection results,
when compared to a combination of R-index and a classified image of the test dataset, reveal that
CLSTM-ISS estimates improved the classification of PS and non-PS pixels compared to those of StaMPS
and CNN-ISS. The predicted results show that CLSTM-ISS reached an accuracy of 93.50%, higher than
that of CNN-ISS (89.21%). CLSTM-ISS also improved the density of reliable PS pixels compared to
StaMPS and CNN-ISS and outperformed StaMPS and other conventional MT-InSAR methods in terms of
computational efficiency.
