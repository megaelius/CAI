Common intervals of K permutations over the same set of n elements were firstly investigated by T.
Uno and M.Yagiura (Algorithmica, 26:290:309, 2000), who proposed an efficient algorithm to find
common intervals when K=2. Several particular classes of intervals have been defined since then,
e.g. conserved intervals and nested common intervals, with applications mainly in genome comparison.
Each such class, including common intervals, led to the development of a specific algorithmic approach
for K=2, and - except for nested common intervals - for its extension to an arbitrary K. In this paper,
we propose a common and efficient algorithmic framework for finding different types of common intervals
in a set P of K permutations, with arbitrary K. Our generic algorithm is based on a global representation
of the information stored in P, called the MinMax-profile of P, and an efficient data structure,
called an LR-stack, that we introduce here. We show that common intervals (and their subclass of
irreducible common intervals), nested common intervals (and their subclass of maximal nested
common intervals) as well as conserved intervals (and their subclass of irreducible conserved
intervals) may be obtained by appropriately setting the parameters of our algorithm in each case.
All the resulting algorithms run in O(Kn+N)-time and need O(n) additional space, where N is the number
of solutions. The algorithms for nested common intervals and maximal nested common intervals are
new for K>2, in the sense that no other algorithm has been given so far to solve the problem with
the same complexity, or better. The other algorithms are as efficient as the best known algorithms.
