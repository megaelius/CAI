Cryptocurrencies are a digital medium of exchange with decentralized control that renders the
community operating the cryptocurrency its sovereign. Leading cryptocurrencies use proof-of-work
or proof-of-stake to reach consensus, thus are inherently plutocratic. This plutocracy is reflected
not only in control over execution, but also in the distribution of new wealth, giving rise to "rich
get richer" phenomena. Here, we explore the possibility of an alternative digital currency that
is egalitarian in control and just in the distribution of created wealth. Such currencies can form
and grow in grassroots and sybil-resilient way. A single currency community can achieve distributive
justice by egalitarian coin minting, where each member mints one coin at every time step. Egalitarian
minting results, in the limit, in the dilution of any inherited assets and in each member having an
equal share of the minted currency, adjusted by the relative productivity of the members. Our main
theorem shows that a currency network, where agents can be members of more than one currency community,
can achieve distributive justice globally across the network by joint egalitarian minting, where
each each agent mints one coin in only one community at each timestep. Equality and distributive
justice can be achieved among people that own the computational agents of a currency community provided
that the agents are genuine (unique and singular). We show that currency networks are sybil-resilient,
in the sense that sybils affect only the communities that harbour them. Furthermore, if a currency
network has a subnet of genuine currency communities, then distributive justice can be achieves
among all the owners of the subnet.
