With the prosperity of business intelligence, recommender systems have evolved into a new stage
that we not only care about what to recommend, but why it is recommended. Explainability of recommendations
thus emerges as a focal point of research and becomes extremely desired in e-commerce. Existent
studies along this line often exploit item attributes and correlations from different perspectives,
but they yet lack an effective way to combine both types of information for deep learning of personalized
interests. In light of this, we propose a novel graph structure, \emph{attribute network}, based
on both items' co-purchase network and important attributes. A novel neural model called \emph{eRAN}
is then proposed to generate recommendations from attribute networks with explainability and
cold-start capability. Specifically, eRAN first maps items connected in attribute networks to
low-dimensional embedding vectors through a deep autoencoder, and then an attention mechanism
is applied to model the attractions of attributes to users, from which personalized item representation
can be derived. Moreover, a pairwise ranking loss is constructed into eRAN to improve recommendations,
with the assumption that item pairs co-purchased by a user should be more similar than those non-paired
with negative sampling in personalized view. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method compared with some state-of-the-art competitors. In particular,
eRAN shows its unique abilities in recommending cold-start items with higher accuracy, as well
as in understanding user preferences underlying complicated co-purchasing behaviors.
