Social influence is the process by which individuals adapt their opinion, revise their beliefs,
or change their behavior as a result of social interactions with other people. In our strongly interconnected
society, social influence plays a prominent role in many self-organized phenomena such as herding
in cultural markets, the spread of ideas and innovations, and the amplification of fears during
epidemics. Yet, the mechanisms of opinion formation remain poorly understood, and existing physics-based
models lack systematic empirical validation. Here, we report two controlled experiments showing
how participants answering factual questions revise their initial judgments after being exposed
to the opinion and confidence level of others. Based on the observation of 59 experimental subjects
exposed to peer-opinion for 15 different items, we draw an influence map that describes the strength
of peer influence during interactions. A simple process model derived from our observations demonstrates
how opinions in a group of interacting people can converge or split over repeated interactions.
In particular, we identify two major attractors of opinion: (i) the expert effect, induced by the
presence of a highly confident individual in the group, and (ii) the majority effect, caused by the
presence of a critical mass of laypeople sharing similar opinions. Additional simulations reveal
the existence of a tipping point at which one attractor will dominate over the other, driving collective
opinion in a given direction. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms
of public opinion formation and managing conflicting situations in which self-confident and better
informed minorities challenge the views of a large uninformed majority.
