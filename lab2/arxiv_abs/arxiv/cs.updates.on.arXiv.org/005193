We derive an algorithm to compute satisfiability bounds for arbitrary {\omega}-regular properties
in an Interval-valued Markov Chain (IMC) interpreted in the adversarial sense. IMCs generalize
regular Markov Chains by assigning a range of possible values to the transition probabilities between
states. In particular, we expand the automata-based theory of {\omega}-regular property verification
in Markov Chains to apply it to IMCs. Any {\omega}-regular property can be represented by a Deterministic
Rabin Automata (DRA) with acceptance conditions expressed by Rabin pairs. Previous works on Markov
Chains have shown that computing the probability of satisfying a given {\omega}-regular property
reduces to a reachability problem in the product between the Markov Chain and the corresponding
DRA. We similarly define the notion of a product between an IMC and a DRA. Then, we show that in a product
IMC, there exists a particular assignment of the transition values that generates a largest set
of non-accepting states. Subsequently, we prove that a lower bound is found by solving a reachability
problem in that refined version of the original product IMC. We derive a similar approach for computing
a satisfiability upper bound in a product IMC with one Rabin pair. For product IMCs with more than
one Rabin pair, we establish that computing a satisfiability upper bound is equivalent to lower-bounding
the satisfiability of the complement of the original property. A search algorithm for finding the
largest accepting and non-accepting sets of states in a product IMC is proposed. Finally, we demonstrate
our findings in a case study.
