Tavenas has recently proved that any n^{O(1)}-variate and degree n polynomial in VP can be computed
by a depth-4 circuit of size 2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log n)}. So to prove VP not equal to VNP, it is sufficient
to show that an explicit polynomial in VNP of degree n requires 2^{\omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)} size
depth-4 circuits. Soon after Tavenas's result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth-4
circuit size lower bounds of 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)} have been proved Kayal et al. and Fournier
et al. In particular, using combinatorial design Kayal et al.\ construct an explicit polynomial
in VNP that requires depth-4 circuits of size 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)} and Fournier et al.\ show
that iterated matrix multiplication polynomial (which is in VP) also requires 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log
n)} size depth-4 circuits. In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that
any polynomial f that satisfies the property would achieve similar circuit size lower bound for
depth-4 circuits. In particular, it does not matter whether f is in VP or in VNP. As a result, we get
a very simple unified lower bound analysis for the above mentioned polynomials. Another goal of
this paper is to compare between our current knowledge of depth-4 circuit size lower bounds and determinantal
complexity lower bounds. We prove the that the determinantal complexity of iterated matrix multiplication
polynomial is \Omega(dn) where d is the number of matrices and n is the dimension of the matrices.
So for d=n, we get that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial achieves the current best
known lower bounds in both fronts: depth-4 circuit size and determinantal complexity. To the best
of our knowledge, a \Theta(n) bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated matrix multiplication
polynomial was known only for constant d>1 by Jansen.
