Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) is a well-known rule for fair allocation of resources
among agents with different preferences. It has many advantages, among them is the fact that a CEEI
allocation is both weakly Pareto-optimal and envy-free. However, when the resources are indivisible,
a CEEI allocation might not exist even when there are two agents and one item. In contrast to this discouraging
non-existence result, Babaioff, Nisan and Talgam-Cohen (2017) recently suggested a new and more
encouraging approach to allocation of indivisible goods: instead of insisting that the incomes
be equal, they look at the entire space of possible incomes, and check whether there exists a \emph{competitive
equilibrium for almost all income-vectors} --- all income-space except a subset of zero volume.
In the domain of monotonic preferences, they show existence when there are at most 3 goods, or when
there are 4 goods and two agents. They also show non-existence when there are 5 goods and two agents.
They leave open the cases of 4 goods with three or four agents. This paper presents a new tool for describing
a CE, as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of a specific sequential game. This tool enables simpler
solutions to the known cases (at most 3 goods, and 4 goods with two agents), as well as a solution to
the previously unsolved case of 4 goods and 3 agents with additive preferences. Moreover, the paper
proves non-existence for 4 goods and three or more agents with monotonic preferences. When the items
to be divided are chores (with a negative utility), CE exists for almost all incomes when there are
two agents with at most 4 chores, but does not exist for two agents with 5 chores or for three agents
with any number of chores. Thus, this paper completes the analysis of CE existence for almost all
incomes, for the domain of monotonic preferences.
