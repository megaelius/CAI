Purpose: In surgical navigation, pre-operative organ models are presented to surgeons during
the intervention to help them in efficiently finding their target. In the case of soft tissue, these
models need to be deformed and adapted to the current situation by using intra-operative sensor
data. A promising method to realize this are real-time capable biomechanical models. Methods:
We train a fully convolutional neural network to estimate a displacement field of all points inside
an organ when given only the displacement of a part of the organ's surface. The network trains on entirely
synthetic data of random organ-like meshes, which allows us to generate much more data than is otherwise
available. The input and output data is discretized into a regular grid, allowing us to fully utilize
the capabilities of convolutional operators and to train and infer in a highly parallelized manner.
Results: The system is evaluated on in-silico liver models, phantom liver data and human in-vivo
breathing data. We test the performance with varying material parameters, organ shapes and amount
of visible surface. Even though the network is only trained on synthetic data, it adapts well to the
various cases and gives a good estimation of the internal organ displacement. The inference runs
at over 50 frames per second. Conclusions: We present a novel method for training a data-driven,
real-time capable deformation model. The accuracy is comparable to other registration methods,
it adapts very well to previously unseen organs and does not need to be re-trained for every patient.
The high inferring speed makes this method useful for many applications such as surgical navigation
and real-time simulation.
