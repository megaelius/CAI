One of the major hurdles preventing the full exploitation of information from online communities
is the widespread concern regarding the quality and credibility of user-contributed content.
Prior works in this domain operate on a static snapshot of the community, making strong assumptions
about the structure of the data (e.g., relational tables), or consider only shallow features for
text classification. To address the above limitations, we propose probabilistic graphical models
that can leverage the joint interplay between multiple factors in online communities --- like user
interactions, community dynamics, and textual content --- to automatically assess the credibility
of user-contributed online content, and the expertise of users and their evolution with user-interpretable
explanation. To this end, we devise new models based on Conditional Random Fields for different
settings like incorporating partial expert knowledge for semi-supervised learning, and handling
discrete labels as well as numeric ratings for fine-grained analysis. This enables applications
such as extracting reliable side-effects of drugs from user-contributed posts in healthforums,
and identifying credible content in news communities. Online communities are dynamic, as users
join and leave, adapt to evolving trends, and mature over time. To capture this dynamics, we propose
generative models based on Hidden Markov Model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Brownian Motion
to trace the continuous evolution of user expertise and their language model over time. This allows
us to identify expert users and credible content jointly over time, improving state-of-the-art
recommender systems by explicitly considering the maturity of users. This also enables applications
such as identifying helpful product reviews, and detecting fake and anomalous reviews with limited
information.
