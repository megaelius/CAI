Access to a large variety of data across a massive population has made it possible to predict customer
purchase patterns and responses to marketing campaigns. In particular, accurate demand forecasts
for popular products with frequent repeat purchases are essential since these products are one
of the main drivers of profits. However, buyer purchase patterns are extremely diverse and sparse
on a per-product level due to population heterogeneity as well as dependence in purchase patterns
across product categories. Traditional methods in survival analysis have proven effective in
dealing with censored data by assuming parametric distributions on inter-arrival times. Distributional
parameters are then fitted, typically in a regression framework. On the other hand, neural-network
based models take a non-parametric approach to learn relations from a larger functional class.
However, the lack of distributional assumptions make it difficult to model partially observed
data. In this paper, we model directly the inter-arrival times as well as the partially observed
information at each time step in a survival-based approach using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
to model purchase times jointly over several products. Instead of predicting a point estimate for
inter-arrival times, the RNN outputs parameters that define a distributional estimate. The loss
function is the negative log-likelihood of these parameters given partially observed data. This
approach allows one to leverage both fully observed data as well as partial information. By externalizing
the censoring problem through a log-likelihood loss function, we show that substantial improvements
over state-of-the-art machine learning methods can be achieved. We present experimental results
based on two open datasets as well as a study on a real dataset from a large retailer.
