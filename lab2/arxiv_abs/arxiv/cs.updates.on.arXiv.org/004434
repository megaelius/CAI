We performed two online surveys of Stack Overflow answerers and visitors to assess their awareness
to outdated code and software licenses in Stack Overflow answerers. The answerer survey targeted
607 highly reputed Stack Overflow users and received a high response rate of 33%. Our findings are
as follows. Although most of the code snippets in the answers are written from scratch, there are
code snippets cloned from the corresponding questions, from personal or company projects, or from
open source projects. Stack Overflow answerers are aware that some of their snippets are outdated.
However, 19% of the participants report that they rarely or never fix their outdated code. At least
98% of the answerers never include software licenses in their snippets and 69% never check for licensing
conflicts with Stack Overflow's CC BY-SA 3.0 if they copy the code from other sources to Stack Overflow
answers. The visitor survey uses convenient sampling and received 89 responses. We found that 66%
of the participants experienced a problem from cloning and reusing Stack Overflow snippets. Fifty-six
percent of the visitors never reported the problems back to the Stack Overflow post. Eighty-five
percent of the participants are not aware that StackOverflow applies the CC BY-SA 3.0 license, and
sixty-two percent never give attributions to Stack Overflow posts or answers they copied the code
from. Moreover, 66% of the participants do not check for licensing conflicts between the copied
Stack Overflow code and their software. With these findings, we suggest Stack Overflow raise awareness
of their users, both answerers and visitors, to the problem of outdated and license-violating code
snippets.
