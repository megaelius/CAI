Supervised learning has long been attributed to several feed-forward neural circuits within the
brain, with attention being paid to the cerebellar granular layer. The focus of this study is to evaluate
the input activity representation of these feed-forward neural networks. The activity of cerebellar
granule cells is conveyed by parallel fibers and translated into Purkinje cell activity; the sole
output of the cerebellar cortex. The learning process at this parallel-fiber-to-Purkinje-cell
connection makes each Purkinje cell sensitive to a set of specific cerebellar states, determined
by the granule-cell activity during a certain time window. A Purkinje cell becomes sensitive to
each neural input state and, consequently, the network operates as a function able to generate a
desired output for each provided input by means of supervised learning. However, not all sets of
Purkinje cell responses can be assigned to any set of input states due to the network's own limitations
(inherent to the network neurobiological substrate), that is, not all input-output mapping can
be learned. A limiting factor is the representation of the input states through granule-cell activity.
The quality of this representation will determine the capacity of the network to learn a varied set
of outputs. In this study we present an algorithm for evaluating quantitatively the level of compatibility/interference
amongst a set of given cerebellar states according to their representation (granule-cell activation
patterns) without the need for actually conducting simulations and network training. The algorithm
input consists of a real-number matrix that codifies the activity level of every considered granule-cell
in each state. The capability of this representation to generate a varied set of outputs is evaluated
geometrically, thus resulting in a real number that assesses the goodness of the representation
