Critical task and cognition-based environments, such as in military and defense operations, aviation
user-technology interaction evaluation on UI, understanding intuitiveness of a hardware model
or software toolkit, etc. require an assessment of how much a particular task is generating mental
workload on a user. This is necessary for understanding how those tasks, operations, and activities
can be improvised and made better suited for the users so that they reduce the mental workload on the
individual and the operators can use them with ease and less difficulty. However, a particular task
can be gauged by a user as simple while for others it may be difficult. Understanding the complexity
of a particular task can only be done on user level and we propose to do this by understanding the mental
workload (MWL) generated on an operator while performing a task which requires processing a lot
of information to get the task done. In this work, we have proposed an experimental setup which replicates
modern day workload on doing regular day job tasks. We propose an approach to automatically evaluate
the task complexity perceived by an individual by using electroencephalogram (EEG) data of a user
during operation. Few crucial steps that are addressed in this work include extraction and optimization
of different features and selection of relevant features for dimensionality reduction and using
supervised machine learning techniques. In addition to this, performance results of the classifiers
are compared using all features and also using only the selected features. From the results, it can
be inferred that machine learning algorithms perform better as compared to traditional approaches
for mental workload estimation.
