We present an extensible software framework, hIPPYlib, for solution of large-scale deterministic
and Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with infinite-dimensional
parameter fields (which are high-dimensional after discretization). hIPPYlib overcomes the
prohibitive nature of Bayesian inversion for this class of problems by implementing state-of-the-art
scalable algorithms for PDE-based inverse problems that exploit the structure of the underlying
operators, notably the Hessian of the log-posterior. The key property of the algorithms implemented
in hIPPYlib is that the solution of the deterministic and linearized Bayesian inverse problem is
computed at a cost, measured in linearized forward PDE solves, that is independent of the parameter
dimension. The mean of the posterior is approximated by the MAP point, which is found by minimizing
the negative log-posterior. This deterministic nonlinear least-squares optimization problem
is solved with an inexact matrix-free Newton-CG method. The posterior covariance is approximated
by the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log posterior evaluated at the MAP point. This Gaussian
approximation is exact when the parameter-to-observable map is linear; otherwise, its logarithm
agrees to two derivatives with the log-posterior at the MAP point, and thus it can serve as a proposal
for Hessian-based MCMC methods. The construction of the posterior covariance is made tractable
by invoking a low-rank approximation of the Hessian of the log-likelihood. Scalable tools for sample
generation are also implemented. hIPPYlib makes all of these advanced algorithms easily accessible
to domain scientists and provides an environment that expedites the development of new algorithms.
hIPPYlib is also a teaching tool to educate researchers and practitioners who are new to inverse
problems and the Bayesian inference framework.
