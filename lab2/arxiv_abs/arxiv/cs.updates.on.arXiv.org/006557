Ranking node importance is crucial in understanding network structure and function on complex
networks. Degree, h-index and coreness are widely used, but which one is more proper to a network
associated with a dynamical process, e.g. SIR spreading process, is still unclear. To fill this
gap, a, which is extracted from the fitting function (f(x)=1-1/(e^(2a(x-b))+1)) of the average
number of nodes in each radius of the neighborhood of a node, is proposed. Experiment results which
are carried out on twenty real-world networks show that a can classify which of the three measures
(degree, h-index and coreness) is more proper to a network in ranking node importance. We also find
that [b/3] is a good indicator for forecasting the optimal radius of the neighborhood of a node in
ranking node importance for a given network. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first solution
of this interesting and open issue. Furthermore, by extending the range of neighborhood where we
construct an operator H on of a node, we propose a new method to quantify the importance of a node. The
ranking accuracies of most networks can be improved when the radius is increased from 0 to its forecasting
optimal radius and the improvement, for the best case, reaches up to 111%. The performances will
reduce on half of the networks studied in this paper if we roughly extend the radius of the neighborhood.
Our work deepens the understanding of how to find out the proper node ranking method for complex networks.
The proposed methods bridge the gaps among network structure and node importance, and may have potential
applications in controlling the outbreak of disease, designing of optimal information spreading
strategies.
