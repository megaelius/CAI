Purpose: Off-resonance artifact correction by deep-learning, to facilitate rapid pediatric
body imaging with a scan time efficient 3D cones trajectory. Methods: A residual convolutional
neural network to correct off-resonance artifacts (Off-ResNet) was trained with a prospective
study of 30 pediatric magnetic resonance angiography exams. Each exam acquired a short-readout
scan (1.18 ms +- 0.38) and a long-readout scan (3.35 ms +- 0.74) at 3T. Short-readout scans, with longer
scan times but negligible off-resonance blurring, were used as reference images and augmented
with additional off-resonance for supervised training examples. Long-readout scans, with greater
off-resonance artifacts but shorter scan time, were corrected by autofocus and Off-ResNet and
compared to short-readout scans by normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), structural similarity
index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scans were also compared by scoring on eight
anatomical features by two radiologists, using analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey's test.
Reader agreement was determined with intraclass correlation. Results: Long-readout scans were
on average 59.3% shorter than short-readout scans. Images from Off-ResNet had superior NRMSE,
SSIM, and PSNR compared to uncorrected images across +-1kHz off-resonance (P<0.01). The proposed
method had superior NRMSE over -677Hz to +1kHz and superior SSIM and PSNR over +-1kHz compared to
autofocus (P<0.01). Radiologic scoring demonstrated that long-readout scans corrected with
Off-ResNet were non-inferior to short-readout scans (P<0.01). Conclusion: The proposed method
can correct off-resonance artifacts from rapid long-readout 3D cones scans to a non-inferior image
quality compared to diagnostically standard short-readout scans.
