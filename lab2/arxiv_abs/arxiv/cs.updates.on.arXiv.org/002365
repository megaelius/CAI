Recently, two new indicators (Equalized Mean-based Normalized Proportion Cited, EMNPC; Mean-based
Normalized Proportion Cited, MNPC) were proposed which are intended for sparse scientometrics
data. The indicators compare the proportion of mentioned papers (e.g. on Facebook) of a unit (e.g.,
a researcher or institution) with the proportion of mentioned papers in the corresponding fields
and publication years (the expected values). In this study, we propose a third indicator (Mantel-Haenszel
quotient, MHq) belonging to the same indicator family. The MHq is based on the MH analysis - an established
method in statistics for the comparison of proportions. We test (using citations and assessments
by peers, i.e. F1000Prime recommendations) if the three indicators can distinguish between different
quality levels as defined on the basis of the assessments by peers. Thus, we test their convergent
validity. We find that the indicator MHq is able to distinguish between the quality levels in most
cases while MNPC and EMNPC are not. Since the MHq is shown in this study to be a valid indicator, we apply
it to six types of zero-inflated altmetrics data and test whether different altmetrics sources
are related to quality. The results for the various altmetrics demonstrate that the relationship
between altmetrics (Wikipedia, Facebook, blogs, and news data) and assessments by peers is not
as strong as the relationship between citations and assessments by peers. Actually, the relationship
between citations and peer assessments is about two to three times stronger than the association
between altmetrics and assessments by peers.
