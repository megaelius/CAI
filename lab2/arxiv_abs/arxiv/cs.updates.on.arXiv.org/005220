Here we study the NP-complete $K$-SAT problem. Although the worst-case complexity of NP-complete
problems is conjectured to be exponential, there exist parametrized random ensembles of problems
where solutions can typically be found in polynomial time for suitable ranges of the parameter.
In fact, random $K$-SAT, with $\alpha=M/N $ as control parameter, can be solved quickly for small
enough values of $\alpha$. It shows a phase transition between a satisfiable phase and an unsatisfiable
phase. For branch and bound algorithms, which operate in the space of feasible Boolean configurations,
the empirically hardest problems are located only close to this phase transition. Here we study
$K$-SAT ($K=3,4$) and the related optimization problem MAX-SAT by a linear programming approach,
which is widely used for practical problems and allows for polynomial run time. In contrast to branch
and bound it operates outside the space of feasible configurations. On the other hand, finding a
solution within polynomial time is not guaranteed. We investigated several variants like including
artificial objective functions, so called cutting-plane approaches, and a mapping to the NP-complete
vertex-cover problem. We observed several easy-hard transitions, from where the problems are
typically solvable (in polynomial time) using the given algorithms, respectively, to where they
are not solvable in polynomial time. For the related vertex-cover problem on random graphs these
easy-hard transitions can be identified with structural properties of the graphs, like percolation
transitions. For the present random $K$-SAT problem we have investigated numerous structural
properties also exhibiting clear transitions, but they appear not be correlated to the here observed
easy-hard transitions. This renders the behaviour of random $K$-SAT more complex than, e.g., the
vertex-cover problem.
