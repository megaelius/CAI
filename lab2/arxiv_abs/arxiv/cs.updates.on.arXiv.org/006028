$ $In many optimization problems, a feasible solution induces a multi-dimensional cost vector.
For example, in load-balancing a schedule induces a load vector across the machines. In $k$-clustering,
opening $k$ facilities induces an assignment cost vector across the clients. In this paper we consider
the following minimum norm optimization problem : Given an arbitrary monotone, symmetric norm,
find a solution which minimizes the norm of the induced cost-vector. This generalizes many fundamental
NP-hard problems. We give a general framework to tackle the minimum norm problem, and illustrate
its efficacy in the unrelated machine load balancing and $k$-clustering setting. Our concrete
results are the following. $\bullet$ We give constant factor approximation algorithms for the
minimum norm load balancing problem in unrelated machines, and the minimum norm $k$-clustering
problem. To our knowledge, our results constitute the first constant-factor approximations for
such a general suite of objectives. $\bullet$ In load balancing with unrelated machines, we give
a $2$-approximation for the problem of finding an assignment minimizing the sum of the largest $\ell$
loads, for any $\ell$. We give a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the so-called ordered load-balancing
problem. $\bullet$ For $k$-clustering, we give a $(5+\varepsilon)$-approximation for the ordered
$k$-median problem significantly improving the constant factor approximations from Byrka, Sornat,
and Spoerhase (STOC 2018) and Chakrabarty and Swamy (ICALP 2018). $\bullet$ Our techniques also
imply $O(1)$ approximations to the best simultaneous optimization factor for any instance of the
unrelated machine load-balancing and the $k$-clustering setting. To our knowledge, these are
the first positive simultaneous optimization results in these settings.
