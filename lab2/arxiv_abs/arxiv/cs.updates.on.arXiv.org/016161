Modern automation systems rely on closed loop control, wherein a controller interacts with a controlled
process, based on observations. These systems are increasingly complex, yet most controllers
are linear Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. PID controllers perform well
on linear and near-linear systems but their simplicity is at odds with the robustness required to
reliably control complex processes. Modern machine learning offers a way to extend PID controllers
beyond their linear capabilities by using neural networks. However, such an extension comes at
the cost of losing stability guarantees and controller interpretability. In this paper, we examine
the utility of extending PID controllers with recurrent neural networks-namely, General Dynamic
Neural Networks (GDNN); we show that GDNN (neural) PID controllers perform well on a range of control
systems and highlight how they can be a scalable and interpretable option for control systems. To
do so, we provide an extensive study using four benchmark systems that represent the most common
control engineering benchmarks. All control benchmarks are evaluated with and without noise as
well as with and without disturbances. The neural PID controller performs better than standard
PID control in 15 of 16 tasks and better than model-based control in 13 of 16 tasks. As a second contribution,
we address the lack of interpretability that prevents neural networks from being used in real-world
control processes. We use bounded-input bounded-output stability analysis to evaluate the parameters
suggested by the neural network, thus making them understandable. This combination of rigorous
evaluation paired with better interpretability is an important step towards the acceptance of
neural-network-based control approaches. It is furthermore an important step towards interpretable
and safely applied artificial intelligence.
