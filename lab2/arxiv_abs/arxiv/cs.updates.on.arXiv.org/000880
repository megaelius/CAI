In multi-user information theory it is often assumed that every node in the network possesses all
codebooks used in the network. This assumption may be impractical in distributed ad-hoc, cognitive
or heterogeneous networks. This work considers the two-user Interference Channel with one Oblivious
Receiver (IC-OR), i.e., one receiver lacks knowledge of the interfering cookbook while the other
receiver knows both codebooks. The paper asks whether, and if so how much, the channel capacity of
the IC-OR is reduced compared to that of the classical IC where both receivers know all codebooks.
A novel outer bound is derived and shown to be achievable to within a gap for the class of injective
semi-deterministic IC-ORs; the gap is shown to be zero for injective fully deterministic IC-ORs.
For the linear deterministic IC-OR that models the Gaussian noise channel at high SNR, non i.i.d.
Bernoulli(1/2) input bits are shown to achieve points not achievable by i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2)
input bits used in the same achievability scheme. For the real-valued Gaussian IC-OR the gap is shown
to be at most 1/2 bit per channel use, even though the set of optimal input distributions for the derived
outer bound could not be determined. Towards understanding the Gaussian IC-OR, an achievability
strategy is evaluated in which the input alphabets at the non-oblivious transmitter are a mixture
of discrete and Gaussian random variables, where the cardinality of the discrete part is appropriately
chosen as a function of the channel parameters. Surprisingly, as the oblivious receiver intuitively
should not be able to 'jointly decode' the intended and interfering messages (whose codebook is
unavailable), it is shown that with this choice of input, the capacity region of the symmetric Gaussian
IC-OR is to within 3.34 bits (per channel use per user) of an outer bound for the classical Gaussian
IC with full codebook knowledge.
