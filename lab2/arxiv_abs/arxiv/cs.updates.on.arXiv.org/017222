Research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications has spread over many scientific disciplines.
Scientists have tested the power of intelligent algorithms developed to predict (or learn from)
natural, physical and social phenomena. This also applies to crime-related research problems.
Nonetheless, studies that map the current state of the art at the intersection between AI and crime
are lacking. What are the current research trends in terms of topics in this area? What is the structure
of scientific collaboration when considering works investigating criminal issues using machine
learning, deep learning, and AI in general? What are the most active countries in this specific scientific
sphere? Using data retrieved from the Scopus database, this work quantitatively analyzes 692 published
works at the intersection between AI and crime employing network science to respond to these questions.
Results show that researchers are mainly focusing on cyber-related criminal topics and that relevant
themes such as algorithmic discrimination, fairness, and ethics are considerably overlooked.
Furthermore, data highlight the extremely disconnected structure of co-authorship networks.
Such disconnectedness may represent a substantial obstacle to a more solid community of scientists
interested in these topics. Additionally, the graph of scientific collaboration indicates that
countries that are more prone to engage in international partnerships are generally less central
in the network. This means that scholars working in highly productive countries (e.g. the United
States, China) tend to mostly collaborate domestically. Finally, current issues and future developments
within this scientific area are also discussed.
