The directed network of telephone subscribers is considered in the article. It can be described
as a dynamic network with vertices that correspond to the subscribers of the telephone network and
emerging directional edges that correspond to the connections between the respective subscribers.
The position of the edge and its direction is determined by the incoming and outgoing calls from the
corresponding vertices. The subject of the article is the statistical properties of the connections
of a certain subset of telephone network subscribers. Such connections are dynamic in nature due
to their appearance and disappearance. The number of outgoing (or incoming) connections occurred
during a day at a selected vertex is used as the main characteristic. The distribution density of
the number of outgoing (or incoming) connections (or calls) of such a network has been analyzed using
the experimental data. It has been shown that such a distribution density over the number of calls
obeys the lognormal distribution density, which depends on the two parameters. The values of two
parameters, namely the mean value and the variance, determining the lognormal distribution density
are established. The reasons for the appearance of a lognormal distribution density over the number
of incoming (or outgoing) connections have been discussed. The statistical properties of other
groups of subscribers have been considered as well. In particular, the group that makes a large number
of outgoing calls to various subscribers of the telephone network has been selected for a separate
study. The members of this group, who create and distribute spam can be called spammers. It has been
shown that these groups, spammers for example, also obeys the lognormal distribution density over
the number of calls but they are characterized by the different mean value and variance.
