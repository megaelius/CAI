When designing service and pricing models, an important goal is to both enable user-friendly and
cost-effective access to services and achieve a high system's utilization. Such design could attract
more users and improve the revenue. QoS-differentiated pricing represents an important direction
to address the above design goal as illustrated by numerous studies in other fields such as Internet.
In this paper, we propose the first analytical model of QoS-differentiated posted pricing in the
context of cloud computing. In this model, a cloud provider offers a stable set of SLAs and their prices
are also posted to users in advance, where higher QoSs are charged higher prices. As a result, users
can directly choose their preferred SLA with a certain price, in contrast to many existing dynamic
pricing mechanisms with the uncertain prices and availability of cloud resource. In order to maximizing
the revenue of a cloud provider, the questions that arise here include: (1) setting the prices properly
to direct users to the right SLAs best fitting their need, and, (2) given a fixed cloud capacity, determining
how many servers should be assigned to each SLA and which users and how many of their jobs are admitted
to be served. To this respect, we propose optimal schemes to jointly determine SLA-based prices
and perform capacity planning. In spite of the usability of such a pricing model, simulations also
show that it could improve the utilization of computing resource by up to eleven-fold increase,
compared with the standard pay-as-you-go pricing model; furthermore, the revenue of a cloud provider
could be improved by up to a five-fold increase.
