Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets, knowledge transfer from
pre-trained models showed outstanding performance in medical image classification. However,
building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced
classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper,
we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition
for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model.4S-DTencourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from
large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using
a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised
learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT
helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy
with a class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data.4S-DT can deal with
any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream
class-decomposition mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine
transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has achieved
an accuracy of 97.54% (95% CI: 96.22%, 98.91%) in the detection of COVID-19 cases on an extended test
set enriched by augmented images, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the
highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.
