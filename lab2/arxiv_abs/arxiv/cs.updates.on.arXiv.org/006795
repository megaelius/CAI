In this paper, we propose generating synthetic multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions on MRI images with
the final aim to improve the performance of supervised machine learning algorithms, therefore
avoiding the problem of the lack of available ground truth. We propose a two-input two-output fully
convolutional neural network model for MS lesion synthesis in MRI images. The lesion information
is encoded as discrete binary intensity level masks passed to the model and stacked with the input
images. The model is trained end-to-end without the need for manually annotating the lesions in
the training set. We then perform the generation of synthetic lesions on healthy images via registration
of patient images, which are subsequently used for data augmentation to increase the performance
for supervised MS lesion detection algorithms. Our pipeline is evaluated on MS patient data from
an in-house clinical dataset and the public ISBI2015 challenge dataset. The evaluation is based
on measuring the similarities between the real and the synthetic images as well as in terms of lesion
detection performance by segmenting both the original and synthetic images individually using
a state-of-the-art segmentation framework. We also demonstrate the usage of synthetic MS lesions
generated on healthy images as data augmentation. We analyze a scenario of limited training data
(one-image training) to demonstrate the effect of the data augmentation on both datasets. Our results
significantly show the effectiveness of the usage of synthetic MS lesion images. For the ISBI2015
challenge, our one-image model trained using only a single image plus the synthetic data augmentation
strategy showed a performance similar to that of other CNN methods that were fully trained using
the entire training set, yielding a comparable human expert rater performance
