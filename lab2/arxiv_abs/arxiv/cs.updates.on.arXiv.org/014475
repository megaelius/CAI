This research work deals with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and extraction of essential information
in an explicit form. The most common among the information management strategies is Document Retrieval
(DR) and Information Filtering. DR systems may work as combine harvesters, which bring back useful
material from the vast fields of raw material. With large amount of potentially useful information
in hand, an Information Extraction (IE) system can then transform the raw material by refining and
reducing it to a germ of original text. A Document Retrieval system collects the relevant documents
carrying the required information, from the repository of texts. An IE system then transforms them
into information that is more readily digested and analyzed. It isolates relevant text fragments,
extracts relevant information from the fragments, and then arranges together the targeted information
in a coherent framework. The thesis presents a new approach for Word Sense Disambiguation using
thesaurus. The illustrative examples supports the effectiveness of this approach for speedy and
effective disambiguation. A Document Retrieval method, based on Fuzzy Logic has been described
and its application is illustrated. A question-answering system describes the operation of information
extraction from the retrieved text documents. The process of information extraction for answering
a query is considerably simplified by using a Structured Description Language (SDL) which is based
on cardinals of queries in the form of who, what, when, where and why. The thesis concludes with the
presentation of a novel strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory of evidential reasoning, for
document retrieval and information extraction. This strategy permits relaxation of many limitations,
which are inherent in Bayesian probabilistic approach.
