Pre-season prediction of crop production outcomes such as grain yields and N losses can provide
insights to stakeholders when making decisions. Simulation models can assist in scenario planning,
but their use is limited because of data requirements and long run times. Thus, there is a need for
more computationally expedient approaches to scale up predictions. We evaluated the potential
of five machine learning (ML) algorithms as meta-models for a cropping systems simulator (APSIM)
to inform future decision-support tool development. We asked: 1) How well do ML meta-models predict
maize yield and N losses using pre-season information? 2) How many data are needed to train ML algorithms
to achieve acceptable predictions?; 3) Which input data variables are most important for accurate
prediction?; and 4) Do ensembles of ML meta-models improve prediction? The simulated dataset included
more than 3 million genotype, environment and management scenarios. Random forests most accurately
predicted maize yield and N loss at planting time, with a RRMSE of 14% and 55%, respectively. ML meta-models
reasonably reproduced simulated maize yields but not N loss. They also differed in their sensitivities
to the size of the training dataset. Across all ML models, yield prediction error decreased by 10-40%
as the training dataset increased from 0.5 to 1.8 million data points, whereas N loss prediction
error showed no consistent pattern. ML models also differed in their sensitivities to input variables.
Averaged across all ML models, weather conditions, soil properties, management information and
initial conditions were roughly equally important when predicting yields. Modest prediction
improvements resulted from ML ensembles. These results can help accelerate progress in coupling
simulation models and ML toward developing dynamic decision support tools for pre-season management.
