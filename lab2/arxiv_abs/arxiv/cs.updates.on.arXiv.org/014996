In this paper, we focus on semi-supervised object detection to boost performance of proposal-based
object detectors (a.k.a. two-stage object detectors) by training on both labeled and unlabeled
data. However, it is non-trivial to train object detectors on unlabeled data due to the unavailability
of ground truth labels. To address this problem, we present a proposal learning approach to learn
proposal features and predictions from both labeled and unlabeled data. The approach consists
of a self-supervised proposal learning module and a consistency-based proposal learning module.
In the self-supervised proposal learning module, we present a proposal location loss and a contrastive
loss to learn context-aware and noise-robust proposal features respectively. In the consistency-based
proposal learning module, we apply consistency losses to both bounding box classification and
regression predictions of proposals to learn noise-robust proposal features and predictions.
Our approach enjoys the following benefits: 1) encouraging more context information to delivered
in the proposals learning procedure; 2) noisy proposal features and enforcing consistency to allow
noise-robust object detection; 3) building a general and high-performance semi-supervised object
detection framework, which can be easily adapted to proposal-based object detectors with different
backbone architectures. Experiments are conducted on the COCO dataset with all available labeled
and unlabeled data. Results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the performance
of fully-supervised baselines. In particular, after combining with data distillation, our approach
improves AP by about 2.0% and 0.9% on average compared to fully-supervised baselines and data distillation
baselines respectively.
