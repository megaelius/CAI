Machine learning techniques typically rely on large datasets to create accurate classifiers.
However, there are situations when data is scarce and expensive to acquire. This is the case of studies
that rely on state-of-the-art computational models which typically take days to run, thus hindering
the potential of machine learning tools. In this work, we present a novel classifier that takes advantage
of lower fidelity models and inexpensive approximations to predict the binary output of expensive
computer simulations. We postulate an autoregressive model between the different levels of fidelity
with Gaussian process priors. We adopt a fully Bayesian treatment for the hyper-parameters and
use Markov Chain Mont Carlo samplers. We take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the classifier
to implement active learning strategies. We also introduce a sparse approximation to enhance the
ability of themulti-fidelity classifier to handle large datasets. We test these multi-fidelity
classifiers against their single-fidelity counterpart with synthetic data, showing a median
computational cost reduction of 23% for a target accuracy of 90%. In an application to cardiac electrophysiology,
the multi-fidelity classifier achieves an F1 score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall,
of 99.6% compared to 74.1% of a single-fidelity classifier when both are trained with 50 samples.
In general, our results show that the multi-fidelity classifiers outperform their single-fidelity
counterpart in terms of accuracy in all cases. We envision that this new tool will enable researchers
to study classification problems that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive. Source code
