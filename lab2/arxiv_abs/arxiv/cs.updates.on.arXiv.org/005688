Bioresorbable scaffolds have become a popular choice for treatment of coronary heart disease,
replacing traditional metal stents. Often, intravascular optical coherence tomography is used
to assess potential malapposition after implantation and for follow-up examinations later on.
Typically, the scaffold is manually reviewed by an expert, analyzing each of the hundreds of image
slices. As this is time consuming, automatic stent detection and visualization approaches have
been proposed, mostly for metal stent detection based on classic image processing. As bioresorbable
scaffolds are harder to detect, recent approaches have used feature extraction and machine learning
methods for automatic detection. However, these methods require detailed, pixel-level labels
in each image slice and extensive feature engineering for the particular stent type which might
limit the approaches' generalization capabilities. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based
method for bioresorbable scaffold visualization using only image-level labels. A convolutional
neural network is trained to predict whether an image slice contains a metal stent, a bioresorbable
scaffold, or no device. Then, we derive local stent strut information by employing weakly supervised
localization using saliency maps with guided backpropagation. As saliency maps are generally
diffuse and noisy, we propose a novel patch-based method with image shifting which allows for high
resolution stent visualization. Our convolutional neural network model achieves a classification
accuracy of 99.0 % for image-level stent classification which can be used for both high quality in-slice
stent visualization and 3D rendering of the stent structure.
