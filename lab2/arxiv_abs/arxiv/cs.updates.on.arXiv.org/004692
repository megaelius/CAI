We develop a new framework for generalizing approximation algorithms from the structural graph
algorithm literature so that they apply to graphs somewhat close to that class (a scenario we expect
is common when working with real-world networks) while still guaranteeing approximation ratios.
The idea is to $\textit{edit}$ a given graph via vertex- or edge-deletions to put the graph into an
algorithmically tractable class, apply known approximation algorithms for that class, and then
$\textit{lift}$ the solution to apply to the original graph. We give a general characterization
of when an optimization problem is amenable to this approach, and show that it includes many well-studied
graph problems, such as Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Minimum Maximal Matching,
Chromatic Number, ($\ell$-)Dominating Set, and Edge ($\ell$-)Dominating Set. To enable this
framework, we develop new editing algorithms that find the approximately fewest edits required
to bring a given graph into one of several important graph classes (in some cases, also approximating
the target parameter of the family). For bounded degeneracy, we obtain a bicriteria $(4,4)$-approximation
which also extends to a smoother bicriteria trade-off. For bounded treewidth, we obtain a bicriteria
$(O(\log^{1.5} n), O(\sqrt{\log w}))$-approximation, and for bounded pathwidth, we obtain a
bicriteria $(O(\log^{1.5} n), O(\sqrt{\log w} \cdot \log n))$-approximation. For treedepth
$2$ (also related to bounded expansion), we obtain a $4$-approximation. We also prove complementary
hardness-of-approximation results assuming $\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}$: in particular,
all of the problems just stated have a log-factor inapproximability, except the last which is not
approximable below some constant factor ($2$ assuming UGC).
