This Work in Progress Research paper departs from the recent, turbulent changes in global societies,
forcing many citizens to re-skill themselves to (re)gain employment. Learners therefore need
to be equipped with skills to be autonomous and strategic about their own skill development. Subsequently,
high-quality, on-line, personalized educational content and services are also essential to serve
this high demand for learning content. Open Educational Resources (OERs) have high potential to
contribute to the mitigation of these problems, as they are available in a wide range of learning
and occupational contexts globally. However, their applicability has been limited, due to low
metadata quality and complex quality control. These issues resulted in a lack of personalised OER
functions, like recommendation and search. Therefore, we suggest a novel, personalised OER recommendation
method to match skill development targets with open learning content. This is done by: 1) using an
OER quality prediction model based on metadata, OER properties, and content; 2) supporting learners
to set individual skill targets based on actual labour market information, and 3) building a personalized
OER recommender to help learners to master their skill targets. Accordingly, we built a prototype
focusing on Data Science related jobs, and evaluated this prototype with 23 data scientists in different
expertise levels. Pilot participants used our prototype for at least 30 minutes and commented on
each of the recommended OERs. As a result, more than 400 recommendations were generated and 80.9%
of the recommendations were reported as useful.
