The overarching problem in artificial intelligence (AI) is that we do not understand the intelligence
process well enough to enable the development of adequate computational models. Much work has been
done in AI over the years at lower levels, but a big part of what has been missing involves the high level,
abstract, general nature of intelligence. We address this gap by developing a model for general
intelligence. To accomplish this, we focus on three basic aspects of intelligence. First, we must
realize the general order and nature of intelligence at a high level. Second, we must come to know
what these realizations mean with respect to the overall intelligence process. Third, we must describe
these realizations as clearly as possible. We propose a hierarchical model to help capture and exploit
the order within intelligence. The underlying order involves patterns of signals that become organized,
stored and activated in space and time. These patterns can be described using a simple, general hierarchy,
with physical signals at the lowest level, information in the middle, and abstract signal representations
at the top. This high level perspective provides a big picture that literally helps us see the intelligence
process, thereby enabling fundamental realizations, a better understanding and clear descriptions
of the intelligence process. The resulting model can be used to support all kinds of information
processing across multiple levels of abstraction. As computer technology improves, and as cooperation
increases between humans and computers, people will become more efficient and more productive
in performing their information processing tasks.
