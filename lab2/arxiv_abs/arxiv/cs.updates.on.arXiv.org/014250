This paper considers the optimal multi-agent persistent monitoring problem defined on a set of
nodes (targets) interconnected according to a fixed graph topology (PMG). The objective is to minimize
a measure of mean overall node state uncertainty evaluated over a finite time interval via controlling
the motion of the team of agents. A class of threshold-based parametric controllers has been proposed
in a prior work as a distributed on-line solution to this PMG problem. However, this approach involves
a lengthy and computationally intensive parameter tuning process, which can still result in low
performing solutions. Recent works have focused on appending a centralized off-line stage to the
aforementioned parameter tuning process so as to improve its performance. However, this comes
at the cost of sacrificing the on-line distributed nature of the original solution while also increasing
the associated computational cost. Moreover, such parametric control approaches are slow to react
to compensate for possible state perturbations. Motivated by these challenges, this paper proposes
a computationally cheap novel event-driven receding horizon control (ED-RHC) approach as a distributed
on-line solution to the PMG problem. In particular, the discrete-event nature of the PMG systems
is exploited in this work to determine locally (i.e., both temporally and spatially) optimum trajectory
decisions for each agent to make at different discrete event times on its trajectory. Numerical
results obtained from this ED-RHC method show significant improvements compared to state of the
art distributed on-line parametric control solutions.
