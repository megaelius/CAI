Mobile manipulation planning commonly adopts a decoupled approach that performs planning separately
for the base and manipulator, to make each planning space low dimensional. While this approach is
fast, it can generate suboptimal paths or cannot find solutions. Another approach, i.e., a coupled
approach, is to jointly adjust the base and manipulator in a high dimensional space. This coupled
approach addresses sub-optimality and ncompleteness of the decoupled approach, but has not been
widely used due to its excessive computational overhead. Given this trade-off space, we present
a novel manipulation sampling method, harmonious sampling, to perform the coupled approach only
in difficult regions, defined as manipulation regions, where we need to simultaneously maneuver
the base and manipulator. For the rest regions, defined by base regions, we perform sampling mainly
on the base, accelerating the planning process. Our method identifies such manipulation regions
based on the reachability map generated from the target end-effector pose and narrow passage identified
by generalized Voronoi diagram. We compare our method with the decoupled and coupled approaches
in six different problems with different characteristics in the C-space. Our method shows meaningful
improvements experimentally in terms of time to find an initial solution (up to 5 times faster) and
final solution cost (up to 30% lower) over these techniques, especially in difficult scenes with
narrow passage. This result is mainly attributed by our harmonious sampling, adaptively adjusting
our sampling process between the coupled and decoupled spaces.
