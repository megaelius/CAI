Deep learning models have achieved huge success in numerous fields, such as computer vision and
natural language processing. However, unlike such fields, it is hard to apply traditional deep
learning models on the graph data due to the `node-orderless' property. Normally, we use an adjacent
matrix to represent a graph, but an artificial and random node-order will be cast on the graphs, which
renders the performance of deep models extremely erratic and not robust. In order to eliminate the
unnecessary node-order constraint, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Isomorphic Neural
Network (IsoNN), which learns the graph representation by extracting its isomorphic features
via the graph matching between input graph and templates. IsoNN has two main components: graph isomorphic
feature extraction component and classification component. The graph isomorphic feature extraction
component utilizes a set of subgraph templates as the kernel variables to learn the possible subgraph
patterns existing in the input graph and then computes the isomorphic features. A set of permutation
matrices is used in the component to break the node-order brought by the matrix representation.
To further lower down the computational cost and identify the optimal subgraph patterns, IsoNN
adopts two min-pooling layers to find the optimal matching. The first min-pooling layer aims at
finding the best permutation matrix, whereas the second one is used to determine the best templates
for the input graph data. Three fully-connected layers are used as the classification component
in IsoNN. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, and the experimental results
demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of IsoNN.
