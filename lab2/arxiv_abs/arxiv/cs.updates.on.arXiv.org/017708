The problem of finding a diagonal flip path between two triangulations has been studied for nearly
a century in the combinatorial (topological) setting and for decades in the geometric setting.
In the geometric setting, finding a diagonal flip path between two triangulations that minimizes
the number of diagonal flips over all such paths is NP-complete. However, when restricted to lattice
triangulations - i.e. triangulations of a finite subset of the integer lattice, or an affine transformation
of this lattice, bounded by a simple, closed polygon with lattice points as vertices - the problem
has a polynomial time algorithm. Lattice triangulations have been studied for their uses in discriminant
theory, Hilbert's 16th problem, toric varieties, quantum spin systems, and material science.
Our first main result shows that there is a polynomial-time computable, unique partially-ordered
set of diagonal flips such that there is a bijection between valid linear-orderings of this set and
minimum diagonal flip paths between two lattice triangulations. This provides an alternative
proof of the previously known result, as well as new structural insights into these diagonal flip
paths. Our second main result characterizes pairs of triangulations, containing sets of edges
$E$ and $E'$ respectively, such that the minimum diagonal flip path between them contains the minimum
number of diagonal flips over all minimum diagonal flip paths between pairs of triangulations,
containing sets of edges $E$ and $E'$ respectively. Remarkably, all of our results are derived from
a simple relationship between edges in triangulations and Farey sequences.
