We study the problem of entrywise $\ell_1$ low rank approximation. We give the first polynomial
time column subset selection-based $\ell_1$ low rank approximation algorithm sampling $\tilde{O}(k)$
columns and achieving an $\tilde{O}(k^{1/2})$-approximation for any $k$, improving upon the
previous best $\tilde{O}(k)$-approximation and matching a prior lower bound for column subset
selection-based $\ell_1$-low rank approximation which holds for any $\text{poly}(k)$ number
of columns. We extend our results to obtain tight upper and lower bounds for column subset selection-based
$\ell_p$ low rank approximation for any $1 < p < 2$, closing a long line of work on this problem. We next
give a $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for entrywise $\ell_p$ low rank approximation,
for $1 \leq p < 2$, that is not a column subset selection algorithm. First, we obtain an algorithm which,
given a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, returns a rank-$k$ matrix $\hat{A}$ in $2^{\text{poly}(k/\varepsilon)}
+ \text{poly}(nd)$ running time such that: $$\|A - \hat{A}\|_p \leq (1 + \varepsilon) \cdot OPT
+ \frac{\varepsilon}{\text{poly}(k)}\|A\|_p$$ where $OPT = \min_{A_k \text{ rank }k} \|A - A_k\|_p$.
Using this algorithm, in the same running time we give an algorithm which obtains error at most $(1
+ \varepsilon) \cdot OPT$ and outputs a matrix of rank at most $3k$ --- these algorithms significantly
improve upon all previous $(1 + \varepsilon)$- and $O(1)$-approximation algorithms for the $\ell_p$
low rank approximation problem, which required at least $n^{\text{poly}(k/\varepsilon)}$ or
$n^{\text{poly}(k)}$ running time, and either required strong bit complexity assumptions (our
algorithms do not) or had bicriteria rank $3k$. Finally, we show hardness results which nearly match
our $2^{\text{poly}(k)} + \text{poly}(nd)$ running time and the above additive error guarantee.
