The integration of large-scale renewable generation has major implications on the operation of
power systems, two of which we address in this work. First, system operators have to deal with higher
degrees of uncertainty due to forecast errors and variability in renewable energy production.
Second, with abundant potential of renewable generation in remote locations, there is an increasing
interest in the use of High Voltage Direct Current lines (HVDC) to increase transmission capacity.
These HVDC transmission lines and the flexibility and controllability they offer must be incorporated
effectively and safely into the system. In this work, we introduce an optimization tool that addresses
both challenges by incorporating the full AC power flow equations, chance constraints to address
the uncertainty of renewable infeed, modelling of point-to-point HVDC lines, and optimized corrective
control policies to model the generator and HVDC response to uncertainty. The main contributions
are twofold. First, we introduce a HVDC line model and the corresponding HVDC participation factors
in a chance-constrained AC-OPF framework. Second, we modify an existing algorithm for solving
the chance-constrained AC-OPF to allow for optimization of the generation and HVDC participation
factors. Using realistic wind forecast data, for 10 and IEEE 39 bus systems with HVDC lines and wind
farms, we show that our proposed OPF formulation achieves good in- and out-of-sample performance
whereas not considering uncertainty leads to high constraint violation probabilities. In addition,
we find that optimizing the participation factors reduces the cost of uncertainty significantly.
