Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is envisioned to be one of the most beneficial technologies
for next generation wireless networks due to its enhanced performance compared to other conventional
radio access techniques. Although the principle of NOMA allows multiple users to use the same frequency
resource, due to decoding complication, information of users in practical systems cannot be decoded
successfully if many of them use the same channel. Consequently, assigned spectrum of a system needs
to be split into multiple subchannels in order to multiplex that among many users. Uplink resource
allocation for such systems is more complicated compared to the downlink ones due to the individual
users' power constraints and discrete nature of subchannel assignment. In this paper, we propose
an uplink subchannel and power allocation scheme for such systems. Due to the NP-hard and non-convex
nature of the problem, the complete solution, that optimizes both subchannel assignment and power
allocation jointly, is intractable. Consequently, we solve the problem in two steps. First, based
on the assumption that the maximal power level of a user is subdivided equally among its allocated
subchannels, we apply many-to-many matching model to solve the subchannel-user mapping problem.
Then, in order to enhance the performance of the system further, we apply iterative water-filling
and geometric programming two power allocation techniques to allocate power in each allocated
subchannel-user slot optimally. Extensive simulation has been conducted to verify the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme always outperforms all
existing works in this context under all possible scenarios.
