This work describes probabilistic methods for utilizing random spanning trees generated via a
random walk process. Goyal et al. showed that the union of random spanning trees approximates the
expansion of every cut of a graph. First, we generalize the method by Goyal et al. for weighted graphs
and show that it is possible to approximate the expansion of every cut in a weighted graph with the
union of random spanning trees generated by a random walk on a weighted graph. Second, we show that
our union of random spanning trees is a spectral sparsifier of the graph. Moreover, we show that $O(\log
n /\epsilon^2)$ random spanning trees are required in order to spectrally approximate a bounded
degree graph. This result closes a previously open question on the number of random spanning trees
required for saprsification. Third, we show that our random spanning trees based construction
provides security features for virtual networks, in the context of Software-Defined Networking.
Network virtualization coupled with Software-Defined Networking allows new on-demand management
capabilities. We demonstrate such a service, namely, on-demand efficient monitoring or anonymity.
The proposed service is based on network virtualization of expanders or sparsifiers over the physical
network. The defined virtual (or overlay) communication graphs coupled with a multi-hop extension
of Valiant randomization based routing lets us monitor the entire traffic in the network, with a
very few monitoring nodes. We propose methods that theoretically improve services provided by
existing monitoring or anonymity networks, and optimize the degree of monitoring or anonymity.
