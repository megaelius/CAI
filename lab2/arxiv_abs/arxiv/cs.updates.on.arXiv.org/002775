Objective: Participation in a physical therapy program is considered one of the greatest predictors
of successful conservative management of common shoulder disorders. However, adherence to these
protocols is often poor and typically worse for unsupervised home exercise programs. Currently,
there are limited tools available for objective measurement of adherence in the home setting. The
goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the potential for performing home shoulder physiotherapy
monitoring using a commercial smartwatch. Approach: Ten healthy adult subjects with no prior shoulder
disorders performed seven exercises from an evidence-based rotator cuff physiotherapy protocol,
while 6-axis inertial sensor data was collected from the active extremity. Within an activitation
recognition chain (ARC) framework, four supervised learning algorithms were trained and optimized
to classify the exercises: k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest (RF), support vector machine
classifier (SVC), and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Algorithm performance
was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation stratified first temporally and then by subject.
Main Results: Categorical classification accuracy was above 98% for all algorithms on the temporally
stratified cross validation, with the best performance achieved by the CRNN algorithm (99.6%).
The subject stratified cross validation, which evaluated classifier performance on unseen subjects,
yielded lower accuracies scores with RF performing best (87.3%). Significance: This proof of concept
study demonstrates the technical feasibility of a smartwatch device and supervised machine learning
approach to more easily monitor and assess the at-home adherence of shoulder physiotherapy exercise
protocols.
