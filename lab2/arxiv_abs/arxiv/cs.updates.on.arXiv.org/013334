This paper is concerned with a compositional approach for constructing both infinite (reduced-order
models) and finite abstractions (a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)) of large-scale
interconnected discrete-time stochastic systems. The proposed framework is based on the notion
of stochastic simulation functions enabling us to employ an abstract system as a substitution of
the original one in the controller design process with guaranteed error bounds. In the first part
of the paper, we derive sufficient small-gain type conditions for the compositional quantification
of the probabilistic distance between the interconnection of stochastic control subsystems and
that of their infinite abstractions. We then construct infinite abstractions together with their
corresponding stochastic simulation functions for a particular class of discrete-time nonlinear
stochastic control systems. In the second part of the paper, we leverage small-gain type conditions
for the compositional construction of finite abstractions. We propose an approach to construct
finite MDPs as finite abstractions of concrete models or their reduced-order versions satisfying
an incremental input-to-state stability property. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
results by applying our approaches to a fully interconnected network of 20 nonlinear subsystems
(totally 100 dimensions). We construct finite MDPs from their reduced-order versions (together
20 dimensions) with guaranteed error bounds on their output trajectories. We also apply the proposed
results to a temperature regulation in a circular building and construct compositionally a finite
abstraction of a network containing 1000 rooms. We employ the constructed finite abstractions
as substitutes to compositionally synthesize policies regulating the temperature in each room
for a bounded time horizon.
