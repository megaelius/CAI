One of the defining characteristic of human being is their ability to walk upright. Loss or restriction
of such ability whether due to the accident, spine problem, stroke or other neurological injuries
can cause tremendous stress on the patients and hence will contribute negatively to their quality
of life. Modern research shows that physical exercise is very important for maintaining physical
fitness and adopting a healthier life style. In modern days treadmill is widely used for physical
exercises and training which enables the user to set up an exercise regime that can be adhered to irrespective
of the weather conditions. Among the users of treadmills today are medical facilities such as hospitals,
rehabilitation centres, medical and physiotherapy clinics etc. The process of assisted training
or doing rehabilitation exercise through treadmill is referred to as treadmill therapy. A modern
treadmill is an automated machine having built in functions and predefined features. Most of the
treadmills used today are one dimensional and user can only walk in one direction. This paper presents
the idea of using omnidirectional treadmills which will be more appealing to the patients as they
can walk in any direction, hence encouraging them to do exercises more frequently. This paper proposes
a fuzzy control design and possible implementation strategy to assist patients in treadmill therapy.
By intelligently controlling the safety belt attached to the treadmill user, one can help them steering
left, right or in any direction. The use of intelligent treadmill therapy can help patients to improve
their walking ability without being continuously supervised by the specialists. The patients
can walk freely within a limited space and the support system will provide continuous evaluation
of their position and can adjust the control parameters of treadmill accordingly to provide best
possible assistance.
