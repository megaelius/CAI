We propose an interpretable graph neural network framework to denoise single or multiple noisy
graph signals. The proposed graph unrolling networks expand algorithm unrolling to the graph domain
and provide an interpretation of the architecture design from a signal processing perspective.
We unroll an iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network layer
where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising graph signals. We train
the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised learning, where the input noisy graph signals
are used to supervise the networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively
capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually choosing signal
priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the edge-weight-sharing graph convolution
operation, which parameterizes each edge weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable
parameters are shared by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and
can flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two special cases
of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC) and graph unrolling trend filtering
(GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed
methods, we conduct extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets,
and demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional denoising algorithms
and state-of-the-art graph neural networks. For denoising a single smooth graph signal, the normalized
mean square error of the proposed networks is around 40% and 60% lower than that of graph Laplacian
denoising and graph wavelets, respectively.
