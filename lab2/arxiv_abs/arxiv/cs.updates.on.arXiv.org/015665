COVID-19 pandemics has challenged emergency response systems worldwide, with widespread reports
of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care structure. A critical element involves
essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic
individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several
countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. This work describes
a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and
how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning
is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential
workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results
in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed
prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed
models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity
and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according
to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution
is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random
choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Machine
learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order
to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic
decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical
resources, and testing insufficiency.
