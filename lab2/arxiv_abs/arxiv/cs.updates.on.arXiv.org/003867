Game creation challenges in schools potentially provide engaging, goal-oriented, and interactive
experiences in classes; thereby supporting the transfer of knowledge for learning in a fun and pedagogic
manner. A key element of the ongoing European project No One Left Behind (NOLB) is to integrate a game-making
teaching framework (GMTF) into the educational app Pocket Code. Pocket Code allows learners to
create programs in a visual Lego-style way to facilitate learning how to code at secondary high schools.
The concept of the NOLB GMTF is based on principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) model.
This framework provides a coherent approach to learning and teaching by integrating leisure oriented
gaming methods into multi-discipline curricula. One output of this framework is the integration
of game-based methods via game templates that refer to didactical scenarios that include a refined
set of genres, assets, rules, challenges, and strategies. These templates allows: 1) teachers
to start with a well-structured program, and 2) pupils to add content and adjust the code to integrate
their own ideas. During the project game genres such as adventure, action, and quiz, as well as rewards
or victory point mechanisms, have been embedded into different subjects, e.g., science, mathematics,
and arts. The insights gained during the class hours were used to generate 13 game templates, which
are integrated in Create@School (a new version of the Pocket Code app which targets schools). To
test the efficiency of these templates, user experience (UX) tests were conducted during classes
to compare games created by pupils who used templates and those who started to create a game from scratch.
Preliminary results showed that these templates allow learners to focus on subject-relevant problem
solving activities rather than on understanding the functionality of the app.
