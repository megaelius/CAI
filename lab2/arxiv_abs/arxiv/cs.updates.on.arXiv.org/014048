This article presents a Unified Architecture for automated point tagging of Building Automation
System data, based on a combination of data-driven approaches. Advanced energy analytics applications-including
fault detection and diagnostics and supervisory control-have emerged as a significant opportunity
for improving the performance of our built environment. Effective application of these analytics
depends on harnessing structured data from the various building control and monitoring systems,
but typical Building Automation System implementations do not employ any standardized metadata
schema. While standards such as Project Haystack and Brick Schema have been developed to address
this issue, the process of structuring the data, i.e., tagging the points to apply a standard metadata
schema, has, to date, been a manual process. This process is typically costly, labor-intensive,
and error-prone. In this work we address this gap by proposing a UA that automates the process of point
tagging by leveraging the data accessible through connection to the BAS, including time series
data and the raw point names. The UA intertwines supervised classification and unsupervised clustering
techniques from machine learning and leverages both their deterministic and probabilistic outputs
to inform the point tagging process. Furthermore, we extend the UA to embed additional input and
output data-processing modules that are designed to address the challenges associated with the
real-time deployment of this automation solution. We test the UA on two datasets for real-life buildings:
1. commercial retail buildings and 2. office buildings from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
campus. The proposed methodology correctly applied 85-90 percent and 70-75 percent of the tags
in each of these test scenarios, respectively.
