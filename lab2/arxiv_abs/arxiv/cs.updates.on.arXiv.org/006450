In this paper, we develop a class of decentralized algorithms for solving a convex resource allocation
problem in a network of $n$ agents, where the agent objectives are decoupled while the resource constraints
are coupled. The agents communicate over a connected undirected graph, and they want to collaboratively
determine a solution to the overall network problem, while each agent only communicates with its
neighbors. We first study the connection between the decentralized resource allocation problem
and the decentralized consensus optimization problem. Then, using a class of algorithms for solving
consensus optimization problems, we propose a novel class of decentralized schemes for solving
resource allocation problems in a distributed manner. Specifically, we first propose an algorithm
for solving the resource allocation problem with an $o(1/k)$ convergence rate guarantee when the
agents' objective functions are generally convex (could be nondifferentiable) and per agent local
convex constraints are allowed; We then propose a gradient-based algorithm for solving the resource
allocation problem when per agent local constraints are absent and show that such scheme can achieve
geometric rate when the objective functions are strongly convex and have Lipschitz continuous
gradients. We have also provided scalability/network dependency analysis. Based on these two
algorithms, we have further proposed a gradient projection-based algorithm which can handle smooth
objective and simple constraints more efficiently. Numerical experiments demonstrates the viability
and performance of all the proposed algorithms.
