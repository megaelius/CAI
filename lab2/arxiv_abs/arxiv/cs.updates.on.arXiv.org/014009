Estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA) as one of the EAs is a stochastic optimization problem
which establishes a probability model to describe the distribution of solutions and randomly samples
the probability model to create offspring and optimize model and population. Reference Vector
Guided Evolutionary (RVEA) based on the EDA framework, having a better performance to solve MaOPs.
Besides, using the generative adversarial networks to generate offspring solutions is also a state-of-art
thought in EAs instead of crossover and mutation. In this paper, we will propose a novel algorithm
based on RVEA[1] framework and using Distributional Adversarial Networks (DAN) [2]to generate
new offspring. DAN uses a new distributional framework for adversarial training of neural networks
and operates on genuine samples rather than a single point because the framework also leads to more
stable training and extraordinarily better mode coverage compared to single-point-sample methods.
Thereby, DAN can quickly generate offspring with high convergence regarding the same distribution
of data. In addition, we also use Large-Scale Multi-Objective Optimization Based on A Competitive
Swarm Optimizer (LMOCSO)[3] to adopts a new two-stage strategy to update the position in order to
significantly increase the search efficiency to find optimal solutions in huge decision space.
The propose new algorithm will be tested on 9 benchmark problems in Large scale multi-objective
problems (LSMOP). To measure the performance, we will compare our proposal algorithm with some
state-of-art EAs e.g., RM-MEDA[4], MO-CMA[10] and NSGA-II.
