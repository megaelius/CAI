Covert communication can prevent the adversary from knowing that a wireless transmission has occurred.
In the additive white Gaussian noise channels, a square root law is obtained and the result shows
that Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$ bits to Bob in $n$ channel
uses. If additional "friendly" node near the adversary can inject artificial noise to aid Alice
in hiding her transmission attempt, covert throughput can be improved, i.e., Alice can covertly
transmit $\mathcal{O}(\min\{n,\lambda^{\alpha/2}\sqrt{n}\})$ bits to Bob over $n$ uses of
the channel ($\lambda$ is the density of friendly nodes and $\alpha$ is the path loss exponent of
wireless channels). In this paper, we consider the covert communication in a noisy wireless network,
where Bob and the adversary Willie not only experience the background noise, but also the aggregated
interference from other transmitters. Our results show that uncertainty in interference experienced
by Willie is beneficial to Alice. When the distance between Alice and Willie $d_{a,w}=\omega(n^{\delta/4})$
($\delta=2/\alpha$ is stability exponent), Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\sqrt{n})$
bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses. Although the covert throughput is lower than the square root law and
the friendly jamming scheme, the spatial throughput is higher. From the network perspective, the
communications are hidden in "the sound and the fury" of noisy wireless networks, and what Willie
sees is merely a "shadow" wireless network. He knows for certain that some nodes are transmitting,
but he cannot catch anyone red-handed.
