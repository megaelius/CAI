We introduce seven new versions of the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-(like)-Noise (KLJN) classical
physical secure key exchange scheme and a new transient protocol for practically-perfect security.
While these practical improvements offer progressively enhanced security and/or speed for the
non-ideal conditions, the fundamental physical laws providing the security remain the same. In
the "intelligent" KLJN (iKLJN) scheme, Alice and Bob utilize the fact that they exactly know not
only their own resistor value but also the stochastic time function of their own noise, which they
generate before feeding it into the loop. In the "multiple" KLJN (MKLJN) system, Alice and Bob have
publicly known identical sets of different resistors with a proper, publicly known truth table
about the bit-interpretation of their combination. In the "keyed" KLJN (KKLJN) system, by using
secure communication with a formerly shared key, Alice and Bob share a proper time-dependent truth
table for the bit-interpretation of the resistor situation for each secure bit exchange step during
generating the next key. The remaining four KLJN schemes are the combinations of the above protocols
to synergically enhance the security properties. These are: the "intelligent-multiple" (iMKLJN),
the "intelligent-keyed" (iKKLJN), the "keyed-multiple" (KMKLJN) and the "intelligent-keyed-multiple"
(iKMKLJN) KLJN key exchange systems. Finally, we introduce a new transient-protocol offering
practically-perfect security without privacy amplification, which is not needed at practical
applications but it is shown for the sake of ongoing discussions.
