Ride-sharing allows multiple persons to share their trips together in one vehicle instead of using
multiple vehicles. This can reduce the number of vehicles in the street, which consequently can
reduce air pollution, traffic congestion and transportation cost. However, a ride-sharing organization
requires passengers to report sensitive location information about their trips to a trip organizing
server (TOS) which creates a serious privacy issue. In addition, existing ride-sharing schemes
are non-flexible, i.e., they require a driver and a rider to have exactly the same trip to share a ride.
Moreover, they are non-scalable, i.e., inefficient if applied to large geographic areas. In this
paper, we propose two efficient privacy-preserving ride-sharing organization schemes for Non-transferable
Ride-sharing Services (NRS) and Transferable Ride-sharing Services (TRS). In the NRS scheme,
a rider can share a ride from its source to destination with only one driver whereas, in TRS scheme,
a rider can transfer between multiple drivers while en route until he reaches his destination. In
both schemes, the ride-sharing area is divided into a number of small geographic areas, called cells,
and each cell has a unique identifier. Each driver/rider should encrypt his trip's data and send
an encrypted ride-sharing offer/request to the TOS. In NRS scheme, Bloom filters are used to compactly
represent the trip information before encryption. Then, the TOS can measure the similarity between
the encrypted trips data to organize shared rides without revealing either the users' identities
or the location information. In TRS scheme, drivers report their encrypted routes, an then the TOS
builds an encrypted directed graph that is passed to a modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path
algorithm to search for an optimal path of rides that can achieve a set of preferences defined by the
riders.
