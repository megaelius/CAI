This paper presents a recursive system identification method for multi-degree-of-freedom (MDoF)
structures with tuned mass dampers (TMDs) considering abrupt stiffness changes in case of sudden
events, such as earthquakes. Due to supplementary non-classical damping of the TMDs, the system
identification of MDoF+TMD systems disposes a challenge, in particular, in case of sudden events.
This identification methods may be helpful for structural health monitoring of MDoF structures
controlled by TMDs. A new adaptation formulation of the unscented Kalman filter allows the identification
method to track abrupt stiffness changes. The paper, firstly, describes the theoretical background
of the proposed system identification method and afterwards presents three parametric studies
regarding the performance of the method. The first study shows the augmented state identification
by the presented system identification method applied on a MDoF+TMD system. In this study, the abrupt
stiffness changes of the system are successfully detected and localized under earthquake, impulse
and white noise excitations. The second study investigates the effects of the state covariance
and its relevance for the system identification of MDoF+TMD systems. The results of this study show
the necessity of an adaptive definition of the state covariance as applied in the proposed method.
The third study investigates the effects of modeling on the performance of the identification method.
Mathematical models with discretization of different orders of convergence and system noise levels
are studied. The results show that, in particular, MDoF+TMD systems require higher order mathematical
models for an accurate identification of abrupt changes.
