Metrics and frameworks to quantifiably assess security measures have arisen from needs of three
distinct research communities - statistical measures from the intrusion detection and prevention
literature, evaluation of cyber exercises, e.g.,red-team and capture-the-flag competitions,
and economic analyses addressing cost-versus-security tradeoffs. In this paper we provide two
primary contributions to the security evaluation literature - a representative survey, and a novel
framework for evaluating security that is flexible, applicable to all three use cases, and readily
interpretable. In our survey of the literature we identify the distinct themes from each community's
evaluation procedures side by side and flesh out the drawbacks and benefits of each. The evaluation
framework we propose includes comprehensively modeling the resource, labor, and attack costs
in dollars incurred based on expected resource usage, accuracy metrics, and time. This framework
provides a unified approach in that it incorporates the accuracy and performance metrics, which
dominate intrusion detection evaluation, the time to detection and impact to data and resources
of an attack, favored by educational competitions' metrics, and the monetary cost of many essential
security components used in financial analysis. Moreover, it is flexible enough to accommodate
each use case, easily interpretable and comparable, and comprehensive in terms of costs considered.Finally,
we provide two examples of the framework applied to real-world use cases. Overall, we provide a survey
and a grounded, flexible framework with multiple concrete examples for evaluating security which
can address the needs of three currently distinct communities.
