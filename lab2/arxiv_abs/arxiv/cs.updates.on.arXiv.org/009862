This contribution proposes the first 3D beam-to-beam interaction model for molecular interactions
between curved slender fibers undergoing large deformations. While the general model is not restricted
to a specific beam formulation, in the present work it is combined with the geometrically exact beam
theory and discretized via the finite element method. A direct evaluation of the total interaction
potential for general 3D bodies requires the integration of contributions from molecule or charge
distributions over the volumes of the interaction partners, leading to a 6D integral (two nested
3D integrals) that has to be solved numerically. Here, we propose a novel strategy to formulate reduced
section-to-section interaction laws for the resultant interaction potential between a pair of
cross-sections of two slender fibers such that only two 1D integrals along the fibers' length directions
have to be solved numerically. This section-to-section interaction potential (SSIP) approach
yields a significant gain in efficiency, which is essential to enable the simulation of relevant
time and length scales for many practical applications. In a first step, the generic structure of
SSIP laws, which is suitable for the most general interaction scenario (e.g. fibers with arbitrary
cross-section shape and inhomogeneous atomic/charge density within the cross-section) is presented.
Assuming circular, homogeneous cross-sections, in a next step, specific analytical expressions
for SSIP laws describing short-range volume interactions (e.g. van der Waals or steric interactions)
and long-range surface interactions (e.g. Coulomb interactions) are proposed. The validity of
the SSIP laws as well as the accuracy and robustness of the general SSIP approach to beam-to-beam
interactions is thoroughly verified by means of a set of numerical examples considering steric
repulsion, electrostatic or van der Waals adhesion.
