Many signals on Cartesian product graphs appear in the real world, such as digital images, sensor
observation time series, and movie ratings on Netflix. These signals are "multi-dimensional"
and have directional characteristics along each factor graph. However, the existing graph Fourier
transform does not distinguish these directions, and assigns 1-D spectra to signals on product
graphs. Further, these spectra are often multi-valued at some frequencies. Our main result is a
multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform that solves such problems associated with the conventional
GFT. Using algebraic properties of Cartesian products, the proposed transform rearranges 1-D
spectra obtained by the conventional GFT into the multi-dimensional frequency domain, of which
each dimension represents a directional frequency along each factor graph. Thus, the multi-dimensional
graph Fourier transform enables directional frequency analysis, in addition to frequency analysis
with the conventional GFT. Moreover, this rearrangement resolves the multi-valuedness of spectra
in some cases. The multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform is a foundation of novel filterings
and stationarities that utilize dimensional information of graph signals, which are also discussed
in this study. The proposed methods are applicable to a wide variety of data that can be regarded as
signals on Cartesian product graphs. This study also notes that multivariate graph signals can
be regarded as 2-D univariate graph signals. This correspondence provides natural definitions
of the multivariate graph Fourier transform and the multivariate stationarity based on their 2-D
univariate versions.
