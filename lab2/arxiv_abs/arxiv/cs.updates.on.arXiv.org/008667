Considering the wide application of network embedding methods in graph data mining, inspired by
the adversarial attack in deep learning, this paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based Euclidean
Distance Attack strategy (EDA) to attack the network embedding, so as to prevent certain structural
information from being discovered. EDA focuses on disturbing the Euclidean distance between a
pair of nodes in the embedding space as much as possible through minimal modifications of the network
structure. Since a large number of downstream network algorithms, such as community detection
and node classification, rely on the Euclidean distance between nodes to evaluate the similarity
between them in the embedding space, EDA can be considered as a universal attack on a variety of network
algorithms. Different from traditional supervised attack strategies, EDA does not need labeling
information, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first unsupervised network embedding attack
method. We take DeepWalk as the base embedding method to develop the EDA. Experiments with a set of
real networks demonstrate that the proposed EDA method can significantly reduce the performance
of DeepWalk-based networking algorithms, i.e., community detection and node classification,
outperforming several heuristic attack strategies. We also show that EDA also works well on attacking
the network algorithms based on other common network embedding methods such as High-Order Proximity
preserved Embedding (HOPE) and non-embedding-based network algorithms such as Label Propagation
Algorithm (LPA) and Eigenvectors of Matrices (EM). The results indicate a strong transferability
of the EDA method.
