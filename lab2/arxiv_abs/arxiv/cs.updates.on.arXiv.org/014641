Nowadays, 23% of the world population lives in multi-million cities. In these metropolises, criminal
activity is much higher and violent than in either small cities or rural areas. Thus, understanding
what factors influence urban crime in big cities is a pressing need. Mainstream studies analyse
crime records through historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with ecological
factor and exploratory mapping. More recently, machine learning methods have provided informed
crime prediction over time. However, previous studies have focused on a single city at a time, considering
only a limited number of factors (such as socio-economical characteristics) and often at large
spatial units. Hence, our understanding of the factors influencing crime across cultures and cities
is very limited. Here we propose a Bayesian model to explore how crime is related not only to socio-economic
factors but also to the built environmental (e.g. land use) and mobility characteristics of neighbourhoods.
To that end, we integrate multiple open data sources with mobile phone traces and compare how the
different factors correlate with crime in diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogot\'a, Los Angeles
and Chicago. We find that the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information
and physical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence of crime,
and improve the performance of the traditional approaches. However, we show that the socio-ecological
factors of neighbourhoods relate to crime very differently from one city to another. Thus there
is clearly no "one fits all" model.
