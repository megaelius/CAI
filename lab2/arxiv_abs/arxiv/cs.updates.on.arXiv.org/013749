The most widely used internal measure for clustering evaluation is the silhouette coefficient,
whose naive computation requires a quadratic number of distance calculations, which is clearly
unfeasible for massive datasets. Surprisingly, there are no known general methods to efficiently
approximate the silhouette coefficient of a clustering with rigorously provable high accuracy.
In this paper, we present the first scalable algorithm to compute such a rigorous approximation
for the evaluation of clusterings based on any metric distances. Our algorithm hinges on a Probability
Proportional to Size (PPS) sampling scheme, and, for any fixed $\varepsilon, \delta \in (0,1)$,
it approximates the silhouette coefficient within a mere additive error $O(\varepsilon)$ with
probability $1-\delta$, using a very small number of distance calculations. We also prove that
the algorithm can be adapted to obtain rigorous approximations of other internal measures of clustering
quality, such as cohesion and separation. Importantly, we provide a distributed implementation
of the algorithm using the MapReduce model, which runs in constant rounds and requires only sublinear
local space at each worker, which makes our estimation approach applicable to big data scenarios.
We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our silhouette approximation algorithm, comparing
its performance to a number of baseline heuristics on real and synthetic datasets. The experiments
provide evidence that, unlike other heuristics, our estimation strategy not only provides tight
theoretical guarantees but is also able to return highly accurate estimations while running in
a fraction of the time required by the exact computation, and that its distributed implementation
is highly scalable, thus enabling the computation of internal measures for very large datasets
for which the exact computation is prohibitive.
