We consider the problem of online set cover with delay (SCD) suggested by Carrasco, Pruhs, Stein
and Verschae and resolve various of their open problems. A universe of $n$ elements and family of
$m$ sets with costs are known in advance. Requests arrive over time on the elements, and each request
accumulates delay cost until served by the algorithm through buying a containing set. A request
can only be served by sets that are bought after the request's arrival, and thus a set may be bought
an unbounded number of times over the course of the algorithm. Carrasco et al. showed an algorithm
for SCD whose competitive ratio grows with the number of requests (i.e. unbounded ratio for any given
universe). Their algorithm runs in exponential time (no polynomial time logarithmic approximation
algorithm is known even for the offline case). In addition, they show a lower bound of $\Omega (\log
\log n)$ on the competitive ratio for the case of known sets. We resolve various of their open problems.
Let $k \le m$ be the maximum number of sets containing any single element. We show an $O(\log k\cdot\log
n)$-competitive randomized algorithm, improving over an unbounded ratio for a fixed universe.
Our algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves its competitive ratio for an arbitrarily long
sequence (In particular it can be used as an offline algorithm as well). We also show lower bounds
of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log k})$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ on the competitiveness of any algorithm
for SCD, improving exponentially over their lower bound for known sets. Our $O(\log k\cdot\log
n)$-competitive algorithm is based on exponential weights combined with the max operator (in contrast
to summation). The lower bounds are described by a recursive construction. As a side result, we also
consider the special case of Vertex Cover with Delay (VCD) and show a simple $3$-competitive deterministic
algorithm.
