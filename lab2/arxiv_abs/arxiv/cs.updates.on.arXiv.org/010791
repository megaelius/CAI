We consider a class of sequential network interdiction problem settings where the interdictor
has incomplete initial information about the network while the evader has complete knowledge of
the network including its structure and arc costs. In each decision epoch, the interdictor can block
(for the duration of the epoch) at most $k$ arcs known to him/her. By observing the evader's actions,
the interdictor learns about the network structure and costs and thus, can adjust his/her actions
in subsequent decision epochs. It is known from the literature that if the evader is greedy (i.e.,
the shortest available path is used in each decision epoch), then under some assumptions the greedy
interdiction policies that block $k$-most vital arcs in each epoch are efficient and have a finite
regret. In this paper, we consider the evader's perspective and explore deterministic "strategic"
evasion policies under the assumption that the interdictor is greedy. We first study the theoretical
computational complexity of the evader's problem. Then we derive basic constructive properties
of optimal evasion policies for two decision epochs when the interdictor has no initial information
about the network structure. These properties are then exploited for the design of a heuristic algorithm
for a strategic evader in a general setting with an arbitrary time horizon and any initial information
available to the interdictor. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic
outperforms the greedy evasion policy on several classes of synthetic network instances under
either perfect or noisy information feedback. Finally, some interesting insights from our theoretical
and computational results conclude the paper.
