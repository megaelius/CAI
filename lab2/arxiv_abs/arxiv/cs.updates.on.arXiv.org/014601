An increasing number of industries rely on Internet-of-Things devices to track physical resources.
Blockchain technology provides primitives to represent these resources as digital assets on a
secure distributed ledger. Due to the proliferation of blockchain-based assets, there is an increasing
need for a generic mechanism to trade assets between isolated platforms. To date, there is no such
mechanism without reliance on a trusted third party. In this work, we address this shortcoming and
present XChange. Unlike existing approaches for decentralized asset trading, we decouple trade
management and the actual exchange of assets. XChange mediates trade of any digital asset between
isolated blockchain platforms while limiting the fraud conducted by adversarial parties. We first
describe a generic, five-phase trading protocol that establishes and executes trade between individuals.
This protocol accounts full trade specifications on a separate blockchain. We then devise a lightweight
system architecture, composed of all required components for a generic asset marketplace. We implement
XChange and conduct real-world experimentation. We leverage an existing, lightweight blockchain,
TrustChain, to account all orders and full trade specifications. By deploying XChange on multiple
low-resource devices, we show that a full trade completes within half a second. To quantify the scalability
of our mechanism, we conduct further experiments on our compute cluster. We conclude that the throughput
of XChange, in terms of trades per second, scales linearly with the system load. Furthermore, we
find that XChange exhibits superior throughput and order fulfil latency compared to related decentralized
exchanges, BitShares and Waves.
