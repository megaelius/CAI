In this paper, we attempt to provide a privacy-preserving and efficient solution for the "similar
patient search" problem among several parties (e.g., hospitals) by addressing the shortcomings
of previous attempts. We consider a scenario in which each hospital has its own genomic dataset and
the goal of a physician (or researcher) is to search for a patient similar to a given one (based on a
genomic makeup) among all the hospitals in the system. To enable this search, we let each hospital
encrypt its dataset with its own key and outsource the storage of its dataset to a public cloud. The
physician can get authorization from multiple hospitals and send a query to the cloud, which efficiently
performs the search across authorized hospitals using a privacy-preserving index structure.
We propose a hierarchical index structure to index each hospital's dataset with low memory requirements.
Furthermore, we develop a novel privacy-preserving index merging mechanism that generates a common
search index from individual indices of each hospital to significantly improve the search efficiency.
We also consider the storage of medical information associated with genomic data of a patient (e.g.,
diagnosis and treatment). We allow access to this information via a fine-grained access control
policy that we develop through the combination of standard symmetric encryption and ciphertext
policy attribute-based encryption. Using this mechanism, a physician can search for similar patients
and obtain medical information about the matching records if the access policy holds. We conduct
experiments on large-scale genomic data and show the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Notably,
we show that under our experimental settings, the proposed scheme is more than $60$ times faster
than Wang et al.'s protocol and $97$ times faster than Asharov et al.'s solution.
