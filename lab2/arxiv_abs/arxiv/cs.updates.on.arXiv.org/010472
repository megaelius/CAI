In this paper, we describe a virtual services marketplace, called Nubo, designed to connect buyers
of virtual services (or tenants) with providers of those services on a cloud computing platform.
The marketplace is implemented as a collection of distributed microservices along with a marketplace
portal that runs as a Web application. The heart of Nubo is the Saranyu tenant and service management
microservice. Saranyu is a decentralized application (dApp) built on top of the J.P. Morgan Quorum
blockchain. Tenant and service accounts are represented as static (nonnegotiable) smart contracts
written in the Solidity language. Quorum provides a tamper evident and tamper resistant distributed
ledger, whereby multiple cloud and service providers can co-operate to provide service resources
to tenants in a trustworthy fashion. Services offer resources consisting of a collection of attributes
describing what the tenant can consume, and tenants subscribe to service resources through the
Nubo Marketplace portal. The Service Manager microservice provides multitenant support for containerized
services built for deployment and orchestration using Docker that were originally not designed
to be managed through Saranyu. We discuss our design goals for Nubo, describe the overall architecture,
discuss some details on how Saranyu uses the blockchain and smart contracts, and provide comprehensive
performance and scalability data measured on the Saranyu REST API. The results indicate Saranyu
is competitive with published results for comparable operations on the Havana release of OpenStack
Keystone, but Saranyu provides a much richer collection of tenant and service management functionality
than Keystone.
