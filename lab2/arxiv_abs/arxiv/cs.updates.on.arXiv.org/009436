In order to implement a STEAM approach including the use of technology, namely the use of interactive
mathematics software GeoGebra, in mathematics classes, in the lusophone space, the materials
presented here were conceived, to be implemented in a first phase among teachers. Later, with the
necessary adaptations, these tasks will be applied to the students. The tasks deal with modeling
situations, in two- and three-dimensional geometric problems, in order to apply GeoGebra software
in its analysis to illustrate its capabilities. The different windows of this software are used,
namely the 2D and 3D windows, CAS window, spreadsheet and extra two dimensional windows in order
to study cutting planes in solids and some surfaces. The tasks are presented so that any user, regardless
of the degree of knowledge they have of the software, can follow them, being supported in scripts
with some indications of the tools and commands to use. Designed for the teaching and learning of
Mathematics, from a STEAM approach, these tasks allow connections with other Sciences and the Arts,
and allow the development of projects using and consolidating relevant mathematical contents.
These tasks are part of the proposals of activities of the participants of the Training Courses for
Trainers in GeoGebra for Portuguese Speaking Countries, which from 2019 have an impact on the STEAM
approach. These courses are carried out with the high sponsorship of the Organization of Ibero-American
States for Education, Science and Culture (OEI). Given the interest that the tasks have for the users
of the Iberian space, as well as their dissemination at a global level, the materials initially developed
in Portuguese language will be adapted for Spanish and English speakers.
