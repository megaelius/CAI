The wearing of the face masks appears as a solution for limiting the spread of COVID-19. In this context,
efficient recognition systems are expected for checking that people faces are masked in regulated
areas. To perform this task, a large dataset of masked faces is necessary for training deep learning
models towards detecting people wearing masks and those not wearing masks. Some large datasets
of masked faces are available in the literature. However, at the moment, there are no available large
dataset of masked face images that permits to check if detected masked faces are correctly worn or
not. Indeed, many people are not correctly wearing their masks due to bad practices, bad behaviors
or vulnerability of individuals (e.g., children, old people). For these reasons, several mask
wearing campaigns intend to sensitize people about this problem and good practices. In this sense,
this work proposes three types of masked face detection dataset; namely, the Correctly Masked Face
Dataset (CMFD), the Incorrectly Masked Face Dataset (IMFD) and their combination for the global
masked face detection (MaskedFace-Net). Realistic masked face datasets are proposed with a twofold
objective: i) to detect people having their faces masked or not masked, ii) to detect faces having
their masks correctly worn or incorrectly worn (e.g.; at airport portals or in crowds). To the best
of our knowledge, no large dataset of masked faces provides such a granularity of classification
towards permitting mask wearing analysis. Moreover, this work globally presents the applied mask-to-face
deformable model for permitting the generation of other masked face images, notably with specific
masks. Our datasets of masked face images (137,016 images) are available at https://github.com/cabani/MaskedFace-Net.
