Caching algorithms are usually described by the eviction method and analyzed using a metric of hit
probability. Since contents have different importance (e.g. popularity), the utility of a high
hit probability, and the cost of transmission can vary across contents. In this paper, we consider
timer-based (TTL) policies across a cache network, where contents have differentiated timers
over which we optimize. Each content is associated with a utility measured in terms of the corresponding
hit probability. We start our analysis from a linear cache network: we propose a utility maximization
problem where the objective is to maximize the sum of utilities and a cost minimization problem where
the objective is to minimize the content transmission cost across the network. These frameworks
enable us to design online algorithms for cache management, for which we prove achieving optimal
performance. Informed by the results of our analysis, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem
for a general cache network. We show that the duality gap is zero, hence we can develop a distributed
iterative primal-dual algorithm for content management in the network. Finally, we consider two
applications of our cache network model: (i) directly mapping to content distribution and (ii)
generalization to wireless sensor network by jointly considering content caching and content
compression. We characterize the tradeoff among caching, compression and communication via a
nonlinear non-convex optimization problem. We show that it can be transformed into an equivalent
convex problem. The obtained numerical results provide us with insights into how to optimize the
performance.
