Sum Product Networks (SPNs) are a recently developed class of deep generative models which compute
their associated unnormalized density functions using a special type of arithmetic circuit. When
certain sufficient structural conditions are imposed on these circuits (called the decomposability
and completeness conditions - or D&C conditions), marginal densities and other useful quantities,
which are normally intractable for deep generative models, can be computed by what amounts to a single
evaluation of the network (a condition called "validity"). However, the limitations that the D&C
conditions place on SPNs are not well understood. In this work we analyze the D&C conditions,
expose the various connections that D&C SPNs have with multilinear arithmetic circuits, and
consider the question of how well they can capture various distributions as a function of their size
and depth. Among our various contributions is a result which establishes the existence of a relatively
simple distribution with fully tractable marginal densities which cannot be efficiently captured
by D&C SPNs of any depth, but which can be efficiently captured by various other deep generative
models. We also show that with each additional layer of depth permitted, the set of distributions
which can be efficiently captured by a D&C SPN grows in size. This kind of "depth hierarchy" property
has been widely conjectured to hold for various deep models, but has never been proven for any of them.
Some of our other contributions include a new characterization of the D&C conditions as sufficient
and necessary ones for a slightly strengthened notion of validity, and various state-machine characterizations
of the types of density computations that can be performed efficiently by D&C SPNs.
