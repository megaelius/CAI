The term visual programming has started to be used in Informatics so far, however, there are different
views on its meaning. The separation of visual programming from development tools of interfaces
provides not only the certainty for this technology, but also opens the systems of modeling and programming
in the education unknown to a wide range. The use of visual programming which is based on the free software
provides the new perspective algorithmic culture formation of future professionals of non-computer
specialists. A wide application of visual programming in the educational process is the perspective
direction of the cognitive activity intensification, laying the foundations of the algorithmic
competence. Visual simulation systems which are related to the creation of the unified means of
any software, when are used in training activities allow not only to create models, determining
the nature, categories and connections, but also to perform the experimental calculation of the
model's conduct for parametric input data, identify behaviour of the system. Therefore the detection
problem of the free software that supports visual programming is relevant and for its solution the
general features of such systems and ways of their use have been analyzed. These results suggest
the significant potential use of visual programming technologies in the educational activities
and that there exist the free software which implements this technology and only enhances its value.
Visual programming is an advanced technology, but also has directions and prospects. Although
it has not got a large scale in programming yet but it has the experience in the educational application.
The results of the visual programming use in the algorithmic culture formation are undeniable,
and thus the further use with improvement techniques will allow to develop the future students'
algorithmic competence.
