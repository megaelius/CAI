With the emergence of the high-resolution fingerprint sensors, the research community has focused
on level-3 fingerprint features especially, pores for providing the next generation automated
fingerprint recognition system (AFRS). Following the recent success of the deep learning approaches
in various computer vision tasks, researchers have explored learning-based approaches for pore
detection in high-resolution fingerprint images. These learning-based approaches provide better
performance than the hand-crafted feature-based approaches. However, domain adaptability of
existing learning-based pore detection methods has not been examined in the past. In this paper,
we present the first study of domain adaptability of existing learning-based pore detection methods.
For this purpose, we have generated an in-house ground truth dataset referred to as IITI-HRF-GT
by using 1000 dpi fingerprint sensor and evaluated the performance of the existing learning-based
pore detection approaches on it. Further, we have also proposed an approach for detecting pores
in a cross sensor scenario referred to as DeepDomainPore using unsupervised domain adaptation
technique. Specifically, DeepDomainPore is a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN)
based pore detection approach DeepResPore and an unsupervised domain adaptation approach included
during the training process. The domain adaptation in the DeepDomainPore is achieved by embedding
a gradient reversal layer between the DeepResPore and a domain classifier network. The results
of all the existing and the proposed learning-based pore detection approaches are evaluated on
IITI-HRF-GT. The DeepDomainPore provides a true detection rate of 88.09%and an F-score of 83.94%
on IITI-HRF-GT. Most importantly, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the cross sensor dataset.
