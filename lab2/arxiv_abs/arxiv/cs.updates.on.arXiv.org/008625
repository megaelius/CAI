The number of women in IT-related disciplines is far below the number of men, especially in developed
countries. Middle-school girls appear to be engaged in coding courses, but when they choose academic
majors relevant to their future careers, only few pursue computer science as a major. In order to
show students a new way of learning and to engage them with coding activities, we used the learning
app Pocket Code. In the "No One Left Behind" H2020 European project, the app was evaluated in several
school subjects. An evaluation of the attractiveness of the app shows that students were motivated
by Pocket Code's ease of use and its appealing design; however, girls rated the app less enthusiastically.
To appeal to female teenagers in particular, a tailored version of the app "Luna&Cat" has been developed.
This customised version stands in contrast to the "one size fits all" solution Pocket Code, which
may discourage certain user groups. For apps to have a higher chance to appeal to a specific target
group, it is, among many other points, necessary to optimise their store listing on app stores, especially
as we found that app stores are the most effective way to reach teenagers. Thus, this paper covers
the following research question. What customizations are necessary in Pocket Code to reinforce
female teenagers in their coding activities? To answer this question, a focus group discussion
was performed. This discussion first brought insights about our target group and suggested names
and designs for the new app; and second, allowed each student to make proposals for their desired
games. Later, these game ideas were analysed, graphically designed, and further developed together
with university design students. By showing female teenagers games designed by other young women
in their age group, we help them to get ideas and inspiration to code their own programs.
