The occurrence of drug-drug-interactions (DDI) from multiple drug dispensations is a serious
problem, both for individuals and health-care systems, since patients with complications due
to DDI are likely to reenter the system at a costlier level. We present a large-scale longitudinal
study (18 months) of the DDI phenomenon at the primary- and secondary-care level using electronic
health records (EHR) from the city of Blumenau in Southern Brazil (pop. $\approx 340,000$). We found
that 181 distinct drug pairs known to interact were dispensed concomitantly to 12\% of the patients
in the city's public health-care system. Further, 4\% of the patients were dispensed drug pairs
that are likely to result in major adverse drug reactions (ADR)---with costs estimated to be much
larger than previously reported in smaller studies. The large-scale analysis reveals that women
have a 60\% increased risk of DDI as compared to men; the increase becomes 90\% when considering only
DDI known to lead to major ADR. Furthermore, DDI risk increases substantially with age; patients
aged 70-79 years have a 34\% risk of DDI when they are dispensed two or more drugs concomitantly. Interestingly,
a statistical null model demonstrates that age- and female-specific risks from increased polypharmacy
fail by far to explain the observed DDI risks in those populations, suggesting unknown social or
biological causes. We also provide a network visualization of drugs and demographic factors that
characterize the DDI phenomenon and demonstrate that accurate DDI prediction can be included in
healthcare and public-health management, to reduce DDI-related ADR and costs.
