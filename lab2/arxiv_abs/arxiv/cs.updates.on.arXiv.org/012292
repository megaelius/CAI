We provide a preliminary comparison of the dispersion properties, specifically the time-amplification
factor, the scaled group velocity and the error in the phase speed of four spatiotemporal discretization
schemes utilized for solving the one-dimensional (1D) linear advection diffusion reaction (ADR)
equation: (a) An explicit (RK2) temporal integration combined with the Optimal Upwind Compact
Scheme (or OUCS3) and the central difference scheme (CD2) for second order spatial discretization,
(b) a fully implicit mid-point rule for time integration coupled with the OUCS3 and the Lele's compact
scheme for first and second order spatial discretization, respectively, (c) An implicit (mid-point
rule)-explicit (RK2) or IMEX time integration blended with OUCS3 and Lele's compact scheme (where
the IMEX time integration follows the same ideology as introduced by Ascher et al.), and (d) the IMEX
(mid-point/RK2) time integration melded with the New Combined Compact Difference scheme (or NCCD
scheme). Analysis reveal the superior resolution features of the IMEX-NCCD scheme including an
enhanced region of neutral stability (a region where the amplification factor is close to one),
a diminished region of spurious propagation characteristics (or a region of negative group velocity)
and a smaller region of nonzero phase speed error. The dispersion error of these numerical schemes
through the role of q-waves is further investigated using the novel error propagation equation
for the 1D linear ADR equation. Again, the in silico experiments divulge excellent Dispersion Relation
Preservation (DRP) properties of the IMEX-NCCD scheme including minimal dissipation via implicit
filtering and negligible unphysical oscillations (or Gibbs' phenomena) on coarser grids.
