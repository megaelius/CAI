Test-driven Development (TDD) is an incremental approach to software development. Despite it
is claimed to improve both quality of software and developers' productivity, the research on the
claimed effects of TDD has so far shown inconclusive results. Some researchers have ascribed these
inconclusive results to the negative affective states that TDD would provoke. A previous (baseline)
experiment has, therefore, studied the affective reactions of (novice) developers---i.e., 29
third-year undergraduates in Computer Science (CS)---when practicing TDD to implement software.
To validate the results of the baseline experiment, we conducted a replicated experiment that studies
the affective reactions of novice developers when applying TDD to develop software. Developers
in the treatment group carried out a development task using TDD, while those in the control group
used a non-TDD approach. To measure the affective reactions of developers, we used the Self-Assessment
Manikin instrument complemented with a liking dimension. The most important differences between
the baseline and replicated experiments are: (i) the kind of novice developers involved in the experiments---third-year
vs. second-year undergraduates in CS from two different universities; and (ii) their number---29
vs. 59. The results of the replicated experiment do not show any difference in the affective reactions
of novice developers. Instead, the results of the baseline experiment suggest that developers
seem to like TDD less as compared to a non-TDD approach and that developers following TDD seem to like
implementing code less than the other developers, while testing code seems to make them less happy.
