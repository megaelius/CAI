For the architecture community, reasonable simulation time is a strong requirement in addition
to performance data accuracy. However, emerging big data and AI workloads are too huge at binary
size level and prohibitively expensive to run on cycle-accurate simulators. The concept of data
motif, which is identified as a class of units of computation performed on initial or intermediate
data, is the first step towards building proxy benchmark to mimic the real-world big data and AI workloads.
However, there is no practical way to construct a proxy benchmark based on the data motifs to help
simulation-based research. In this paper, we embark on a study to bridge the gap between data motif
and a practical proxy benchmark. We propose a data motif-based proxy benchmark generating methodology
by means of machine learning method, which combine data motifs with different weights to mimic the
big data and AI workloads. Furthermore, we implement various data motifs using light-weight stacks
and apply the methodology to five real-world workloads to construct a suite of proxy benchmarks,
considering the data types, patterns, and distributions. The evaluation results show that our
proxy benchmarks shorten the execution time by 100s times on real systems while maintaining the
average system and micro-architecture performance data accuracy above 90%, even changing the
input data sets or cluster configurations. Moreover, the generated proxy benchmarks reflect consistent
performance trends across different architectures. To facilitate the community, we will release
the proxy benchmarks on the project homepage this http URL
