We present a tailored multigrid method for linear problems stemming from a Nitsche-based extended
finite element method (XFEM). Our multigrid method is robust with respect to highly varying coefficients
and the number of interfaces in a domain. It shows level independent convergence rates when applied
to different variants of Nitsche's method. Generally, multigrid methods require a hierarchy of
finite element (FE) spaces which can be created geometrically using a hierarchy of nested meshes.
However, in the XFEM framework, standard multigrid methods might demonstrate poor convergence
properties if the hierarchy of FE spaces employed is not nested. We design a prolongation operator
for the multigrid method in such a way that it can accommodate the discontinuities across the interfaces
in the XFEM framework and recursively induces a nested FE space hierarchy. The prolongation operator
is constructed using so-called pseudo-$L^2$-projections; as common, the adjoint of the prolongation
operator is employed as the restriction operator. The stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method
plays an important role in imposing interface conditions and also affects the condition number
of the linear systems. We discuss the requirements on the stabilization parameter to ensure coercivity
and review selected strategies from the literature which are used to implicitly estimate the stabilization
parameter. Eventually, we compare the impact of different variations of Nitsche's method on discretization
errors and condition number of the linear systems. We demonstrate the robustness of our multigrid
method with respect to varying coefficients and the number of interfaces and compare it with other
preconditioners.
