The biomedical literature contains a wealth of chemical-protein interactions (CPIs). Automatically
extracting CPIs described in biomedical literature is essential for drug discovery, precision
medicine, as well as basic biomedical research. However, the existing methods do not consider the
impact of overlapping relations on CPI extraction. This leads to the extraction of sentences with
overlapping relations becoming the bottleneck of CPI extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel
neural network-based approach to improve the CPI extraction performance of sentences with overlapping
relations. Specifically, the approach first employs BERT to generate high-quality contextual
representations of the title sequence, instance sequence, and knowledge sequence. Then, the Gaussian
probability distribution is introduced to capture the local structure of the instance. Meanwhile,
the attention mechanism is applied to fuse the title information and biomedical knowledge, respectively.
Finally, the related representations are concatenated and fed into the softmax function to extract
CPIs. We evaluate our proposed model on the CHEMPROT corpus. Our proposed model is superior in performance
as compared with other state-of-the-art models. The experimental results show that the Gaussian
probability distribution and external knowledge are complementary to each other. Integrating
them can effectively improve the CPI extraction performance. Furthermore, the Gaussian probability
distribution can significantly improve the extraction performance of sentences with overlapping
relations in biomedical relation extraction tasks. Data and code are available at https://github.com/CongSun-dlut/CPI_extraction.
