Unit disk graphs are the intersection graphs of unit radius disks in the Euclidean plane. Deciding
whether there exists an embedding of a given unit disk graph, i.e. unit disk graph recognition, is
an important geometric problem, and has many application areas. In general, this problem is known
to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete. In some applications, the objects that correspond to unit
disks, have predefined (geometrical) structures to be placed on. Hence, many researchers attacked
this problem by restricting the domain of the disk centers. One example to such applications is wireless
sensor networks, where each disk corresponds to a wireless sensor node, and a pair of intersecting
disks corresponds to a pair of sensors being able to communicate with one another. It is usually assumed
that the nodes have identical sensing ranges, and thus a unit disk graph model is used to model problems
concerning wireless sensor networks. We consider the unit disk graph realization problem on a restricted
domain, by assuming a scenario where the wireless sensor nodes are deployed on the corridors of a
building. Based on this scenario, we impose a geometric constraint such that the unit disks must
be centered onto given straight lines. In this paper, we first describe a polynomial-time reduction
which shows that deciding whether a graph can be realized as unit disks onto given straight lines
is NP-hard, when the given lines are parallel to either $x$-axis or $y$-axis. Using the reduction
we described, we also show that this problem is NP-complete when the given lines are only parallel
to $x$-axis (and one another). We obtain those results using the idea of the logic engine introduced
by Bhatt and Cosmadakis in 1987.
