In the Bounded Degree Matroid Basis Problem, we are given a matroid and a hypergraph on the same ground
set, together with costs for the elements of that set as well as lower and upper bounds $f(\varepsilon)$
and $g(\varepsilon)$ for each hyperedge $\varepsilon$. The objective is to find a minimum-cost
basis $B$ such that $f(\varepsilon) \leq |B \cap \varepsilon| \leq g(\varepsilon)$ for each hyperedge
$\varepsilon$. Kir\'aly et al. (Combinatorica, 2012) provided an algorithm that finds a basis
of cost at most the optimum value which violates the lower and upper bounds by at most $2 \Delta-1$,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the hypergraph. When only lower or only upper bounds are present
for each hyperedge, this additive error is decreased to $\Delta-1$. We consider an extension of
the matroid basis problem to generalized polymatroids, or g-polymatroids, and additionally allow
element multiplicities. The Bounded Degree g-polymatroid Element Problem with Multiplicities
takes as input a g-polymatroid $Q(p,b)$ instead of a matroid, and besides the lower and upper bounds,
each hyperedge $\varepsilon$ has element multiplicities $m_\varepsilon$. Building on the approach
of Kir\'aly et al., we provide an algorithm for finding a solution of cost at most the optimum value,
having the same additive approximation guarantee. As an application, we develop a $1.5$-approximation
for the metric Many-Visits TSP, where the goal is to find a minimum-cost tour that visits each city
$v$ a positive $r(v)$ number of times. Our approach combines our algorithm for the Bounded Degree
g-polymatroid Element Problem with Multiplicities with the principle of Christofides' algorithm
from 1976 for the (single-visit) metric TSP, whose approximation guarantee it matches.
