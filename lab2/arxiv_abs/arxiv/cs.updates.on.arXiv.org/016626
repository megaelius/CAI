During a disaster event, two types of information that are especially useful for coordinating relief
operations are needs and availabilities of resources (e.g., food, water, medicines) in the affected
region. Information posted on microblogging sites is increasingly being used for assisting post-disaster
relief operations. In this context, two practical challenges are (i)~to identify tweets that inform
about resource needs and availabilities (termed as need-tweets and availability-tweets respectively),
and (ii)~to automatically match needs with appropriate availabilities. While several works have
addressed the first problem, there has been little work on automatically matching needs with availabilities.
The few prior works that attempted matching only considered the resources, and no attempt has been
made to understand other aspects of needs/availabilities that are essential for matching in practice.
In this work, we develop a methodology for understanding five important aspects of need-tweets
and availability-tweets, including what resource and what quantity is needed/available, the
geographical location of the need/availability, and who needs / is providing the resource. Understanding
these aspects helps us to address the need-availability matching problem considering not only
the resources, but also other factors such as the geographical proximity between the need and the
availability. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to develop methods for understanding
the semantics of need-tweets and availability-tweets. We also develop a novel methodology for
matching need-tweets with availability-tweets, considering both resource similarity and geographical
proximity. Experiments on two datasets corresponding to two disaster events, demonstrate that
our proposed methods perform substantially better matching than those in prior works.
