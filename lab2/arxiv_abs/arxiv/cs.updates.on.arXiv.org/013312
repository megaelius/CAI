Many recent social media posts and news may create a perception of big success in the use of blockchain
for the real estate industry, land registration and protection of titles and property rights. A
sobering outlook is crucial because misleading concepts may bury the whole idea of blockchain use.
The paper aims to research the possibilities of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies
(DLT) and applicability of these technologies for different purposes in real estate, property
rights and public registries. Blockchain, which is distinguished from permissioned systems as
the technology of the immutable ledger that does not require authorities, is a new word in governance.
However, this technology has some principal features that can restrain its implementation at the
state level, and thus require further research and development. The application of blockchain
requires a proper architecture of overlaid technologies to support changes of outdated and mistaken
data, address issues of digital identity and privacy, legal compliance and enforceability of smart
contracts and scalability of the ledger. This paper shows the constraints of the technology's properties
which were not explained before in the context of title rights and land registration even though
technological limits are known in more specific technical sources. Along with the known benefits
this meant to help to avoid misinterpretation of some DLT features by non-technical people. A multidisciplinary
approach in analysing the technology and laws helped to better understand what can and cannot be
beneficial for public registries and the protection of property rights. The presented outcomes
can be laid down as requirements for the technical protocols aimed at addressing the issues of DLT
and public policies to put blockchain at the service of society.
