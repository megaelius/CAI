The goal of Machine Learning to automatically learn from data, extract knowledge and to make decisions
without any human intervention. Such automatic (aML) approaches show impressive success. Recent
results even demonstrate intriguingly that deep learning applied for automatic classification
of skin lesions is on par with the performance of dermatologists, yet outperforms the average. As
human perception is inherently limited, such approaches can discover patterns, e.g. that two objects
are similar, in arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces what no human is able to do. Humans can deal
only with limited amounts of data, whilst big data is beneficial for aML; however, in health informatics,
we are often confronted with a small number of data sets, where aML suffer of insufficient training
samples and many problems are computationally hard. Here, interactive machine learning (iML)
may be of help, where a human-in-the-loop contributes to reduce the complexity of NP-hard problems.
A further motivation for iML is that standard black-box approaches lack transparency, hence do
not foster trust and acceptance of ML among end-users. Rising legal and privacy aspects, e.g. with
the new European General Data Protection Regulations, make black-box approaches difficult to
use, because they often are not able to explain why a decision has been made. In this paper, we present
some experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the human-in-the-loop approach, particularly
in opening the black-box to a glass-box and thus enabling a human directly to interact with an learning
algorithm. We selected the Ant Colony Optimization framework, and applied it on the Traveling Salesman
Problem, which is a good example, due to its relevance for health informatics, e.g. for the study
of protein folding. From studies of how humans extract so much from so little data, fundamental ML-research
also may benefit.
