We consider the constrained graph alignment problem which has applications in biological network
analysis. Given two input graphs $G_1=(V_1,E_1), G_2=(V_2,E_2)$, a pair of vertex mappings induces
an {\it edge conservation} if the vertex pairs are adjacent in their respective graphs. %In general
terms The goal is to provide a one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the input graphs in order
to maximize edge conservation. However the allowed mappings are restricted since each vertex from
$V_1$ (resp. $V_2$) is allowed to be mapped to at most $m_1$ (resp. $m_2$) specified vertices in $V_2$
(resp. $V_1$). Most of results in this paper deal with the case $m_2=1$ which attracted most attention
in the related literature. We formulate the problem as a maximum independent set problem in a related
{\em conflict graph} and investigate structural properties of this graph in terms of forbidden
subgraphs. We are interested, in particular, in excluding certain wheals, fans, cliques or claws
(all terms are defined in the paper), which corresponds in excluding certain cycles, paths, cliques
or independent sets in the neighborhood of each vertex. Then, we investigate algorithmic consequences
of some of these properties, which illustrates the potential of this approach and raises new horizons
for further works. In particular this approach allows us to reinterpret a known polynomial case
in terms of conflict graph and to improve known approximation and fixed-parameter tractability
results through efficiently solving the maximum independent set problem in conflict graphs. Some
of our new approximation results involve approximation ratios that are function of the optimal
value, in particular its square root; this kind of results cannot be achieved for maximum independent
set in general graphs.
