In this paper, we propose a novel design of image deblurring in the form of one-shot convolution filtering
that can directly convolve with naturally blurred images for restoration. The problem of optical
blurring is a common disadvantage to many imaging applications that suffer from optical imperfections.
Despite numerous deconvolution methods that blindly estimate blurring in either inclusive or
exclusive forms, they are practically challenging due to high computational cost and low image
reconstruction quality. Both conditions of high accuracy and high speed are prerequisites for
high-throughput imaging platforms in digital archiving. In such platforms, deblurring is required
after image acquisition before being stored, previewed, or processed for high-level interpretation.
Therefore, on-the-fly correction of such images is important to avoid possible time delays, mitigate
computational expenses, and increase image perception quality. We bridge this gap by synthesizing
a deconvolution kernel as a linear combination of Finite Impulse Response (FIR) even-derivative
filters that can be directly convolved with blurry input images to boost the frequency fall-off
of the Point Spread Function (PSF) associated with the optical blur. We employ a Gaussian low-pass
filter to decouple the image denoising problem for image edge deblurring. Furthermore, we propose
a blind approach to estimate the PSF statistics for two Gaussian and Laplacian models that are common
in many imaging pipelines. Thorough experiments are designed to test and validate the efficiency
of the proposed method using 2054 naturally blurred images across six imaging applications and
seven state-of-the-art deconvolution methods.
