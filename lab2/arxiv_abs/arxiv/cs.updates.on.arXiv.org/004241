As networks expand in size and complexity, they pose greater administrative and management challenges.
Software Defined Networks (SDN) offer a promising approach to meeting some of these challenges.
In this paper, we propose a policy driven security architecture for securing end to end services
across multiple SDN domains. We develop a language based approach to design security policies that
are relevant for securing SDN services and communications. We describe the policy language and
its use in specifying security policies to control the flow of information in a multi-domain SDN.
We demonstrate the specification of fine grained security policies based on a variety of attributes
such as parameters associated with users and devices/switches, context information such as location
and routing information, and services accessed in SDN as well as security attributes associated
with the switches and Controllers in different domains. An important feature of our architecture
is its ability to specify path and flow based security policies, which are significant for securing
end to end services in SDNs. We describe the design and the implementation of our proposed policy
based security architecture and demonstrate its use in scenarios involving both intra and inter-domain
communications with multiple SDN Controllers. We analyse the performance characteristics of
our architecture as well as discuss how our architecture is able to counteract various security
attacks. The dynamic security policy based approach and the distribution of corresponding security
capabilities intelligently as a service layer that enable flow based security enforcement and
protection of multitude of network devices against attacks are important contributions of this
paper.
