As well known, the huge memory and compute costs of both artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) greatly hinder their deployment on edge devices with high efficiency. Model
compression has been proposed as a promising technique to improve the running efficiency via parameter
and operation reduction. Whereas, this technique is mainly practiced in ANNs rather than SNNs.
It is interesting to answer how much an SNN model can be compressed without compromising its functionality,
where two challenges should be addressed: i) the accuracy of SNNs is usually sensitive to model compression,
which requires an accurate compression methodology; ii) the computation of SNNs is event-driven
rather than static, which produces an extra compression dimension on dynamic spikes. To this end,
we realize a comprehensive SNN compression through three steps. First, we formulate the connection
pruning and weight quantization as a constrained optimization problem. Second, we combine spatio-temporal
backpropagation (STBP) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem
with minimum accuracy loss. Third, we further propose activity regularization to reduce the spike
events for fewer active operations. These methods can be applied in either a single way for moderate
compression or a joint way for aggressive compression. We define several quantitative metrics
to evaluation the compression performance for SNNs. Our methodology is validated in pattern recognition
tasks over MNIST, N-MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, where extensive comparisons, analyses,
and insights are provided. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that studies SNN compression
in a comprehensive manner by exploiting all compressible components and achieves better results.
