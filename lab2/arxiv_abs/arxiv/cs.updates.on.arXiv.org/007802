The article deals with the development, implementation and research of the spectrum analyzers
that can be used in sensor networks and Internet systems of things. As an operating frequency range,
2.4-2.5 GHz ISM is selected. At the stage of hardware selection, a comparative analysis of existing
available microcontrollers for the analysis of the spectrum, the choice of hardware interfaces,
the ordering of the required modules and electrical components, as well as the input control is carried
out. During development, several variants of spectrum analyzers on the basis of microcontroller
and TI Chipcon CC2500 microcontrollers with USB interfaces, as well as Cypress CYWUSB6935 modules
with LPT and USB interfaces, have been implemented. At the development stage, the development of
the printed circuit board, its fabrication, component assembly, microcontroller programming,
the verification of the assembly's robustness, making corrections, connecting to a personal computer
and assembly in the case have been carried out. An analysis of existing software for collecting information
on the state of the wireless broadcast is also conducted. According to the results of comparative
experiments of various collections of spectrum analyzers, spectrographs for different types
of signals were obtained. On these typical spectrographs a comparative analysis of the work of various
prototypes was conducted. The offered approaches to building sensors on the basis of spectrum analyzers
allow to create low-power modules for embedding in existing wireless information networks of enterprises
for prevention of inter-channel interference and ensuring the integrity of data transmission.
