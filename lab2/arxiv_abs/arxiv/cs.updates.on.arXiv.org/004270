IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS) is one of the most effective imaging modalities that provides
assistance to experts in order to diagnose and treat cardiovascular diseases. We address a central
problem in IVUS image analysis with Fully Convolutional Network (FCN): automatically delineate
the lumen and media-adventitia borders in IVUS images, which is crucial to shorten the diagnosis
process or benefits a faster and more accurate 3D reconstruction of the artery. Particularly, we
propose an FCN architecture, called IVUS-Net, followed by a post-processing contour extraction
step, in order to automatically segments the interior (lumen) and exterior (media-adventitia)
regions of the human arteries. We evaluated our IVUS-Net on the test set of a standard publicly available
dataset containing 326 IVUS B-mode images with two measurements, namely Jaccard Measure (JM) and
Hausdorff Distances (HD). The evaluation result shows that IVUS-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art
lumen and media segmentation methods by 4% to 20% in terms of HD distance. IVUS-Net performs well
on images in the test set that contain a significant amount of major artifacts such as bifurcations,
shadows, and side branches that are not common in the training set. Furthermore, using a modern GPU,
IVUS-Net segments each IVUS frame only in 0.15 seconds. The proposed work, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first deep learning based method for segmentation of both the lumen and the media vessel walls
in 20 MHz IVUS B-mode images that achieves the best results without any manual intervention. Code
