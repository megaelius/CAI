Automatic facial emotion recognition is a challenging task that has gained significant scientific
interest over the past few years, but the problem of emotion recognition for a group of people has
been less extensively studied. However, it is slowly gaining popularity due to the massive amount
of data available on social networking sites containing images of groups of people participating
in various social events. Group emotion recognition is a challenging problem due to obstructions
like head and body pose variations, occlusions, variable lighting conditions, variance of actors,
varied indoor and outdoor settings and image quality. The objective of this task is to classify a
group's perceived emotion as Positive, Neutral or Negative. In this report, we describe our solution
which is a hybrid machine learning system that incorporates deep neural networks and Bayesian classifiers.
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) work from bottom to top, analysing facial expressions
expressed by individual faces extracted from the image. The Bayesian network works from top to bottom,
inferring the global emotion for the image, by integrating the visual features of the contents of
the image obtained through a scene descriptor. In the final pipeline, the group emotion category
predicted by an ensemble of CNNs in the bottom-up module is passed as input to the Bayesian Network
in the top-down module and an overall prediction for the image is obtained. Experimental results
show that the stated system achieves 65.27% accuracy on the validation set which is in line with state-of-the-art
results. As an outcome of this project, a Progressive Web Application and an accompanying Android
app with a simple and intuitive user interface are presented, allowing users to test out the system
with their own pictures.
