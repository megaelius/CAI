Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological discovery, providing
an unbiased picture of cellular heterogeneity in tissues. While scRNA-seq has been used extensively
to provide insight into both healthy systems and diseases, it has not been used for disease prediction
or diagnostics. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) have proven to be versatile for a wide range of tasks
by learning from both original features and graph structures. Here we present a graph attention
model for predicting disease state from single-cell data on a large dataset of Multiple Sclerosis
(MS) patients. MS is a disease of the central nervous system that can be difficult to diagnose. We
train our model on single-cell data obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for a cohort
of seven MS patients and six healthy adults (HA), resulting in 66,667 individual cells. We achieve
92 % accuracy in predicting MS, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as a graph convolutional
network and a random forest classifier. Further, we use the learned graph attention model to get
insight into the features (cell types and genes) that are important for this prediction. The graph
attention model also allow us to infer a new feature space for the cells that emphasizes the differences
between the two conditions. Finally we use the attention weights to learn a new low-dimensional
embedding that can be visualized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use graph
attention, and deep learning in general, to predict disease state from single-cell data. We envision
applying this method to single-cell data for other diseases.
