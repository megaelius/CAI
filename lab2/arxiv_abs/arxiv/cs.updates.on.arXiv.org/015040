As a crucial component in intelligent transportation systems, traffic flow prediction has recently
attracted widespread research interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the increasing
availability of massive traffic mobility data. Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse
factors (such as temporal rules and spatial dependencies) to infer the evolution trend of traffic
flow. To address this problem, we propose a unified neural network called Attentive Traffic Flow
Machine (ATFM), which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of
traffic flow with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ATFM is composed of two progressive
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM \cite{xingjian2015convolutional}) units connected
with a convolutional layer. Specifically, the first ConvLSTM unit takes normal traffic flow features
as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into the connected convolutional
layer for spatial attention map inference. The second ConvLSTM unit aims at learning the dynamic
spatial-temporal representations from the attentionally weighted traffic flow features. Further,
we develop two deep learning frameworks based on ATFM to predict citywide short-term/long-term
traffic flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential and periodic data as well as other external
influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed method for traffic flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of our
method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger pickup/dropoff demands
in traffic prediction and show its superior performance.
