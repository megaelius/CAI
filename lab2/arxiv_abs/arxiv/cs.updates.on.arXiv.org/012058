With increasing point of interest (POI) datasets available with fine-grained spatial and temporal
attributes, space-time Ripley's K function has been regarded as a powerful approach to analyze
spatiotemporal point process. However, space-time Ripley's K function is computationally intensive
for point-wise distance comparisons, edge correction and simulations for significance testing.
Parallel computing technologies like OpenMP, MPI and CUDA have been leveraged to accelerate the
K function, and related experiments have demonstrated the substantial acceleration. Nevertheless,
previous works have not extended optimization of Ripley's K function from space dimension to space-time
dimension. Without sophisticated spatiotemporal query and partitioning mechanisms, extra computational
overhead can be problematic. Meanwhile, these researches were limited by the restricted scalability
and relative expensive programming cost of parallel frameworks and impeded their applications
for large POI dataset and Ripley's K function variations. This paper presents a distributed computing
method to accelerate space-time Ripley's K function upon state-of-the-art distributed computing
framework Apache Spark, and four strategies are adopted to simplify calculation procedures and
accelerate distributed computing respectively. Based on the optimized method, a web-based visual
analytics framework prototype has been developed. Experiments prove the feasibility and time
efficiency of the proposed method, and also demonstrate its value on promoting applications of
space-time Ripley's K function in ecology, geography, sociology, economics, urban transportation
and other fields.
