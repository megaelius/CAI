From longitudinal biomedical studies to social networks, graphs have emerged as a powerful framework
for describing evolving interactions between agents in complex systems. In such studies, the data
typically consists of a set of graphs representing a system's state at different points in time or
space. The analysis of the system's dynamics depends on the selection of the appropriate tools.
In particular, after specifying properties characterizing similarities between states, a critical
step lies in the choice of a distance capable of reflecting such similarities. While the literature
offers a number of distances that one could a priori choose from, their properties have been little
investigated and no guidelines regarding the choice of such a distance have yet been provided. However,
these distances' sensitivity to perturbations in the network's structure and their ability to
identify important changes are crucial to the analysis, making the selection of an adequate metric
a decisive -- yet delicate -- practical matter. In the spirit of Goldenberg, Zheng and Fienberg's
seminal 2009 review, the purpose of this article is to provide an overview of commonly-used graph
distances and an explicit characterization of the structural changes that they are best able to
capture. To see how this translates in real-life situations, we use as a guiding thread to our discussion
the application of these distances to the analysis a longitudinal microbiome study -- as well as
on synthetic examples. Having unveiled some of traditional distances' shortcomings, we also suggest
alternative similarity metrics and highlight their relative advantages in specific analysis
scenarios. Above all, we provide some guidance for choosing one distance over another in certain
types of applications. Finally, we show an application of these different distances to a network
created from worldwide recipes.
