Purpose: To develop a deep learning approach to de-noise optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scans
of the optic nerve head (ONH). Methods: Volume scans consisting of 97 horizontal B-scans were acquired
through the center of the ONH using a commercial OCT device (Spectralis) for both eyes of 20 subjects.
For each eye, single-frame (without signal averaging), and multi-frame (75x signal averaging)
volume scans were obtained. A custom deep learning network was then designed and trained with 2,328
"clean B-scans" (multi-frame B-scans), and their corresponding "noisy B-scans" (clean B-scans
+ gaussian noise) to de-noise the single-frame B-scans. The performance of the de-noising algorithm
was assessed qualitatively, and quantitatively on 1,552 B-scans using the signal to noise ratio
(SNR), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and mean structural similarity index metrics (MSSIM). Results:
The proposed algorithm successfully denoised unseen single-frame OCT B-scans. The denoised B-scans
were qualitatively similar to their corresponding multi-frame B-scans, with enhanced visibility
of the ONH tissues. The mean SNR increased from $4.02 \pm 0.68$ dB (single-frame) to $8.14 \pm 1.03$
dB (denoised). For all the ONH tissues, the mean CNR increased from $3.50 \pm 0.56$ (single-frame)
to $7.63 \pm 1.81$ (denoised). The MSSIM increased from $0.13 \pm 0.02$ (single frame) to $0.65 \pm
0.03$ (denoised) when compared with the corresponding multi-frame B-scans. Conclusions: Our
deep learning algorithm can denoise a single-frame OCT B-scan of the ONH in under 20 ms, thus offering
a framework to obtain superior quality OCT B-scans with reduced scanning times and minimal patient
discomfort.
