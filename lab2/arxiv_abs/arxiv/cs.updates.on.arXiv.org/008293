Multispectral person detection aims at automatically localizing humans in images that consist
of multiple spectral bands. Usually, the visual-optical (VIS) and the thermal infrared (IR) spectra
are combined to achieve higher robustness for person detection especially in insufficiently illuminated
scenes. This paper focuses on analyzing existing detection approaches for their generalization
ability. Generalization is a key feature for machine learning based detection algorithms that
are supposed to perform well across different datasets. Inspired by recent literature regarding
person detection in the VIS spectrum, we perform a cross-validation study to empirically determine
the most promising dataset to train a well-generalizing detector. Therefore, we pick one reference
Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture and three different multispectral datasets.
The Region Proposal Network (RPN) originally introduced for object detection within the popular
Faster R-CNN is chosen as a reference DCNN. The reason is that a stand-alone RPN is able to serve as
a competitive detector for two-class problems such as person detection. Furthermore, current
state-of-the-art approaches initially apply an RPN followed by individual classifiers. The three
considered datasets are the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Benchmark including recently published
improved annotations for training and testing, the Tokyo Multi-spectral Semantic Segmentation
dataset, and the OSU Color-Thermal dataset including recently released annotations. The experimental
results show that the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Benchmark with its improved annotations
provides the best basis to train a DCNN with good generalization ability compared to the other two
multispectral datasets. On average, this detection model achieves a log-average Miss Rate (MR)
of 29.74 % evaluated on the reasonable test subsets of the three datasets.
