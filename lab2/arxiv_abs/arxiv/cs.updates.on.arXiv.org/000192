We use information theoretic achievable rate formulas for the multi-relay channel to study the
problem of optimal placement of relay nodes along the straight line joining a source node and a sink
node. The achievable rate formulas that we use are for full-duplex radios at the relays and decode-
and-forward relaying. For the single relay case, and individual power constraints at the source
node and the relay node, we provide explicit formulas for the optimal relay location and the optimal
power allocation to the source-relay channel, for the exponential and the power-law path-loss
channel models. For the multiple relay case, we consider exponential path-loss and a total power
constraint over the source and the relays, and derive an optimization problem, the solution of which
provides the optimal relay locations. Numerical results suggest that at low attenuation the relays
are mostly clustered close to the source in order to be able to cooperate among themselves, whereas
at high attenuation they are uniformly placed and work as repeaters. The structure of the optimal
power allocation for a given placement of the nodes, then motivates us to formulate the problem of
impromptu ("as-you-go") placement of relays along a line of exponentially distributed length,
with exponential path- loss, so as to minimize a cost function that is additive over hops. The hop
cost trades off a capacity limiting term, motivated from the optimal power allocation solution,
against the cost of adding a relay node. We formulate the problem as a total cost Markov decision process,
for which we prove results for the value function, and provide insights into the placement policy
via numerical exploration.
