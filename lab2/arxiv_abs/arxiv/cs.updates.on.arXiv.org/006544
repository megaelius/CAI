Although public clouds still occupy the largest portion of the total cloud infrastructure, private
clouds are attracting increasing interest from both industry and academia because of their better
security and privacy control. According to the existing studies, the high upfront cost is among
the most critical challenges associated with private clouds. To reduce cost and improve performance,
virtual machine placement (VMP) methods have been extensively investigated, however, few of these
methods have focused on private clouds. This paper proposes a heterogeneous and multidimensional
clairvoyant dynamic bin packing (CDBP) model, in which the scheduler can conduct more efficient
VMP processes using additional information on the arrival time and duration of virtual machines
to reduce the datacenter scale and thereby decrease the upfront cost of private clouds. In addition,
a novel branch-and-bound algorithm with a divide-and-conquer strategy (DCBB) is proposed to effectively
and efficiently handle the derived problem. One state-of-the-art and several classic VMP methods
are also modified to adapt to the proposed model to observe their performance and compare with our
proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real-world and synthetic workloads
to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate
that DCBB delivers near-optimal solutions with a convergence rate that is much faster than those
of the other search-based algorithms evaluated. In particular, DCBB yields the optimal solution
for a real-world workload with an execution time that is an order of magnitude shorter than that required
by the original branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm.
