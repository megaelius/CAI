Ensembles of thermostatically controlled loads (TCL) provide a significant demand response reserve
for the system operator to balance power grids. However, this also results in the parasitic synchronization
of individual devices within the ensemble leading to long post-demand-response oscillations
in the integrated energy consumption of the ensemble. The synchronization is eventually destructed
by fluctuations, thus leading to the (pre-demand response) steady state; however, this natural
desynchronization, or relaxation to a statistically steady-state is too long. A resolution of
this problem consists in measuring the ensemble's instantaneous consumption and using it as a feedback
to stochastic switching of the ensemble's devices between on- and off- states. It was recently shown
with a simplified continuous-time model that carefully tuned nonlinear feedback results in a fast
relaxation of the ensemble energy consumption -- coined super-relaxation. Since both state information
and control signals are discrete, the actual TCL devices operation is space-time quantized, and
this must be considered for realistic TCL ensemble modelling. Here, assuming that states are characterized
by a temperature (quantifying comfort) and the air conditioner regime (on, off), we construct a
discrete model based on the probabilistic description of state transitions. We demonstrate that
super-relaxation holds in such a more realistic setting, and that while it is stable against randomness
in the stochastic matrix of the quantized model, it remains sensitive to the time discretization
scheme. Aiming to achieve a balance between super-relaxation and customer's comfort, we analyze
the dependence of super-relaxation on details of the space-time quantization, and provide a simple
analytical criterion to avoid undesirable oscillations in consumption.
