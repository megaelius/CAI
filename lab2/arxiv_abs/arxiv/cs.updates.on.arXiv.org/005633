Random graphs are mathematical models that have applications in a wide range of domains. We study
the following model where one adds Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi\xspace (ER) type perturbation to a random
geometric graph. More precisely, assume $G_\mathcal{X}^{*}$ is a random geometric graph sampled
from a nice measure on a metric space $\mathcal{X} = (X,d)$. The input observed graph $\widehat{G}(p,q)$
is generated by removing each existing edge from $G_\mathcal{X}^*$ with probability $p$, while
inserting each non-existent edge to $G_\mathcal{X}^{*}$ with probability $q$. We refer to such
random $p$-deletion and $q$-insertion as ER-perturbation. Although these graphs are related
to the objects in the continuum percolation theory, our understanding of them is still rather limited.
In this paper we consider a localized version of the classical notion of clique number for the aforementioned
\emph{ER-perturbed random geometric graphs}: Specifically, we study the \emph{edge clique number}
for each edge in a graph, defined as the size of the largest clique(s) in the graph containing that
edge. The clique number of the graph is simply the largest edge clique number. Interestingly, given
a ER-perturbed random geometric graph, we show that the edge clique number presents two fundamentally
different types of behaviors, depending on which "type" of randomness it is generated from. As an
application of the above results, we show that by using a filtering process based on the edge clique
number, we can recover the shortest-path metric of the random geometric graph $G_\mathcal{X}^*$
within a multiplicative factor of $3$, from an ER-perturbed observed graph $\widehat{G}(p,q)$,
for a significantly wider range of insertion probability $q$ than in previous work.
