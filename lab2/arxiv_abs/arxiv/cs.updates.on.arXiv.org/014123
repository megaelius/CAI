As important side information, attributes have been widely exploited in the existing recommender
system for better performance. In the real-world scenarios, it is common that some attributes of
items/users are missing (e.g., some movies miss the genre data). Prior studies usually use a default
value (i.e., "other") to represent the missing attribute, resulting in sub-optimal performance.
To address this problem, in this paper, we present an attribute-aware attentive graph convolution
network (A${^2}$-GCN). In particular, we first construct a graph, whereby users, items, and attributes
are three types of nodes and their associations are edges. Thereafter, we leverage the graph convolution
network to characterize the complicated interactions among <users, items, attributes>. To learn
the node representation, we turn to the message-passing strategy to aggregate the message passed
from the other directly linked types of nodes (e.g., a user or an attribute). To this end, we are capable
of incorporating associate attributes to strengthen the user and item representations, and thus
naturally solve the attribute missing problem. Considering the fact that for different users,
the attributes of an item have different influence on their preference for this item, we design a
novel attention mechanism to filter the message passed from an item to a target user by considering
the attribute information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on several publicly accessible
datasets to justify our model. Results show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art
methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of our attention method.
