Dynamic and flexible optical networking enabled by NFV and SDN are the key technology enablers for
supporting the dynamicity and bandwidth requirements of emerging 5G network services. To achieve
the objective of 5G, Network Services (NSes) must be often deployed transparently over multiple
administrative and technological domains. Such case often presents security risks since a typical
NS may comprise a chain of network functions, each executed in different remote locations, and tampering
within the network infrastructure may compromise their communication. To avoid such threats,
QKD has been identified and proposed as a future-proof method immune to any algorithmic cryptanalysis
based on quantum-physics mechanisms. The maturity of QKD has enabled the R&D of quantum networks
coexisting with optical networks using telecom equipment. This makes the QKD a suitable candidate
for the security of distributed and virtualised network services. In this paper, for the first time,
we propose a dynamic quantum-secured optical network for supporting network services that are
dynamically created by chaining VNF over multiple network domains. This work includes a new quantum-ROADM,
extensions to SDN-enabled optical control plane, and extensions to NFV orchestration to achieve
quantum-aware, on-demand chaining of VNFs. The experimental results verify the capability of
routing quantum and classical data channels both individually and dynamically over shared fibre
links. Moreover, quantum secured chaining of VNFs in 5G networks is experimentally demonstrated
via interconnecting four autonomous 5G islands simultaneously through the q-ROADM with eight
optical channels using the 5GUK Exchange orchestration platform. The experimental scenarios
and results confirm the benefit of the proposed data plane architecture and control/management
plane framework.
