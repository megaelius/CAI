Recent progress in robotic manipulation has dealt with the case of previously unknown objects in
the context of relatively simple tasks, such as bin-picking. Existing methods for more constrained
problems, however, such as deliberate placement in a tight region, depend more critically on shape
information to achieve safe execution. This work deals with pick-and-constrained placement of
objects without access to geometric models. The objective is to pick an object and place it safely
inside a desired goal region without any collisions, while minimizing the time and the sensing operations
required to complete the task. An algorithmic framework is proposed for this purpose, which performs
manipulation planning simultaneously over a conservative and an optimistic estimate of the object's
volume. The conservative estimate ensures that the manipulation is safe while the optimistic estimate
guides the sensor-based manipulation process when no solution can be found for the conservative
estimate. To maintain these estimates and dynamically update them during manipulation, objects
are represented by a simple volumetric representation, which stores sets of occupied and unseen
voxels. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by developing a robotic system
that picks a previously unseen object from a table-top and places it in a constrained space. The system
comprises of a dual-arm manipulator with heterogeneous end-effectors and leverages hand-offs
as a re-grasping strategy. Real-world experiments show that straightforward pick-sense-and-place
alternatives frequently fail to solve pick-and-constrained placement problems. The proposed
pipeline, however, achieves more than 95% success rate and faster execution times as evaluated
over multiple physical experiments.
