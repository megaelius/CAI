In pliable index coding, we consider a server with $m$ messages and $n$ clients where each client
has as side information a subset of the messages. We seek to minimize the number of broadcast transmissions,
so that each client can recover any one unknown message she does not already have. Previous work has
shown that the pliable index coding problem is NP-hard and requires at most $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(n))$
broadcast transmissions, which indicates exponential savings over the conventional index coding
that requires in the worst case $\mathcal{O}(n)$ transmissions. In this work, building on a decoding
criterion that we propose, we first design a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that can
realize the exponential benefits, by achieving, in the worst case, a performance upper bounded
by $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(n))$ broadcast transmissions. We extend our algorithm to the $t$-requests
case, where each client requires $t$ unknown messages that she does not have, and show that our algorithm
requires at most $\mathcal{O}(t\log(n)+\log^2(n))$ broadcast transmissions. We construct
lower bound instances that require at least $\Omega(\log(n))$ transmissions for linear pliable
index coding and at least $\Omega(t+\log(n))$ transmissions for the $t$-requests case, indicating
that both our upper and lower bounds are polynomials of $\log(n)$ and differ within a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$.
Finally, we provide a probabilistic analysis and show that the required number of transmissions
is almost surely $\Theta(\log(n))$, as compared to $\Theta(n/\log(n))$ for index coding. Our
numerical experiments show that our algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for pliable index
coding by up to $50\%$ less transmissions.
