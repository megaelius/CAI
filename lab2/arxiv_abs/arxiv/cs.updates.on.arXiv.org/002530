In current study, a mechanism to extract traffic related information such as congestion and incidents
from textual data from the internet is proposed. The current source of data is Twitter. As the data
being considered is extremely large in size automated models are developed to stream, download,
and mine the data in real-time. Furthermore, if any tweet has traffic related information then the
models should be able to infer and extract this data. Currently, the data is collected only for United
States and a total of 120,000 geo-tagged traffic related tweets are extracted, while six million
geo-tagged non-traffic related tweets are retrieved and classification models are trained. Furthermore,
this data is used for various kinds of spatial and temporal analysis. A mechanism to calculate level
of traffic congestion, safety, and traffic perception for cities in U.S. is proposed. Traffic congestion
and safety rankings for the various urban areas are obtained and then they are statistically validated
with existing widely adopted rankings. Traffic perception depicts the attitude and perception
of people towards the traffic. It is also seen that traffic related data when visualized spatially
and temporally provides the same pattern as the actual traffic flows for various urban areas. When
visualized at the city level, it is clearly visible that the flow of tweets is similar to flow of vehicles
and that the traffic related tweets are representative of traffic within the cities. With all the
findings in current study, it is shown that significant amount of traffic related information can
be extracted from Twitter and other sources on internet. Furthermore, Twitter and these data sources
are freely available and are not bound by spatial and temporal limitations. That is, wherever there
is a user there is a potential for data.
