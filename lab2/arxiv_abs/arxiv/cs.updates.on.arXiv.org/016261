Human visual system can selectively attend to parts of a scene for quick perception, a biological
mechanism known as Human attention. Inspired by this, recent deep learning models encode attention
mechanisms to focus on the most task-relevant parts of the input signal for further processing,
which is called Machine/Neural/Artificial attention. Understanding the relation between human
and machine attention is important for interpreting and designing neural networks. Many works
claim that the attention mechanism offers an extra dimension of interpretability by explaining
where the neural networks look. However, recent studies demonstrate that artificial attention
maps do not always coincide with common intuition. In view of these conflicting evidence, here we
make a systematic study on using artificial attention and human attention in neural network design.
With three example computer vision tasks, diverse representative backbones, and famous architectures,
corresponding real human gaze data, and systematically conducted large-scale quantitative studies,
we quantify the consistency between artificial attention and human visual attention and offer
novel insights into existing artificial attention mechanisms by giving preliminary answers to
several key questions related to human and artificial attention mechanisms. Overall results demonstrate
that human attention can benchmark the meaningful `ground-truth' in attention-driven tasks,
where the more the artificial attention is close to human attention, the better the performance;
for higher-level vision tasks, it is case-by-case. It would be advisable for attention-driven
tasks to explicitly force a better alignment between artificial and human attention to boost the
performance; such alignment would also improve the network explainability for higher-level computer
vision tasks.
