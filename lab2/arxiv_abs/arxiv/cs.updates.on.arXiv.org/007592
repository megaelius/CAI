Testing processes and workflows in information and Internet of Things systems is a major part of
the typical software testing effort. Consistent and efficient path-based test cases are desired
to support these tests. Because certain parts of software system workflows have a higher business
priority than others, this fact has to be involved in the generation of test cases. In this paper,
we propose a Prioritized Process Test (PPT), which is a model-based test case generation algorithm
that represents an alternative to currently established algorithms that use directed graphs and
test requirements to model the system under test. The PPT accepts a directed multigraph as a model
to express priorities, and edge weights are used instead of test requirements. To determine the
test-coverage level of test cases, a test-depth-level concept is used. We compared the presented
PPT with five alternatives (i.e., the Process Cycle Test, a naive reduction of test set created by
the Process Cycle Test, Brute Force algorithm, Set-covering Based Solution and Matching-based
Prefix Graph Solution) for edge coverage and edge-pair coverage. To assess the optimality of the
path-based test cases produced by these strategies, we used fourteen metrics based on the properties
of these test cases and 59 models that were created for three real-world systems. For all edge coverage,
the PPT produced more optimal test cases than the alternatives in terms of the majority of the metrics.
For edge-pair coverage, the PPT strategy yielded similar results to those of the alternatives.
Thus, the PPT strategy is an applicable alternative, as it reflects both the required test coverage
level and the business priority in parallel.
