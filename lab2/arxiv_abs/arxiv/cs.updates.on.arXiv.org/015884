Previous studies have shown that health information technologies have a positive impact on health
systems. Electronic health record (EHR) systems are one of the most promising applications, demonstrating
a positive effect in high income countries. On the other hand, robust evidence for low and middle
income countries is still spare. The aim of this study is to initiate a carefully planned nationwide
EHR system in Vietnam by assessing the core readiness. The assessment structure is mainly based
on previous research, which recommends a readiness assessment prior to to an EHR system implementation.
To collect data, participant observation, document analysis and an in-depth interview were used.
This study has revealed new insights into the current situation on EHR in Vietnam. The Ministry of
Health is currently working on improving the conditions for future implementation of a Vietnamese
EHR system. There are issues with the current way of handling health records. These issues are encouraging
the Ministry of Health to work on identifying the next steps for an EHR system implementation. The
integration of an EHR system with current systems seems to be challenging as most systems are commercial,
closed source and very likely have no standardised interface. In conclusion, this study identifies
points which need to be further investigated prior to an implementation. Generally, health care
workers show good awareness of new technologies. As the Vietnam's health care system is centrally
organised, there is the possibility for a nation-wide implementation. This could have a positive
impact on the health care system, however, besides rigours planning also standards need to be followed
and common interfaces implemented. Finally, this assessment has focused on only one level of readiness
assessment. Further research is needed to complete the assessment.
