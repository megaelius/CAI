Gang violence is a severe issue in major cities across the U.S. and recent studies [Patton et al. 2017]
have found evidence of social media communications that can be linked to such violence in communities
with high rates of exposure to gang activity. In this paper we partnered computer scientists with
social work researchers, who have domain expertise in gang violence, to analyze how public tweets
with images posted by youth who mention gang associations on Twitter can be leveraged to automatically
detect psychosocial factors and conditions that could potentially assist social workers and violence
outreach workers in prevention and early intervention programs. To this end, we developed a rigorous
methodology for collecting and annotating tweets. We gathered 1,851 tweets and accompanying annotations
related to visual concepts and the psychosocial codes: aggression, loss, and substance use. These
codes are relevant to social work interventions, as they represent possible pathways to violence
on social media. We compare various methods for classifying tweets into these three classes, using
only the text of the tweet, only the image of the tweet, or both modalities as input to the classifier.
In particular, we analyze the usefulness of mid-level visual concepts and the role of different
modalities for this tweet classification task. Our experiments show that individually, text information
dominates classification performance of the loss class, while image information dominates the
aggression and substance use classes. Our multimodal approach provides a very promising improvement
(18% relative in mean average precision) over the best single modality approach. Finally, we also
illustrate the complexity of understanding social media data and elaborate on open challenges.
