We describe a novel geometric methodology for analyzing free-energy and kinetics of assembly driven
by short-range pair-potentials in an implicit solvent, and provides illustrations of its unique
capabilities. An atlas is a labeled partition of the assembly landscape into a topological roadmap
of maximal, contiguous, nearly-equipotential-energy conformational regions or macrostates,
together with their neighborhood relationships. The new methodology decouples the roadmap generation
from sampling and produces: (1) a query-able atlas of local potential energy minima, their basin
structure, energy barriers, and neighboring basins; (2) paths between a specified pair of basins;
and (3) approximations of relative path lengths, basin volumes (configurational entropy), and
path probabilities. Results demonstrating the core algorithm's capabilities have been generated
by a resource-light, opensource software implementation EASAL. EASAL atlases several hundred
thousand macrostates in minutes on a standard laptop. Subsequent path and basin computations each
take seconds. The core algorithm's correctness, time complexity, and efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs
are formally guaranteed using modern geometric constraint systems. The methodology further links
geometric variables of the input assembling units to a type of intuitive topological bar-code of
the output atlas, which in turn determine stable assembled structures and kinetics. This succinct
input-output relationship facilitates reverse analysis, and control towards design. We use the
novel convex Cayley (distance-based) parametrization that is unique to assembly, as opposed to
folding. Sampling microstates with macrostate-specific Cayley parameters avoids gradient-descent
search used by all prevailing methods. This increases sampling efficiency, significantly reduces
the number of repeated and discarded samples.
