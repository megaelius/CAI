Graph matching is an important and persistent problem in computer vision and pattern recognition
for finding node-to-node correspondence between graph-structured data. However, as widely used,
graph matching that incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment
problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational difficulties. In this
paper, we present a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more
geometric insights on the problem and reduce the space and time complexities of corresponding algorithms.
To achieve these goals, we represent a graph endowed with edge attributes by a linear function space
equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that has an explicit geometric meaning.
Consequently, the correspondence between graphs can be represented as a linear representation
map of that functional. Specifically, we reformulate the linear functional representation map
as a new parameterization for Euclidean graph matching, which is associative with geometric parameters
for graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations. This allows us to estimate the correspondence
and geometric deformations simultaneously. The use of the representation of edge attributes rather
than the affinity matrix enables us to reduce the space complexity by two orders of magnitudes. Furthermore,
we propose an efficient optimization strategy with low time complexity to optimize the objective
function. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
the proposed FRGM can achieve state-of-the-art performance.
