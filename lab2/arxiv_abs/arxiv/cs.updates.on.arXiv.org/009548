Background: Networks in different domains are characterized by similar global characteristics
while differing in local structures. To further extend this concept, we investigated network regularities
on a fine scale in order to examine the functional impact of recurring motifs in signed oriented biological
networks. In this work we generalize to signaling net works some considerations made on feedback
and feed forward loops and extend them by adding a close scrutiny of Linear Triplets, which have not
yet been investigate in detail. Results: We studied the role of triplets, either open or closed (Loops
or linear events) by enumerating them in different biological signaling networks and by comparing
their significance profiles. We compared different data sources and investigated the fine topology
of protein networks representing causal relationships based on transcriptional control, phosphorylation,
ubiquitination and binding. Not only were we able to generalize findings that have already been
reported but we also highlighted a connection between relative motif abundance and node function.
Furthermore, by analyzing for the first time Linear Triplets, we highlighted the relative importance
of nodes sitting in specific positions in closed signaling triplets. Finally, we tried to apply
machine learning to show that a combination of motifs features can be used to derive node function.
Availability: The triplets counter used for this work is available as a Cytoscape App and as a standalone
command line Java application. this http URL Keywords: Graph theory, graph analysis, graph topology,
