By the aid of attention mechanisms to weight the image features adaptively, recent advanced deep
learning-based salient object detection models encourage the predicted results to approximate
the ground-truth masks with as large predictable areas as possible. However, these methods do not
pay enough attention to small areas prone to misprediction. In this way, it is still tough to accurately
locate salient objects due to the existence of regions with indistinguishable foreground and background
and regions with complex or fine structures. To address these problems, we propose a novel network
with purificatory mechanism and structural similarity loss. Specifically, in order to better
locate preliminary salient objects, we first introduce the promotion attention, which is based
on spatial and channel attention mechanisms to promote attention to salient regions. Subsequently,
for the purpose of restoring the indistinguishable regions that can be regarded as error-prone
regions of one model, we propose the rectification attention, which is learned from the areas of
wrong prediction and guide the network to focus on error-prone regions thus rectifying errors.
Through these two attentions, we use the Purificatory Mechanism to impose strict weights with different
regions of the whole salient objects and purify results from hard-to-distinguish regions, thus
accurately predicting the locations and details of salient objects. In addition to paying different
attention to these hard-to-distinguish regions, we also consider the structural constraints
on complex regions and propose the Structural Similarity Loss. The proposed loss models the region-level
pair-wise relationship between regions to assist these regions to calibrate their own saliency
values. In experiments, the proposed approach efficiently outperforms 19 state-of-the-art methods
on six datasets with a notable margin.
