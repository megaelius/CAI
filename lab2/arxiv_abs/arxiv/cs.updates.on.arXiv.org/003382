Although human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied
extensively in the last few decades, yet in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods
has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose
estimation methods. However, in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes
with specific challenges including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout
a day and also having different pose distribution from the common human surveillance viewpoint.
In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly lessen the effectiveness of
existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge,
infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data
under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with unconventional pose perspective,
a 2-end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. In this work, we
explored the idea of employing a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained
on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-tuning the model using our own shallow in-bed
IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic
life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-trained CNN called convolutional
pose machine (CPM) was repurposed for in-bed pose estimation by fine-tuning its specific intermediate
layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM significantly
improved by 26.4% in PCK0.1 criteria compared to the model without such rectification.
