Short-term traffic forecasting based on deep learning methods, especially recurrent neural networks
(RNN), has received much attention in recent years. However, the potential of RNN-based models
in traffic forecasting has not yet been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial-temporal
data and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on RNN-based models and
attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its variants into traffic prediction models.
A stacked bidirectional and unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed
to assist the design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key component
of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to capture the forward and backward
temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data. To deal with missing values in spatial-temporal
data, we also propose a data imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an
imputation unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional version
of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world network-wide traffic state
datasets are used to conduct experiments and published to facilitate further traffic prediction
research. The prediction performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is
evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM architecture, especially
the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior performance for the network-wide traffic prediction
in both accuracy and robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed
data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding prediction performance
when the model's input data contains different patterns of missing values.
