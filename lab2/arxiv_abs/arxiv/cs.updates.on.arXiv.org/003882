Neuroscientific data analysis has classically involved methods for statistical signal and image
processing, drawing on linear algebra and stochastic process theory. However, digitized neuroanatomical
data sets containing labelled neurons, either individually or in groups labelled by tracer injections,
do not fully fit into this classical framework. The tree-like shapes of neurons cannot mathematically
be adequately described as points in a vector space. There is therefore a need for new approaches.
Methods from computational topology and geometry are naturally suited to the analysis of neuronal
shapes. Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse Theory to extract tree-skeletons of individual
neurons from volumetric brain image data, or to summarize collections of neurons labelled by localized
anterograde tracer injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible
to summarize the collection of neurons labelled by a localized anterograde tracer injection using
a consensus tree-shape. The algorithmic procedure includes an initial pre-processing step to
extract a density field from the raw volumetric image data, followed by initial skeleton extraction
from the density field using a discrete version of a 1-(un)stable manifold of the density field.
Heuristically, if the density field is regarded as a mountainous landscape, then the 1-(un)stable
manifold follows the "mountain ridges" connecting the maxima of the density field. We then simplify
this skeleton-graph into a tree using a shortest-path approach and methods derived from persistent
homology. The advantage of this approach is that it uses global information about the density field
and is therefore robust to local fluctuations and non-uniformly distributed input signals. To
be able to handle large data sets, we use a divide-and-conquer approach. The resulting software
DiMorSC is available on Github.
