To overcome the limitations of DSRC with short range, non-supportability of high density networks,
unreliable broadcast services, signal congestion and connectivity disruptions, cellular vehicle-to-everything
(C-V2X) communication networks, standardized in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release
14, have been recently introduced to cover broader vehicular communication scenarios including
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) and vehicle-to-infrastructure/network
(V2I/N). In C-V2X, vehicles can directly communicate over PC5 based dedicated sidelinks called
direct mode or V2V communication. However, high vehicle densities may require reuse of cellular
spectrum for V2V. Moreover, infrastructure mode communication through V2I/N links can augment
V2V communication by enhancing communication range and reliability for enhanced safety along
with consistent performance under traffic congestions. Motivated by the stringent connection
reliability, spectral efficiency, and coverage requirements in C-V2X, this paper presents the
first comprehensive and tractable analytical framework for performance of C-V2X networks over
shared V2V and cellular uplink channels, where the transmitting vehicles can deliver their information
via infrastructure or direct mode, based on their distances, propagation environments and the
bias factor. By practically modeling the vehicles on the roads using the doubly stochastic Cox process
and the base-stations, we derive new association probabilities, new success probabilities of
infrastructure and direct mode, and overall success probability of the C-V2X communication over
shared channels, which are validated by the simulations results. Our results reveal the benefits
of our proposed model (possibility of selecting both direct and infrastructure modes over shared
channels) compared to V2V network in terms of success probability.
