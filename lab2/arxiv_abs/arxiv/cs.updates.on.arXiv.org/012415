Structural information about protein-protein interactions, often missing at the interactome
scale, is important for mechanistic understanding of cells and rational discovery of therapeutics.
Protein docking provides a computational alternative to predict such information. However, ranking
near-native docked models high among a large number of candidates, often known as the scoring problem,
remains a critical challenge. Moreover, estimating model quality, also known as the quality assessment
problem, is rarely addressed in protein docking. In this study the two challenging problems in protein
docking are regarded as relative and absolute scoring, respectively, and addressed in one physics-inspired
deep learning framework. We represent proteins' and encounter complexes' 3D structures as intra-
and inter-molecular residue contact graphs with atom-resolution node and edge features. And we
propose a novel graph convolutional kernel that pool interacting nodes' features through edge
features so that generalized interaction energies can be learned directly from graph data. The
resulting energy-based graph convolutional networks (EGCN) with multi-head attention are trained
to predict intra- and inter-molecular energies, binding affinities, and quality measures (interface
RMSD) for encounter complexes. Compared to a state-of-the-art scoring function for model ranking,
EGCN has significantly improved ranking for a CAPRI test set involving homology docking; and is
comparable for Score_set, a CAPRI benchmark set generated by diverse community-wide docking protocols
not known to training data. For Score_set quality assessment, EGCN shows about 27% improvement
to our previous efforts. Directly learning from 3D structure data in graph representation, EGCN
represents the first successful development of graph convolutional networks for protein docking.
