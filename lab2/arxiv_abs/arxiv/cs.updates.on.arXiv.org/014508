The connection between messaging and action is fundamental both to web applications, such as web
search and sentiment analysis, and to economics. However, while prominent online applications
exploit messaging in natural (human) language in order to predict non-strategic action selection,
the economics literature focuses on the connection between structured stylized messaging to strategic
decisions in games and multi-agent encounters. This paper aims to connect these two strands of research,
which we consider highly timely and important due to the vast online textual communication on the
web. Particularly, we introduce the following question: can free text expressed in natural language
serve for the prediction of action selection in an economic context, modeled as a game? In order to
initiate the research on this question, we introduce the study of an individual's action prediction
in a one-shot game based on free text he/she provides, while being unaware of the game to be played.
We approach the problem by attributing commonsensical personality attributes via crowd-sourcing
to free texts written by individuals, and employing transductive learning to predict actions taken
by these individuals in one-shot games based on these attributes. Our approach allows us to train
a single classifier that can make predictions with respect to actions taken in multiple games. In
experiments with three well-studied games, our algorithm compares favorably with strong alternative
approaches. In ablation analysis, we demonstrate the importance of our modeling choices -- the
representation of the text with the commonsensical personality attributes and our classifier
-- to the predictive power of our model.
