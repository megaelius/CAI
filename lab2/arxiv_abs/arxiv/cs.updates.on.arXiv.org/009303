Very high resolution (VHR) images provide abundant ground details and spatial distribution information.
Change detection in multi-temporal VHR images plays a significant role in urban expansion and area
internal change analysis. Nevertheless, traditional change detection methods can neither take
full advantage of spatial context information nor cope with the complex internal heterogeneity
of VHR images. In this paper, we propose a powerful multi-scale feature convolution unit (MFCU)
for change detection in VHR images. The proposed unit is able to extract multi-scale features in
the same layer. Based on the proposed unit, two novel deep Siamese convolutional networks, deep
Siamese multi-scale convolutional network (DSMS-CN) and deep Siamese multi-scale fully convolutional
network (DSMS-FCN), are designed for unsupervised and supervised change detection in multi-temporal
VHR images. For unsupervised change detection, we implement automatic pre-classification to
obtain training patch samples, and the DSMS-CN fits the statistical distribution of changed and
unchanged area from patch samples through multi-scale feature extraction module and deep Siamese
architecture. For supervised change detection, the end-to-end deep fully convolutional network
DSMS-FCN is trained in any size of multi-temporal VHR images, and directly output the binary change
map. In addition, for the purpose of solving the inaccurate localization problem, the fully connected
conditional random field (FC-CRF) is combined with DSMS-FCN to refine the results. The experimental
results with challenging data sets confirm that the two proposed architectures perform better
than the state-of-the-art methods.
