<incorrect proofs; does not consider an important case because of which the proofs are wrong. The
paper was withdrawn from submission> One of the objectives of a Delaunay mesh refinement algorithm
is to produce meshes with tetrahedral elements having a bounded aspect ratio, which is the ratio
between the radius of the circumscribing and inscribing spheres. The refinement is carried out
by inserting additional Steiner vertices inside the circumsphere of a poor-quality tetrahedron
(to remove the tetrahedron) at a sufficient distance from existing vertices to guarantee the termination
and size optimality of the algorithm. This technique eliminates tetrahedra whose ratio of the radius
of the circumscribing sphere and the shortest side, the radius-edge ratio, is large. Slivers, almost-planar
tetrahedra, which have a small radius-edge ratio, but a large aspect ratio, are avoided by small
random perturbations of the Steiner vertices to improve the aspect ratio. Additionally, geometric
constraints, called "petals", have been shown to produce smaller high-quality meshes in 2D Delaunay
refinement algorithms. In this paper, we develop a deterministic nondifferentiable optimization
routine to place the Steiner vertex inside geometrical constraints that we call "snow globes" for
3D Delaunay refinement. We explore why the geometrical constraints and an ordering on processing
of poor-quality tetrahedra result in smaller meshes. The stricter analysis provides an improved
constant associated with the size optimality of the generated meshes. Aided by the analysis, we
present a modified algorithm to handle boundary encroachment. The final algorithm behaves like
an advancing-front algorithms that are commonly used for quadrilateral and hexahedral meshing.
