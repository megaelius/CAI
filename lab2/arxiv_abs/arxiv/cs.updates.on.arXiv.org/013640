Safe and compliant control of dynamic systems in interaction with the environment, e.g., in shared
workspaces, continues to represent a major challenge. Mismatches in the dynamic model of the robots,
numerical singularities, and the intrinsic environmental unpredictability are all contributing
factors.Online optimization of impedance controllers has recently shown great promise in addressing
this challenge, however, their performance is not sufficiently robust to be deployed in challenging
environments. This work proposes a compliant control method for redundant manipulators based
on a stack of multiple passive task-space controllers. Our control framework of passive controllers
is inherently stable, numerically well-conditioned (as no matrix inversions are required), and
computationally inexpensive (as no optimization is used). We leverage and introduce a novel stiffness
profile for a recently proposed passive controller with smooth transitions between the divergence
and convergence phases making it particularly suitable when multiple passive controllers are
combined in a stack. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves sub-centimeter
tracking performance during dynamic demanding tasks with fast-changing references, while remaining
safe to interact with and robust to singularities. The proposed framework achieves this without
knowledge of the robot dynamics and thanks to its passivity is intrinsically stable. The data further
shows that the robot can fully take advantage of the null-space to maintain the primary task accuracy
while compensating for external perturbations.
