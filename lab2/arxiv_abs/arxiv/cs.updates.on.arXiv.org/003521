There has been considerable interest in the electrification of freight transport, particularly
heavy-duty trucks to downscale the greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector.
However, the economic competitiveness of electric semi-trucks is uncertain as there are substantial
additional initial costs associated with the large battery packs required. In this work, we analyze
the trade-off between the initial investment and the operating cost for realistic usage scenarios
to compare a fleet of electric semi-trucks with a range of 500 miles with a fleet of diesel trucks.
For the baseline case with 30% of fleet requiring battery pack replacements and a price differential
of US\$50,000, we find a payback period of about 3 years. Based on sensitivity analysis, we find that
the fraction of the fleet that requires battery pack replacements is a major factor. For the case
with 100% replacement fraction, the payback period could be as high as 5-6 years. We identify the
price of electricity as the second most important variable, where a price of US$0.14/kWh, the payback
period could go up to 5 years. Electric semi-trucks are expected to lead to savings due to reduced
repairs and magnitude of these savings could play a crucial role in the payback period as well. With
increased penetration of autonomous vehicles, the annual mileage of semi-trucks could substantially
increase and this heavily sways in favor of electric semi-trucks, bringing down the payback period
to around 2 years at an annual mileage of 120,000 miles. There is an undeniable economic case for electric
semi-trucks and developing battery packs with longer cycle life and higher specific energy would
make this case even stronger.
