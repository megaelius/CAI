The emerging technology enabling autonomy in vehicles has led to a variety of new problems in transportation
networks. In particular, challenges exist in guaranteeing safety and optimizing traffic flow
when the transportation network is under heterogeneous use: when cars of differing levels of autonomy
co-exist on the same roads. Problems involving heterogeneous use of transportation networks have
diverged into two major techniques: one leveraging only local interactions between cars benefiting
the vehicles locally, and the other leveraging only global control techniques benefiting the traffic
network. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two paradigms. Our key insight
is that the micro level interactions between the vehicles can in fact inform and affect the global
behavior of the network, and vice versa. To this end, we utilize features of high levels of autonomy
such as platooning to inform low-level controllers that incorporate the interaction between the
vehicles. We will examine a high-level queuing framework to study the capacity of a transportation
network, and then outline a lower-level control framework that leverages local interactions between
cars to achieve a more efficient traffic flow via intelligent reordering of the cars. Such reorderings
can be enforced by leveraging the interaction between autonomous and human-driven cars. We present
a novel algorithm to show that the local actions of the autonomous cars on the road can initiate optimal
orderings for the global properties in spite of randomly allocated initial ordering of the vehicles.
We showcase our algorithm using a simulated mixed-autonomy traffic network, where we illustrate
the re-ordering in action.
