Dynamic taint analysis (DTA) is widely used by various applications to track information flow during
runtime execution. Existing DTA techniques use rule-based taint-propagation, which is neither
accurate (i.e., high false positive) nor efficient (i.e., large runtime overhead). It is hard to
specify taint rules for each operation while covering all corner cases correctly. Moreover, the
overtaint and undertaint errors can accumulate during the propagation of taint information across
multiple operations. Finally, rule-based propagation requires each operation to be inspected
before applying the appropriate rules resulting in prohibitive performance overhead on large
real-world applications. In this work, we propose NEUTAINT, a novel end-to-end approach to track
information flow using neural program embeddings. The neural program embeddings model the target's
programs computations taking place between taint sources and sinks, which automatically learns
the information flow by observing a diverse set of execution traces. To perform lightweight and
precise information flow analysis, we utilize saliency maps to reason about most influential sources
for different sinks. NEUTAINT constructs two saliency maps, a popular machine learning approach
to influence analysis, to summarize both coarse-grained and fine-grained information flow in
the neural program embeddings. We compare NEUTAINT with 3 state-of-the-art dynamic taint analysis
tools. The evaluation results show that NEUTAINT can achieve 68% accuracy, on average, which is
10% improvement while reducing 40 times runtime overhead over the second-best taint tool Libdft
on 6 real world programs. NEUTAINT also achieves 61% more edge coverage when used for taint-guided
fuzzing indicating the effectiveness of the identified influential bytes.
