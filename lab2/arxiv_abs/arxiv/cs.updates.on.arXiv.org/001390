Non-linear, especially convex, objective functions have been extensively studied in recent years
in which approaches relies crucially on the convexity property of cost functions. In this paper,
we present primal-dual approaches based on configuration linear programs to design competitive
online algorithms for problems with arbitrarily-grown objective. This approach is particularly
appropriate for non-linear (non-convex) objectives in online setting. We first present a simple
greedy algorithm for a general cost-minimization problem. The competitive ratio of the algorithm
is characterized by the mean of a notion, called smoothness, which is inspired by a similar concept
in the context of algorithmic game theory. The algorithm gives optimal (up to a constant factor)
competitive ratios while applying to different contexts such as network routing, vector scheduling,
energy-efficient scheduling and non-convex facility location. Next, we consider the online $0-1$
covering problems with non-convex objective. Building upon the resilient ideas from the primal-dual
framework with configuration LPs, we derive a competitive algorithm for these problems. Our result
generalizes the online primal-dual algorithm developed recently by Azar et al. for convex objectives
with monotone gradients to non-convex objectives. The competitive ratio is now characterized
by a new concept, called local smoothness --- a notion inspired by the smoothness. Our algorithm
yields tight competitive ratio for the objectives such as the sum of $\ell_{k}$-norms and gives
competitive solutions for online problems of submodular minimization and some natural non-convex
minimization under covering constraints.
