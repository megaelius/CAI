We propose a secure computation solution for blockchain networks. The correctness of computation
is verifiable even under malicious majority condition using information-theoretic Message Authentication
Code (MAC), and the privacy is preserved using Secret-Sharing. With state-of-the-art multiparty
computation protocol and a layer2 solution, our privacy-preserving computation guarantees data
security on blockchain, cryptographically, while reducing the heavy-lifting computation job
to a few nodes. This breakthrough has several implications on the future of decentralized networks.
First, secure computation can be used to support Private Smart Contracts, where consensus is reached
without exposing the information in the public contract. Second, it enables data to be shared and
used in trustless network, without disclosing the raw data during data-at-use, where data ownership
and data usage is safely separated. Last but not least, computation and verification processes
are separated, which can be perceived as computational sharding, this effectively makes the transaction
processing speed linear to the number of participating nodes. Our objective is to deploy our secure
computation network as an layer2 solution to any blockchain system. Smart Contracts\cite{smartcontract}
will be used as bridge to link the blockchain and computation networks. Additionally, they will
be used as verifier to ensure that outsourced computation is completed correctly. In order to achieve
this, we first develop a general MPC network with advanced features, such as: 1) Secure Computation,
2) Off-chain Computation, 3) Verifiable Computation, and 4)Support dApps' needs like privacy-preserving
data exchange.
