Molecular interaction networks are powerful resources for the discovery. They are increasingly
used with machine learning methods to predict biologically meaningful interactions. While deep
learning on graphs has dramatically advanced the prediction prowess, current graph neural network
(GNN) methods are optimized for prediction on the basis of direct similarity between interacting
nodes. In biological networks, however, similarity between nodes that do not directly interact
has proved incredibly useful in the last decade across a variety of interaction networks. Here,
we present SkipGNN, a graph neural network approach for the prediction of molecular interactions.
SkipGNN predicts molecular interactions by not only aggregating information from direct interactions
but also from second-order interactions, which we call skip similarity. In contrast to existing
GNNs, SkipGNN receives neural messages from two-hop neighbors as well as immediate neighbors in
the interaction network and non-linearly transforms the messages to obtain useful information
for prediction. To inject skip similarity into a GNN, we construct a modified version of the original
network, called the skip graph. We then develop an iterative fusion scheme that optimizes a GNN using
both the skip graph and the original graph. Experiments on four interaction networks, including
drug-drug, drug-target, protein-protein, and gene-disease interactions, show that SkipGNN
achieves superior and robust performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 28.8\% of area
under the precision recall curve (PR-AUC). Furthermore, we show that unlike popular GNNs, SkipGNN
learns biologically meaningful embeddings and performs especially well on noisy, incomplete
interaction networks.
