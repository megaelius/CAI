While contemporary semantic search systems offer to improve classical keyword-based search,
they are not always adequate for complex domain specific information needs. The domain of prescription
drug abuse, for example, requires knowledge of both ontological concepts and 'intelligible constructs'
not typically modeled in ontologies. These intelligible constructs convey essential information
that include notions of intensity, frequency, interval, dosage and sentiments, which could be
important to the holistic needs of the information seeker. We present a hybrid approach to domain
specific information retrieval (or knowledge-aware search) that integrates ontology-driven
query interpretation with synonym-based query expansion and domain specific rules, to facilitate
search in social media. Our framework is based on a context-free grammar (CFG) that defines the query
language of constructs interpretable by the search system. The grammar provides two levels of semantic
interpretation: 1) a top-level CFG that facilitates retrieval of diverse textual patterns, which
belong to broad templates and 2) a low-level CFG that enables interpretation of certain specific
expressions that belong to such patterns. These low-level expressions occur as concepts from four
different categories of data: 1) ontological concepts, 2) concepts in lexicons (such as emotions
and sentiments), 3) concepts in lexicons with only partial ontology representation, called lexico-ontology
concepts (such as side effects and routes of administration (ROA)), and 4) domain specific expressions
(such as date, time, interval, frequency and dosage) derived solely through rules. Our approach
is embodied in a novel Semantic Web platform called PREDOSE developed for prescription drug abuse
epidemiology. Keywords: Knowledge-Aware Search, Ontology, Semantic Search, Background Knowledge,
