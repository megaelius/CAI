The exciting new technology known as mid-air haptics has been adopted by several industries including
Automotive and Entertainment, however it has yet to emerge in simulated pilot training or in real-life
flight decks. Full-flight simulators are expensive to manufacture, maintain and operate. Not
only that, each simulator is limited to one aircraft type, which is inefficient for the majority
of airlines that have several in service. With the growing trend in touchscreen instrumentation,
cockpit displays require the pilot's attention to be drawn away from their view out of the window.
But by using gesture recognition interfaces combined with mid-air haptic feedback, we can mitigate
this shortcoming while also adding another dimension to the existing technology for pilots already
familiar with using legacy cockpits, complete with traditional instrumentation. Meanwhile,
simulation environments using augmented and virtual reality technology offers quality immersive
training to the extent that pilots can go from hundreds of hours of simulated training to being responsible
for hundreds of lives on their very first flight. The software re-programmability and dynamic richness
afforded by mid-air haptic technologies combined with a basic full-motion platform could allow
for an interchange of instrumentation layouts thus enhancing simulation immersiveness and environments.
Finally, by borrowing and exploring concepts within the automotive sector, this concept paper
presents how flight deck design could evolve by adopting this technology. If pilot testimony suggests
that they can adapt to virtual objects, can this replace physical controls?
