Proteins biological function is tightly connected to its specific 3D structure. Prediction of
protein secondary structure is a crucial intermediate step towards elucidating its 3D structure
and function. The average accuracy of the previous machine learning approaches has hardly reached
beyond 80%. The possible underlying reasons are abstruse sequence structure relation, noise,
class imbalance and high dimensionality of encoding schemes which represent protein sequences.
In this paper, we have developed an accurate multi-component prediction machine to overcome challenges
of protein secondary structure prediction. The principal tenet behind the proposed approach is
to directly process amino-acid sequences to reveal deeper and, simultaneously, more biologically
meaningful sequence structure relation. Taking this approach, it is possible to prevent losing
rich information hidden in sequence data, which is biologically believed to be sufficient for structure
adoption. Additionally, it facilitates resolving the high dimensionality of the numerical representation
for protein sequences. Moreover, the multi-component designation can better address the high
complexity of the relation between sequence and structure. To pursue these objectives, we have
employed various components in our framework. The learning components of our framework are SVM
and fuzzy KNN along with edit kernel and a compound dissimilarity measure symbolized as e d. Also
a fuzzy aggregation pool and a biological altering module are utilized. Utilizing the popular RS126
dataset, our multi-component framework demonstrates a prediction accuracy of 87.29%. The proposed
framework is a solution whose effectiveness can be further improved via parameter optimization.
