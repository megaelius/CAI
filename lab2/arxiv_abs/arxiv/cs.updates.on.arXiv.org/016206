We present a new algorithm to solve the supervisory control problem over non-terminating processes
modeled as $\omega$-regular automata. A solution to the problem was obtained by Thistle in 1995
which uses complex manipulations of automata. This algorithm is notoriously hard to understand
and, to the best of our knowledge, has never been implemented. We show a new solution to the problem
through a reduction to reactive synthesis. A naive, and incorrect, approach reduces the supervisory
control problem to a reactive synthesis problem that asks for a control strategy which ensures the
given specification if the plant behaves in accordance to its liveness properties. This is insufficient.
A correct control strategy might not fulfill the specification but force the plant to invalidate
its liveness property. To prevent such solutions, supervisory control additionally requires
that the controlled system is non-conflicting: any finite word compliant with the supervisor should
be extendable to a word satisfying the plants' liveness properties. To capture this additional
requirement, our solution goes through obliging games instead. An obliging game has two requirements:
a strong winning condition as in reactive synthesis and a weak winning condition. A strategy is winning
if it satisfies the strong condition and additionally, every partial play can be extended to satisfy
the weak condition. Obliging games can be reduced to $\omega$-regular reactive synthesis, for
which symbolic algorithms exist. We reduce supervisor synthesis to obliging games. The strong
condition is an implication: if the plant behaves in accordance with its liveness properties, the
specification should also hold. The weak condition is the plants' liveness property.
