News articles capture a variety of topics about our society. They reflect not only the socioeconomic
activities that happened in our physical world, but also some of the cultures, human interests,
and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned
in news articles, and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence often
suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the relatedness may be under different
topics depending on the contents of the news articles. We consider the relatedness under different
topics as semantic relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic relatedness
between cities, yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles, it is very difficult, if not impossible,
for anyone to manually read them. This paper proposes a computational framework which can "read"
a large number of news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This framework
is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine learning process to identify
the main topics of news articles. We describe the overall structure of this framework and its individual
modules, and then apply it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering
the top 100 U.S. cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory visualization of the extracted
semantic relatedness under different topics and over multiple years. We also analyze the impact
of geographic distance on semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed
framework can be used to support large-scale content analysis in city network research.
