With the ever increasing size and costs of wind turbines, structural load minimization is crucial
to extend the turbine lifetime, and to minimize operation and maintenance expenses. In practice,
the turbine rotor has a mass imbalance, which induces a periodic and rotor-speed dependent tower
side-side excitation during below-rated operation. Operating at this frequency generally degrades
the expected structural life span, as the first tower natural frequency for larger turbines coincides
with a below-rated operational rotor speed, and the sideward direction has negligible aerodynamic
damping. To reduce this effect, earlier work has shown the effectiveness of active tower damping
control strategies using collective pitch control. A more passive approach is frequency skipping
by inclusion of speed exclusion zones, which avoids prolonged operation near the critical frequency.
However, neither of the methods incorporate a convenient way of performing a trade-off between
energy maximization and fatigue load minimization. Therefore, this paper introduces a quasi-linear
parameter varying model predictive control (qLPV-MPC) scheme, exploiting the beneficial (convex)
properties of a qLPV system description. The qLPV model is obtained by a modulation transformation
and augmented with a simple wind turbine model. Results show the effectiveness of the algorithm
in synthetic and realistic simulations using the NREL 5-MW reference wind turbine in high-fidelity
simulation code. Prolonged rotor speed operation at the tower natural frequency is prevented,
whereas when the trade-off is in favor of energy production, the algorithm decides to rapidly pass
over the tower natural frequency to attain higher rotor speeds and power production rates.
