"United we stand, divided we fall" is a well known saying. We are living in the era of virtual collaborations.
Advancement on conceptual and technological level has enhanced the way people communicate. Everything-as-a-Service
once a dream, now becoming a reality. Problem nature has also been changed over the time. Today, e-Collaborations
are applied to all the domains possible. Extensive data and computing resources are in need and assistance
from human experts is also becoming essential. This puts a great responsibility on Information
Technology (IT) researchers and developers to provide generic platforms where user can easily
communicate and solve their problems. To realize this concept, distributed computing has offered
many paradigms, e.g. cluster, grid, cloud computing. Virtual Organization (VO) is a logical orchestration
of globally dispersed resources to achieve common goals. Existing paradigms and technology are
used to form Virtual Organization, but lack of standards remained a critical issue for last two decades.
Our research endeavor focuses on developing a design blueprint for Virtual Organization building
process. The proposed standardization process is a two phase activity. First phase provides requirement
analysis and the second phase presents a Reference Architecture for Virtual Organization (RAVO).
This form of standardization is chosen to accommodate both technological and paradigm shift. We
categorize our efforts in two parts. First part consists of a pattern to identify the requirements
and components of a Virtual Organization. Second part details a generic framework based on the concept
of Everything-as-a-Service.
