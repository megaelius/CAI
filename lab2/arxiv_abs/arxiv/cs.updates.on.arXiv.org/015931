Place-based accessibility measures, such as the gravity-based model, are widely applied to study
the spatial accessibility of workers to job opportunities in cities. However, gravity-based measures
often suffer from three main limitations: (1) they are sensitive to the spatial configuration and
scale of the units of analysis, which are not specifically designed for capturing job accessibility
patterns and are often too coarse; (2) they omit the temporal dynamics of job opportunities and workers
in the calculation, instead assuming that they remain stable over time; and (3) they do not lend themselves
to dynamic geovisualization techniques. In this paper, a new methodological framework for measuring
and visualizing place-based job accessibility in space and time is presented that overcomes these
three limitations. First, discretization and dasymetric mapping approaches are used to disaggregate
counts of jobs and workers over specific time intervals to a fine-scale grid. Second, Shen (1998)
gravity-based accessibility measure is modified to account for temporal fluctuations in the spatial
distributions of the supply of jobs and the demand of workers and is used to estimate hourly job accessibility
at each cell. Third, a four-dimensional volumetric rendering approach is employed to integrate
the hourly job access estimates into a space-time cube environment, which enables the users to interactively
visualize the space-time job accessibility patterns. The integrated framework is demonstrated
in the context of a case study of the Tampa Bay region of Florida. The findings demonstrate the value
of the proposed methodology in job accessibility analysis and the policy-making process.
