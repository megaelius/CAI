The classic Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism ensures incentive compatibility, i.e., that
truth-telling of all agents is a dominant strategy, for a static one-shot game. However, in a dynamic
environment that unfolds over time, the agents' intertemporal payoffs depend on the expected future
controls and payments, and a direct extension of the VCG mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee
incentive compatibility. In fact, it does not appear to be feasible to construct mechanisms that
ensure the dominance of dynamic truth-telling for agents comprised of general stochastic dynamic
systems. The contribution of this paper is to show that such a dynamic stochastic extension does
exist for the special case of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) agents with a careful construction
of a sequence of layered payments over time. For a set of LQG agents, we propose a modified layered
version of the VCG mechanism for payments that decouples the intertemporal effect of current bids
on future payoffs, and prove that truth-telling of dynamic states forms a dominant strategy if system
parameters are known and agents are rational. An important example of a problem needing such optimal
dynamic coordination of stochastic agents arises in power systems where an Independent System
Operator (ISO) has to ensure balance of generation and consumption at all time instants, while ensuring
social optimality. The challenge is to determine a bidding scheme between all agents and the ISO
that maximizes social welfare, while taking into account the stochastic dynamic models of agents,
since renewable energy resources such as solar/wind are stochastic and dynamic in nature, as are
consumptions by loads which are influenced by factors such as local temperatures and thermal inertias
of facilities.
