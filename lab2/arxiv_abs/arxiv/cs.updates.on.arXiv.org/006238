In this paper authors are going to present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based algorithm in Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT) as a safety compliance layer for human in loop system. Though some industries
are moving towards Industry 4.0 and attempting to automate the systems as much as possible by using
robots, still human in loop systems are very common in developing countries like India. When ever
there is a need for human machine interaction, there is a scope of health hazard. In this work we have
developed a system for one such industry using MDP. The proposed algorithm used in this system learned
the probability of state transition from experience as well as the system is adaptable to new changes
by incorporating the concept of transfer learning. The system was evaluated on the data set obtained
from 39 sensors connected to a computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine pushing data every
second in a 24x7 scenario. The state changes are typically instructed by a human which subsequently
lead to some intentional or unintentional mistakes and errors. The proposed system raises an alarm
for the operator to warn which he may or may not overlook depending on his own perception about the
present condition of the system. Repeated ignorance of the operator for a particular state transition
warning guides the system to retrain the model. We observed 95.61% alarms raised by the said system
are taken care of by the operator. 3.2% alarms are coming from the changes in the system which in turn
used to retrain the model and 1.19% alarms are false alarms. We could not compute the error coming
from the mistake performed by the human operator as there is no ground truth available for that.
