Puerto Rico suffered severe damage from the category 5 hurricane (Maria) in September 2017. Total
monetary damages are estimated to be ~92 billion USD, the third most costly tropical cyclone in US
history. The response to this damage has been tempered and slow moving, with recent estimates placing
45% of the population without power three months after the storm. Consequently, we developed a unique
data-fusion mapping approach called the Urban Development Index (UDI) and new open source tool,
Comet Time Series (CometTS), to analyze the recovery of electricity and infrastructure in Puerto
Rico. Our approach incorporates a combination of time series visualizations and change detection
mapping to create depictions of power or infrastructure loss. It also provides a unique independent
assessment of areas that are still struggling to recover. For this workflow, our time series approach
combines nighttime imagery from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared
Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP VIIRS), multispectral imagery from two Landsat satellites, US Census
data, and crowd-sourced building footprint labels. Based upon our approach we can identify and
evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to pre-storm levels, 2) the location of potentially
damaged infrastructure that has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without
power over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across the island indicate
that 13.9% +/- ~5.6% of persons still lack power and/or that 13.2% +/- ~5.3% of infrastructure has
been lost. In comparison, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority states that less than 1% of their
customers still are without power.
