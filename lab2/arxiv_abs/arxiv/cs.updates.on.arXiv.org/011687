In this paper, a binaural beamforming algorithm for hearing aid applications is introduced.The
beamforming algorithm is designed to be robust to some error in the estimate of the target speaker
direction. The algorithm has two main components: a robust target linearly constrained minimum
variance (TLCMV) algorithm based on imposing two constraints around the estimated direction of
the target signal, and a post-processor to help with the preservation of binaural cues. The robust
TLCMV provides a good level of noise reduction and low level of target distortion under realistic
conditions. The post-processor enhances the beamformer abilities to preserve the binaural cues
for both diffuse-like background noise and directional interferers (competing speakers), while
keeping a good level of noise reduction. The introduced algorithm does not require knowledge or
estimation of the directional interferers' directions nor the second-order statistics of noise-only
components. The introduced algorithm requires an estimate of the target speaker direction, but
it is designed to be robust to some deviation from the estimated direction. Compared with recently
proposed state-of-the-art methods, comprehensive evaluations are performed under complex realistic
acoustic scenarios generated in both anechoic and mildly reverberant environments, considering
a mismatch between estimated and true sources direction of arrival. Mismatch between the anechoic
propagation models used for the design of the beamformers and the mildly reverberant propagation
models used to generate the simulated directional signals is also considered. The results illustrate
the robustness of the proposed algorithm to such mismatches.
