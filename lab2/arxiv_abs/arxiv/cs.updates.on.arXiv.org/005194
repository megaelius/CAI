Quantitative measurement of functional and anatomical traits of 4D tongue motion in the course
of speech or other lingual behaviors remains a major challenge in scientific research and clinical
applications. Here, we introduce a statistical multimodal atlas of 4D tongue motion using healthy
subjects, which enables a combined quantitative characterization of tongue motion in a reference
anatomical configuration. This atlas framework, termed Speech Map, combines cine- and tagged-MRI
in order to provide both the anatomic reference and motion information during speech. Our approach
involves a series of steps including (1) construction of a common reference anatomical configuration
from cine-MRI, (2) motion estimation from tagged-MRI, (3) transformation of the motion estimations
to the reference anatomical configuration, and (4) computation of motion quantities such as Lagrangian
strain. Using this framework, the anatomic configuration of the tongue appears motionless, while
the motion fields and associated strain measurements change over the time course of speech. In addition,
to form a succinct representation of the high-dimensional and complex motion fields, principal
component analysis is carried out to characterize the central tendencies and variations of motion
fields of our speech tasks. Our proposed method provides a platform to quantitatively and objectively
explain the differences and variability of tongue motion by illuminating internal motion and strain
that have so far been intractable. The findings are used to understand how tongue function for speech
is limited by abnormal internal motion and strain in glossectomy patients.
