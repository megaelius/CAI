Purpose: Develop AI-based automated CT image analysis tools for detection, quantification, and
tracking of Coronavirus; demonstrate they can differentiate coronavirus patients from non-patients.
Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected
areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying
and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple
retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected
COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time
using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international
patients (China and U.S). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus
cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control
and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time
analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller
opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map
or a 3D volume display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over time.
Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a larger population, demonstrated
that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus
as well as quantification and tracking of disease burden.
