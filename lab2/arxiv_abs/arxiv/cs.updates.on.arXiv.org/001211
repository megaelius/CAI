Device-free localization plays an important role in many ubiquitous applications. Among the different
technologies proposed, Wi-Fi based technology using commercial devices has attracted much attention
due to its low cost, ease of deployment, and high potential for accurate localization. Existing
solutions use either fingerprints that require labor-intensive radio-map survey and updates,
or models constructed from empirical studies with dense deployment of Wi-Fi transceivers. In this
work, we explore the Fresnel Zone Theory in physics and propose a generic Fresnel Penetration Model
(FPM), which reveals the linear relationship between specific Fresnel zones and multicarrier
Fresnel phase difference, along with the Fresnel phase offset caused by static multipath environments.
We validate FPM in both outdoor and complex indoor environments. Furthermore, we design a multicarrier
FPM based device-free localization system (MFDL), which overcomes a number of practical challenges,
particularly the Fresnel phase difference estimation and phase offset calibration in multipath-rich
indoor environments. Extensive experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art
work (LiFS), our MFDL system achieves better localization accuracy with much fewer number of Wi-Fi
transceivers. Specifically, using only three transceivers, the median localization error of
MFDL is as low as 45$cm$ in an outdoor environment of 36$m^2$, and 55$cm$ in indoor settings of 25$m^2$.
Increasing the number of transceivers to four allows us to achieve 75$cm$ median localization error
in a 72$m^2$ indoor area, compared with the 1.1$m$ median localization error achieved by LiFS using
11 transceivers in a 70$m^2$ area.
