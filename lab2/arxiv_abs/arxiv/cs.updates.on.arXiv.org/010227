As applications become more distributed to improve user experience and offer higher availability,
businesses rely on geographically dispersed datacenters that host such applications more than
ever. Dedicated inter-datacenter networks have been built that provide high visibility into the
network status and flexible control over traffic forwarding to offer quality communication across
the instances of applications hosted on many datacenters. These networks are relatively small,
with tens to hundreds of nodes and are managed by the same organization that operates the datacenters
which make centralized traffic engineering feasible. Using coordinated data transmission from
the services and routing over the inter-datacenter network, one can optimize the network performance
according to a variety of utility functions that take into account data transfer deadlines, network
capacity consumption, and transfer completion times. In this dissertation, we study techniques
and algorithms for fast and efficient data transfers across geographically dispersed datacenters
over the inter-datacenter networks. We discuss different forms and properties of inter-datacenter
transfers and present a generalized optimization framework to maximize an operator selected utility
function. Next, in the several chapters that follow, we study, in detail, the problems of admission
control for transfers with deadlines and inter-datacenter multicast transfers. For the admission
control problem, our solutions offer significant speed up in the admission control process while
offering almost identical performance in the total traffic admitted into the network. For the bulk
multicasting problem, our techniques enable significant performance gain in receiver completion
times with low computational complexity, which makes them highly applicable to inter-datacenter
networks.
