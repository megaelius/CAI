An easily moving and safe transportation is an indicator in any country in the world of economic growth
and well-being. For the past 100 years, innovation within the automotive sector has brought major
technological advances leading to safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles. But for the most
time since the inception of the moving assembly line for vehicle production by Henry Ford, the changes
have been incremental / evolutionary. Thanks to the new possibilities due to the IT / wireless revolution,
the automotive industry appears to be on the cusp of revolutionary change with potential to dramatically
reshape not just the competitive landscape but also the way we interact with vehicles, and indeed
the future design of our roads and cities. Apart from connected personal mobility, vehicles are
also envisioned to provide Value Added Services (VAS) such as autonomous driving via Vehicle-to-Vehicle
(V2V) and Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), electric load balancing via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)
solutions, communication solutions using Visible Light Communications (VLC) etc. The development
and evaluation of vehicular VAS requires a modular and scalable multidisciplinary simulation
platform. In this paper we propose a novel simulation platform named Cyber-Automotive Simulation
\& Evaluation Platform (CASEP). The purpose of CASEP is to evaluate and visualize the gains of various
vehicular VAS with special emphasis on commercial vehicle VAS. The use cases are evaluated with
respect to the mission-specific performance indicators, thereby providing usable metrics for
optimization. The visualization platform is being developed using the UNITY 3D engine, thereby
enabling intuitive interaction as in real physics-based games
