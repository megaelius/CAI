Face de-identification algorithms have been developed in response to the prevalent use of public
video recordings and surveillance cameras. Here, we evaluated the success of identity masking
in the context of monitoring drivers as they actively operate a motor vehicle. We studied the effectiveness
of eight de-identification algorithms using human perceivers and a state-of-the-art deep convolutional
neural network (CNN). We used a standard face recognition experiment in which human subjects studied
high-resolution (studio-style) images to learn driver identities. Subjects were tested subsequently
on their ability to recognize those identities in low-resolution videos depicting the drivers
operating a motor vehicle. The videos were in either unmasked format, or were masked by one of the
eight de-identification algorithms. All masking algorithms lowered identification accuracy
substantially, relative to the unmasked video. In all cases, identifications were made with stringent
decision criteria indicating the subjects had low confidence in their decisions. When matching
the identities in high-resolution still images to those in the masked videos, the CNN performed
at chance. Next, we examined CNN performance on the same task, but using the unmasked videos and their
masked counterparts. In this case, the network scored surprisingly well on a subset of mask conditions.
We conclude that carefully tested de-identification approaches, used alone or in combination,
can be an effective tool for protecting the privacy of individuals captured in videos. We note that
no approach is equally effective in masking all stimuli, and that future work should examine possible
methods for determining the most effective mask per individual stimulus.
