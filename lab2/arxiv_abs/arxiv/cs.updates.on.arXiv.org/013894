As online tracking continues to grow, existing anti-tracking and fingerprinting detection techniques
that require significant manual input must be augmented. Heuristic approaches to fingerprinting
detection are precise but must be carefully curated. Supervised machine learning techniques proposed
for detecting tracking require manually generated label-sets. Seeking to overcome these challenges,
we present a semi-supervised machine learning approach for detecting fingerprinting scripts.
Our approach is based on the core insight that fingerprinting scripts have similar patterns of API
access when generating their fingerprints, even though their access patterns may not match exactly.
Using this insight, we group scripts by their JavaScript (JS) execution traces and apply a semi-supervised
approach to detect new fingerprinting scripts. We detail our methodology and demonstrate its ability
to identify the majority of scripts ($\geqslant$94.9%) identified by existing heuristic techniques.
We also show that the approach expands beyond detecting known scripts by surfacing candidate scripts
that are likely to include fingerprinting. Through an analysis of these candidate scripts we discovered
fingerprinting scripts that were missed by heuristics and for which there are no heuristics. In
particular, we identified over one hundred device-class fingerprinting scripts present on hundreds
of domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time device-class fingerprinting has
been measured in the wild. These successes illustrate the power of a sparse vector representation
and semi-supervised learning to complement and extend existing tracking detection techniques.
