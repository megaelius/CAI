Most information systems store data by modifying the local state of matter, in the hope that atomic
(or sub-atomic) local interactions would stabilize the state for a sufficiently long time, thereby
allowing later recovery. In this work we initiate the study of information retention in locally-interacting
systems. The evolution in time of the interacting particles is modeled via the stochastic Ising
model (SIM). The initial spin configuration $X_0$ serves as the user-controlled input. The output
configuration $X_t$ is produced by running $t$ steps of the Glauber chain. Our main goal is to evaluate
the information capacity $I_n(t)\triangleq\max_{p_{X_0}}I(X_0;X_t)$ when the time $t$ scales
with the size of the system $n$. For the zero-temperature SIM on the two-dimensional $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$
grid and free boundary conditions, it is easy to show that $I_n(t) = \Theta(n)$ for $t=O(n)$. In addition,
we show that on the order of $\sqrt{n}$ bits can be stored for infinite time in striped configurations.
The $\sqrt{n}$ achievability is optimal when $t\to\infty$ and $n$ is fixed. One of the main results
of this work is an achievability scheme that stores more than $\sqrt{n}$ bits (in orders of magnitude)
for superlinear (in $n$) times. The analysis of the scheme decomposes the system into $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
independent Z-channels whose crossover probability is found via the (recently rigorously established)
Lifshitz law of phase boundary movement. We also provide results for the positive but small temperature
regime. We show that an initial configuration drawn according to the Gibbs measure cannot retain
more than a single bit for $t\geq e^{cn^{\frac{1}{4}+\epsilon}}$. On the other hand, when scaling
time with $\beta$, the stripe-based coding scheme (that stores for infinite time at zero temperature)
is shown to retain its bits for time that is exponential in $\beta$.
