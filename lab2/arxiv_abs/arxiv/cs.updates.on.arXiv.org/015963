The dynamic monitoring of commuting flows is crucial for improving transit systems in fast-developing
cities around the world. However, existing methodology to infer commuting originations and destinations
have to either rely on large-scale survey data, which is inherently expensive to implement, or on
Call Detail Records but based on ad-hoc heuristic assignment rules based on the frequency of appearance
at given locations. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to accurately infer the point of origin
and destinations of commuting flows based on individual's spatial-temporal patterns inferred
from Call Detail Records. Our project significantly improves the accuracy upon the heuristic assignment
rules popularly adopted in the literature. Starting with the historical data of geo-temporal travel
patterns for a panel of individuals, we create, for each person-location, a vector of probability
distribution capturing the likelihood that the person will appear in that location for a given the
time of day. Stacked in this way, the matrix of historical geo-temporal data enables us to apply Eigen-decomposition
and use unsupervised machine learning techniques to extract commonalities across locations for
the different groups of travelers, which ultimately allows us to make inferences and create labels,
such as home and work, on specific locations. Testing the methodology on real-world data with known
location labels shows that our method identifies home and workplaces with significant accuracy,
improving upon the most commonly used methods in the literature by 79% and 34%, respectively. Most
importantly, our methodology does not bear any significant computation burden and is easily scalable
and easily expanded to other real-world data with historical tracking.
