The problem of autonomous transportation in industrial scenarios is receiving a renewed interest
due to the way it can revolutionise internal logistics, especially in unstructured environments.
This paper presents a novel architecture allowing a robot to detect, localise, and track (possibly
multiple) pallets using machine learning techniques based on an on-board 2D laser rangefinder
only. The architecture is composed of two main components: the first stage is a pallet detector employing
a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) detector cascaded with a CNN-based
classifier; the second stage is a Kalman filter for localising and tracking detected pallets, which
we also use to defer commitment to a pallet detected in the first stage until sufficient confidence
has been acquired via a sequential data acquisition process. For fine-tuning the CNNs, the architecture
has been systematically evaluated using a real-world dataset containing 340 labeled 2D scans,
which have been made freely available in an online repository. Detection performance has been assessed
on the basis of the average accuracy over k-fold cross-validation, and it scored 99.58% in our tests.
Concerning pallet localisation and tracking, experiments have been performed in a scenario where
the robot is approaching the pallet to fork. Although data have been originally acquired by considering
only one pallet as per specification of the use case we consider, artificial data have been generated
as well to mimic the presence of multiple pallets in the robot workspace. Our experimental results
confirm that the system is capable of identifying, localising and tracking pallets with a high success
rate while being robust to false positives.
