Hyperspectral imagery collected from airborne or satellite sources inevitably suffers from spectral
variability, making it difficult for spectral unmixing to accurately estimate abundance maps.
The classical unmixing model, the linear mixing model (LMM), generally fails to handle this sticky
issue effectively. To this end, we propose a novel spectral mixture model, called the augmented
linear mixing model (ALMM), to address spectral variability by applying a data-driven learning
strategy in inverse problems of hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach models the main
spectral variability (i.e., scaling factors) generated by variations in illumination or typography
separately by means of the endmember dictionary. It then models other spectral variabilities caused
by environmental conditions (e.g., local temperature and humidity, atmospheric effects) and
instrumental configurations (e.g., sensor noise), as well as material nonlinear mixing effects,
by introducing a spectral variability dictionary. To effectively run the data-driven learning
strategy, we also propose a reasonable prior knowledge for the spectral variability dictionary,
whose atoms are assumed to be low-coherent with spectral signatures of endmembers, which leads
to a well-known low coherence dictionary learning problem. Thus, a dictionary learning technique
is embedded in the framework of spectral unmixing so that the algorithm can learn the spectral variability
dictionary and estimate the abundance maps simultaneously. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed
method in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.
