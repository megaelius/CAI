Reviewing radiology reports in emergency departments is an essential but laborious task. Timely
follow-up of patients with abnormal cases in their radiology reports may dramatically affect the
patient's outcome, especially if they have been discharged with a different initial diagnosis.
Machine learning approaches have been devised to expedite the process and detect the cases that
demand instant follow up. However, these approaches require a large amount of labeled data to train
reliable predictive models. Preparing such a large dataset, which needs to be manually annotated
by health professionals, is costly and time-consuming. This paper investigates a semi-supervised
learning framework for radiology report classification across three hospitals. The main goal
is to leverage clinical unlabeled data in order to augment the learning process where limited labeled
data is available. To further improve the classification performance, we also integrate a transfer
learning technique into the semi-supervised learning pipeline . Our experimental findings show
that (1) convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while being independent of any problem-specific
feature engineering, achieve significantly higher effectiveness compared to conventional supervised
learning approaches, (2) leveraging unlabeled data in training a CNN-based classifier reduces
the dependency on labeled data by more than 50% to reach the same performance of a fully supervised
CNN, and (3) transferring the knowledge gained from available labeled data in an external source
hospital significantly improves the performance of a semi-supervised CNN model over their fully
supervised counterparts in a target hospital.
