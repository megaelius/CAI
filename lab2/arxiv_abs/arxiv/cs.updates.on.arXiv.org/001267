We study the following version of cut sparsification. Given a large edge-weighted network $G$ with
$k$ terminal vertices, compress it into a smaller network $H$ with the same terminals, such that
every minimum terminal cut in $H$ approximates the corresponding one in $G$, up to a factor $q\geq
1$ that is called the quality. (The case $q=1$ is known also as a mimicking network). We provide new
insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts, leading to new results for cut sparsifiers
of planar graphs. Our first contribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which
we call elementary, that generates all the others. Consequently, $H$ is a cut sparsifier if and only
if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to this factor $q$). This structural characterization
lead to improved bounds on the size of $H$. For example, it improve the bound of mimicking-network
size for planar graphs into a near-optimal one. Our second and main contribution is to refine the
known bounds in terms of $\gamma=\gamma(G)$, which is defined as the minimum number of faces that
are incident to all the terminals in a planar graph $G$. We prove that the number of elementary terminal
cuts is $O((2k/\gamma)^{2\gamma})$ (compared to $O(2^k)$ terminal cuts), and furthermore obtain
a mimicking-network of size $O(\gamma 2^{2\gamma} k^4)$, which is near-optimal as a function of
$\gamma$. In the analysis we break the elementary terminal cuts into fragments, and count them carefully.
Our third contribution is a duality between cut sparsification and distance sparsification for
certain planar graphs, when the sparsifier $H$ is required to be a minor of $G$. This duality connects
problems that were previously studied separately, implying new results, new proofs of known results,
and equivalences between open gaps.
