Oblivious RAM (ORAM) and private information retrieval (PIR) are classic cryptographic primitives
used to hide the access pattern to data whose storage has been outsourced to an untrusted server.
Unfortunately, both primitives require considerable overhead compared to plaintext access.
For large-scale storage infrastructure with highly frequent access requests, the degradation
in response time and the exorbitant increase in resource costs incurred by either ORAM or PIR prevent
their usage. In an ideal scenario, a privacy-preserving storage protocols with small overhead
would be implemented for these heavily trafficked storage systems to avoid negatively impacting
either performance and/or costs. In this work, we study the problem of the best $\mathit{storage\
access\ privacy}$ that is achievable with only $\mathit{small\ overhead}$ over plaintext access.
To answer this question, we consider $\mathit{differential\ privacy\ access}$ which is a generalization
of the $\mathit{oblivious\ access}$ security notion that are considered by ORAM and PIR. Quite
surprisingly, we present strong evidence that constant overhead storage schemes may only be achieved
with privacy budgets of $\epsilon = \Omega(\log n)$. We present asymptotically optimal constructions
for differentially private variants of both ORAM and PIR with privacy budgets $\epsilon = \Theta(\log
n)$ with only $O(1)$ overhead. In addition, we consider a more complex storage primitive called
key-value storage in which data is indexed by keys from a large universe (as opposed to consecutive
integers in ORAM and PIR). We present a differentially private key-value storage scheme with $\epsilon
= \Theta(\log n)$ and $O(\log\log n)$ overhead. This construction uses a new oblivious, two-choice
hashing scheme that may be of independent interest.
