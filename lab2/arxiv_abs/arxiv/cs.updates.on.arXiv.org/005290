Climate zones are an established part of urban energy management. California is divided into 16
climate zones, for example, and each zone imposes different energy-related building standards
-- so for example different zones have different roofing standards. Although developed long ago,
these zones continue to shape urban policy. New climate zone definitions are now emerging in urban
settings. Both the County of Los Angeles and the US Department of Energy have recently adopted refined
zones -- for restructuring electricity rates, and for scoring home energy efficiency. Defining
new zones is difficult, however, because climates depend on variables that are difficult to map.
In this paper we show that Los Angeles climate zones can be inferred from energy use data. We have studied
residential electricity consumption (EC) patterns in Los Angeles data. This data permits identification
of geographical zones whose EC patterns are characteristically different from surrounding regions.
These regions have topographic boundaries in Los Angeles consistent with microclimates. Specifically,
our key finding is that EC-microclimate zones -- regions in which block groups have similar Electricity
Consumption patterns over time -- resemble environmental microclimate zones. Because they conform
to microclimates, but are based directly on EC data, these zones can be useful in urban energy management.
We also show how microclimates and household electricity consumption in Los Angeles are strongly
linked to socioeconomic variables like income and population density. These links permit data-driven
development of microclimate zones that support zone-specific modeling and improved energy policy.
