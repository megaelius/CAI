This work considers a line-of-sight underwater acoustic sensor network (UWASN) consisting of
$M$ underwater sensor nodes randomly deployed according to uniform distribution within a vertical
half-disc (the so-called trusted zone). The sensor nodes report their sensed data to a sink node
on water surface on a shared underwater acoustic (UWA) reporting channel in a time-division multiple-access
(TDMA) fashion, while an active-yet-invisible adversary (so-called Eve) is present in the close
vicinity who aims to inject malicious data into the system by impersonating some Alice node. To this
end, this work first considers an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) UWA channel, and proposes
a novel, multiple-features based, two-step method at the sink node to thwart the potential impersonation
attack by Eve. Specifically, the sink node exploits the noisy estimates of the distance, the angle
of arrival, and the location of the transmit node as device fingerprints to carry out a number of binary
hypothesis tests (for impersonation detection) as well as a number of maximum likelihood hypothesis
tests (for transmitter identification when no impersonation is detected). We provide closed-form
expressions for the error probabilities (i.e., the performance) of most of the hypothesis tests.
We then consider the case of a UWA with colored noise and frequency-dependent pathloss, and derive
a maximum-likelihood (ML) distance estimator as well as the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).
We then invoke the proposed two-step, impersonation detection framework by utilizing distance
as the sole feature. Finally, we provide detailed simulation results for both AWGN UWA channel and
the UWA channel with colored noise. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme is indeed
effective for a UWA channel with colored noise and frequency-dependent pathloss.
