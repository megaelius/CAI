One of the first attempts to set a solid theoretical foundation for extending the content of relational
databases with incomplete information was the fuzzy relational model by Buckles and Petry. This
structure was based on two generalizations of the traditional relational model: (1) A tuple component
can be any subset of the corresponding domain, rather than a single element and (2) A similarity relation
is defined on each domain. This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry and
max-min transitivity, thus having the equality relation as a special case. This generalization
keeps two key properties of the relational model - that no two different tuples represent the same
information and that the application of any operation of the relation algebra has a unique result.
Shenoi and Melton generalized this model and showed how the existence of equivalence classes over
the attribute domains can also be preserved with a relation that only satisfies the properties of
reflexivity and symmetry (proximity relation). The motivation for this generalization is the
strictness of the max-min transitivity property of similarity relations, which complicates the
construction of this relation for some domain types. An important characteristic of the Shenoi-Melton
model is the dependence of the equivalence classes upon the current content of the database. This
characteristic, together with the way the equivalence relation is constructed by the proximity
relation, can lead to the equivalence classes that don't correspond well with some database query
types. Here we will present a different way of forming the equivalence classes over the attribute
domains in fuzzy relational databases in which they depend only on the attribute domain and not on
the current database state. We will also show a simple method for automatic construction of proximity
relations over some domain types.
