The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted
tremendous interests from both the research communities and the industry. The blockchain network
was originated in the Internet finical sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional
data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized
data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular,
the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability and self-organization are
primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks.
This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized
consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this survey, we provide a systematic vision of
the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of incentivized
consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols
is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of
incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review
on the strategy adoption for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone
networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging applications of the
blockchain networks in a wide range of areas. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus
mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol
design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.
