Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) is widely used to complement
ultrasound examinations and x-ray mammography during the early detection and diagnosis of breast
cancer. However, images generated by various MRI scanners (e.g. GE Healthcare vs Siemens) differ
both in intensity and noise distribution, preventing algorithms trained on MRIs from one scanner
to generalize to data from other scanners successfully. We propose a method for image normalization
to solve this problem. MRI normalization is challenging because it requires both normalizing intensity
values and mapping between the noise distributions of different scanners. We utilize a cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network to learn a bidirectional mapping between MRIs produced by GE Healthcare
and Siemens scanners. This allows us learning the mapping between two different scanner types without
matched data, which is not commonly available. To ensure the preservation of breast shape and structures
within the breast, we propose two technical innovations. First, we incorporate a mutual information
loss with the CycleGAN architecture to ensure that the structure of the breast is maintained. Second,
we propose a modified discriminator architecture which utilizes a smaller field-of-view to ensure
the preservation of finer details in the breast tissue. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
show that the second proposed method was able to consistently preserve a high level of detail in the
breast structure while also performing the proper intensity normalization and noise mapping.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully learn a bidirectional mapping
between MRIs produced by different vendors, potentially enabling improved accuracy of downstream
computational algorithms for diagnosis and detection of breast cancer.
