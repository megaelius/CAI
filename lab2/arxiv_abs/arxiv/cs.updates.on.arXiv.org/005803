Symmetric tensor decomposition is an important problem with applications in several areas for
example signal processing, statistics, data analysis and computational neuroscience. It is equivalent
to Waring's problem for homogeneous polynomials, that is to write a homogeneous polynomial in $n$
variables of degree $D$ as a sum of $D$-th powers of linear forms, using the minimal number of summands.
This minimal number is called the \emph{rank} of the polynomial/tensor. We focus on decomposing
binary forms, a problem that corresponds to the decomposition of symmetric tensors of dimension
$2$ and order $D$. Under this formulation, the problem finds its roots in invariant theory where
the decompositions are known as canonical forms. In this context many different algorithms were
proposed. We introduce a \emph{superfast} algorithm that improves the previous approaches with
results from \emph{structured linear algebra}. It achieves a \emph{softly linear} arithmetic
complexity bound. To the best of our knowledge, the previously known algorithms have at least quadratic
complexity bounds. Our algorithm computes a symbolic decomposition in $O(\mathtt{M}(D) \log(D))$
arithmetic operations, where $\mathtt{M}(D)$ is the complexity of multiplying two polynomials
of degree $D$. It is deterministic when the decomposition is unique. When the decomposition is not
unique, our algorithm is randomized. We present a Monte Carlo version of it and we show how to modify
it to a Las Vegas one, within the same complexity. From the symbolic decomposition, we approximate
the terms of the decomposition with an error of $2^{-\varepsilon}$, in $O\big(D \log^2(D)\big(\log^2(D)
+ \log(\varepsilon)\big)\big)$ arithmetic operations. We use results from \citet{kaltofen1989improved}
to bound the size of the representation of the coefficients involved in the decomposition and we
bound the algebraic degree of the problem by $\min(rank, D-rank+1)$. We show that this bound can
be tight. When the input polynomial has integer coefficients, our algorithm performs, up to poly-logarithmic
factors, $\widetilde{O}_B(D \ell + D^4 + D^3 \tau)$ bit operations, where $\tau$ is the maximum
bitsize of the coefficients and $2^{-\ell}$ is the relative error of the terms in the decomposition.
