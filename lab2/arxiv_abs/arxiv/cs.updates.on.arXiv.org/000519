The word-frequency distribution of a text written by an author is well accounted for by a maximum
entropy distribution, the RGF (random group formation)-prediction. The RGF-distribution is
completely determined by the a priori values of the total number of words in the text (M), the number
of distinct words (N) and the number of repetitions of the most common word (k_max). It is here shown
that this maximum entropy prediction also describes a text written in Chinese characters. In particular
it is shown that although the same Chinese text written in words and Chinese characters have quite
differently shaped distributions, they are nevertheless both well predicted by their respective
three a priori characteristic values. It is pointed out that this is analogous to the change in the
shape of the distribution when translating a given text to another language. Another consequence
of the RGF-prediction is that taking a part of a long text will change the input parameters (M, N, k_max)
and consequently also the shape of the frequency distribution. This is explicitly confirmed for
texts written in Chinese characters. Since the RGF-prediction has no system-specific information
beyond the three a priori values (M, N, k_max), any specific language characteristic has to be sought
in systematic deviations from the RGF-prediction and the measured frequencies. One such systematic
deviation is identified and, through a statistical information theoretical argument and an extended
RGF-model, it is proposed that this deviation is caused by multiple meanings of Chinese characters.
The effect is stronger for Chinese characters than for Chinese words. The relation between Zipf's
law, the Simon-model for texts and the present results are discussed.
