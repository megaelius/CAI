Purpose: Probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (pCLE) enables performing an optical biopsy,
providing real-time microscopic images, via a probe. pCLE probes consist of multiple optical fibres
arranged in a bundle, which taken together generate signals in an irregularly sampled pattern.
Current pCLE reconstruction is based on interpolating irregular signals onto an over-sampled
Cartesian grid, using a naive linear interpolation. It was shown that Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) could improve pCLE image quality. Although classical CNNs were applied to pCLE, input data
were limited to reconstructed images in contrast to irregular data produced by pCLE. Methods: We
compare pCLE reconstruction and super-resolution (SR) methods taking irregularly sampled or
reconstructed pCLE images as input. We also propose to embed a Nadaraya-Watson (NW) kernel regression
into the CNN framework as a novel trainable CNN layer. Using the NW layer and exemplar-based super-resolution,
we design an NWNetSR architecture that allows for reconstructing high-quality pCLE images directly
from the irregularly sampled input data. We created synthetic sparse pCLE images to evaluate our
methodology. Results: The results were validated through an image quality assessment based on
a combination of the following metrics: Peak signal-to-noise ratio, the Structural Similarity
Index. Conclusion: Both dense and sparse CNNs outperform the reconstruction method currently
used in the clinic. The main contributions of our study are a comparison of sparse and dense approach
in pCLE image reconstruction, implementing trainable generalised NW kernel regression, and adaptation
of synthetic data for training pCLE SR.
