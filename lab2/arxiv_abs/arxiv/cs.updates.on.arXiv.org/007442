Image classification is a difficult machine learning task, where Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have been applied for over 20 years in order to solve the problem. In recent years, instead
of the traditional way of only connecting the current layer with its next layer, shortcut connections
have been proposed to connect the current layer with its forward layers apart from its next layer,
which has been proved to be able to facilitate the training process of deep CNNs. However, there are
various ways to build the shortcut connections, it is hard to manually design the best shortcut connections
when solving a particular problem, especially given the design of the network architecture is already
very challenging. In this paper, a hybrid evolutionary computation (EC) method is proposed to \textit{automatically}
evolve both the architecture of deep CNNs and the shortcut connections. Three major contributions
of this work are: Firstly, a new encoding strategy is proposed to encode a CNN, where the architecture
and the shortcut connections are encoded separately; Secondly, a hybrid two-level EC method, which
combines particle swarm optimisation and genetic algorithms, is developed to search for the optimal
CNNs; Lastly, an adjustable learning rate is introduced for the fitness evaluations, which provides
a better learning rate for the training process given a fixed number of epochs. The proposed algorithm
is evaluated on three widely used benchmark datasets of image classification and compared with
12 peer Non-EC based competitors and one EC based competitor. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms all of the peer competitors in terms of classification accuracy.
