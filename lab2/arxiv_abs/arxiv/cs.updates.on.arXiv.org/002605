We consider the computational complexity of finding a legal black pebbling of a DAG $G=(V,E)$ with
minimum cumulative cost. A black pebbling is a sequence $P_0,\ldots, P_t \subseteq V$ of sets of
nodes which must satisfy the following properties: $P_0 = \emptyset$ (we start off with no pebbles
on $G$), $\mathsf{sinks}(G) \subseteq \bigcup_{j \leq t} P_j$ (every sink node was pebbled at some
point) and $\mathsf{parents}\big(P_{i+1}\backslash P_i\big) \subseteq P_i$ (we can only place
a new pebble on a node $v$ if all of $v$'s parents had a pebble during the last round). The cumulative
cost of a pebbling $P_0,P_1,\ldots, P_t \subseteq V$ is $\mathsf{cc}(P) = | P_1| + \ldots + | P_t|$.
The cumulative pebbling cost is an especially important security metric for data-independent
memory hard functions, an important primitive for password hashing. Thus, an efficient (approximation)
algorithm would be an invaluable tool for the cryptanalysis of password hash functions as it would
provide an automated tool to establish tight bounds on the amortized space-time cost of computing
the function. We show that such a tool is unlikely to exist. In particular, we prove the following
results. (1) It is $\texttt{NP}\mbox{-}\texttt{Hard}$ to find a pebbling minimizing cumulative
cost. (2) The natural linear program relaxation for the problem has integrality gap $\tilde{O}(n)$,
where $n$ is the number of nodes in $G$. We conjecture that the problem is hard to approximate. (3)
We show that a related problem, find the minimum size subset $S\subseteq V$ such that $\textsf{depth}(G-S)
\leq d$, is also $\texttt{NP}\mbox{-}\texttt{Hard}$. In fact, under the unique games conjecture
there is no $(2-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm.
