Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerged mainly to improve road safety, traffic efficiency,
and passenger comfort. The performance of most VANET applications relies on the availability of
accurate and recent mobility-information, shared by neighboring vehicles. However, sharing
false mobility information can disrupt any potential VANET application. Misbehavior detection
is an important security component. However, existing misbehavior detection solutions lack considering
the high dynamicity of vehicular context which leads to low detection accuracy and high false alarms.
The use of predefined and static security thresholds are the main drawbacks of the existing solutions.
In this paper, a context-aware misbehavior detection scheme (CAMDS) is proposed using sequential
analysis of temporal and spatial properties of mobility information. A dynamic context reference
is constructed online and timely updated using statistical techniques. Firstly, the Kalman filter
algorithm is used to track the mobility information received from neighboring vehicles. Then,
the innovation errors of the Kalman filter are utilized to construct a temporal consistency assessment
model for each vehicle using Box-plot. Then, the Hampel filter is used to construct a spatial consistency
assessment model that represents the context reference model. Similarly, plausibility assessment
reference models are built online and timely updated using the Hampel filter and by utilizing the
consistency assessment reference model of neighboring information. Finally, a message is classified
as suspicious if its consistency and plausibility scores deviate much from the context reference
model. The proposed context-aware scheme achieved a 73% reduction in false Alarm rate while it achieves
a 37% improvement in the detection rate. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared
with the existing static solutions.
