Discovering and characterizing the large-scale topological features in empirical networks are
crucial steps in understanding how complex systems function. However, most existing methods used
to obtain the modular structure of networks suffer from serious problems, such as being oblivious
to the statistical evidence supporting the discovered patterns, which results in the inability
to separate actual structure from noise. In addition to this, one also observes a resolution limit
on the size of communities, where smaller but well-defined clusters are not detectable when the
network becomes large. This phenomenon occurs not only for the very popular approach of modularity
optimization, which lacks built-in statistical validation, but also for more principled methods
based on statistical inference and model selection, which do incorporate statistical validation
in a formally correct way. Here we construct a nested generative model that, through a complete description
of the entire network hierarchy at multiple scales, is capable of avoiding this limitation, and
enables the detection of modular structure at levels far beyond those possible with current approaches.
Even with this increased resolution, the method is based on the principle of parsimony, and is capable
of separating signal from noise, and thus will not lead to the identification of spurious modules
even on sparse networks. Furthermore, it fully generalizes other approaches in that it is not restricted
to purely assortative mixing patterns, directed or undirected graphs, and ad hoc hierarchical
structures such as binary trees. Despite its general character, the approach is tractable, and
can be combined with advanced techniques of community detection to yield an efficient algorithm
that scales well for very large networks.
