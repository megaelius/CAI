Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of hospital admissions in the US. Readmission within
30 days after a HF hospitalization is both a recognized indicator for disease progression and a source
of considerable financial burden to the healthcare system. Consequently, the identification
of patients at risk for readmission is a key step in improving disease management and patient outcome.
In this work, we used a large administrative claims dataset to (1)explore the systematic application
of neural network-based models versus logistic regression for predicting 30 days all-cause readmission
after discharge from a HF admission, and (2)to examine the additive value of patients' hospitalization
timelines on prediction performance. Based on data from 272,778 (49% female) patients with a mean
(SD) age of 73 years (14) and 343,328 HF admissions (67% of total admissions), we trained and tested
our predictive readmission models following a stratified 5-fold cross-validation scheme. Among
the deep learning approaches, a recurrent neural network (RNN) combined with conditional random
fields (CRF) model (RNNCRF) achieved the best performance in readmission prediction with 0.642
AUC (95% CI, 0.640-0.645). Other models, such as those based on RNN, convolutional neural networks
and CRF alone had lower performance, with a non-timeline based model (MLP) performing worst. A competitive
model based on logistic regression with LASSO achieved a performance of 0.643 AUC (95%CI, 0.640-0.646).
We conclude that data from patient timelines improve 30 day readmission prediction for neural network-based
models, that a logistic regression with LASSO has equal performance to the best neural network model
and that the use of administrative data result in competitive performance compared to published
approaches based on richer clinical datasets.
