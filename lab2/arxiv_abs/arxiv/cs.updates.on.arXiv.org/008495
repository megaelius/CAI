Behavior is characterized by sequences of goal-oriented conducts, such as food uptake, socializing
and resting. Classically, one would define for each task a corresponding satisfaction level, with
the agent engaging, at a given time, in the activity having the lowest satisfaction level. Alternatively,
one may consider that the agent follows the overarching objective to generate sequences of distinct
activities. To achieve a balanced distribution of activities would then be the primary goal, and
not to master a specific task. In this setting, the agent would show two types of behaviors, task-oriented,
and task-searching phases, with the latter interseeding the former. We study the emergence of autonomous
task switching for the case of a simulated robot arm. Grasping one of several moving objects corresponds
in this setting to a specific activity. Overall, the arm should follow a given object temporarily
and then move away, in order to search for a new target and reengage. We show that this behavior can
be generated robustly when modeling the arm as an adaptive dynamical system. The dissipation function
is in this approach time dependent. The arm is in a dissipative state when searching for a nearby object,
dissipating energy on approach. Once close, the dissipation function starts to increase, with
the eventual sign change implying that the arm will take up energy and wander off. The resulting explorative
state ends when the dissipation function becomes again negative and the arm selects a new target.
We believe that our approach may be generalized to generate self-organized sequences of activities
in general.
