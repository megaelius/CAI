In this paper, we study the cell planning problem for a two-tier cellular network containing two
types of base stations (BSs)-- i.e. with fiber backhaul, referred to as wired BSs (W-BSs), and BSs
with wireless backhaul, referred to as unwired-BSs (U-BSs). In-band full-duplex wireless communications
is used to connect U-BSs and W-BSs. We propose an algorithm to determine the minimum number of W-BSs
and U-BSs to satisfy given cell and capacity coverage constraints. Furthermore, we apply our proposed
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to solve both cell planning and joint cell
and backhaul planning problem to minimize the cost of planning, while maximizing the coverage simultaneously.
Additionally, the considered cell planning program is developed into an optimization by including
the problem of minimizing the cost of fiber backhaul deployment. In order to analyze the performance
of the proposed algorithm, we study three different deployment scenarios based on different spatial
distributions of users and coverage areas. The results show the superiority of our proposed NSGA-II
algorithm for both cell planning and joint cell and backhaul planning to other well-known optimization
algorithms. The results also reveal that there is a trade-off between cell deployment costs and
SINR/rate coverage, and W-BSs are placed in congested areas to consume less resources for wireless
backhauls. Similarly, a trade-off between cell and fiber deployment costs and SINR/rate coverage
is observed in planning. We show that for realistic scenarios desirable solutions can be selected
from the Pareto front of the introduced multi-objective problem based on given cellular operator
policies.
