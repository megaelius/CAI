A reliable prediction of 3D protein structures from sequence data remains a big challenge due to
both theoretical and computational difficulties. We have previously shown that our kinetostatic
compliance method (KCM) implemented into the Protofold package can overcome some of the key difficulties
faced by other de novo structure prediction methods, such as the very small time steps required by
the molecular dynamics (MD) approaches or the very large number of samples needed by the Monte Carlo
(MC) sampling techniques. In this article, we improve the free energy formulation used in Protofold
by including the typically underrated entropic effects, imparted due to differences in hydrophobicity
of the chemical groups, which dominate the folding of most water-soluble proteins. In addition
to the model enhancement, we revisit the numerical implementation by redesigning the algorithms
and introducing efficient data structures that reduce the expected complexity from quadratic
to linear. Moreover, we develop and optimize parallel implementations of the algorithms on both
central and graphics processing units (CPU/GPU) achieving speed-ups up to two orders of magnitude
on the GPU. Our simulations are consistent with the general behavior observed in the folding process
in aqueous solvent, confirming the effectiveness of model improvements. We report on the folding
process at multiple levels; namely, the formation of secondary structural elements and tertiary
interactions between secondary elements or across larger domains. We also observe significant
enhancements in running times that make the folding simulation tractable for large molecules.
