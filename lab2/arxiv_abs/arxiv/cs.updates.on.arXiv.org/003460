Interactive proofs are a fundamental theoretical concept that has become increasingly widely
used as a framework to design efficient computation-outsourcing protocols. However, in all existing
interactive-proof systems with multiple provers, the provers' interests either perfectly align
(as in multi-prover interactive proofs) or directly conflict (as in refereed games). Neither of
these extremes truly capture the strategic nature of service providers in outsourcing applications.
How to design and analyze non-cooperative interactive proofs is an important open problem. In this
paper, we introduce a multi-prover interactive-proof model in which the provers are rational and
non-cooperative---each prover acts individually so as to maximize his own utility in the resulting
game. In contrast to refereed games, no prover is required to be honest. To model interactive protocols
with non-cooperative provers, we first define a new solution concept for extensive-form games
with imperfect information, strong sequential equilibrium. Our technical results focus on protocols
that provide strong utility gap guarantees, which are analogous to soundness gap in classic interactive
proofs. At a high level, a utility gap of u means that the protocol is robust against provers that may
not care about a utility loss of 1/u. We fully characterize the complexity of our proof system under
different utility gap guarantees. Our results imply that non-cooperative provers can be used to
handle adaptive oracle queries (unlike the cooperative rational provers studied previously),
which makes them more powerful whenever adaptive queries do not reduce to non-adaptive queries.
