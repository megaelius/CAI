Cortical plasticity is one of the main features that enable our capability to learn and adapt in our
environment. Indeed, the cerebral cortex has the ability to self-organize itself through two distinct
forms of plasticity: the structural plasticity that creates (sprouting) or cuts (pruning) synaptic
connections between neurons, and the synaptic plasticity that modifies the synaptic connections
strength. These mechanisms are very likely at the basis of an extremely interesting characteristic
of the human brain development: the multimodal association. [...] To model such a behavior, Edelman
and Damasio proposed respectively the Reentry and the Convergence Divergence Zone frameworks
where bi-directional neural communications can lead to both multimodal fusion (convergence)
and inter-modal activation (divergence). [...] In this paper, we build a brain-inspired neural
system based on the Reentry principles, using Self-Organizing Maps and Hebbian-like learning.
We propose and compare different computational methods for unsupervised learning and inference,
then quantify the gain of both convergence and divergence mechanisms in a multimodal classification
task. The divergence mechanism is used to label one modality based on the other, while the convergence
mechanism is used to improve the overall accuracy of the system. We perform our experiments on a constructed
written/spoken digits database and a DVS/EMG hand gestures database. Finally, we implement our
system on the Iterative Grid, a cellular neuromorphic architecture that enables distributed computing
with local connectivity. We show the gain of the so-called hardware plasticity induced by our model,
where the system's topology is not fixed by the user but learned along the system's experience through
self-organization.
