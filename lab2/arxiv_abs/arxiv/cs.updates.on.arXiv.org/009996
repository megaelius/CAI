This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. In today's computer architectures, moving data is considerably
more time- and energy consuming than computing on this data. One of the key performance optimizations
for any application is therefore to minimize data motion and maximize data reuse. Especially on
modern supercomputers with very complex and deep memory hierarchies, it is mandatory to take data
locality into account. Especially when targeting accelerators with directive systems like OpenACC
or OpenMP, identifying data scope, access type and data reuse are critical to minimize the data transfers
from and to the accelerator. Unfortunately, manually identifying data locality information in
complex code bases can be a time consuming task and tool support is therefore desirable. In this report
we summarize the results of a survey of currently available tools that support software developers
and performance engineers with data locality information in complex code bases like numerical
weather prediction (NWP) or climate simulation applications. Based on the survey results we then
recommend a tool and specify some extensions for a tool to solve the problems encountered in an NWP
application.
