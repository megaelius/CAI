Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have created new security challenges for critical infrastructures
due to their stealthy, dynamic, and adaptive natures. In this work, we aim to lay a game-theoretic
foundation by establishing a multi-stage Bayesian game framework to capture incomplete information
of deceptive APTs and their multi-stage multi-phase movement. The analysis of the perfect Bayesian
Nash equilibrium (PBNE) enables a prediction of attacker's behaviors and a design of defensive
strategies that can deter the adversaries and mitigate the security risks. A conjugate-prior method
allows online computation of the belief and reduces Bayesian update into an iterative parameter
update. The forwardly updated parameters are assimilated into the backward dynamic programming
computation to characterize a computationally tractable and time-consistent equilibrium solution
based on the expanded state space. The Tennessee Eastman (TE) process control problem is used as
a case study to demonstrate the dynamic game under the information asymmetry and show that APTs tend
to be stealthy and deceptive during their transitions in the cyber layer and behave aggressively
when reaching the targeted physical plant. The online update of the belief allows the defender to
learn the behavior of the attacker and choose strategic defensive actions that can thwart adversarial
behaviors and mitigate APTs. Numerical results illustrate the defender's tradeoff between the
immediate reward and the future expectation as well as the attacker's goal to reach an advantageous
system state while making the defender form a positive belief.
