Quality control is a fundamental component of many manufacturing processes, especially those
involving casting or welding. However, manual quality control procedures are often time-consuming
and error-prone. In order to meet the growing demand for high-quality products, the use of intelligent
visual inspection systems is becoming essential in production lines. Recently, Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance in both image classification and localization
tasks. In this article, a system is proposed for the identification of casting defects in X-ray images,
based on the Mask Region-based CNN architecture. The proposed defect detection system simultaneously
performs defect detection and segmentation on input images, making it suitable for a range of defect
detection tasks. It is shown that training the network to simultaneously perform defect detection
and defect instance segmentation, results in a higher defect detection accuracy than training
on defect detection alone. Transfer learning is leveraged to reduce the training data demands and
increase the prediction accuracy of the trained model. More specifically, the model is first trained
with two large openly-available image datasets before finetuning on a relatively small metal casting
X-ray dataset. The accuracy of the trained model exceeds state-of-the art performance on the GRIMA
database of X-ray images (GDXray) Castings dataset and is fast enough to be used in a production setting.
The system also performs well on the GDXray Welds dataset. A number of in-depth studies are conducted
to explore how transfer learning, multi-task learning, and multi-class learning influence the
performance of the trained system.
