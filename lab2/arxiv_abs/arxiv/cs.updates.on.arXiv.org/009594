We describe an algorithm for the exhaustive generation of non-isomorphic graphs with a given number
$k \ge 0$ of hamiltonian cycles, which is especially efficient for small $k$. Our main findings,
combining applications of this algorithm and existing algorithms with new theoretical results,
revolve around graphs containing exactly one hamiltonian cycle (1H) or exactly three hamiltonian
cycles (3H). Motivated by a classic result of Smith and recent work of Royle, we show that there exist
nearly cubic 1H graphs of order $n$ iff $n \ge 18$ is even. This gives the strongest form of a theorem
of Entringer and Swart, and sheds light on a question of Fleischner originally settled by Seamone.
We prove equivalent formulations of the conjecture of Bondy and Jackson that every planar 1H graph
contains two vertices of degree 2, verify it up to order 16, and show that its toric analogue does not
hold. We treat Thomassen's conjecture that every hamiltonian graph of minimum degree at least $3$
contains an edge such that both its removal and its contraction yield hamiltonian graphs. We also
verify up to order 21 the conjecture of Sheehan that there is no 4-regular 1H graph. Extending work
of Schwenk, we describe all orders for which cubic 3H triangle-free graphs exist. We verify up to
order $48$ Cantoni's conjecture that every planar cubic 3H graph contains a triangle, and show that
there exist infinitely many planar cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graphs with exactly four
hamiltonian cycles, thereby answering a question of Chia and Thomassen. Finally, complementing
work of Sheehan on 1H graphs of maximum size, we determine the maximum size of graphs containing exactly
one hamiltonian path and give, for every order $n$, the exact number of such graphs on $n$ vertices
and of maximum size.
