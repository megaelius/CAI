In the big data era, deep learning and intelligent data mining technique solutions have been applied
by researchers in various areas. Forecast and analysis of stock market data have represented an
essential role in today's economy, and a significant challenge to the specialist since the market's
tendencies are immensely complex, chaotic and are developed within a highly dynamic environment.
There are numerous researches from multiple areas intending to take on that challenge, and Machine
Learning approaches have been the focus of many of them. There are multiple models of Machine Learning
algorithms been able to obtain competent outcomes doing that class of foresight. This paper proposes
the implementation of a generative adversarial network (GAN), which is composed by a bi-directional
Long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network(CNN) referred as Bi-LSTM-CNN
to generate synthetic data that agree with existing real financial data so the features of stocks
with positive or negative trends can be retained to predict future trends of a stock. The novelty
of this proposed solution that distinct from previous solutions is that this paper introduced the
concept of a hybrid system (Bi-LSTM-CNN) rather than a sole LSTM model. It was collected data from
multiple stock markets such as TSX, SHCOMP, KOSPI 200 and the S&P 500, proposing an adaptative-hybrid
system for trends prediction on stock market prices, and carried a comprehensive evaluation on
several commonly utilized machine learning prototypes, and it is concluded that the proposed solution
approach outperforms preceding models. Additionally, during the research stage from preceding
works, gaps were found between investors and researchers who dedicated to the technical domain.
