Recommender systems are designed to help mitigate information overload users experience during
online shopping. Recent work explores neural language models to learn user and item representations
from user reviews and combines such representations with rating information. Most existing convolutional-based
neural models take pooling immediately after convolution and loses the interaction information
between the latent dimension of convolutional feature vectors along the way. Moreover, these models
usually take all feature vectors at higher levels as equal and do not take into consideration that
some features are more relevant to this specific user-item context. To bridge these gaps, this paper
proposes a convolutional quantum-like language model with mutual-attention for rating prediction
(ConQAR). By introducing a quantum-like density matrix layer, interactions between latent dimensions
of convolutional feature vectors are well captured. With the attention weights learned from the
mutual-attention layer, final representations of a user and an item absorb information from both
itself and its counterparts for making rating prediction. Experiments on two large datasets show
that our model outperforms multiple state-of-the-art CNN-based models. We also perform an ablation
test to analyze the independent effects of the two components of our model. Moreover, we conduct
a case study and present visualizations of the quantum probabilistic distributions in one user
and one item review document to show that the learned distributions capture meaningful information
about this user and item, and can be potentially used as textual profiling of the user and item.
