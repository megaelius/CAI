In recent years the explosion in the volumes of data being stored online has resulted in distributed
storage systems transitioning to erasure coding based schemes. Local Reconstruction Codes (LRCs)
have emerged as the codes of choice for these applications. An $(n,r,h,a,q)$-LRC is a $q$-ary code,
where encoding is as a two stage process. In the first stage, $h$ redundant parity symbols are generated
from $k$ data symbols. In the second stage, the $k+h$ symbols are partitioned into sets of size $r-a$
and each set is extended with $a$ redundant symbols using an MDS code to form a local group. Local groups
ensure that when at most $a$ coordinates are erased, any missing coordinate can be recovered by accessing
at most $r-a$ symbols. Also, if a larger number of coordinates is erased; then missing symbols can
be recovered by potentially accessing all remaining symbols. An $(n,r,h,a,q)$-LRC code as above
is Maximally Recoverable (MR), if it corrects all erasure patterns which are information theoretically
correctable given the presence of local groups. Obtaining MR LRCs over finite fields of minimal
size is important in practice and has been the goal of a line of work in coding theory. In this work we
make progress towards this goal. In particular, we show that when $a$ and $h$ are constant and $r$
may grow, for every maximally recoverable LRC, $q\geq \Omega_{a,h}\left(n\cdot r^{\min\{a,h-2\}}\right).$
Prior to our work, there was no super-linear lower bound known on the field size of MR LRCs for any setting
of parameters. We also give an optimal construction when there are two global parities ($h=2$) and
improve existing constructions when there are three global parities ($h=3$).
