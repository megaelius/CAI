Predicting the response of a specific cancer to a therapy is a major goal in modern oncology that should
ultimately lead to a personalised treatment. High-throughput screenings of potentially active
compounds against a panel of genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple
relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various computational approaches
have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on genomic features, while others have used the
chemical properties of the drugs to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary
approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of cancer cell lines to
drug treatment, quantified through IC50 values, based on both the genomic features of the cell lines
and the chemical properties of the considered drugs. Models predicted IC50 values in a 8-fold cross-validation
and an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.72 and 0.64 respectively.
Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy (R2 of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines
from a tissue not used in the training stage. Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental
design of drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC50 values rather than
experimentally measure them. The implications of our results go beyond virtual drug screening
design: potentially thousands of drugs could be probed in silico to systematically test their potential
efficacy as anti-tumour agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework
to identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful for personalized
medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug sensitivity.
