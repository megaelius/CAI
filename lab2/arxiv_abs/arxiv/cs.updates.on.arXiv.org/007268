Population protocols are a model of distributed computation intended for the study of networks
of independent computing agents with dynamic communication structure. Each agent has a finite
number of states, and communication opportunities occur nondeterministically, allowing the
agents involved to change their states based on each other's states. Multiple variations of that
model have been studied. In most of them the situation of temporary impossibility of communication
between some agents is natural. On the other hand, the models usually assume atomic interactions,
i.e. either all the agents update their state or none do. In practice, ensuring that in case of a communication
problem an interaction is recognised as successful either by all participants or by nobody has performance
and implementation complexity costs. In the present paper we study unreliable models based on population
protocols and their variations from the point of view of expressive power. We model the effects of
non-atomic interaction. We show that for a general definition of unreliable protocols with constant-storage
agents such protocols can only compute predicates computable by immediate observation population
protocols. Immediate observation population protocols are inherently tolerant of unreliable
communication and keep their expressive power under a wide range of fairness conditions. We prove
it via a structural lemma that can also be applied for other settings requiring guaranteed eventual
correctness. We also prove that adding unreliability reduces expressive power non-monotonically,
and show that a large class of message-based models becomes strictly less expressive than immediate
observation.
