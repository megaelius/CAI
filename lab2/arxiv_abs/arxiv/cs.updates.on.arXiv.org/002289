Bike sharing is a vital piece in a modern multi-modal transportation system. However, it suffers
from the bike unbalancing problem due to fluctuating spatial and temporal demands. Accurate bike
sharing demand predictions can help operators to make optimal routes and schedules for bike redistributions,
and therefore enhance the system efficiency. In this study, we propose a novel Graph Convolutional
Neural Network with Data-driven Graph Filter (GCNN-DDGF) model to predict station-level hourly
demands in a large-scale bike-sharing network. With each station as a vertex in the network, the
new proposed GCNN-DDGF model is able to automatically learn the hidden correlations between stations,
and thus overcomes a common issue reported in the previous studies, i.e., the quality and performance
of GCNN models rely on the predefinition of the adjacency matrix. To show the performance of the proposed
model, this study compares the GCNN-DDGF model with four GCNNs models, whose adjacency matrices
are from different bike sharing system matrices including the Spatial Distance matrix (SD), the
Demand matrix (DE), the Average Trip Duration matrix (ATD) and the Demand Correlation matrix (DC),
respectively. The five types of GCNN models and the classic Support Vector Regression model are
built on a Citi Bike dataset from New York City which includes 272 stations and over 28 million transactions
from 2013 to 2016. Results show that the GCNN-DDGF model has the lowest Root Mean Square Error, followed
by the GCNN-DC model, and the GCNN-ATD model has the worst performance. Through a further examination,
we find the learned DDGF captures some similar information embedded in the SD, DE and DC matrices,
and it also uncovers more hidden heterogeneous pairwise correlations between stations that are
not revealed by any of those matrices.
