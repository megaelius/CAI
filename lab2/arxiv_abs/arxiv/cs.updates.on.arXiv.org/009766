Zwick's $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) problem
runs in time $\widetilde{O}(\frac{n^\omega}{\varepsilon} \log{W})$, where $\omega \le 2.373$
is the exponent of matrix multiplication and $W$ denotes the largest weight. This can be used to approximate
several graph characteristics including the diameter, radius, median, minimum-weight triangle,
and minimum-weight cycle in the same time bound. Since Zwick's algorithm uses the scaling technique,
it has a factor $\log W$ in the running time. In this paper, we study whether APSP and related problems
admit approximation schemes avoiding the scaling technique. That is, the number of arithmetic
operations should be independent of $W$; this is called strongly polynomial. Our main results are
as follows. - We design approximation schemes in strongly polynomial time $O(\frac{n^\omega}{\varepsilon}
\text{polylog}(\frac{n}{\varepsilon}))$ for APSP on undirected graphs as well as for the graph
characteristics diameter, radius, median, minimum-weight triangle, and minimum-weight cycle
on directed or undirected graphs. - For APSP on directed graphs we design an approximation scheme
in strongly polynomial time $O(n^{\frac{\omega + 3}{2}} \varepsilon^{-1} \text{polylog}(\frac{n}{\varepsilon}))$.
This is significantly faster than the best exact algorithm. - We explain why our approximation scheme
for APSP on directed graphs has a worse exponent than $\omega$: Any improvement over our exponent
$\frac{\omega + 3}{2}$ would improve the best known algorithm for Min-Max Product In fact, we prove
that approximating directed APSP and exactly computing the Min-Max Product are equivalent.
