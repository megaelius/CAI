This paper presents a practical solution to the problem of limited bandwidth in Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD)- secured communication through using rapidly rekeyed Internet Protocol security (IPsec)
links. QKD is a cutting-edge security technology that provides mathematically proven security
by using quantum physical effects and information theoretical axioms to generate a guaranteed
non-disclosed stream of encryption keys. Although it has been a field of theoretical research for
some time, it has only been producing market-ready solutions for a short period of time. The downside
of this technology is that its key generation rate is only around 52,000 key bits per second over a
distance of 50 km. As this rate limits the data throughput to the same rate, it is substandard for normal
modern communications, especially for securely interconnecting networks. IPsec, on the other
hand, is a well-known security protocol that uses classical encryption and is capable of exactly
creating site-to-site virtual private networks. This paper presents a solution that combines
the performance advantages of IPsec with QKD. The combination sacrifices only a small portion of
QKD security by using the generated keys a limited number of times instead of just once. As a part of
this, the solution answers the question of how many data bits per key bit make sensible upper and lower
boundaries to yield high performance while maintaining high security. While previous approaches
complement the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE), this approach simplifies the implementation
with a new key synchronization concept, proposing a lightweight protocol that uses relatively
few, slim control messages and sparse acknowledgement. Furthermore, it provides a Linux-based
module for the AIT QKD software using the Netlink XFRM Application Programmers Interface to feed
the quantum key to the IP***ABSTRACT TRUNCATED TO 1920 CHARS***
