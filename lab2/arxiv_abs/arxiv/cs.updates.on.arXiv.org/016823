Pervasive computing applications deal with the incorporation of intelligent components around
end users to facilitate their activities. Such applications can be provided upon the vast infrastructures
of Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing (EC). IoT devices collect ambient data transferring
them towards the EC and Cloud for further processing. EC nodes could become the hosts of distributed
datasets where various processing activities take place. The future of EC involves numerous nodes
interacting with the IoT devices and themselves in a cooperative manner to realize the desired processing.
A critical issue for concluding this cooperative approach is the exchange of data synopses to have
EC nodes informed about the data present in their peers. Such knowledge will be useful for decision
making related to the execution of processing activities. In this paper, we propose n uncertainty
driven model for the exchange of data synopses. We argue that EC nodes should delay the exchange of
synopses especially when no significant differences with historical values are present. Our mechanism
adopts a Fuzzy Logic (FL) system to decide when there is a significant difference with the previous
reported synopses to decide the exchange of the new one. Our scheme is capable of alleviating the
network from numerous messages retrieved even for low fluctuations in synopses. We analytically
describe our model and evaluate it through a large set of experiments. Our experimental evaluation
targets to detect the efficiency of the approach based on the elimination of unnecessary messages
while keeping immediately informed peer nodes for significant statistical changes in the distributed
datasets.
