This paper studies unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless communication, where a rotarywing
UAV is dispatched to send/collect data to/from multiple ground nodes (GNs). We aim to minimize the
total UAV energy consumption, including both propulsion energy and communication related energy,
while satisfying the communication throughput requirement of each GN. To this end, we first derive
an analytical propulsion power consumption model for rotary-wing UAVs, and then formulate the
energy minimization problem by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication time allocation
among GNs, as well as the total mission completion time. The problem is difficult to be optimally
solved, as it is non-convex and involves infinitely many variables over time. To tackle this problem,
we first consider the simple fly-hover-communicate design, where the UAV successively visits
a set of hovering locations and communicates with one corresponding GN when hovering at each location.
For this design, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize the hovering locations and durations,
as well as the flying trajectory connecting these hovering locations, by leveraging the travelling
salesman problem (TSP) and convex optimization techniques. Next, we consider the general case
where the UAV communicates also when flying. We propose a new path discretization method to transform
the original problem into a discretized equivalent with a finite number of optimization variables,
for which we obtain a locally optimal solution by applying the successive convex approximation
(SCA) technique. Numerical results show the significant performance gains of the proposed designs
over benchmark schemes, in achieving energy-efficient communication with rotary-wing UAVs.
