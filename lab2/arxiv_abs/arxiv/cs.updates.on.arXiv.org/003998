Requirements Engineering (RE) has established itself as a software engineering discipline during
the past decades. While researchers have been investigating the RE discipline with a plethora of
empirical studies, attempts to systematically derive an empirically-based theory in context
of the RE discipline have just recently been started. However, such a theory is needed if we are to
define and motivate guidance in performing high quality RE research and practice. We aim at providing
an empirical and valid foundation for a theory of RE, which helps software engineers establish effective
and efficient RE processes. We designed a survey instrument and theory that has now been replicated
in 10 countries world-wide. We evaluate the propositions of the theory with bootstrapped confidence
intervals and derive potential explanations for the propositions. We report on the underlying
theory and the full results obtained from the replication studies with participants from 228 organisations.
Our results represent a substantial step forward towards developing an empirically-based theory
of RE giving insights into current practices with RE processes. The results reveal, for example,
that there are no strong differences between organisations in different countries and regions,
that interviews, facilitated meetings and prototyping are the most used elicitation techniques,
that requirements are often documented textually, that traces between requirements and code or
design documents is common, requirements specifications themselves are rarely changed and that
requirements engineering (process) improvement endeavours are mostly intrinsically motivated.
Our study establishes a theory that can be used as starting point for many further studies for more
detailed investigations. Practitioners can use the results as theory-supported guidance on selecting
suitable RE methods and techniques.
