The 5G-ALLSTAR project is aimed at integrating Terrestrial and Satellite Networks for satisfying
the highly challenging and demanding requirements of the 5G use cases. The integration of the two
networks is a key feature to assure the service continuity in challenging communication situations
(e.g., emergency cases, marine, railway, etc.) by avoiding service interruptions. The 5G-ALLSTAR
project proposes to develop Multi-Connectivity (MC) solutions in order to guarantee network reliability
and improve the throughput and latency for each connection between User Equipment (UE) and network.
In the 5G-ALLSTAR vision, we divide the gNB in two entities: 1) gNB-CU (Centralized Unit) and 2) gNB-DU
(Distributed Unit) The gNB-CU integrates an innovative Traffic Flow Control algorithm able to
optimize the network resources by coordinating the controlled gNB-DUs resources, while implementing
MC solutions. The MC permits to connect each UE with simultaneous multiple access points (even different
radio access technologies). This solution leads to have independent gNB-DU/s that contain the
RLC, MAC and PHY layers. The 5G-ALLSTAR MC algorithms offer advanced functionalities to RRC layer
(in the gNB-CU) that is, in turn, able to set up the SDAP, the PDCP and the lower layers in gNB-DU. In
this regard, the AI-based MC algorithms, implemented in gNB-CU, by considering the network performances
in the UE surrounding environment as well as the UE QoS requirements, will dynamically select the
most promising access points able to guarantee the fulfilment of the requirements also enabling
the optimal traffic splitting to cope with the connection reliability. In this paper, we present
also an innovative AI-based framework, included within the Traffic Flow Control, able to address
the MC objectives, by implementing a Reinforcement Learning algorithm in charge of solving the
network control problem.
