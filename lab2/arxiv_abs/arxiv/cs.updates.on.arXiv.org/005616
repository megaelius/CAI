Tactile Internet often requires (i) the ultra-reliable and ultra-responsive network connection
and (ii) the proactive and intelligent actuation at edge devices. A promising approach to address
these two requirements is to enable mobile edge devices to share their communication, computation,
and caching (3C) resources via device-to-device (D2D) connections. In this paper, we propose a
general 3C resource sharing framework, which includes many existing 1C/2C sharing models in the
literature as special cases. Comparing with 1C/2C models, the proposed 3C framework can further
improve the resource utilization efficiency by offering more flexibilities in the device cooperation
and resource scheduling. As a typical example, we focus on the energy utilization under the proposed
3C framework. Specifically, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem under the
3C framework, which is an integer non-convex optimization problem. To solve the problem, we first
transform it into an equivalent integer linear programming problem that is much easier to solve.
Then, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on linear programming, which can further reduce the
computation time and produce a result that is empirically close to the optimal solution. Moreover,
we evaluate the energy reduction due to the 3C sharing both analytically and numerically. Numerical
results show that, comparing with the existing 1C/2C approaches, the proposed 3C sharing framework
can reduce the total energy consumption by 83.8% when the D2D energy is negligible. The energy reduction
is still 27.5% when the D2D transmission energy per unit time is twice as large as the cellular transmission
energy per unit time.
