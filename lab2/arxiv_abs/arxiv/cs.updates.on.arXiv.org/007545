A $t$-spanner of a graph $G$ is a subgraph $H$ in which all distances are preserved up to a multiplicative
$t$ factor. A classical result of Alth\"ofer et al. is that for every integer $k$ and every graph $G$,
there is a $(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$ with at most $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. But for some settings the more
interesting notion is not the number of edges, but the degrees of the nodes. This spurred interest
in and study of spanners with small maximum degree. However, this is not necessarily a robust enough
objective: we would like spanners that not only have small maximum degree, but also have "few" nodes
of "large" degree. To interpolate between these two extremes, in this paper we initiate the study
of graph spanners with respect to the $\ell_p$-norm of their degree vector, thus simultaneously
modeling the number of edges (the $\ell_1$-norm) and the maximum degree (the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm).
We give precise upper bounds for all ranges of $p$ and stretch $t$: we prove that the greedy $(2k-1)$-spanner
has $\ell_p$ norm of at most $\max(O(n), O(n^{(k+p)/(kp)}))$, and that this bound is tight (assuming
the Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture). We also study universal lower bounds, allowing us to give "generic"
guarantees on the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm which generalize and interpolate
between the known approximations for the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Finally, we show that
at least in some situations, the $\ell_p$ norm behaves fundamentally differently from $\ell_1$
or $\ell_{\infty}$: there are regimes ($p=2$ and stretch $3$ in particular) where the greedy spanner
has a provably superior approximation to the generic guarantee.
