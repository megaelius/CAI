Verification of data generated by wearable sensors is increasingly becoming of concern to health
service providers and insurance companies. There is a need for a verification framework that various
authorities can request a verification service for the local network data of a target IoT device.
In this paper, we leverage blockchain as a distributed platform to realize an on-demand verification
scheme. This allows authorities to automatically transact with connected devices for witnessing
services. A public request is made for witness statements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted
on its local network, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer witnessing
service. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We develop a system architecture based on blockchain
and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail a verification service for data
of a subject device from a distributed set of witnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving
manner) their local wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; (2) We then develop a method
to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification error is minimized subject to monetary
cost constraints; (3) Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces
collected from a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points, representative of
a hospital. According to the current pricing schedule of the Ethereum public blockchain, our scheme
enables healthcare authorities to verify data transmitted from a typical wearable device with
the verification error of the order 0.01% at cost of less than two dollars for one-hour witnessing
service.
