Machine learning recently has been used to identify the governing equations for dynamics in physical
systems. The promising results from applications on systems such as fluid dynamics and chemical
kinetics inspire further investigation of these methods on complex engineered systems. Dynamics
of these systems play a crucial role in design and operations. Hence, it would be advantageous to
learn about the mechanisms that may be driving the complex dynamics of systems. In this work, our
research question was aimed at addressing this open question about applicability and usefulness
of novel machine learning approach in identifying the governing dynamical equations for engineered
systems. We focused on distillation column which is an ubiquitous unit operation in chemical engineering
and demonstrates complex dynamics i.e. it's dynamics is a combination of heuristics and fundamental
physical laws. We tested the method of Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamics (SINDy) because
of it's ability to produce white-box models with terms that can be used for physical interpretation
of dynamics. Time series data for dynamics was generated from simulation of distillation column
using ASPEN Dynamics. One promising result was reduction of number of equations for dynamic simulation
from 1000s in ASPEN to only 13 - one for each state variable. Prediction accuracy was high on the test
data from system within the perturbation range, however outside perturbation range equations
did not perform well. In terms of physical law extraction, some terms were interpretable as related
to Fick's law of diffusion (with concentration terms) and Henry's law (with ratio of concentration
and pressure terms). While some terms were interpretable, we conclude that more research is needed
on combining engineering systems with machine learning approach to improve understanding of governing
laws for unknown dynamics.
