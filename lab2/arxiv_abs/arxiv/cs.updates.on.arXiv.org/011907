This survey presents a review of state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures, algorithms,
and systems in vision and speech applications. Recent advances in deep artificial neural network
algorithms and architectures have spurred rapid innovation and development of intelligent vision
and speech systems. With availability of vast amounts of sensor data and cloud computing for processing
and training of deep neural networks, and with increased sophistication in mobile and embedded
technology, the next-generation intelligent systems are poised to revolutionize personal and
commercial computing. This survey begins by providing background and evolution of some of the most
successful deep learning models for intelligent vision and speech systems to date. An overview
of large-scale industrial research and development efforts is provided to emphasize future trends
and prospects of intelligent vision and speech systems. Robust and efficient intelligent systems
demand low-latency and high fidelity in resource-constrained hardware platforms such as mobile
devices, robots, and automobiles. Therefore, this survey also provides a summary of key challenges
and recent successes in running deep neural networks on hardware-restricted platforms, i.e. within
limited memory, battery life, and processing capabilities. Finally, emerging applications of
vision and speech across disciplines such as affective computing, intelligent transportation,
and precision medicine are discussed. To our knowledge, this paper provides one of the most comprehensive
surveys on the latest developments in intelligent vision and speech applications from the perspectives
of both software and hardware systems. Many of these emerging technologies using deep neural networks
show tremendous promise to revolutionize research and development for future vision and speech
systems.
