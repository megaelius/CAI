Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) is an encryption method that allows quantum computation
to be performed on one party's private data with the program provided by another party, without revealing
much information about the data nor about the program to the opposite party. It is known that information-theoretically-secure
QHE for circuits of unrestricted size would require exponential resources, and efficient computationally-secure
QHE schemes for polynomial-sized quantum circuits have been constructed. In this paper we first
propose a QHE scheme for a type of circuits of polynomial depth, based on the rebit quantum computation
formalism. The scheme keeps the restricted type of data perfectly secure. We then propose a QHE scheme
for a larger class of polynomial-depth quantum circuits, which has partial data privacy. Both schemes
have good circuit privacy. We also propose an interactive QHE scheme with asymptotic data privacy,
however, the circuit privacy is not good, in the sense that the party who provides the data could cheat
and learn about the circuit. We show that such cheating would generally affect the correctness of
the evaluation or cause deviation from the protocol. Hence the cheating can be caught by the opposite
party in an interactive scheme with embedded verifications. Such scheme with verification has
a minor drawback in data privacy. Finally, we show an improved interactive QHE scheme which achieves
some nontrivial level of data privacy and circuit privacy without resorting to allowing early terminations.
The entanglement and classical communication costs in these schemes are polynomial in the circuit
size and the security parameter (if any).
