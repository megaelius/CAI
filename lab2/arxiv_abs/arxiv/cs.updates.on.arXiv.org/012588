The popularity and proliferation of micromobility vehicles, such as electric scooters or e-scooters,
as last-mile transportation solutions in our cities and urban communities has been rapidly rising.
Rent-by-the-minute pricing and a healthy competition of service providers is also benefiting
riders with low trip costs. However, an unprepared and depleted urban infrastructure, combined
with uncertain operation policies and poor regulation enforcement, has resulted in micromobility
riders encroaching public spaces meant for pedestrians, thus causing significant safety concerns
both for themselves and the pedestrians. As a consequence, it has become critical to understand
the current state of pedestrian safety in our urban communities vis-\`a-vis micromobility services,
identify factors that impact pedestrian safety due to such services, and determine how to enable
pedestrian safety going forward. Unfortunately, to date there have been no realistic, data-driven
efforts within the research community that address these issues. In this work, we attempt to fill
this gap by conducting the first large-scale field-study to empirically investigate the safety
issues due to micromobility services from the pedestrian's perspective. By crowd-sensing real-time
encounter data between e-scooters and pedestrian participants on two urban university campuses
over a three-month period, we analyze the impact of these micromobility services on pedestrian
safety and uncover encounter statistics and mobility trends that could identify potentially unsafe
spatio-temporal zones for pedestrians. This first of its kind work also provides a blueprint on
how crowd-sensed micromobility data can enable similar safety-related studies in other urban
communities.
