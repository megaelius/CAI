Stagewise training strategy is commonly used for learning neural networks, which uses a stochastic
algorithm (e.g., SGD) starting with a relatively large step size (aka learning rate) and geometrically
decreasing the step size after a number of iterations. It has been observed that the stagewise SGD
has much faster convergence than the vanilla SGD with a polynomial decaying step size in terms of
both training error and testing error. {\it But how to explain this phenomenon has been largely ignored
by existing studies.} This paper provides some theoretical evidence for explaining this faster
convergence. In particular, we consider the stagewise training strategy for minimizing empirical
risk that satisfies the Polyak-\L ojasiewicz condition, which has been observed/proved for neural
networks and also holds for a broad family of convex functions. For convex loss functions and "nice-behaviored"
non-convex loss functions that are close to a convex function (namely weakly convex functions),
we establish faster convergence of stagewise training than the vanilla SGD under the same condition
on both training error and testing error. Indeed, the proposed algorithm has additional favorable
features that come with theoretical guarantee for the considered non-convex optimization problems,
including using explicit algorithmic regularization at each stage, using stagewise averaged
solution for restarting, and returning the last stagewise averaged solution as the final solution.
To differentiate from commonly used stagewise SGD, we refer to our algorithm as stagewise regularized
training algorithm. Of independent interest, the proved testing error bounds for a family of non-convex
loss functions are dimensionality and norm independent.
