Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due
to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies
are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Therefore, finding factors
that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn. The main
contribution of our work is to develop a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators
to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn. The model developed in this work uses machine
learning techniques on big data platform and builds a new way of features' engineering and selection.
In order to measure the performance of the model, the Area Under Curve (AUC) standard measure is adopted,
and the AUC value obtained is 93.3%. Another main contribution is to use customer social network
in the prediction model by extracting Social Network Analysis (SNA) features. The use of SNA enhanced
the performance of the model from 84 to 93.3% against AUC standard. The model was prepared and tested
through Spark environment by working on a large dataset created by transforming big raw data provided
by SyriaTel telecom company. The dataset contained all customers' information over 9 months, and
was used to train, test, and evaluate the system at SyriaTel. The model experimented four algorithms:
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machine Tree "GBM" and Extreme Gradient Boosting
"XGBOOST". However, the best results were obtained by applying XGBOOST algorithm. This algorithm
was used for classification in this churn predictive model.
