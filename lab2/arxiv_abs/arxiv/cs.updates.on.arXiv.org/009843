The estimation and control of resource usage is now an important challenge in an increasing number
of computing systems. In particular, requirements on timing and energy arise in a wide variety of
applications such as internet of things, cloud computing, health, transportation, and robots.
At the same time, parallel computing, with (heterogeneous) multi-core platforms in particular,
has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture. Predicting resource usage on such platforms
poses a difficult challenge. Most work on static resource analysis has focused on sequential programs,
and relatively little progress has been made on the analysis of parallel programs, or more specifically
on parallel logic programs. We propose a novel, general, and flexible framework for setting up cost
equations/relations which can be instantiated for performing resource usage analysis of parallel
logic programs for a wide range of resources, platforms and execution models. The analysis estimates
both lower and upper bounds on the resource usage of a parallel program (without executing it) as
functions on input data sizes. In addition, it also infers other meaningful information to better
exploit and assess the potential and actual parallelism of a system. We develop a method for solving
cost relations involving the max function that arise in the analysis of parallel programs. Finally,
we instantiate our general framework for the analysis of logic programs with Independent And-Parallelism,
report on an implementation within the CiaoPP system, and provide some experimental results. To
our knowledge, this is the first approach to the cost analysis of parallel logic programs.
