The aim of this work is to use Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a representation of an indoor
environment that can be used for robot navigation. We use images extracted from a video, in which
a camera takes a tour around a house, for training the VAE model with a 4 dimensional latent space.
After the model is trained, each real frame has a corresponding representation point on manifold
in the latent space, and each representation point has corresponding reconstructed image. For
the navigation problem, we map the starting image and destination image to the latent space, then
optimize a path on the learned manifold connecting the two points, and finally map the path back through
decoder to a sequence of images. The ideal sequence of images should correspond to a route that is
spatially continuous - i.e. neighbor images in the route should correspond to neighbor locations
in physical space. Such a route could be used for navigation with computer vision techniques, i.e.
a robot could follow the image sequence from starting location to destination in the environment
step by step. We implement this algorithm, but find in our experimental results that the resulting
route is not satisfactory. The route consist of several discontinuous image frames along the ideal
routes, so that the route could not be followed by a robot with computer vision techniques in practice.
In our evaluation, we propose two reasons for our failure to automatically find continuous routes:
(1) The VAE tends to capture global structures, but discard the details; (2) the Euclidean similarity
metric used for measuring continuity between house images is sub-optimal. For further work, we
propose: trying other generative models like VAE-GANs which may be better at reconstructing the
details to learn the representation map, and adjusting the similarity metric in the path selecting
algorithm.
