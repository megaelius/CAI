Identifying patterns and aberrations in graph data can pinpoint areas of interest, provide context
for deeper understanding, and enable discovery in many applications. Because of inherent complexity,
converting graph data to meaningful information through analysis or visualization is often challenging.
This work presents a novel modeling and analysis framework for graph sequences. The framework addresses
the issues of modeling, detecting anomalies at multiple scales, and enabling understanding of
graph data. A new graph model, generalizing the BTER model of Seshadhri et al. by adding flexibility
to community structure, is introduced and used to perform multi-scale graph anomaly detection.
Specifically, probability models describing coarse subgraphs are built by aggregating probabilities
at finer levels, and these closely related hierarchical models simultaneously detect deviations
from expectation. This technique provides insight into the graph's structure and internal context
that may shed light on a detected event. Additionally, this multi-scale analysis facilitates intuitive
visualizations by allowing users to narrow focus from an anomalous graph to particular subgraphs
causing the anomaly. For evaluation, two hierarchical anomaly detectors are tested against a baseline
on a series of sampled graphs. The superior hierarchical detector outperforms the baseline, and
changes in community structure are accurately detected at the node, subgraph, and graph levels.
To illustrate the accessibility of information made possible via this technique, a prototype visualization
tool, informed by the multi-scale analysis is tested on NCAA football data. Teams and conferences
exhibiting changes in membership are identified with greater than 92% precision and recall. Screenshots
of an interactive visualization, allowing users to probe into selected communities, are given.
