We consider a setting where an auctioneer sells a single item to $n$ potential agents with {\em interdependent
values}. That is, each agent has her own private signal, and the valuation of each agent is a known
function of all $n$ private signals. This captures settings such as valuations for artwork, oil
drilling rights, broadcast rights, and many more. In the interdependent value setting, all previous
work has assumed a so-called {\sl single-crossing condition}. Single-crossing means that the
impact of agent $i$'s private signal, $s_i$, on her own valuation is greater than the impact of $s_i$
on the valuation of any other agent. It is known that without the single-crossing condition an efficient
outcome cannot be obtained. We study welfare maximization for interdependent valuations through
the lens of approximation. We show that, in general, without the single-crossing condition, one
cannot hope to approximate the optimal social welfare any better than the approximation given by
assigning the item to a random bidder. Consequently, we introduce a relaxed version of single-crossing,
{\sl $c$-single-crossing}, parameterized by $c\geq 1$, which means that the impact of $s_i$ on
the valuation of agent $i$ is at least $1/c$ times the impact of $s_i$ on the valuation of any other
agent ($c=1$ is single-crossing). Using this parameterized notion, we obtain a host of positive
results. We propose a prior-free deterministic mechanism that gives an $(n-1)c$-approximation
guarantee to welfare. We then show that a random version of the proposed mechanism gives a prior-free
universally truthful $2c$-approximation to the optimal welfare for any concave $c$-single crossing
setting (and a $2\sqrt{n}c^{3/2}$-approximation in the absence of concavity). We extend this
mechanism to a universally truthful mechanism that gives $O(c^2)$-approximation to the optimal
revenue.
