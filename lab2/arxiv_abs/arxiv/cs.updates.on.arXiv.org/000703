The sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of two fundamental multi-user network structures,
the K-user Gaussian multiple access (MAC) wiretap channel and the K-user interference channel
(IC) with secrecy constraints, have been determined recently as K(K-1)/(K(K-1)+1) [1,2] and K(K-1)/(2K-1)
[3,4], respectively. In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these two channel
models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the converse of [1,2]. The converse
for the IC includes constraints both due to secrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion
of the region close to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to secrecy
constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper bounds due to interference
constraints. Different from the existing literature, in order to fully understand the characterization
of the s.d.o.f. region of the IC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not
illustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability, we use the polytope
structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases, we develop explicit schemes that achieve
the extreme points of the polytope region given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points
of the MAC region are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e., by setting
(K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure (structured) cooperative jammers.
The extreme points of the IC region are achieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m
helpers, and N external eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in this
paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of the s.d.o.f. region, which
is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC and IC channel models.
