Multi-view graph embedding has become a widely studied problem in the area of graph learning. Most
of the existing works on multi-view graph embedding aim to find a shared common node embedding across
all the views of the graph by combining the different views in a specific way. Hub detection, as another
essential topic in graph mining has also drawn extensive attentions in recent years, especially
in the context of brain network analysis. Both the graph embedding and hub detection relate to the
node clustering structure of graphs. The multi-view graph embedding usually implies the node clustering
structure of the graph based on the multiple views, while the hubs are the boundary-spanning nodes
across different node clusters in the graph and thus may potentially influence the clustering structure
of the graph. However, none of the existing works in multi-view graph embedding considered the hubs
when learning the multi-view embeddings. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the hub detection
task into the multi-view graph embedding framework so that the two tasks could benefit each other.
Specifically, we propose an auto-weighted framework of Multi-view Graph Embedding with Hub Detection
(MVGE-HD) for brain network analysis. The MVGE-HD framework learns a unified graph embedding across
all the views while reducing the potential influence of the hubs on blurring the boundaries between
node clusters in the graph, thus leading to a clear and discriminative node clustering structure
for the graph. We apply MVGE-HD on two real multi-view brain network datasets (i.e., HIV and Bipolar).
The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in brain
network analysis for clinical investigation and application.
