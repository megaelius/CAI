We focus in this report on two main axes. The first is dedicated to the study of the effect of replicas
distribution on data grid performances. In this respect, our main contributions are as follows:
1) An overview of replication strategies mainly from the viewpoints of the considered parameters
in their associated steps as well as the used metrics in the literature for their evaluation. 2) A
study of the impact of placement strategies on data grid performance which motivated the analysis
of the effect of the replicas distribution quality on the performance results of replication strategies.
3) The proposal of new evaluation metrics dedicated to the evaluation of the distribution quality.
4) The setting of an objective evaluation of replication strategies which is based on a beforehand
assessment of the distribution quality. The second axis is mainly dedicated to exploiting results
of data mining techniques to enhance performances of replication strategies. With respect to this
axis, we mainly concentrate on the following contributions listed below: 1) The study of the strengths
and the drawbacks of the main replication strategies based on data mining techniques and how these
latter are applied in this context. 2) The proposal of a new guideline to data mining application
in the context of data grid replication strategies. 3) The proposal of a new algorithm for mining
maximal frequent correlated patterns. The input of this algorithm is obtained through a preliminary
step focusing on how to adapt the required grid concepts to the data mining algorithm. 4) The design
and the implementation of a new replication strategy based on a data mining technique, and more precisely
correlated patterns.
