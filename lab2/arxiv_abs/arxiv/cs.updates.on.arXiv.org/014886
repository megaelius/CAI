The exponential increase in COVID-19 patients is overwhelming healthcare systems across the world.
With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every patient with respiratory illness to be tested
using conventional techniques (RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited
sensitivity. Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high risk
patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already available in most healthcare
systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems already digitized, there is no transportation time
involved for the samples either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the selection
of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an inpatient setting where the present
systems are struggling to decide whether to keep the patient in the ward along with other patients
or isolate them in COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood
of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further, we propose the use of
modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients using X-Ray images in an automated manner,
particularly in settings where radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing
technology scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural network based
model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly available covid-chestxray-dataset
[2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100% sensitivity (recall) for the COVID-19 infection.
We significantly improve upon the results of Covid-Net [10] on the same dataset.
