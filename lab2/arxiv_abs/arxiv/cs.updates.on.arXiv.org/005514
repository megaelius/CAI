Data de-duplication is the task of detecting multiple records that correspond to the same real-world
entity in a database. In this work, we view de-duplication as a clustering problem where the goal
is to put records corresponding to the same physical entity in the same cluster and putting records
corresponding to different physical entities into different clusters. We introduce a framework
which we call promise correlation clustering. Given a complete graph $G$ with the edges labelled
$0$ and $1$, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the number of $0$ edges within a cluster
plus the number of $1$ edges across different clusters (or correlation loss). The optimal clustering
can also be viewed as a complete graph $G^*$ with edges corresponding to points in the same cluster
being labelled $0$ and other edges being labelled $1$. Under the promise that the edge difference
between $G$ and $G^*$ is "small", we prove that finding the optimal clustering (or $G^*$) is still
NP-Hard. [Ashtiani et. al, 2016] introduced the framework of semi-supervised clustering, where
the learning algorithm has access to an oracle, which answers whether two points belong to the same
or different clusters. We further prove that even with access to a same-cluster oracle, the promise
version is NP-Hard as long as the number queries to the oracle is not too large ($o(n)$ where $n$ is
the number of vertices). Given these negative results, we consider a restricted version of correlation
clustering. As before, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the correlation loss. However,
we restrict ourselves to a given class $\mathcal F$ of clusterings. We offer a semi-supervised algorithmic
approach to solve the restricted variant with success guarantees.
