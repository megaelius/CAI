In a distributed storage system, recovering from multiple failures is a critical and frequent task
that is crucial for maintaining the system's reliability and fault-tolerance. In this work, we
focus on the problem of repairing multiple failures in a centralized way, which can be desirable
in many data storage configurations, and we show that a significant repair traffic reduction is
possible. First, the fundamental tradeoff between the repair bandwidth and the storage size for
functional repair is established. Using a graph-theoretic formulation, the optimal tradeoff
is identified as the solution to an integer optimization problem, for which a closed-form expression
is derived. Expressions of the extreme points, namely the minimum storage multi-node repair (MSMR)
and minimum bandwidth multi-node repair (MBMR) points, are obtained. Second, we describe a general
framework for converting single erasure minimum storage regenerating codes to MSMR codes. The
repair strategy for $e$ failures is similar to that for single failure, however certain extra requirements
need to be satisfied by the repairing functions for single failure. For illustration, the framework
is applied to product-matrix codes and interference alignment codes. Furthermore, we prove that
the functional MBMR point is not achievable for linear exact repair codes. We also show that exact-repair
minimum bandwidth cooperative repair (MBCR) codes achieve an interior point, that lies near the
MBMR point, when $k \equiv 1 \mod e$, $k$ being the minimum number of nodes needed to reconstruct the
entire data. Finally, for $k> 2e, e\mid k$ and $e \mid d$, where $d$ is the number of helper nodes during
repair, we show that the functional repair tradeoff is not achievable under exact repair, except
for maybe a small portion near the MSMR point, which parallels the results for single erasure repair
