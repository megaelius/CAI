To test the hypothesis that accuracy, discrimination, and precision in predicting postoperative
complications improve when using both preoperative and intraoperative data input features versus
preoperative data alone. Models that predict postoperative complications often ignore important
intraoperative physiological changes. Incorporation of intraoperative physiological data
may improve model performance. This retrospective cohort analysis included 52,529 inpatient
surgeries at a single institution during a 5 year period. Random forest machine learning models
in the validated MySurgeryRisk platform made patient-level predictions for three postoperative
complications and mortality during hospital admission using electronic health record data and
patient neighborhood characteristics. For each outcome, one model trained with preoperative
data alone and one model trained with both preoperative and intraoperative data. Models were compared
by accuracy, discrimination (expressed as AUROC), precision (expressed as AUPRC), and reclassification
indices (NRI). Machine learning models incorporating both preoperative and intraoperative data
had greater accuracy, discrimination, and precision than models using preoperative data alone
for predicting all three postoperative complications (intensive care unit length of stay >48 hours,
mechanical ventilation >48 hours, and neurological complications including delirium) and in-hospital
mortality (accuracy: 88% vs. 77%, AUROC: 0.93 vs. 0.87, AUPRC: 0.21 vs. 0.15). Overall reclassification
improvement was 2.9-10.0% for complications and 11.2% for in-hospital mortality. Incorporating
both preoperative and intraoperative data significantly increased accuracy, discrimination,
and precision for machine learning models predicting postoperative complications.
