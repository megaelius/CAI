The enormous financial success of online advertising platforms is partially due to the precise
targeting features they offer. Although researchers and journalists have found many ways that
advertisers can target---or exclude---particular groups of users seeing their ads, comparatively
little attention has been paid to the implications of the platform's ad delivery process, comprised
of the platform's choices about which users see which ads. It has been hypothesized that this process
can "skew" ad delivery in ways that the advertisers do not intend, making some users less likely than
others to see particular ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate
that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook, due to market and financial optimization effects
as well as the platform's own predictions about the "relevance" of ads to different groups of users.
We find that both the advertiser's budget and the content of the ad each significantly contribute
to the skew of Facebook's ad delivery. Critically, we observe significant skew in delivery along
gender and racial lines for "real" ads for employment and housing opportunities despite neutral
targeting parameters. Our results demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to
potentially discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their targeting parameters
to be highly inclusive. This underscores the need for policymakers and platforms to carefully consider
the role of the ad delivery optimization run by ad platforms themselves---and not just the targeting
choices of advertisers---in preventing discrimination in digital advertising.
