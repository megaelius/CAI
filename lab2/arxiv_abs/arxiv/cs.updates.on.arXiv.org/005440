Depth prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. In this paper, we propose
a simple yet effective convolutional spatial propagation network (CSPN) to learn the affinity
matrix for various depth estimation tasks. Specifically, it is an efficient linear propagation
model, in which the propagation is performed with a manner of recurrent convolutional operation,
and the affinity among neighboring pixels is learned through a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN). We can append this module to any output from a state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation networks
to improve their performances. In practice, we further extend CSPN in two aspects: 1) take sparse
depth map as additional input, which is useful for the task of depth completion; 2) similar to commonly
used 3D convolution operation in CNNs, we propose 3D CSPN to handle features with one additional
dimension, which is effective in the task of stereo matching using 3D cost volume. For the tasks of
sparse to dense, a.k.a depth completion. We experimented the proposed CPSN conjunct algorithms
over the popular NYU v2 and KITTI datasets, where we show that our proposed algorithms not only produce
high quality (e.g., 30% more reduction in depth error), but also run faster (e.g., 2 to 5x faster)
than previous SOTA spatial propagation network. We also evaluated our stereo matching algorithm
on the Scene Flow and KITTI Stereo datasets, and rank 1st on both the KITTI Stereo 2012 and 2015 benchmarks,
which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed module. The code of CSPN proposed in this work
will be released at https://github.com/XinJCheng/CSPN.
