In the $k$-Steiner Orientation problem we are given a mixed graph, that is, with both directed and
undirected edges, and a set of $k$ terminal pairs. The goal is to find an orientation of the undirected
edges that maximizes the number of terminal pairs for which there is a path from the source to the sink.
The problem is known to be W[1]-hard when parameterized by $k$ and hard to approximate up to some constant
for FPT algorithms assuming Gap-ETH. On the other hand, no approximation better than $O(k)$ is known.
We show that $k$-Steiner Orientation admits no sublogarithmic approximation algorithm, even
with a parameterized running time, assuming W[1] $\ne$ FPT. To obtain this result, we reduce the
problem to itself via a hashing-based gap amplification technique, which turns out useful even
outside of the FPT paradigm. Precisely, we rule out any approximation ratio of the form $(\log k)^{o(1)}$
for parameterized algorithms and $(\log n)^{o(1)}$ for purely polynomial running time, under
the same assumption. This constitutes a novel inapproximability result for polynomial time algorithms
obtained via tools from the FPT theory. Moreover, we prove $k$-Steiner Orientation to be W[1]-complete,
what provides an example of a natural approximation task that is complete in a parameterized complexity
class. Finally, we apply our technique to the maximization version of Directed Multicut and obtain
a simple proof that the problem admits no FPT approximation with ratio $O(k^{\frac 1 2 - \epsilon})$
(assuming W[1] $\ne$ FPT) and no polynomial-time approximation with ratio $O(m^{\frac 1 2 - \epsilon})$
(assuming NP $\not\subseteq$ co-RP).
