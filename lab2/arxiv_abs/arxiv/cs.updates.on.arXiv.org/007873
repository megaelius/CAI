In recent years, the image and video coding technologies have advanced by leaps and bounds. However,
due to the popularization of image and video acquisition devices, the growth rate of image and video
data is far beyond the improvement of the compression ratio. In particular, it has been widely recognized
that there are increasing challenges of pursuing further coding performance improvement within
the traditional hybrid coding framework. Deep convolution neural network (CNN) which makes the
neural network resurge in recent years and has achieved great success in both artificial intelligent
and signal processing fields, also provides a novel and promising solution for image and video compression.
In this paper, we provide a systematic, comprehensive and up-to-date review of neural network based
image and video compression techniques. The evolution and development of neural network based
compression methodologies are introduced for images and video respectively. More specifically,
the cutting-edge video coding techniques by leveraging deep learning and HEVC framework are presented
and discussed, which promote the state-of-the-art video coding performance substantially. Moreover,
the end-to-end image and video coding frameworks based on neural networks are also reviewed, revealing
interesting explorations on next generation image and video coding frameworks/standards. The
most significant research works on the image and video coding related topics using neural networks
are highlighted, and future trends are also envisioned. In particular, the joint compression on
semantic and visual information is tentatively explored to formulate high efficiency signal representation
structure for both human vision and machine vision, which are the two dominant signal receptor in
the age of artificial intelligence.
