Discovering imaging biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical to help explain
ASD and predict or monitor treatment outcomes. Toward this end, deep learning classifiers have
recently been used for identifying ASD from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
higher accuracy than traditional learning strategies. However, a key challenge with deep learning
models is understanding just what image features the network is using, which can in turn be used to
define the biomarkers. Current methods extract biomarkers, i.e., important features, by looking
at how the prediction changes if "ignoring" one feature at a time. In this work, we go beyond looking
at only individual features by using Shapley value explanation (SVE) from cooperative game theory.
Cooperative game theory is advantageous here because it directly considers the interaction between
features and can be applied to any machine learning method, making it a novel, more accurate way of
determining instance-wise biomarker importance from deep learning models. A barrier to using
SVE is its computational complexity: $2^N$ given $N$ features. We explicitly reduce the complexity
of SVE computation by two approaches based on the underlying graph structure of the input data: 1)
only consider the centralized coalition of each feature; 2) a hierarchical pipeline which first
clusters features into small communities, then applies SVE in each community. Monte Carlo approximation
can be used for large permutation sets. We first validate our methods on the MNIST dataset and compare
to human perception. Next, to insure plausibility of our biomarker results, we train a Random Forest
(RF) to classify ASD/control subjects from fMRI and compare SVE results to standard RF-based feature
importance. Finally, we show initial results on ranked fMRI biomarkers using SVE on a deep learning
classifier for the ASD/control dataset.
