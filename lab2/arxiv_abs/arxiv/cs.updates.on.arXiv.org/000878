This paper introduces a new global analytical model of the heat dissipation process that occurs
in passively-cooled embedded systems, and explicits under what circumstances the folklore assumption
that exponential cooling laws apply in such context is valid. Since the power consumption and reliability
of microprocessors are highly dependent on temperature, both designers and, later on, run-time
temperature management units must be able rely upon accurate heating and cooling models to handle
heat generation and peak temperature. If exponential cooling models are justified for actively-cooled
microprocessors, e.g., by forced air or water cooling, for passively cooled processors however,
as frequently found in embedded systems such as mobile phones, an exponential law may not be theoretically
justified. Here, we analyzed the tractability of the exact cooling law for a passively cooled body,
subject to radiative cooling and a modest level of heat loss via convection. Focusing then on embedded
microprocessors, we compare the performance difference between our new passive cooling law and
the conventionally-used exponential one. We show that the differences between the exact solution
and the exponential cooling law are not significant, and even negligible, for small surfaces of
the order 10cm$^2$. However, for larger surface sizes, the radiative cooling component may become
comparable to the convective cooling component. Our results thus suggest that, in the absence of
accurate temperature measurements, an exponential cooling law is accurate enough for small-sized
SoC systems that require low processing overhead.
