Decision making in real-life scenarios may often be modeled as an optimization problem. It requires
the consideration of various attributes like human preferences and thinking, which constrain
achieving the optimal value of the problem objectives. The value of the objectives may be maximized
or minimized, depending on the situation. Numerous times, the values of these problem parameters
are in linguistic form, as human beings naturally understand and express themselves using words.
These problems are therefore termed as linguistic optimization problems (LOPs), and are of two
types, namely single objective linguistic optimization problems (SOLOPs) and multi-objective
linguistic optimization problems (MOLOPs). In these LOPs, the value of the objective function(s)
may not be known at all points of the decision space, and therefore, the objective function(s) as
well as problem constraints are linked by the if-then rules. Tsukamoto inference method has been
used to solve these LOPs; however, it suffers from drawbacks. As, the use of linguistic information
inevitably calls for the utilization of computing with words (CWW), and therefore, 2-tuple linguistic
model based solution methodologies were proposed for LOPs. However, we found that 2-tuple linguistic
model based solution methodologies represent the semantics of the linguistic information using
a combination of type-1 fuzzy sets and ordinal term sets. As, the semantics of linguistic information
are best modeled using the interval type-2 fuzzy sets, hence we propose solution methodologies
for LOPs based on CWW approach of perceptual computing, in this paper. The perceptual computing
based solution methodologies use a novel design of CWW engine, called the perceptual reasoning
(PR). PR in the current form is suitable for solving SOLOPs and, hence, we have also extended it to
the MOLOPs.
