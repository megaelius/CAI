Human pose estimation has been widely studied with much focus on supervised learning requiring
sufficient annotations. However, in real applications, a pretrained pose estimation model usually
need be adapted to a novel domain with no labels or sparse labels. Such domain adaptation for 2D pose
estimation hasn't been explored. The main reason is that a pose, by nature, has typical topological
structure and needs fine-grained features in local keypoints. While existing adaptation methods
do not consider topological structure of object-of-interest and they align the whole images coarsely.
Therefore, we propose a novel domain adaptation method for multi-person pose estimation to conduct
the human-level topological structure alignment and fine-grained feature alignment. Our method
consists of three modules: Cross-Attentive Feature Alignment (CAFA), Intra-domain Structure
Adaptation (ISA) and Inter-domain Human-Topology Alignment (IHTA) module. The CAFA adopts a bidirectional
spatial attention module (BSAM)that focuses on fine-grained local feature correlation between
two humans to adaptively aggregate consistent features for adaptation. We adopt ISA only in semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) to exploit the corresponding keypoint semantic relationship for reducing
the intra-domain bias. Most importantly, we propose an IHTA to learn more domain-invariant human
topological representation for reducing the inter-domain discrepancy. We model the human topological
structure via the graph convolution network (GCN), by passing messages on which, high-order relations
can be considered. This structure preserving alignment based on GCN is beneficial to the occluded
or extreme pose inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular benchmarks and results
demonstrate the competency of our method compared with existing supervised approaches.
