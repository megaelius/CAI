At some point in the history of most nations, one or more events of illegal electronic surveillance
by those in power or law enforcement has occurred that has the effect of setting State against Citizen.
The media sensationalise these incidents for profit, however they more often correctly express
the concern felt by the general public. At these times politicians rise, either into fame or infamy,
by proposing new legislation which the public is told will protect them by from future incidents
of illegal and unwarranted invasion by officers of the state. Two things have occurred since these
protective laws were enacted; technological advancement that is claimed has frustrated legitimate
investigation, and changes in the law that are ostensibly presented as intending to facilitate
the prosecution or prevention of a publicly decried offence, like child pornography, but which
in context deliver expanded powers to the State, effectively weakening the protections previously
enacted. This report looks at human rights legislation in three jurisdictions, starting from a
position of comparing and contrasting the protections that are available from illegal search and
seizure. By identifying legislative changes related to several forms of electronic surveillance
and technology, and the situations that led to them, we can locate the effective peak of protection
and discuss the processes that have led to a gradual yet pervasive weakening of those laws in all three
nations. We are regularly diverted by those in power towards disregarding the paranoia of the outliers
who have been warning us with their purple prose that big brother is watching. But if we focus on the
effect of recent legislative changes in the area of electronic surveillance we can clearly see that
the Orwellian dystopia is already here, and we are living it.
