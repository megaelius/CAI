Abdominal multi-organ segmentation of computed tomography (CT) images has been the subject of
extensive research interest. It presents a substantial challenge in medical image processing,
as the shape and distribution of abdominal organs can vary greatly among the population and within
an individual over time. While continuous integration of novel datasets into the training set provides
potential for better segmentation performance, collection of data at scale is not only costly,
but also impractical in some contexts. Moreover, it remains unclear what marginal value additional
data have to offer. Herein, we propose a single-pass active learning method through human quality
assurance (QA). We built on a pre-trained 3D U-Net model for abdominal multi-organ segmentation
and augmented the dataset either with outlier data (e.g., exemplars for which the baseline algorithm
failed) or inliers (e.g., exemplars for which the baseline algorithm worked). The new models were
trained using the augmented datasets with 5-fold cross-validation (for outlier data) and withheld
outlier samples (for inlier data). Manual labeling of outliers increased Dice scores with outliers
by 0.130, compared to an increase of 0.067 with inliers (p<0.001, two-tailed paired t-test). By
adding 5 to 37 inliers or outliers to training, we find that the marginal value of adding outliers
is higher than that of adding inliers. In summary, improvement on single-organ performance was
obtained without diminishing multi-organ performance or significantly increasing training
time. Hence, identification and correction of baseline failure cases present an effective and
efficient method of selecting training data to improve algorithm performance.
