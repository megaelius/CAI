The objective of this paper is to design novel multi-layer neural network architectures for multiscale
simulations of flows taking into account the observed data and physical modeling concepts. Our
approaches use deep learning concepts combined with local multiscale model reduction methodologies
to predict flow dynamics. Using reduced-order model concepts is important for constructing robust
deep learning architectures since the reduced-order models provide fewer degrees of freedom.
Flow dynamics can be thought of as multi-layer networks. More precisely, the solution (e.g., pressures
and saturations) at the time instant $n+1$ depends on the solution at the time instant $n$ and input
parameters, such as permeability fields, forcing terms, and initial conditions. One can regard
the solution as a multi-layer network, where each layer, in general, is a nonlinear forward map and
the number of layers relates to the internal time steps. We will rely on rigorous model reduction
concepts to define unknowns and connections for each layer. In each layer, our reduced-order models
will provide a forward map, which will be modified ("trained") using available data. It is critical
to use reduced-order models for this purpose, which will identify the regions of influence and the
appropriate number of variables. Because of the lack of available data, the training will be supplemented
with computational data as needed and the interpolation between data-rich and data-deficient
models. We will also use deep learning algorithms to train the elements of the reduced model discrete
system. We will present main ingredients of our approach and numerical results. Numerical results
show that using deep learning and multiscale models, we can improve the forward models, which are
conditioned to the available data.
