We introduce the tensor numerical method for solution of the $d$-dimensional optimal control problems
with fractional Laplacian type operators in constraints discretized on large $n^{\otimes d}$
tensor-product Cartesian grids. The approach is based on the rank-structured approximation of
the matrix valued functions of the corresponding fractional finite difference Laplacian. We solve
the equation for the control function, where the system matrix includes the sum of the fractional
$d$-dimensional Laplacian and its inverse. The matrix valued functions of discrete Laplace operator
on a tensor grid are diagonalized by using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then the low rank approximation
of the $d$-dimensional tensors obtained by folding of the corresponding large diagonal matrices
of eigenvalues are computed, which allows to solve the governing equation for the control function
in a tensor-structured format. The existence of low rank canonical approximation to the class of
matrix valued functions involved is justified by using the sinc quadrature approximation method
applied to the Laplace transform of the generating function. The linear system of equations for
the control function is solved by the PCG iterative method with the rank truncation at each iteration
step, where the low Kronecker rank preconditioner is precomputed. The right-hand side, the solution
vector, and the governing system matrix are maintained in the rank-structured tensor format which
beneficially reduces the numerical cost to $O(n\log n)$, outperforming the standard FFT based
methods of complexity $O(n^3\log n)$ for 3D case. Numerical tests for the 2D and 3D control problems
confirm the linear complexity scaling of the method in the univariate grid size $n$.
