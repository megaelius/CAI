A terrain is an x-monotone polygonal curve, i.e., successive vertices have increasing x-coordinates.
Terrain Guarding can be seen as a special case of the famous art gallery problem where one has to place
at most $k$ guards on a terrain made of $n$ vertices in order to fully see it. In 2010, King and Krohn
showed that Terrain Guarding is NP-complete [SODA '10, SIAM J. Comput. '11] thereby solving a long-standing
open question. They observe that their proof does not settle the complexity of Orthogonal Terrain
Guarding where the terrain only consists of horizontal or vertical segments; those terrains are
called rectilinear or orthogonal. Recently, Ashok et al. [SoCG'17] presented an FPT algorithm
running in time $k^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ for Dominating Set in the visibility graphs of rectilinear
terrains without 180-degree vertices. They ask if Orthogonal Terrain Guarding is in P or NP-hard.
In the same paper, they give a subexponential-time algorithm running in $n^{O(\sqrt n)}$ (actually
even $n^{O(\sqrt k)}$) for the general Terrain Guarding and notice that the hardness proof of King
and Krohn only disproves a running time $2^{o(n^{1/4})}$ under the ETH. Hence, there is a significant
gap between their $2^{O(n^{1/2} \log n)}$-algorithm and the no $2^{o(n^{1/4})}$ ETH-hardness
implied by King and Krohn's result. In this paper, we answer those two remaining questions. We adapt
the gadgets of King and Krohn to rectilinear terrains in order to prove that even Orthogonal Terrain
Guarding is NP-complete. Then, we show how their reduction from Planar 3-SAT (as well as our adaptation
for rectilinear terrains) can actually be made linear (instead of quadratic).
