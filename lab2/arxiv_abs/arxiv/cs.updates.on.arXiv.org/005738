Imaging fluorescent disease biomarkers in tissues and skin is a non-invasive method to screen for
health conditions. We report an automated process that combines intraoral fluorescent porphyrin
biomarker imaging, clinical examinations and machine learning for correlation of systemic health
conditions with periodontal disease. 1215 intraoral fluorescent images, from 284 consenting
adults aged 18-90, were analyzed using a machine learning classifier that can segment periodontal
inflammation. The classifier achieved an AUC of 0.677 with precision and recall of 0.271 and 0.429,
respectively, indicating a learned association between disease signatures in collected images.
Periodontal diseases were more prevalent among males (p=0.0012) and older subjects (p=0.0224)
in the screened population. Physicians independently examined the collected images, assigning
localized modified gingival indices (MGIs). MGIs and periodontal disease were then cross-correlated
with responses to a medical history questionnaire, blood pressure and body mass index measurements,
and optic nerve, tympanic membrane, neurological, and cardiac rhythm imaging examinations. Gingivitis
and early periodontal disease were associated with subjects diagnosed with optic nerve abnormalities
(p <0.0001) in their retinal scans. We also report significant co-occurrences of periodontal disease
in subjects reporting swollen joints (p=0.0422) and a family history of eye disease (p=0.0337).
These results indicate cross-correlation of poor periodontal health with systemic health outcomes
and stress the importance of oral health screenings at the primary care level. Our screening process
and analysis method, using images and machine learning, can be generalized for automated diagnoses
and systemic health screenings for other diseases.
