In this experiment, a closed-loop discrete time system for speed control of a permanent magnet DC
motor with discrete PI controller is implemented in embedded platform. The design & analysis of
the system is based on the mathematical model of the DC motor obtained by system identification technique.
After that the closed loop system is distributed through a wireless network created by means of Bluetooth
without any change in the discrete controller. The network connects the controller on one side with
the sensor, actuator & the plant on the other side. Then the performance of the closed loop system
is observed with the wireless network in two configurations : with point-to-point connection between
two nodes and a network structure with two intermediate nodes among the controller side node & the
plant side node. It has been observed that the performance degrades with only the PI controller a
little bit in point to point configuration and the performance severely degrades in intermediate
node configuration. To tackle this issue time delay is measured in the WNCS and then a digital smith
predictor structure is implemented to obtain better performance. It has been observed that in point
to point configuration the time delay remains almost constant and in intermediate node configuration
the time delay is varying. Hence the digital smith predictor fails to perform reasonably in intermediate
node configuration. An online time delay measurement & estimation procedure has been implemented
and proposed in this research. We have implemented an adaptive digital smith predictor using the
online time delay measurement and identification. The implemented smith predictor provides good
results for both intermediate node and point to point connection. An stability analysis of the DC
motor system with variation of delay has been discussed.
