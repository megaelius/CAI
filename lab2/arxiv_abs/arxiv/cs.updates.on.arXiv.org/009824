We study uniform population protocols: networks of anonymous agents whose pairwise interactions
are chosen at random, where each agent uses an identical transition algorithm that does not depend
on the population size $n$. Many existing polylog$(n)$ time protocols for leader election and majority
computation are nonuniform: to operate correctly, they require all agents to be initialized with
an approximate estimate of $n$ (specifically, the exact value $\lfloor \log n \rfloor$). Our first
main result is a uniform protocol for calculating $\log(n) \pm O(1)$ with high probability in $O(\log^2
n)$ time and $O(\log^4 n)$ states ($O(\log \log n)$ bits of memory). The protocol is converging but
not terminating: it does not signal when the estimate is close to the true value of $\log n$. If it could
be made terminating, this would allow composition with protocols, such as those for leader election
or majority, that require a size estimate initially, to make them uniform (though with a small probability
of failure). We do show how our main protocol can be indirectly composed with others in a simple and
elegant way, based on the leaderless phase clock, demonstrating that those protocols can in fact
be made uniform. However, our second main result implies that the protocol cannot be made terminating,
a consequence of a much stronger result: a uniform protocol for any task requiring more than constant
time cannot be terminating even with probability bounded above 0, if infinitely many initial configurations
are dense: any state present initially occupies $\Omega(n)$ agents. (In particular, no leader
is allowed.) Crucially, the result holds no matter the memory or time permitted. Finally, we show
that with an initial leader, our size-estimation protocol can be made terminating with high probability,
with the same asymptotic time and space bounds.
