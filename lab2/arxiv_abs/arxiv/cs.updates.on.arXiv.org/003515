In the context of numerical solution of PDEs, dynamic mesh redistribution methods (r-adaptive
methods) are an important procedure for increasing the resolution in regions of interest, without
modifying the connectivity of the mesh. Key to the success of these methods is that the mesh should
be sufficiently refined (locally) and flexible in order to resolve evolving solution features,
but at the same time not introduce errors through skewness and lack of regularity. Some state-of-the-art
methods are bottom-up in that they attempt to prescribe both the local cell size and the alignment
to features of the solution. However, the resulting problem is overdetermined, necessitating
a compromise between these conflicting requirements. An alternative approach, described in this
paper, is to prescribe only the local cell size and augment this an optimal transport condition to
provide global regularity. This leads to a robust and flexible algorithm for generating meshes
fitted to an evolving solution, with minimal need for tuning parameters. Of particular interest
for geophysical modelling are meshes constructed on the surface of the sphere. The purpose of this
paper is to demonstrate that meshes generated on the sphere using this optimal transport approach
have good a-priori regularity and that the meshes produced are naturally aligned to various simple
features. It is further shown that the sphere's intrinsic curvature leads to more regular meshes
than the plane. In addition to these general results, we provide a wide range of examples relevant
to practical applications, to showcase the behaviour of optimally transported meshes on the sphere.
These range from axisymmetric cases that can be solved analytically to more general examples that
are tackled numerically. Evaluation of the singular values and singular vectors of the mesh transformation
provides a quantitative measure of the mesh aniso...
