The FOSS CFD-SPH code SPHERA v.9.0.0 (RSE SpA) is empowered to deal with fluid-solid body interactions
under no-slip conditions and laminar regimes for the simulation of hydrodynamic lubrication.
The code is herein validated in relation to a uniform slider bearing (i.e., for a constant lubricant
film depth) and a linear slider bearing (i.e., for a film depth with a linear profile variation along
the main flow direction). Validations refer to comparisons with analytical solutions, herein
generalized to consider any Dirichlet boundary condition. Further, this study allows a first code
validation of the fluid-fixed frontier interactions under no-slip conditions. With respect to
the most state-of-the-art models (2D codes based on Reynolds' equation for fluid films), the following
distinctive features are highlighted: (i) 3D formulation on all the terms of the Navier-Stokes
equations for incompressible fluids with uniform viscosity; (ii) validations on both local and
global quantities (pressure and velocity profiles; load-bearing capacity); (iii) possibility
to simulate any 3D topology. This study also shows the advantages of using a CFD-SPH code in simulating
the inertia and 3D effects close to the slider edges, and it opens new research directions overcoming
the limitations of the codes for hydrodynamic lubrication based on the Reynolds' equation for fluid
films. This study finally allows SPHERA to deal with hydrodynamic lubrication and empowers the
code for other relevant application fields involving fluid-structure interactions (e.g., transport
of solid bodies by floods and earth landslides; rock landslides). SPHERA is developed and distributed
on a GitHub public repository.
