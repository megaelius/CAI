Thermal preferences vary from person to person and may change over time. The objective of this paper
is to sequentially pose intelligent queries to occupants in order to optimally learn the room temperatures
which maximize their satisfaction. Our central hypothesis is that an occupant's preference relation
over room temperatures can be described using a scalar function of these temperatures, which we
call the "occupant's thermal utility function". Information about an occupant's preference over
room temperatures is available to us through their response to thermal preference queries : "prefer
warmer," "prefer cooler" and "satisfied" which we interpret as statements about the derivative
of their utility function, i.e. the utility function is "increasing", "decreasing" and "constant"
respectively. We model this hidden utility function using a Gaussian process with a built-in unimodality
constraint, i.e., the utility function has a unique maximum, and we train this model using Bayesian
inference. This permits an expected improvement based selection of next preference query to pose
to the occupant, which takes into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty)
and exploitation (sampling from areas which are likely to offer an improvement over current best
observation). We use this framework to sequentially design experiments and illustrate its benefits
by showing that it requires drastically fewer observations to learn the maximally preferred room
temperature values as compared to other methods. This framework is an important step towards the
development of intelligent HVAC systems which would be able to respond to individual occupants'
personalized thermal comfort needs. In order to encourage the use of our PE framework and ensure
reproducibility in results, we publish an implementation of our work named GPPrefElicit as an open-source
package in the Python language .
