\textit{Purpose} Estimating the interaction forces of instruments and tissue is of interest,
particularly to provide haptic feedback during robot assisted minimally invasive interventions.
Different approaches based on external and integrated force sensors have been proposed. These
are hampered by friction, sensor size, and sterilizability. We investigate a novel approach to
estimate the force vector directly from optical coherence tomography image volumes. \textit{Methods}
We introduce a novel Siamese 3D CNN architecture. The network takes an undeformed reference volume
and a deformed sample volume as an input and outputs the three components of the force vector. We employ
a deep residual architecture with bottlenecks for increased efficiency. We compare the Siamese
approach to methods using difference volumes and two-dimensional projections. Data was generated
using a robotic setup to obtain ground truth force vectors for silicon tissue phantoms as well as
porcine tissue. \textit{Results} Our method achieves a mean average error of 7.7 +- 4.3 mN when estimating
the force vector. Our novel Siamese 3D CNN architecture outperforms single-path methods that achieve
a mean average error of 11.59 +- 6.7 mN. Moreover, the use of volume data leads to significantly higher
performance compared to processing only surface information which achieves a mean average error
of 24.38 +- 22.0 mN. Based on the tissue dataset, our methods shows good generalization in between
different subjects. \textit{Conclusions} We propose a novel image-based force estimation method
using optical coherence tomography. We illustrate that capturing the deformation of subsurface
structures substantially improves force estimation. Our approach can provide accurate force
estimates in surgical setups when using intraoperative optical coherence tomography.
