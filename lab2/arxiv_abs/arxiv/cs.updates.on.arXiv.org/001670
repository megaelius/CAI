Scale selection methods based on local extrema over scale of scale-normalized derivatives have
been primarily developed to be applied sparsely --- at image points where the magnitude of a scale-normalized
differential expression additionally assumes local extrema over the domain where the data are
defined. This paper presents a methodology for performing dense scale selection, so that hypotheses
about local characteristic scales in images, temporal signals and video can be computed at every
image point and every time moment. A critical problem when designing mechanisms for dense scale
selection is that the scale at which scale-normalized differential entities assume local extrema
over scale can be strongly dependent on the local order of the locally dominant differential structure.
To address this problem, we propose a methodology where local extrema over scale are detected of
a quasi quadrature measure involving scale-space derivatives up to order two and propose two independent
mechanisms to reduce the phase dependency of the local scale estimates by: (i) introducing a second
layer of post-smoothing prior to the detection of local extrema over scale and (ii) performing local
phase compensation based on a model of the phase dependency of the local scale estimates depending
on the relative strengths between first- vs. second-order differential structure. This general
methodology is applied over three types of domains: (i) spatial images, (ii) temporal signals and
(iii) spatio-temporal video. Experiments show that the proposed methodology leads to intuitively
reasonable results with local scale estimates that reflect variations in the characteristic scale
of locally dominant structures over space and time.
