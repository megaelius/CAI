We present the Network-based Biased Tree Ensembles (NetBiTE) method for drug sensitivity prediction
and drug sensitivity biomarker identification in cancer using a combination of prior knowledge
and gene expression data. Our devised method consists of a biased tree ensemble that is built according
to a probabilistic bias weight distribution. The bias weight distribution is obtained from the
assignment of high weights to the drug targets and propagating the assigned weights over a protein-protein
interaction network such as STRING. The propagation of weights, defines neighborhoods of influence
around the drug targets and as such simulates the spread of perturbations within the cell, following
drug administration. Using a synthetic dataset, we showcase how application of biased tree ensembles
(BiTE) results in significant accuracy gains at a much lower computational cost compared to the
unbiased random forests (RF) algorithm. We then apply NetBiTE to the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity
in Cancer (GDSC) dataset and demonstrate that NetBiTE outperforms RF in predicting IC50 drug sensitivity,
only for drugs that target membrane receptor pathways (MRPs): RTK, EGFR and IGFR signaling pathways.
We propose based on the NetBiTE results, that for drugs that inhibit MRPs, the expression of target
genes prior to drug administration is a biomarker for IC50 drug sensitivity following drug administration.
We further verify and reinforce this proposition through control studies on, PI3K/MTOR signaling
pathway inhibitors, a drug category that does not target MRPs, and through assignment of dummy targets
to MRP inhibiting drugs and investigating the variation in NetBiTE accuracy.
