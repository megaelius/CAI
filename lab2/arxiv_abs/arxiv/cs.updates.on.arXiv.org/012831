Statistical shape models (SSMs) are state-of-the-art medical image analysis tools for extracting
and explaining features across a set of biological structures. However, a principled and robust
way to combine shape and pose features has been illusive due to three main issues: 1) Non-homogeneity
of the data (data with linear and non-linear natural variation across features), 2) non-optimal
representation of the $3D$ motion (rigid transformation representations that are not proportional
to the kinetic energy that move an object from one position to the other), and 3) artificial discretization
of the models. In this paper, we propose a new framework for dynamic multi-object statistical modelling
framework for the analysis of human joints in a continuous domain. Specifically, we propose to normalise
shape and dynamic spatial features in the same linearized statistical space permitting the use
of linear statistics; we adopt an optimal 3D motion representation for more accurate rigid transformation
comparisons; and we provide a 3D shape and pose prediction protocol using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
sampling-based fitting. The framework affords an efficient generative dynamic multi-object
modelling platform for biological joints. We validate the framework using a controlled synthetic
data. Finally, the framework is applied to an analysis of the human shoulder joint to compare its
performance with standard SSM approaches in prediction of shape while adding the advantage of determining
relative pose between bones in a complex. Excellent validity is observed and the shoulder joint
shape-pose prediction results suggest that the novel framework may have utility for a range of medical
image analysis applications. Furthermore, the framework is generic and can be extended to n$>$2
objects, making it suitable for clinical and diagnostic methods for the management of joint disorders.
