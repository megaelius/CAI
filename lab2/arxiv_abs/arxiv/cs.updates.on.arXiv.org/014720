SQL queries, with the AND, OR, and NOT operators, constitute a broad class of highly used queries.
Thus, their cardinality estimation is important for query optimization. In addition, a query planner
requires the set-theoretic cardinality (i.e., without duplicates) for queries with DISTINCT
as well as in planning; for example, when considering sorting options. Yet, despite the importance
of estimating query cardinalities in the presence of DISTINCT, AND, OR, and NOT, many cardinality
estimation methods are limited to estimating cardinalities of only conjunctive queries with duplicates
counted. The focus of this work is on two methods for handling this deficiency that can be applied
to any limited cardinality estimation model. First, we describe a specialized deep learning scheme,
PUNQ, which is tailored to representing conjunctive SQL queries and predicting the percentage
of unique rows in the query's result with duplicate rows. Using the predicted percentages obtained
via PUNQ, we are able to transform any cardinality estimation method that only estimates for conjunctive
queries, and which estimates cardinalities with duplicates (e.g., MSCN), to a method that estimates
queries cardinalities without duplicates. This enables estimating cardinalities of queries
with the DISTINCT keyword. In addition, we describe a recursive algorithm, GenCrd, for extending
any cardinality estimation method M that only handles conjunctive queries to one that estimates
cardinalities for more general queries (that include AND, OR, and NOT), without changing the method
M itself. Our evaluation is carried out on a challenging, real-world database with general queries
that include either the DISTINCT keyword or the AND, OR, and NOT operators. Experimentally, we show
that the proposed methods obtain accurate cardinality estimates with the same level of accuracy
as that of the original transformed methods.
