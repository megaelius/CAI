Recent applications of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to precision agriculture have shown increased
ease and efficiency in data collection at precise remote locations. However, further enhancement
of the field requires operation over long periods of time, e.g. days or weeks. This has so far been
impractical due to the limited flight times of such platforms and the requirement of humans in the
loop for operation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully autonomous rotorcraft UAS
that is capable of performing repeated flights for long-term observation missions without any
human intervention. We address two key technologies that are critical for such a system: full platform
autonomy to enable mission execution independently from human operators and the ability of vision-based
precision landing on a recharging station for automated energy replenishment. High-level autonomous
decision making is implemented as a hierarchy of master and slave state machines. Vision-based
precision landing is enabled by estimating the landing pad's pose using a bundle of AprilTag fiducials
configured for detection from a wide range of altitudes. We provide an extensive evaluation of the
landing pad pose estimation accuracy as a function of the bundle's geometry. The functionality
of the complete system is demonstrated through two indoor experiments with a duration of 11 and 10.6
hours, and one outdoor experiment with a duration of 4 hours. The UAS executed 16, 48 and 22 flights
respectively during these experiments. In the outdoor experiment, the ratio between flying to
collect data and charging was 1 to 10, which is similar to past work in this domain. All flights were
fully autonomous with no human in the loop. To our best knowledge this is the first research publication
about the long-term outdoor operation of a quadrotor system with no human interaction.
