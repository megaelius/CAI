Utility is an important concept in economics. A variety of applications consider utility in real-life
situations, which has lead to the emergence of utility-oriented mining (also called utility mining)
in the recent decade. Utility mining has attracted a great amount of attention, but most of the existing
studies have been developed to deal with itemset-based data. Time-ordered sequence data is more
commonly seen in real-world situations, which is different from itemset-based data. Since they
are time-consuming and require large amount of memory usage, current utility mining algorithms
still have limitations when dealing with sequence data. In addition, the mining efficiency of utility
mining on sequence data still needs to be improved, especially for long sequences or when there is
a low minimum utility threshold. In this paper, we propose an efficient Projection-based Utility
Mining (ProUM) approach to discover high-utility sequential patterns from sequence data. The
utility-array structure is designed to store the necessary information of the sequence-order
and utility. ProUM can significantly improve the mining efficiency by utilizing the projection
technique in generating utility-array, and it effectively reduces the memory consumption. Furthermore,
a new upper bound named sequence extension utility is proposed and several pruning strategies are
further applied to improve the efficiency of ProUM. By taking utility theory into account, the derived
high-utility sequential patterns have more insightful and interesting information than other
kinds of patterns. Experimental results showed that the proposed ProUM algorithm significantly
outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of execution time, memory usage, and scalability.
