As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question facing us is: can we even
partially reopen the economy without risking a second wave? We first need to understand if shutting
down the economy helped. And if it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the
pandemic while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand the effects
of the various interventions that can be put into place and their corresponding health and economic
implications. Since many interventions exist, the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding
the potential trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that works
best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of Synthetic Interventions (a
natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a data-driven and statistically principled method
to perform what-if scenario planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the method leverages
information from different interventions that have already been enacted across the world and fits
it to a policy maker's setting of interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting
interventions on the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a "synthetic low mobility U.S." and predict the counterfactual trajectory
of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find
that lifting severe mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions
(at retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope this provides
guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the population, strain on the healthcare
system, and impact on the economy.
