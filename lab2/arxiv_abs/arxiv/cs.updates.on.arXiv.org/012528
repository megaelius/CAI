Email is an integral part of people's work and life, enabling them to perform activities such as communicating,
searching, managing tasks and storing information. Modern email clients take a step forward and
help improve users' productivity by automatically creating reminders, tasks or responses. The
act of reading is arguably the only activity that is in common in most -- if not all -- of the interactions
that users have with their emails. In this paper, we characterize how users read their enterprise
emails, and reveal the various contextual factors that impact reading time. Our approach starts
with a reading time analysis based on the reading events from a major email platform, followed by
a user study to provide explanations for some discoveries. We identify multiple temporal and user
contextual factors that are correlated with reading time. For instance, email reading time is correlated
with user devices: on desktop reading time increases through the morning and peaks at noon but on
mobile it increases through the evening till midnight. The reading time is also negatively correlated
with the screen size. We have established the connection between user status and reading time: users
spend more time reading emails when they have fewer meetings and busy hours during the day. In addition,
we find that users also reread emails across devices. Among the cross-device reading events, 76%
of reread emails are first visited on mobile and then on desktop. Overall, our study is the first to
characterize enterprise email reading time on a very large scale. The findings provide insights
to develop better metrics and user models for understanding and improving email interactions.
