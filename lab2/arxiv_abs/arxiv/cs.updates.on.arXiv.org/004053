With the expanding growth of Arabic electronic data on the web, extracting information, which is
actually one of the major challenges of the question-answering, is essentially used for building
corpus of documents. In fact, building a corpus is a research topic that is currently referred to
among some other major themes of conferences, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as, Information
Retrieval (IR), Question-Answering (QA), Automatic Summary (AS), etc. Generally, a question-answering
system provides various passages to answer the user questions. To make these passages truly informative,
this system needs access to an underlying knowledge base; this requires the construction of a corpus.
The aim of our research is to build an Arabic question-answering system. In addition, analyzing
the question must be the first step. Next, it is essential to retrieve a passage from the web that can
serve as an appropriate answer. In this paper, we propose a method to analysis the question and retrieve
the passage answer in the Arabic language. For the question analysis, five factual question types
are processed. Additionally, our purpose is to experiment with the generation of a logic representation
from the declarative form of each question. Several studies, deal with the logic approaches in question-answering,
are discussed in other languages than the Arabic language. This representation is very promising
because it helps us later in the selection of a justifiable answer. The accuracy of questions that
are correctly analyzed and translated into the logic form achieved 64%. And then, the results of
passages of texts that are automatically generated achieved an 87% score for accuracy and a 98% score
for c@1.
