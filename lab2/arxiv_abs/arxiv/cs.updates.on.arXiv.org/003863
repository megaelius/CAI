Let $K$ be a field. We simplify and extend work of Althaler \& D\"ur on finite sequences over $K$ by
regarding $K[x^{-1},z^{-1}]$ as a $K[x,z]$ module, and studying forms in $K[x^{-1},z^{-1}]$
from first principles. Then we apply our results to finite sequences. First we define the annihilator
ideal $I_F$ of a non-zero form $F\in K[x^{-1},z^{-1}]$, a homogeneous ideal. We inductively construct
an ordered pair ($f_1$\,,\,$f_2$) of forms which generate $I_F$\,; our generators are special
in that $z$ does not divide the leading grlex monomial of $f_1$ but $z$ divides $f_2$\,, and the sum
of their total degrees is always $2-|F|$, where $|F|$ is the total degree of $F$. We show that $f_1,f_2$
is a maximal regular sequence for $I_F$, so that the height of $I_F$ is 2. The corresponding algorithm
is $\sim |F|^2/2$. The row vector obtained by accumulating intermediate forms of the construction
gives a minimal grlex Gr\"obner basis for $I_F$ for no extra computational cost other than storage
and apply this to determining $\dim_K (K[x,z] /I_F)$\,. We show that either the form vector is reduced
or a monomial of $f_1$ can be reduced by $f_2$\,. This enables us to efficiently construct the unique
reduced Gr\"obner basis for $I_F$ from the vector extension of our algorithm. Then we specialise
to the inverse form of a finite sequence, obtaining generator forms for its annihilator ideal and
a corresponding algorithm which does not use the last 'length change' of Massey. We compute the intersection
of two annihilator ideals using syzygies in $K[x,z]^5$. This improves a result of Althaler \& D\"ur.
Finally, dehomogenisation induces a one-to-one correspondence ($f_1$\,,$f_2$) $\mapsto$ (minimal
polynomial, auxiliary polynomial), the output of the author's variant of the Berlekamp-Massey
algorithm. So we can also solve the LFSR synthesis problem via the corresponding algorithm for sequences.
