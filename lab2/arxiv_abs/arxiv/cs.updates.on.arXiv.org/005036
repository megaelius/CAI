In this chapter, we present a literature survey of an emerging, cutting-edge, and multi-disciplinary
field of research at the intersection of Robotics and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) which we refer
to as Robotic Wireless Sensor Networks (RWSN). We define a RWSN as an autonomous networked multi-robot
system that aims to achieve certain sensing goals while meeting and maintaining certain communication
performance requirements, through cooperative control, learning and adaptation. While both
of the component areas, i.e., Robotics and WSN, are very well-known and well-explored, there exist
a whole set of new opportunities and research directions at the intersection of these two fields
which are relatively or even completely unexplored. One such example would be the use of a set of robotic
routers to set up a temporary communication path between a sender and a receiver that uses the controlled
mobility to the advantage of packet routing. We find that there exist only a limited number of articles
to be directly categorized as RWSN related works whereas there exist a range of articles in the robotics
and the WSN literature that are also relevant to this new field of research. To connect the dots, we
first identify the core problems and research trends related to RWSN such as connectivity, localization,
routing, and robust flow of information. Next, we classify the existing research on RWSN as well
as the relevant state-of-the-arts from robotics and WSN community according to the problems and
trends identified in the first step. Lastly, we analyze what is missing in the existing literature,
and identify topics that require more research attention in the future.
