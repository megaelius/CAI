Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
can be critical for early treatment and thus has attracted more and more attention nowadays. Since
first introduced, machine learning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related
research. Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely
used for the prediction of AD or MCI. However, before a machine learning algorithm can be applied,
image features need to be extracted to represent the MRI images. While good representations can
be pivotal to the classification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on
human labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated to AD, such as hippocampus,
amygdala, precuneus, etc. This procedure requires domain knowledge and is costly and tedious.
Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to remove manual ROI labelling
from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI images. In other words, we can let the machine learning
methods to figure out these informative and discriminative image structures for AD classification.
In this work, we propose to learn deep convolutional image features using unsupervised and supervised
learning. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the machine learning community and has
been successfully applied to various tasks. We thus propose to exploit deep features of MRI images
based on a pre-trained large convolutional neural network (CNN) for AD and MCI classification,
which spares the effort of manual ROI annotation process.
