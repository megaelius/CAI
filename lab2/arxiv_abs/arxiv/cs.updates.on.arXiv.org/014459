In this contribution, the properties of sub-stochastic matrix and super-stochastic matrix are
applied to analyze the bipartite tracking issues of multi-agent systems (MASs) over signed networks,
in which the edges with positive weight and negative weight are used to describe the cooperation
and competition among the agents, respectively. For the sake of integrity of the study, the overall
content is divided into two parts. In the first part, we examine the dynamics of bipartite tracking
for first-order MASs, second-order MASs and general linear MASs in the presence of asynchronous
interactions, respectively. Asynchronous interactions mean that each agent only interacts with
its neighbors at the instants when it wants to update the state rather than keeping compulsory consistent
with other agents. In the second part, we investigate the problems of bipartite tracing in different
practical scenarios, such as time delays, switching topologies, random networks, lossy links,
matrix disturbance, external noise disturbance, and a leader of unmeasurable velocity and acceleration.
The bipartite tracking problems of MASs under these different scenario settings can be equivalently
converted into the product convergence problems of infinite sub-stochastic matrices (ISubSM)
or infinite super-stochastic matrices (ISupSM). With the help of nonnegative matrix theory together
with some key results related to the compositions of directed edge sets, we establish systematic
algebraic-graphical methods of dealing with the product convergence of ISubSM and ISupSM. Finally,
the efficiency of the proposed methods is verified by computer simulations.
