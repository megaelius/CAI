Sepsis is a life-threatening condition affecting one million people per year in the US in which dysregulation
of the body's own immune system causes damage to its tissues, resulting in a 28 - 50% mortality rate.
Clinical trials for sepsis treatment over the last 20 years have failed to produce a single currently
FDA approved drug treatment. In this study, we attempt to discover an effective cytokine mediation
treatment strategy for sepsis using a previously developed agent-based model that simulates the
innate immune response to infection: the Innate Immune Response agent-based model (IIRABM). Previous
attempts at reducing mortality with multi-cytokine mediation using the IIRABM have failed to reduce
mortality across all patient parameterizations and motivated us to investigate whether adaptive,
personalized multi-cytokine mediation can control the trajectory of sepsis and lower patient
mortality. We used the IIRABM to compute a treatment policy in which systemic patient measurements
are used in a feedback loop to inform future treatment. Using deep reinforcement learning, we identified
a policy that achieves 0% mortality on the patient parameterization on which it was trained. More
importantly, this policy also achieves 0.8% mortality over 500 randomly selected patient parameterizations
with baseline mortalities ranging from 1 - 99% (with an average of 49%) spanning the entire clinically
plausible parameter space of the IIRABM. These results suggest that adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine
mediation therapy could be a promising approach for treating sepsis. We hope that this work motivates
researchers to consider such an approach as part of future clinical trials. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to consider adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy for
sepsis, and is the first to exploit deep reinforcement learning on a biological simulation.
