Multi-User Detection is fundamental not only to cellular wireless communication but also to Radio-Frequency
Identification (RFID) technology that supports supply chain management. The challenge of Multi-user
Detection (MUD) is that of demodulating mutually interfering signals, and the two biggest impediments
are the asynchronous character of random access and the lack of channel state information. Given
that at any time instant the number of active users is typically small, the promise of Compressive
Sensing (CS) is the demodulation of sparse superpositions of signature waveforms from very few
measurements. This paper begins by unifying two front-end architectures proposed for MUD by showing
that both lead to the same discrete signal model. Algorithms are presented for coherent and noncoherent
detection that are based on iterative matching pursuit. Noncoherent detection is all that is needed
in the application to RFID technology where it is only the identity of the active users that is required.
The coherent detector is also able to recover the transmitted symbols. It is shown that compressive
demodulation requires $\mathcal{O}(K\log N(\tau+1))$ samples to recover $K$ active users whereas
standard MUD requires $N(\tau+1)$ samples to process $N$ total users with a maximal delay $\tau$.
Performance guarantees are derived for both coherent and noncoherent detection that are identical
in the way they scale with number of active users. The power profile of the active users is shown to
be less important than the SNR of the weakest user. Gabor frames and Kerdock codes are proposed as
signature waveforms and numerical examples demonstrate the superior performance of Kerdock codes
- the same probability of error with less than half the samples.
