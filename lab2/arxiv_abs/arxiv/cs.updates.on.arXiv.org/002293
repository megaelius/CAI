Covert communication can prevent the opponent from knowing that a wireless communication has occurred.
In the additive white Gaussian noise channels, if we only take the ambient noise into account, a square
root law was obtained and the result shows that Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n})$
bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses. If additional "friendly" node closest to the adversary can produce
artificial noise to aid in hiding the communication, the covert throughput can be improved. In this
paper, we consider the covert communication in noisy wireless networks, where potential transmitters
form a stationary Poisson point process. Alice wishes to communicate covertly to Bob without being
detected by the warden Willie. In this scenario, Bob and Willie not only experience the ambient noise,
but also the aggregated interference simultaneously. Although the random interference sources
are not in collusion with Alice and Bob, our results show that uncertainty in noise and interference
experienced by Willie is beneficial to Alice. When the distance between Alice and Willie $d_{a,w}=\omega(n^{\delta/4})$
($\delta=2/\alpha$ is stability exponent), Alice can reliably and covertly transmit $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\sqrt{n})$
bits to Bob in $n$ channel uses, and there is no limitation on the transmit power of transmitters.
Although the covert throughout is lower than the square root law and the friendly jamming scheme,
the spatial throughout of the network is higher, and Alice does not presuppose to know the location
of Willie. From the network perspective, the communications are hidden in the noisy wireless networks,
and what Willie sees is merely a "\emph{shadow}" wireless network where he knows for certain some
nodes are transmitting, but he cannot catch anyone red-handed.
