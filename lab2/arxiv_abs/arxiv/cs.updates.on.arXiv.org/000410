Recent years have seen an explosion in wireless video communication systems. Optimization in such
systems is crucial - but most existing methods intended to optimize the performance of multi-user
wireless video transmission are inefficient. Some works (e.g. Network Utility Maximization (NUM))
are myopic: they choose actions to maximize instantaneous video quality while ignoring the future
impact of these actions. Such myopic solutions are known to be inferior to foresighted solutions
that optimize the long-term video quality. Alternatively, foresighted solutions such as rate-distortion
optimized packet scheduling focus on single-user wireless video transmission, while ignoring
the resource allocation among the users. In this paper, we propose an optimal solution for performing
joint foresighted resource allocation and packet scheduling among multiple users transmitting
video over a shared wireless network. A key challenge in developing foresighted solutions for multiple
video users is that the users' decisions are coupled. To decouple the users' decisions, we adopt
a novel dual decomposition approach, which differs from the conventional optimization solutions
such as NUM, and determines foresighted policies. Specifically, we propose an informationally-decentralized
algorithm in which the network manager updates resource "prices" (i.e. the dual variables associated
with the resource constraints), and the users make individual video packet scheduling decisions
based on these prices. Because a priori knowledge of the system dynamics is almost never available
at run-time, the proposed solution can learn online, concurrently with performing the foresighted
optimization. Simulation results show 7 dB and 3 dB improvements in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR) over myopic solutions and existing foresighted solutions, respectively.
