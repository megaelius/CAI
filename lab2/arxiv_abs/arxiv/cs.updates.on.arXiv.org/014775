In customer support centers, a successful service interaction involves a dialogue between a customer
and an agent. Both parties depend on one another for information and problem solving, and this interaction
defines a co-produced service process. In this paper, we propose, develop, and compare new stochastic
models for the co-production of service in a contact center. Using insights from service communication
data, we model the service interactions using self-exciting and mutually exciting bivariate Hawkes
processes, so that a correspondence from one party increases the likelihood of a response from the
other party soon after. Moreover, our models incorporate both dynamic busyness factors that depend
on the agent workload as well as dynamic factors that depend on the inner-mechanics of the interaction.
To understand how well our Hawkes models describe the message-timestamps, we compare the goodness-of-fit
of these models on contact center data from industry. We show that the word-count bivariate Hawkes
model, which takes into account the mutual interaction and the amount of information provided by
each party, fits the data the best. In addition to a great goodness-of-fit, the Hawkes models allow
us to construct explicit expressions for the relationship between the correspondence rates of
each party and the conversation progress. These formulae illustrate that the agent is more dominant
in pacing the service along in the short term, but that the customer has a more profound effect on the
duration of the conversation in the long run. Finally, we use our models to predict the future level
of activity within a given conversation, through which we find that the bivariate Hawkes processes
that incorporate the amount of information provided by each party or the sentiment expressed by
the customer give us the most accurate predictions.
