The key contribution of this paper is to propose a classification into two dimensions of the load
forecasting studies to decide which forecasting tools to use in which case. This classification
aims to provide a synthetic view of the relevant forecasting techniques and methodologies by forecasting
problem. In addition, the key principles of the main techniques and methodologies used are summarized
along with the reviews of these papers. The classification process relies on two couples of parameters
that define a forecasting problem. Each article is classified with key information about the dataset
used and the forecasting tools implemented: the forecasting techniques (probabilistic or deterministic)
and methodologies, the data cleansing techniques, and the error metrics. The process to select
the articles reviewed in this paper was conducted into two steps. First, a set of load forecasting
studies was built based on relevant load forecasting reviews and forecasting competitions. The
second step consisted in selecting the most relevant studies of this set based on the following criteria:
the quality of the description of the forecasting techniques and methodologies implemented, the
description of the results, and the contributions. This paper can be read in two passes. The first
one by identifying the forecasting problem of interest to select the corresponding class into one
of the four classification tables. Each one references all the articles classified across a forecasting
horizon. They provide a synthetic view of the forecasting tools used by articles addressing similar
forecasting problems. Then, a second level composed of four Tables summarizes key information
about the forecasting tools and the results of these studies. The second pass consists in reading
the key principles of the main techniques and methodologies of interest and the reviews of the articles.
