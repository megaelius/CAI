Quantitative characterization of disease progression using longitudinal data can provide long-term
predictions for the pathological stages of individuals. This work studies robust modeling of Alzheimer's
disease progression using parametric methods. The proposed method linearly maps individual's
chronological age to a disease progression score (DPS) and robustly fits a constrained generalized
logistic function to the longitudinal dynamic of a biomarker as a function of the DPS using M-estimation.
Robustness of the estimates is quantified using bootstrapping via Monte Carlo resampling, and
the inflection points are used to temporally order the modeled biomarkers in the disease course.
Moreover, kernel density estimation is applied to the obtained DPSs for clinical status prediction
using a Bayesian classifier. Different M-estimators and logistic functions, including a new generalized
type proposed in this study called modified Stannard, are evaluated on the ADNI database for robust
modeling of volumetric MRI and PET biomarkers, as well as neuropsychological tests. The results
show that the modified Stannard function fitted using the modified Huber loss achieves the best
modeling performance with a mean of median absolute errors (MMAE) of 0.059 across all biomarkers
and bootstraps. In addition, applied to the ADNI test set, this model achieves a multi-class area
under the ROC curve (MAUC) of 0.87 in clinical status prediction, and it significantly outperforms
an analogous state-of-the-art method with a biomarker modeling MMAE of 0.059 vs. 0.061 (p < 0.001).
Finally, the experiments show that the proposed model, trained using abundant ADNI data, generalizes
well to data from the independent NACC database, where both modeling and diagnostic performance
are significantly improved (p < 0.001) compared with using a model trained using relatively sparse
NACC data.
