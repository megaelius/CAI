Estimating pose from given 3D correspondences, including point-to-point, point-to-line and
point-to-plane correspondences, is a fundamental task in computer vision with many applications.
We present a complete solution for this task, including a solution for the minimal problem and the
least-squares problem of this task. Previous works mainly focused on finding the global minimizer
to address the least-squares problem. However, existing works that show the ability to achieve
global minimizer are still unsuitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, as one of contributions
of this paper, we prove that there exist ambiguous configurations for any number of lines and planes.
These configurations have several solutions in theory, which makes the correct solution may come
from a local minimizer. Our algorithm is efficient and able to reveal local minimizers. We employ
the Cayley-Gibbs-Rodriguez (CGR) parameterization of the rotation to derive a general rational
cost for the three cases of 3D correspondences. The main contribution of this paper is to solve the
resulting equation system of the minimal problem and the first-order optimality conditions of
the least-squares problem, both of which are of complicated rational forms. The central idea of
our algorithm is to introduce intermediate unknowns to simplify the problem. Extensive experimental
results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous algorithms when the number
of correspondences is small. Besides, when the global minimizer is the solution, our algorithm
achieves the same accuracy as previous algorithms that have guaranteed global optimality, but
our algorithm is applicable to real-time applications.
