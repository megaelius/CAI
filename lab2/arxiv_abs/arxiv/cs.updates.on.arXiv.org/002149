In patients with coronary artery stenoses of intermediate severity, the functional significance
needs to be determined. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement, performed during invasive
coronary angiography (ICA), is most often used in clinical practice. To reduce the number of ICA
procedures, we present a method for automatic identification of patients with functionally significant
coronary artery stenoses, employing deep learning analysis of the left ventricle (LV) myocardium
in rest coronary CT angiography (CCTA). The study includes consecutively acquired CCTA scans of
166 patients with FFR measurements. To identify patients with a functionally significant coronary
artery stenosis, analysis is performed in several stages. First, the LV myocardium is segmented
using a multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN). To characterize the segmented LV myocardium,
it is subsequently encoded using unsupervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Thereafter,
patients are classified according to the presence of functionally significant stenosis using
an SVM classifier based on the extracted and clustered encodings. Quantitative evaluation of LV
myocardium segmentation in 20 images resulted in an average Dice coefficient of 0.91 and an average
mean absolute distance between the segmented and reference LV boundaries of 0.7 mm. Classification
of patients was evaluated in the remaining 126 CCTA scans in 50 10-fold cross-validation experiments
and resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 +- 0.02. At sensitivity
levels 0.60, 0.70 and 0.80, the corresponding specificity was 0.77, 0.71 and 0.59, respectively.
The results demonstrate that automatic analysis of the LV myocardium in a single CCTA scan acquired
at rest, without assessment of the anatomy of the coronary arteries, can be used to identify patients
with functionally significant coronary artery stenosis.
