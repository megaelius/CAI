Motivated by recent concerns that queuing delays in the Internet are on the rise, we conduct a performance
evaluation of Compound TCP (C-TCP) in two topologies: a single bottleneck and a multi-bottleneck
topology, under different traffic scenarios. The first topology consists of a single bottleneck
router, and the second consists of two distinct sets of TCP flows, regulated by two edge routers,
feeding into a common core router. We focus on some dynamical and statistical properties of the underlying
system. From a dynamical perspective, we develop fluid models in a regime wherein the number of flows
is large, bandwidth-delay product is high, buffers are dimensioned small (independent of the bandwidth-delay
product) and routers deploy a Drop-Tail queue policy. A detailed local stability analysis for these
models yields the following key insight: smaller buffers favour stability. Additionally, we highlight
that larger buffers, in addition to increasing latency, are prone to inducing limit cycles in the
system dynamics, via a Hopf bifurcation. These limit cycles in turn cause synchronisation among
the TCP flows, and also result in a loss of link utilisation. For the topologies considered, we also
empirically analyse some statistical properties of the bottleneck queues. These statistical
analyses serve to validate an important modelling assumption: that in the regime considered, each
bottleneck queue may be approximated as either an $M/M/1/B$ or an $M/D/1/B$ queue. This immediately
makes the modelling perspective attractive and the analysis tractable. Finally, we show that smaller
buffers, in addition to ensuring stability and low latency, would also yield fairly good system
performance, in terms of throughput and flow completion times.
