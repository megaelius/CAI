Metasurfaces have drawn significant attentions due to their superior capability in tailoring
electromagnetic waves with a wide frequency range, from microwave to visible light. Recently,
programmable metasurfaces have demonstrated the ability of manipulating the amplitude or phase
of electromagnetic waves in a programmable manner in real time, which renders them especially appealing
in the applications of wireless communications. To practically demonstrate the feasibility of
programmable metasurfaces in future communication systems, in this paper, we design and realize
a novel metasurface-based wireless communication system. By exploiting the dynamically controllable
property of programmable metasurface, we firstly introduce the fundamental principle of the metasurface-based
wireless communication system design. We then present the design, implementation and experimental
evaluation of the proposed metasurface-based wireless communication system with a prototype,
which realizes single carrier quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) transmission over the air.
In the developed prototype, the phase of the reflected electromagnetic wave of programmable metasurface
is directly manipulated in real time according to the baseband control signal, which achieves 2.048
Mbps data transfer rate with video streaming transmission over the air. Experimental result is
provided to compare the performance of the proposed metasurface-based architecture against the
conventional one. With the slight increase of the transmit power by 5 dB, the same bit error rate (BER)
performance can be achieved as the conventional system in the absence of channel coding. Such a result
is encouraging considering that the metasurface-based system has the advantages of low hardware
cost and simple structure, thus leading to a promising new architecture for wireless communications.
