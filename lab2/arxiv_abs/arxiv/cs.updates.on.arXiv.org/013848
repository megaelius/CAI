Objective: This paper aims to demonstrate functional discriminability among restored hand sensations
with different locations, qualities, and intensities that are evoked by microelectrode stimulation
of residual afferent fibers in human amputees. Methods: We implanted a Utah Slanted Electrode Array
(USEA) in the median and ulnar residual arm nerves of three transradial amputees and delivered stimulation
via different electrodes and at different frequencies to produce various locations, qualities,
and intensities of sensation on the missing hand. Blind discrimination trials were performed to
determine how well subjects could discriminate among these restored sensations. Results: Subjects
discriminated among restored sensory percepts with varying cutaneous and proprioceptive locations,
qualities, and intensities in blind trials, including discrimination among up to 10 different
location-intensity combinations (15/30 successes, p < 0.0005). Variations in the site of stimulation
within the nerve, via electrode selection, enabled discrimination among up to 5 locations and qualities
(35/35 successes, p < 0.0001). Variations in the stimulation frequency enabled discrimination
among 4 different intensities at the same location (13/20 successes, p < 0.005). One subject discriminated
among simultaneous, alternating, and isolated stimulation of two different USEA electrodes,
as may be desired during multi-sensor closed-loop prosthesis use (20/25 successes, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: USEA stimulation enables encoding of a diversity of functionally discriminable sensations
with different locations, qualities, and intensities. Significance: These percepts provide
a potentially rich source of sensory feedback that may enhance performance and embodiment during
multi-sensor, closed-loop prosthesis use.
