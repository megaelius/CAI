Glioma is one of the most common and aggressive types of primary brain tumors. The accurate segmentation
of subcortical brain structures is crucial to the study of gliomas in that it helps the monitoring
of the progression of gliomas and aids the evaluation of treatment outcomes. However, the large
amount of required human labor makes it difficult to obtain the manually segmented Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) data, limiting the use of precise quantitative measurements in the clinical practice.
In this work, we try to address this problem by developing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network~(3D
CNN) based model to automatically segment gliomas. The major difficulty of our segmentation model
comes with the fact that the location, structure, and shape of gliomas vary significantly among
different patients. In order to accurately classify each voxel, our model captures multi-scale
contextual information by extracting features from two scales of receptive fields. To fully exploit
the tumor structure, we propose a novel architecture that hierarchically segments different lesion
regions of the necrotic and non-enhancing tumor~(NCR/NET), peritumoral edema~(ED) and GD-enhancing
tumor~(ET). Additionally, we utilize densely connected convolutional blocks to further boost
the performance. We train our model with a patch-wise training schema to mitigate the class imbalance
problem. The proposed method is validated on the BraTS 2017 dataset~\cite{DBLP:journals/tmi/MenzeJBKFKBPSWL15}
and it achieves Dice scores of 0.72, 0.83 and 0.81 for the complete tumor, tumor core and enhancing
tumor, respectively. These results are comparable to the reported state-of-the-art results,
and our method is better than existing 3D-based methods in terms of compactness, time and space efficiency.
