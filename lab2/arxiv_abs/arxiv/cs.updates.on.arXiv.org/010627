Traffic forecasting approaches are critical to developing adaptive strategies for mobility.
Traffic patterns have complex spatial and temporal dependencies that make accurate forecasting
on large highway networks a challenging task. Recently, diffusion convolutional recurrent neural
networks (DCRNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic forecasting by capturing
the spatiotemporal dynamics of the traffic. Despite the promising results, adopting DCRNN for
large highway networks still remains elusive because of computational and memory bottlenecks.
We present an approach to apply DCRNN for a large highway network. We use a graph-partitioning approach
to decompose a large highway network into smaller networks and train them simultaneously on a cluster
with graphics processing units (GPU). For the first time, we forecast the traffic of the entire California
highway network with 11,160 traffic sensor locations simultaneously. We show that our approach
can be trained within 3 hours of wall-clock time using 64 GPUs to forecast speed with high accuracy.
Further improvements in the accuracy are attained by including overlapping sensor locations from
nearby partitions and finding high-performing hyperparameter configurations for the DCRNN using
DeepHyper, a hyperparameter tuning package. We demonstrate that a single DCRNN model can be used
to train and forecast the speed and flow simultaneously and the results preserve fundamental traffic
flow dynamics. We expect our approach for modeling a large highway network in short wall-clock time
as a potential core capability in advanced highway traffic monitoring systems, where forecasts
can be used to adjust traffic management strategies proactively given anticipated future conditions.
