The problem of mobile sequential recommendation is presented to suggest a route connecting some
pick-up points for a taxi driver so that he/she is more likely to get passengers with less travel cost.
Essentially, a key challenge of this problem is its high computational complexity. In this paper,
we propose a dynamical programming based method to solve this problem. Our method consists of two
separate stages: an offline pre-processing stage and an online search stage. The offline stage
pre-computes optimal potential sequence candidates from a set of pick-up points, and the online
stage selects the optimal driving route based on the pre-computed sequences with the current position
of an empty taxi. Specifically, for the offline pre-computation, a backward incremental sequence
generation algorithm is proposed based on the iterative property of the cost function. Simultaneously,
an incremental pruning policy is adopted in the process of sequence generation to reduce the search
space of the potential sequences effectively. In addition, a batch pruning algorithm can also be
applied to the generated potential sequences to remove the non-optimal ones of a certain length.
Since the pruning effect continuously increases with the increase of the sequence length, our method
can search the optimal driving route efficiently in the remaining potential sequence candidates.
Experimental results on real and synthetic data sets show that the pruning percentage of our method
is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods, which makes our method can
be used to handle the problem of mobile sequential recommendation with more pick-up points and to
search the optimal driving routes in arbitrary length ranges.
