Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) constitutes a fundamental asset for wide-areas monitoring with
high-resolution requirements. The first SAR sensors have given rise to coarse coastal and maritime
monitoring applications, including oil spill, ship and ice floes detection. With the upgrade to
very high-resolution sensors in the recent years, with relatively new SAR missions such as Sentinel-1,
a great deal of data providing a stronger information content has been released, enabling more refined
studies on general targets features and thus permitting complex classifications, as for ship classification,
which has become increasingly relevant given the growing need for coastal surveillance in commercial
and military segments. In the last decade, several works focused on this topic have been presented,
generally based on radiometric features processing; furthermore, in the very recent years a significant
amount of research works have focused on emerging deep learning techniques, in particular on Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN). Recently Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) have been presented, demonstrating
a notable improvement in capturing the properties of given entities, improving the use of spatial
informations, in particular of spatial dependence between features, a severely lacking feature
in CNNs. In fact, CNNs pooling operations have been criticized for losing spatial relations, thus
special capsules, along with a new iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism, have been proposed.
In this work a comparison between Capsule and CNNs potential in the ship classification application
domain is shown, by leveraging the OpenSARShip, a SAR Sentinel-1 ship chips dataset; in particular,
a performance comparison between capsule and various convolutional architectures is built, demonstrating
better performances of CapsNet in classifying ships within a small dataset.
