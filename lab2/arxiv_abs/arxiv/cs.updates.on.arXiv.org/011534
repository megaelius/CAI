Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology has dramatically promoted many promising
applications to enhance traffic safety, mobility, and sustainability. However, However, we still
lack the understanding of some fundamental properties of V2V technology under urban traffic conditions,
such as interference at traffic intersections. Motivated by this view, this study develops the
mathematical formulations to capture the worst-case interference at traffic intersections,
considering the macroscopic traffic flow conditions and critical road geometric features including
intersection diameter D, and intersection angle {\alpha}. Built upon these formulations, we develop
a mathematical model to approximate a conservative transmission range to sustain the successful
V2V transmission at a traffic intersection. Our experiments illustrate that the proposed analytical
formulations can provide accurate approximations for the interference and the corresponding
transmission range at orthogonal (non-orthogonal) traffic intersections under various traffic
congestion levels. Furthermore, this study conducted other experiments to understand how intersection
geometric features (such as (D, {\alpha})) impact V2V communication at traffic intersections.
The results illustrate that severer interference and smaller transmission range occur at a smaller
intersection (with smaller diameter D) under heavy traffic congestion level. And the orthogonal
intersection gives critical thresholds (such as severest interference and minimum transmission
range) under all different traffic conditions, which help in understanding the V2V communication
performance at an urban traffic intersection. These findings will potentially help to develop
efficient MAC algorithms adaptive to urban traffic conditions, and further support various ITS
applications using V2V communication. interference and transmission range.
