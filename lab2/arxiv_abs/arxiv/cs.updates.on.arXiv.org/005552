Combinatorial interaction testing is an important software testing technique that has seen lots
of recent interest. It can reduce the number of test cases needed by considering interactions between
combinations of input parameters. Empirical evidence shows that it effectively detects faults,
in particular, for highly configurable software systems. In real-world software testing, the
input variables may vary in how strongly they interact, variable strength combinatorial interaction
testing (VS-CIT) can exploit this for higher effectiveness. The generation of variable strength
test suites is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard computational problem \cite{BestounKamalFuzzy2017}.
Research has shown that stochastic population-based algorithms such as particle swarm optimization
(PSO) can be efficient compared to alternatives for VS-CIT problems. Nevertheless, they require
detailed control for the exploitation and exploration trade-off to avoid premature convergence
(i.e. being trapped in local optima) as well as to enhance the solution diversity. Here, we present
a new variant of PSO based on Mamdani fuzzy inference system \cite{Camastra2015,TSAKIRIDIS2017257,KHOSRAVANIAN2016280},
to permit adaptive selection of its global and local search operations. We detail the design of this
combined algorithm and evaluate it through experiments on multiple synthetic and benchmark problems.
We conclude that fuzzy adaptive selection of global and local search operations is, at least, feasible
as it performs only second-best to a discrete variant of PSO, called DPSO. Concerning obtaining
the best mean test suite size, the fuzzy adaptation even outperforms DPSO occasionally. We discuss
the reasons behind this performance and outline relevant areas of future work.
