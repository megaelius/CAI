In this paper, we investigate a distributed estimation problem for multi-agent systems with state
equality constraints (SEC). First, under a time-based consensus communication protocol, applying
a modified projection operator and the covariance intersection fusion method, we propose a distributed
Kalman filter with guaranteed consistency and satisfied SEC. Furthermore, we establish the relationship
between consensus step, SEC and estimation error covariance in dynamic and steady processes, respectively.
Employing a space decomposition method, we show the error covariance in the constraint set can be
arbitrarily small by setting a sufficiently large consensus step. Besides, we propose an extended
collective observability (ECO) condition based on SEC, which is milder than existing observability
conditions. Under the ECO condition, through utilizing a technique of matrix approximation, we
prove the boundedness of error covariance and the exponentially asymptotic unbiasedness of state
estimate, respectively. Moreover, under the ECO condition for linear time-invariant systems
with SEC, we provide a novel event-triggered communication protocol by employing the consistency,
and give an offline design principle of triggering thresholds with guaranteed boundedness of error
covariance. More importantly, we quantify and analyze the communication rate for the proposed
event-triggered distributed Kalman filter, and provide optimization based methods to obtain
the minimal (maximal) successive non-triggering (triggering) times. Two simulations are provided
to demonstrate the developed theoretical results and the effectiveness of the filters.
