Real-World networks have an inherently dynamic structure and are often composed of communities
that are constantly changing in membership. Identifying these communities is of great importance
when analyzing structural properties of networks. Hence, recent years have witnessed intense
research in of solving the challenging problem of detecting such evolving communities. The mainstream
approach towards community detection involves optimization of a global partition quality metric
(e.g. modularity) over the network. Another technique, Spectral Clustering, involves mapping
of original data points in a lower dimensional space, where the clustering properties of a graph
are much more evident, and then applying standard clustering techniques for identifying communities.
However, the traditional spectral clustering techniques cannot naturally learn the number of
communities in networks. These techniques are based on external community connectivity properties,
and often fail to identify smaller community structures in dense networks. In this article, we propose
an algorithm, namely, the Cascaded Stackelberg Community Detection Algorithm (CASCODE) inspired
by the Stackelberg Duopoly Game. This algorithm uses the notion of a leader-follower relationship
between the nodes to influence the actions of either. The intuition of the algorithm is based on the
natural expected internal structure in evolving communities in networks. Thus, the algorithm
is able to naturally learn the number of communities in a network in contrast with other techniques
such as Spectral Clustering, which require the expected number of communities as an input. Because
this Stackelberg Model-based Community Detection algorithm detects communities through their
internal structure, we are able to obtain a finer community structure resolution in dense networks.
