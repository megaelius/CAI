Under the paradigm of Edge Computing (EC), a Network Operator (NO) deploys computational resources
at the network edge and let third-party services run on top of them. Besides the clear advantages
for Service Providers (SPs) and final users thanks to the vicinity of computation nodes, a NO aims
to allocate edge resources in order to increase its own utility, including bandwidth saving, operational
cost reduction, QoE for its user, etc. However, while the number of third-party services competing
for edge resources is expected to dramatically grow, the resources deployed cannot increase accordingly
due to physical limitations. Therefore, other strategies are needed to fully exploit the potential
of EC, despite its constrains. To this aim we propose to leverage \emph{service adaptability},
a dimension that has mainly been neglected so far. Each service can adapt to the amount of resources
that the NO has allocated to it, balancing the fraction of service computation performed locally
at the edge and relying on remote servers, e.g., in the Cloud, for the rest. We propose \emph{EdgeMORE},
a resource allocation strategy in which SPs declare the different configurations to which they
are able to adapt, specifying the resources needed and the expected utility. The NO then chooses
the most convenient option per each SP, in order to maximize the total utility. We formalize EdgeMORE
as a Integer Linear Programming and we propose a polynomial time heuristic. We show via simulation
that, by letting SPs declare their ability to adapt to different constrained configurations and
letting the NO choose between them, EdgeMORE greatly improves EC utility and resource utilization.
