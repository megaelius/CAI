Modern networked systems are constantly under threat from systemic attacks. There has been a massive
upsurge in the number of devices connected to a network as well as the associated traffic volume.
This has intensified the need to better understand all possible attack vectors during system design
and implementation. Further, it has increased the need to mine large data sets, analyzing which
has become a daunting task. It is critical to scale monitoring infrastructures to match this need,
but a difficult goal for the small and medium organization. Hence, there is a need to propose novel
approaches that address the big data problem in security. Information Centrality (IC) labels network
nodes with better vantage points for detecting network-based anomalies as central nodes and uses
them for detecting a category of attacks called systemic attacks. The main idea is that since these
central nodes already see a lot of information flowing through the network, they are in a good position
to detect anomalies before other nodes. This research first dives into the importance of using graphs
in understanding the topology and information flow. We then introduce the usage of information
centrality, a centrality-based index, to reduce data collection in existing communication networks.
Using IC-identified central nodes can accelerate outlier detection when armed with a suitable
anomaly detection technique. We also come up with a more efficient way to compute Information centrality
for large networks. Finally, we demonstrate that central nodes detect anomalous behavior much
faster than other non-central nodes, given the anomalous behavior is systemic in nature.
