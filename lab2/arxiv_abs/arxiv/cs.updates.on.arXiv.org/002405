Power analysis is a branch of side channel attacks where power consumption data is used as the side
channel to attack the system. First using a device like an oscilloscope power traces are collected
when the cryptographic device is doing the cryptographic operation. Then those traces are statistically
analysed using methods such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) to derive the secret key of the system.
Being possible to break Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in few minutes, power analysis attacks
have become a serious security issue for cryptographic devices such as smart card. As the first phase
of our project, we build a testbed for doing research on power analysis attacks. As power analysis
is a practical type of attack in order to do any research, a testbed is the first requirement. Since
building a test bed is a complicated process, having a pre-built testbed would save the time of future
researchers. The second phase of our project is to attack the latest cryptographic algorithm called
Speck which has been released by National Security Agency (NSA) for use in embedded systems. In spite
it has lot of differences to AES making impossible to directly use the power analysis approach used
for AES, we introduce novel approaches to break Speck in less than an hour. In the third phase of the
project, we select few already introduced countermeasures and practically attack them on our testbed
to do a comparative analysis. We show that software countermeasures such as random instruction
injection and randomly shuffling S-boxes are good enough for their simplicity and cost. But we identify
the possible threat due to the problem of generating a good seed for the pseudo-random algorithm
running on the microcontroller. We attempt to address this issue by using a hardware-based true
random generator that amplifies a random electrical signal and samples to generate a proper seed.
