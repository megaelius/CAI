We leverage automatic differentiation (AD) and probabilistic programming to develop an end-to-end
optimization algorithm for batch triangulation of a large number of unknown objects. Given noisy
detections extracted from noisily geo-located street level imagery without depth information,
we jointly estimate the number and location of objects of different types, together with parameters
for sensor noise characteristics and prior distribution of objects conditioned on side information.
The entire algorithm is framed as nested stochastic variational inference. An inner loop solves
a soft data association problem via loopy belief propagation; a middle loop performs soft EM clustering
using a regularized Newton solver (leveraging an AD framework); an outer loop backpropagates through
the inner loops to train global parameters. We place priors over sensor parameters for different
traffic object types, and demonstrate improvements with richer priors incorporating knowledge
of the environment. We test our algorithm on detections of road signs observed by cars with mounted
cameras, though in practice this technique can be used for any geo-tagged images. The detections
were extracted by neural image detectors and classifiers, and we independently triangulate each
type of sign (e.g. stop, traffic light). We find that our model is more robust to DNN misclassifications
than current methods, generalizes across sign types, and can use geometric information to increase
precision. Our algorithm outperforms our current production baseline based on k-means clustering.
We show that variational inference training allows generalization by learning sign-specific
parameters.
