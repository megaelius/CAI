Privacy has been a major concern for everybody over the internet. Governments across the globe have
given their views on how the internet space can be managed effectively so that there is some control
on the flow of confidential information and privacy to users and as well as to data is achieved. Taking
advantage of the lack of one unified body that could govern the online space with its strict and stringent
rules certain websites use the text files called cookies in collecting data from users and using
them for marketing them in advertisements networks and third party websites with the help of JavaScript
and flash technologies. Even before many of us think what is happening around us in the online usage
we are being invaded by the cookies and are targeted with their specific information that could tempt
us to buy a product or service to which we were longing for in the recent past. Though it may be argued
its a kind of marketing strategy to give the customer what he wants but it can no way be something like
the user is just being targeted because he has already shown interest in something and he should be
disturbed until he gets hold of something. Its purely a security breach as most of the websites dont
ask permission for the usage of cookies and setting them into the users browser and the most important
thing is no privacy statement is issued that the information is used for targeted marketing. This
analysis paper has views from different sources, an example of such an activity that is a potential
security breach and various other information of what these sites do to use the deadly cookies for
commercial tricks.
