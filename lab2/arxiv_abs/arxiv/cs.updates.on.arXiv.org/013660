The aim of this work is to provide a family of qualitative theories for spatial change in general,
and for motion of spatial scenes in particular. To achieve this, we consider a spatio-temporalisation
MTALC(Dx), of the well-known ALC(D) family of Description Logics (DLs) with a concrete domain:
the MTALC(Dx) concepts are interpreted over infinite k-ary Sigma-trees, with the nodes standing
for time points, and Sigma including, additionally to its uses in classical k-ary Sigma-trees,
the description of the snapshot of an n-object spatial scene of interest; the roles split into m+n
immediate-successor (accessibility) relations, which are serial, irreflexive and antisymmetric,
and of which m are general, not necessarily functional, the other n functional; the concrete domain
Dx is generated by an RCC8-like spatial Relation Algebra (RA) x, and is used to guide the change by
imposing spatial constraints on objects of the "followed" spatial scene, eventually at different
time points of the input trees. In order to capture the expressiveness of most modal temporal logics
encountered in the literature, we introduce weakly cyclic Terminological Boxes (TBoxes) of MTALC(Dx),
whose axioms capture the decreasing property of modal temporal operators. We show the important
result that satisfiability of an MTALC(Dx) concept with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox can be reduced
to the emptiness problem of a Buchi weak alternating automaton augmented with spatial constraints.
In another work, complementary to this one, also submitted to this conference, we thoroughly investigate
Buchi automata augmented with spatial constraints, and provide, in particular, a translation
of an alternating into a nondeterministic, and an effective decision procedure for the emptiness
problem of the latter.
