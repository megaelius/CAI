A connected component of a vertex-coloured graph is said to be colourful if all its vertices have
different colours, and a graph is colourful if all its connected components are colourful. Given
a vertex-coloured graph, the Colourful Components problem asks whether there exist at most $p$
edges whose removal makes the graph colourful, and the Colourful Partition problem asks whether
there exists a partition of the vertex set with at most $p$ parts such that each part induces a colourful
component. We study the problems on $k$-caterpillars (caterpillars with hairs of length at most
$k$) and explore the boundary between polynomial and NP-complete cases. It is known that the problems
are NP-complete on $2$-caterpillars with unbounded maximum degree. We prove that both problems
remain NP-complete on binary $4$-caterpillars and on ternary $3$-caterpillars. This answers
an open question regarding the complexity of the problems on trees with maximum degree at most $5$.
On the positive side, we give a linear time algorithm for $1$-caterpillars with unbounded degree,
even if the backbone is a cycle, which outperforms the previous best complexity on paths and widens
the class of graphs. Finally, we answer an open question regarding the complexity of Colourful Components
on graphs with maximum degree at most $5$. We show that the problem is NP-complete on $5$-coloured
planar graphs with maximum degree $4$, and on $12$-coloured planar graphs with maximum degree $3$.
Since the problem can be solved in polynomial-time on graphs with maximum degree $2$, the results
are the best possible with regard to the maximum degree.
