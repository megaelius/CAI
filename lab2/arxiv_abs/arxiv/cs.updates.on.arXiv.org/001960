Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) as an emerging paradigm utilizing cloudlet or fog nodes to extend remote
cloud computing to the edge of the network, is foreseen as a key technology towards next generation
wireless networks. By offloading computation intensive tasks from resource constrained mobile
devices to fog nodes or the remote cloud, the energy of mobile devices can be saved and the computation
capability can be enhanced. For fog nodes, they can rent the resource rich remote cloud to help them
process incoming tasks from mobile devices. In this architecture, the benefit of short computation
and computation delay of mobile devices can be fully exploited. However, existing studies mostly
assume fog nodes possess unlimited computing capacity, which is not practical, especially when
fog nodes are also energy constrained mobile devices. To provide incentive of fog nodes and reduce
the computation cost of mobile devices, we provide a cost effective offloading scheme in mobile
edge computing with the cooperation between fog nodes and the remote cloud with task dependency
constraint. The mobile devices have limited budget and have to determine which task should be computed
locally or sent to the fog. To address this issue, we first formulate the offloading problem as a task
finish time inimization problem with given budgets of mobile devices, which is NP-hard. We then
devise two more algorithms to study the network performance. Simulation results show that the proposed
greedy algorithm can achieve the near optimal performance. On average, the Brute Force method and
the greedy algorithm outperform the simulated annealing algorithm by about 28.13% on the application
finish time.
