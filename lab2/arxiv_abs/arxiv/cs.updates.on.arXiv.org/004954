I present a generalization of Chew's first algorithm for Delaunay mesh refinement. In his algorithm,
Chew splits the line segments of the input planar straight line graph (PSLG) into shorter subsegments
whose lengths are nearly identical. The constrained Delaunay triangulation of the subsegments
is refined based on the length of the radii of the circumcircles of the triangles. This algorithm
produces a uniform mesh, whose minimum angle can be at most $\pi/6$. My algorithm generates both
truly Delaunay and constrained Delaunay size-optimal meshes. In my algorithm, I split the line
segments of the input PSLG such that their lengths are asymptotically proportional to the local
feature size (LFS) by solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that map points from a closed
1D interval to points on the input line segments in the PSLG. I then refine the Delaunay triangulation
(truly or constrained) of the PSLG by inserting off-center Steiner vertices of "skinny" triangles
while prioritizing such triangles with shortest edges first. As in Chew's algorithm, I show that
the Steiner vertices do not encroach upon any subsegment of the PSLG. The off-center insertion algorithm
places Steiner vertices in an advancing front manner such that we obtain a size-optimal Delaunay
mesh (truly or constrained) if the desired minimum angle is less than $\pi/6$. In addition, even
in the presence of a small angle $\phi < \pi/2$ in the PSLG, the bound on the minimum angle "across"
the small angle tends to $\arctan{((\sin{\phi})/(2-\cos(\phi))}$ as the PSLG is progressively
refined. Also, the bound on the maximum angle across any small input angle tends to $\pi/2 + \phi/2$
as the PSLG is progressively refined.
