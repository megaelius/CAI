Drug-drug interactions are preventable causes of medical injuries and often result in doctor and
emergency room visits. Computational techniques can be used to predict potential drug-drug interactions.
We approach the drug-drug interaction prediction problem as a link prediction problem and present
two novel methods for drug-drug interaction prediction based on artificial neural networks and
factor propagation over graph nodes: adjacency matrix factorization (AMF) and adjacency matrix
factorization with propagation (AMFP). We conduct a retrospective analysis by training our models
on a previous release of the DrugBank database with 1,141 drugs and 45,296 drug-drug interactions
and evaluate the results on a later version of DrugBank with 1,440 drugs and 248,146 drug-drug interactions.
Additionally, we perform a holdout analysis using DrugBank. We report an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve score of 0.807 and 0.990 for the retrospective and holdout analyses
respectively. Finally, we create an ensemble-based classifier using AMF, AMFP, and existing link
prediction methods and obtain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.814
and 0.991 for the retrospective and the holdout analyses. We demonstrate that AMF and AMFP provide
state of the art results compared to existing methods and that the ensemble-based classifier improves
the performance by combining various predictors. These results suggest that AMF, AMFP, and the
proposed ensemble-based classifier can provide important information during drug development
and regarding drug prescription given only partial or noisy data. These methods can also be used
to solve other link prediction problems. Drug embeddings (compressed representations) created
when training our models using the interaction network have been made public.
