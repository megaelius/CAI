Public goods are often either over-consumed in the absence of regulatory mechanisms, or remain
completely unused, as in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic, where social distance constraints are
enforced to limit the number of people who can share public spaces. In this work, we plug this gap through
market based mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods.
To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein each agent in the economy
is endowed with an artificial currency budget that they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher
markets provide a strong methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their
applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints - budgets of individual
buyers and capacities of goods. The presence of additional physical constraints that arise in public
goods allocation problems motivates the need for modifications to the Fisher market framework
to account for these more general set of constraints. In our market mechanism, we specifically modify
the Fisher market social optimization problem through a perturbation of the budgets of agents.
The budget perturbations are set based on the dual variables of the additional physical constraints
such that the KKT conditions of the newly defined social and individual optimization problems are
equivalent. This establishes that our mechanism sets market clearing prices such that each agent
obtains their maximum possible utilities subject to their constraints. Finally, to compute the
perturbation constants we present a fixed point scheme, establish the existence of a unique fixed
point and present numerical experiments to illustrate convergence guarantees. Thus, our mechanism,
both theoretically and computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of Fisher markets,
which only consider capacity and budget constraints.
