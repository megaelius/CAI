Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) generate valuable knowledge about network security, but an
abundance of false alarms and a lack of methods to capture the interdependence among alerts hampers
their utility for network defense. Here, we explore a graph-based approach for fusing alerts generated
by multiple IDSs (e.g., Snort, OSSEC, and Bro). Our approach generates a weighted graph of alert
fields (not network topology) that makes explicit the connections between multiple alerts, IDS
systems, and other cyber artifacts. We use this multi-modal graph to identify anomalous changes
in the alert patterns of a network. To detect the anomalies, we apply the role-dynamics approach,
which has successfully identified anomalies in social media, email, and IP communication graphs.
In the cyber domain, each node (alert field) in the fused IDS alert graph is assigned a probability
distribution across a small set of roles based on that node's features. A cyber attack should trigger
IDS alerts and cause changes in the node features, but rather than track every feature for every alert-field
node individually, roles provide a succinct, integrated summary of those feature changes. We measure
changes in each node's probabilistic role assignment over time, and identify anomalies as deviations
from expected roles. We test our approach using simulations including three weeks of normal background
traffic, as well as cyber attacks that occur near the end of the simulations. This paper presents
a novel approach to multi-modal data fusion and a novel application of role dynamics within the cyber-security
domain. Our results show a drastic decrease in the false-positive rate when considering our anomaly
indicator instead of the IDS alerts themselves, thereby reducing alarm fatigue and providing a
promising avenue for threat intelligence in network defense.
