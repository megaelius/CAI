The world's digital transformation has influenced not only the way we do business, but also the way
we perform daily activities. In fact, the past Presidential elections in the United States as well
as those in Great Britain (Brexit) and in Colombia (peace agreement referendum) are proof that social
media play an important part in modern politics. In fact, this digital political field is filled
by political movements and political candidates looking for popular support (number of followers),
regular citizens' messages discussing social issues (trending topics flooding social media),
or even political propaganda in favor or against politicians or political movements (advertisement).
One of the issues with social media in this era is the presence of automatic accounts (bots) that artificially
fill accounts with fake followers, create false trending topics, and share fake news or simply flood
the net with propaganda. All this artificial information may influence people and sometimes may
even censor people's real opinions undermining their freedom of speech. In this paper, we propose
a methodology to track elections and a set of tools used to collect and analyze election data. In particular,
this paper discusses our experiences during the Presidential Elections in Ecuador held in 2017.
In fact, we show how all candidates prepared an online campaign in social media (Twitter) and how
the political campaign altered a common follower rate subscription. We discuss that the high presence
of followers during the period between the first and second round of elections may be altered by automatic
accounts. Finally, we use bot detection systems and gathered more than 30,000 political motivated
bots. In our data analysis, we show that these bots were mainly used for propaganda purposes in favor
or against a particular candidate.
