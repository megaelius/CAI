Contact tracing is of paramount importance when it comes to preventing the spreading of infectious
diseases. Contact tracing is usually performed manually by authorized personnel. Manual contact
tracing is an inefficient, error-prone, time-consuming process of limited utility to the population
at large as those in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days, later.
This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The proposed Smart Contact
Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine
learning classifier to accurately and quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution
is two-fold: a) classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity
sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications protocol. SCT leverages
BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast a signature packet when the user is in the
public space. Both broadcasted and observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and
they are only uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public health authorities
to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each smartphone estimates its distance from
other user's phones and issues real-time alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The
paper includes extensive experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative
evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that a decision tree
classifier outperforms other states of the art classification methods in terms of accuracy. Lastly,
to facilitate research in this area, and to contribute to the timely development of advanced solutions
the entire data set of six experiments with about 123,000 data points is made publicly available.
