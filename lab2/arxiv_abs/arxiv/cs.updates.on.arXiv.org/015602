In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic statistics solution or artificial intelligence (AI)
approach to identify and quantify permanent (non-zero strain) continuum/material deformation
only based on the scanned material data in the spatial configuration and the shape of the initial
design configuration or the material configuration. The challenge of this problem is that we only
know the scanned material data in the spatial configuration and the shape of the design configuration
of three-dimensional (3D) printed products, whereas for a specific scanned material point we do
not know its corresponding material coordinates in the initial or designed referential configuration,
provided that we do not know the detailed information on actual physical deformation process. Different
from physics-based modeling, the method developed here is a data-driven artificial intelligence
method, which solves the problem with incomplete deformation data or with missing information
of actual physical deformation process. We coined the method is an AI-based material deformation
finding algorithm. This method has practical significance and important applications in finding
and designing thermal compensation configuration of a 3D printed product in additive manufacturing,
which is at the heart of the cutting edge 3D printing technology. In this paper, we demonstrate that
the proposed AI continuum/material deformation finding approach can accurately find permanent
thermal deformation configuration for a complex 3D printed structure component, and hence to identify
the thermal compensation design configuration in order to minimizing the impact of temperature
fluctuations on 3D printed structure components that are sensitive to changes of temperature.
