We consider streaming over a peer-to-peer network with homogeneous nodes in which a single source
broadcasts a data stream to all the users in the system. Peers are allowed to enter or leave the system
(adversarially) arbitrarily. Previous approaches for streaming in this setting have either used
randomized distribution graphs or structured trees with randomized maintenance algorithms.
Randomized graphs handle peer churn well but have poor connectivity guarantees, while structured
trees have good connectivity but have proven hard to maintain under peer churn. We improve upon both
approaches by presenting a novel distribution structure with a deterministic and distributed
algorithm for maintenance under peer churn; our result is inspired by a recent work proposing deterministic
algorithms for rumor spreading in graphs. A key innovation in our approach is in having redundant
links in the distribution structure. While this leads to a reduction in the maximum streaming rate
possible, we show that for the amount of redundancy used, the delay guarantee of the proposed algorithm
is near optimal. We introduce a tolerance parameter that captures the worst-case transient streaming
rate received by the peers during churn events and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between
rate, delay and tolerance. A natural generalization of the deterministic algorithm achieves this
tradeoff near optimally. Finally, the proposed deterministic algorithm is robust enough to handle
various generalizations: ability to deal with heterogeneous node capacities of the peers and more
complicated streaming patterns where multiple source transmissions are present.
