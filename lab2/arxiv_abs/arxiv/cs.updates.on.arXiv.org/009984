In computational science and in computer science, research software is a central asset for research.
Computational science is the application of computer science and software engineering principles
to solving scientific problems, whereas computer science is the study of computer hardware and
software design. The Open Science agenda holds that science advances faster when we can build on
existing results. Therefore, research software has to be reusable for advancing science. Thus,
we need proper research software engineering for obtaining reusable and sustainable research
software. This way, software engineering methods may improve research in other disciplines. However,
research in software engineering and computer science itself will also benefit from reuse when
research software is involved. For good scientific practice, the resulting research software
should be open and adhere to the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and repeatable)
to allow repeatability, reproducibility, and reuse. Compared to research data, research software
should be both archived for reproducibility and actively maintained for reusability. The FAIR
data principles do not require openness, but research software should be open source software.
Established open source software licenses provide sufficient licensing options, such that it
should be the rare exception to keep research software closed. We review and analyze the current
state in this area in order to give recommendations for making computer science research software
FAIR and open. We observe that research software publishing practices in computer science and in
computational science show significant differences.
