Pathological is crucial to cancer diagnosis. Usually, Pathologists draw their conclusion based
on observed cell and tissue structure on histology slides. Rapid development in machine learning,
especially deep learning have established robust and accurate classifiers. They are being used
to analyze histopathological slides and assist pathologists in diagnosis. Most machine learning
systems rely heavily on annotated data sets to gain experiences and knowledge to correctly and accurately
perform various tasks such as classification and segmentation. This work investigates different
granularity of annotations in histopathological data set including image-wise, bounding box,
ellipse-wise, and pixel-wise to verify the influence of annotation in pathological slide on deep
learning models. We design corresponding experiments to test classification and segmentation
performance of deep learning models based on annotations with different annotation granularity.
In classification, state-of-the-art deep learning-based classifiers perform better when trained
by pixel-wise annotation dataset. On average, precision, recall and F1-score improves by 7.87%,
8.83% and 7.85% respectively. Thus, it is suggested that finer granularity annotations are better
utilized by deep learning algorithms in classification tasks. Similarly, semantic segmentation
algorithms can achieve 8.33% better segmentation accuracy when trained by pixel-wise annotations.
Our study shows not only that finer-grained annotation can improve the performance of deep learning
models, but also help extracts more accurate phenotypic information from histopathological slides.
Intelligence systems trained on granular annotations may help pathologists inspecting certain
regions for better diagnosis. The compartmentalized prediction approach similar to this work
may contribute to phenotype and genotype association studies.
