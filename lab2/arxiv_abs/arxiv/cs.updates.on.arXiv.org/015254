Recent observations with varied schedules and types (moving average, snapshot, or regularly spaced)
can help to improve streamflow forecasts, but it is challenging to integrate them effectively.
Based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow model, we tested multiple versions of a flexible
procedure we call data integration (DI) to leverage recent discharge measurements to improve forecasts.
DI accepts lagged inputs either directly or through a convolutional neural network (CNN) unit.
DI ubiquitously elevated streamflow forecast performance to unseen levels, reaching a record
continental-scale median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient value of 0.86. Integrating
moving-average discharge, discharge from the last few days, or even average discharge from the
previous calendar month could all improve daily forecasts. Directly using lagged observations
as inputs was comparable in performance to using the CNN unit. Importantly, we obtained valuable
insights regarding hydrologic processes impacting LSTM and DI performance. Before applying DI,
the base LSTM model worked well in mountainous or snow-dominated regions, but less well in regions
with low discharge volumes (due to either low precipitation or high precipitation-energy synchronicity)
and large inter-annual storage variability. DI was most beneficial in regions with high flow autocorrelation:
it greatly reduced baseflow bias in groundwater-dominated western basins and also improved peak
prediction for basins with dynamical surface water storage, such as the Prairie Potholes or Great
Lakes regions. However, even DI cannot elevate high-aridity basins with one-day flash peaks. Despite
this limitation, there is much promise for a deep-learning-based forecast paradigm due to its performance,
automation, efficiency, and flexibility.
