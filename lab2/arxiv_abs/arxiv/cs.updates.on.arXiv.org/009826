Cat-SD is a multiple criteria decision aiding method for dealing with nominal classification problems.
Actions are assessed according to multiple criteria and assigned to one or more categories. A set
of reference actions is used for defining each category. The assignment of an action to a given category
depends on the comparison of the action to each reference set according to likeness thresholds.
Distinct sets of criteria weights, interaction coefficients, and likeness thresholds can be defined
per category. We propose to apply Multiple Criteria Hierarchy Process (MCHP) to Cat-SD. An adapted
MCHP is proposed to take into account possible interaction effects between criteria structured
in a hierarchical way. On the basis of the known deck of cards method, we also consider an imprecise
elicitation of parameters permitting to take into account interactions and antagonistic effects
between criteria. The elicitation procedure we are proposing can be applied to any Electre method.
With the purpose of exploring the assignments obtained by Cat-SD considering possible sets of parameters,
we propose to apply the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA). The SMAA methodology
allows to draw statistical conclusions on the classification of the actions. The proposed method,
SMAA-hCat-SD, helps the decision maker to check the effects of the variation of parameters on the
classification at different levels of the hierarchy. We propose also a procedure, based on the concept
of loss function, to obtain a final classification fulfilling some requirements given by the decision
maker and taking into account the hierarchy of criteria and the probabilistic assignments obtained
applying SMAA. Also this procedure can be applied to any classification Electre method.
