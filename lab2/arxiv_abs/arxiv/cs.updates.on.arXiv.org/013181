Digital receivers are required to recover the transmitted symbols from their observed channel
output. In multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups, where multiple symbols are
simultaneously transmitted, accurate symbol detection is challenging. A family of algorithms
capable of reliably recovering multiple symbols is based on interference cancellation. However,
these methods assume that the channel is linear, a model which does not reflect many relevant channels,
as well as require accurate channel state information (CSI), which may not be available. In this
work we propose a multiuser MIMO receiver which learns to jointly detect in a data-driven fashion,
without assuming a specific channel model or requiring CSI. In particular, we propose a data-driven
implementation of the iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm which we refer
to as DeepSIC. The resulting symbol detector is based on integrating dedicated machine-learning
(ML) methods into the iterative SIC algorithm. DeepSIC learns to carry out joint detection from
a limited set of training samples without requiring the channel to be linear and its parameters to
be known. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that for linear channels with full CSI, DeepSIC
approaches the performance of iterative SIC, which is comparable to the optimal performance, and
outperforms previously proposed ML-based MIMO receivers. Furthermore, in the presence of CSI
uncertainty, DeepSIC significantly outperforms model-based approaches. Finally, we show that
DeepSIC accurately detects symbols in non-linear channels, where conventional iterative SIC
fails even when accurate CSI is available.
