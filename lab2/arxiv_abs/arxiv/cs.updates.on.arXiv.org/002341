In wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), sensors typically have a limited energy budget as
they are often battery driven. Energy efficiency is therefore essential to the design of algorithms
in WASNs. One way to reduce energy costs is to only select the sensors which are most informative,
a problem known as {\it sensor selection}. In this way, only sensors that significantly contribute
to the task at hand will be involved. In this work, we consider a more general approach, which is based
on rate-distributed spatial filtering. Together with the distance over which transmission takes
place, bit rate directly influences the energy consumption. We try to minimize the battery usage
due to transmission, while constraining the noise reduction performance. This results in an efficient
rate allocation strategy, which depends on the underlying signal statistics, as well as the distance
from sensors to a fusion center (FC). Under the utilization of a linearly constrained minimum variance
(LCMV) beamformer, the problem is derived as a semi-definite program. Furthermore, we show that
rate allocation is more general than sensor selection, and sensor selection can be seen as a special
case of the presented rate-allocation solution, e.g., the best microphone subset can be determined
by thresholding the rates. Finally, numerical simulations for the application of estimating several
target sources in a WASN demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the microphone subset
selection based approaches in the sense of energy usage, and we find that the sensors close to the
FC and close to point sources are allocated with higher rates.
