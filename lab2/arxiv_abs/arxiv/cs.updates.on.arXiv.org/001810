To support maternal care we propose new computational models for analyzing self-reported emotional
diary texts of pregnant women. We gathered affective ratings outside clinical setting and developed
new models to facilitate interpretation and communication of affective expressions between persons
representing different affective ratings. We developed a new computational methodology to perform
psychologically motivated analyses of natural language expressions in various contexts currently
emphasizing concepts related to emotions and pregnancy. Relying on respected psychological theories,
models and rating scales, such as constructed emotion theory, models of dimensional emotion categories
and affective ratings of Self Assessment Manikin, we demonstrate our new proposal to support analyzing
linguistic data with computational models. We developed new models to represent how the affective
ratings can depend on various properties of language usage and population subgroup categorization,
including "women without children", "women with children" and "men without children" that we consider
important population segments to be addressed in maternal care. 35 persons having Finnish as a native
language provided affective ratings for 195 emotional adjectives and 16 pregnancy-related nouns
in Finnish in dimensions of pleasure, arousal and dominance. We analyzed gathered affective ratings
with vector space and clustering methods and our results represent dependencies and differences
of affective ratings between various population subgroup categorizations. We wanted to exploit
such categorizations that enable identification of properties of affectivity that have a risk
to become misinterpreted and thus need support in communication when implementing a successful
healthcare process. Our affective ratings showed significant correlations between pleasure
and dominance... [to continue in the manuscript]
