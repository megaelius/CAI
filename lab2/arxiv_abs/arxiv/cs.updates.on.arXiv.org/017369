Systems exhibiting nonlinear dynamics, including but not limited to chaos, are ubiquitous across
Earth Sciences such as Meteorology, Hydrology, Climate and Ecology, as well as Biology such as neural
and cardiac processes. However, System Identification remains a challenge. In climate and earth
systems models, while governing equations follow from first principles and understanding of key
processes has steadily improved, the largest uncertainties are often caused by parameterizations
such as cloud physics, which in turn have witnessed limited improvements over the last several decades.
Climate scientists have pointed to Machine Learning enhanced parameter estimation as a possible
solution, with proof-of-concept methodological adaptations being examined on idealized systems.
While climate science has been highlighted as a "Big Data" challenge owing to the volume and complexity
of archived model-simulations and observations from remote and in-situ sensors, the parameter
estimation process is often relatively a "small data" problem. A crucial question for data scientists
in this context is the relevance of state-of-the-art data-driven approaches including those based
on deep neural networks or kernel-based processes. Here we consider a chaotic system - two-level
Lorenz-96 - used as a benchmark model in the climate science literature, adopt a methodology based
on Gaussian Processes for parameter estimation and compare the gains in predictive understanding
with a suite of Deep Learning and strawman Linear Regression methods. Our results show that adaptations
of kernel-based Gaussian Processes can outperform other approaches under small data constraints
along with uncertainty quantification; and needs to be considered as a viable approach in climate
science and earth system modeling.
