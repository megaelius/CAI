This paper focuses on the unsupervised domain adaptation of transferring the knowledge from the
source domain to the target domain in the context of semantic segmentation. Existing approaches
usually regard the pseudo label as the ground truth to fully exploit the unlabeled target-domain
data. Yet the pseudo labels of the target-domain data are usually predicted by the model trained
on the source domain. Thus, the generated labels inevitably contain the incorrect prediction due
to the discrepancy between the training domain and the test domain, which could be transferred to
the final adapted model and largely compromises the training process. To overcome the problem,
this paper proposes to explicitly estimate the prediction uncertainty during training to rectify
the pseudo label learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation adaptation. Given the input
image, the model outputs the semantic segmentation prediction as well as the uncertainty of the
prediction. Specifically, we model the uncertainty via the prediction variance and involve the
uncertainty into the optimization objective. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method,
we evaluate the proposed method on two prevalent synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks,
i.e., GTA5 -> Cityscapes and SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes, as well as one cross-city benchmark, i.e., Cityscapes
-> Oxford RobotCar. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the proposed approach (1)
dynamically sets different confidence thresholds according to the prediction variance, (2) rectifies
the learning from noisy pseudo labels, and (3) achieves significant improvements over the conventional
pseudo label learning and yields competitive performance on all three benchmarks.
