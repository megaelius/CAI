Objectives: To predict mechanical ventilation requirement and mortality using computational
modeling of chest radiographs (CXR) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We also
investigate the relative advantages of deep learning (DL), radiomics, and DL of radiomic-embedded
feature maps in predicting these outcomes. Methods: This two-center, retrospective study analyzed
deidentified CXRs taken from 514 patients suspected of COVID-19 infection on presentation at Stony
Brook University Hospital (SBUH) and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center (NBIMC) between the months
of March and June 2020. A DL segmentation pipeline was developed to generate masks for both lung fields
and artifacts for each CXR. Machine learning classifiers to predict mechanical ventilation requirement
and mortality were trained and evaluated on 353 baseline CXRs taken from COVID-19 positive patients.
A novel radiomic embedding framework is also explored for outcome prediction. Results: Classification
models for mechanical ventilation requirement (test N=154) and mortality (test N=190) had AUCs
of up to 0.904 and 0.936, respectively. We also found that the inclusion of radiomic-embedded maps
improved DL model predictions of clinical outcomes. Conclusions: We demonstrate the potential
for computerized analysis of baseline CXR in predicting disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients.
Our results also suggest that radiomic embedding improves DL models in medical image analysis,
a technique that might be explored further in other pathologies. The models proposed in this study
and the prognostic information they provide, complementary to other clinical data, might be used
to aid physician decision making and resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic.
