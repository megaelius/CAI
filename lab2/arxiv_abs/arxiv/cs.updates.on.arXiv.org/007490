The fundamental diagram is an assumed functional relationship between traffic flow and traffic
density. In practice, this relationship is noisy and exhibits significant statistical variability.
On smart motorways, this variability is increased by variable speed limits that are not captured
by the fundamental diagram. To study this variability, it is appropriate to consider the joint probability
distribution function (pdf) of density and flow. We perform an empirical study of the variability
in the relationship between flow and density using 74 days of data from 64 sections of London's M25.
The objectives are to determine how much of the variability in the flow-density relationship results
from variable speed limits and to assess whether particular functional forms of the fundamental
diagram are systematically preferred. Empirically, the joint pdf of flow and density is strongly
bimodal, illustrating that traffic flows are often found in high-density or low-density regimes
but rarely in between. We find that the high-density regime is strongly affected by variable speed
limits whereas the low-density regime is not. The Daganzo-Newell (triangular) model of the fundamental
diagram systematically fits best to the data. However, the optimal parameters vary with location.
Clustering analysis of these parameters suggests three qualitatively different types of flow-density
relationships applying to different sections of the M25. These clusters have natural interpretations
in terms of the frequency and severity of flow breakdown. Accident rates also depend on cluster type
suggesting possible links to other properties of traffic flows beyond the flow-density relationship.
