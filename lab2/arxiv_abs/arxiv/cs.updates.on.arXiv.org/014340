Colonoscopy is the tool of choice for preventing Colorectal Cancer, by detecting and removing polyps
before they become cancerous. However, colonoscopy is hampered by the fact that endoscopists routinely
miss 22-28% of polyps. While some of these missed polyps appear in the endoscopist's field of view,
others are missed simply because of substandard coverage of the procedure, i.e. not all of the colon
is seen. This paper attempts to rectify the problem of substandard coverage in colonoscopy through
the introduction of the C2D2 (Colonoscopy Coverage Deficiency via Depth) algorithm which detects
deficient coverage, and can thereby alert the endoscopist to revisit a given area. More specifically,
C2D2 consists of two separate algorithms: the first performs depth estimation of the colon given
an ordinary RGB video stream; while the second computes coverage given these depth estimates. Rather
than compute coverage for the entire colon, our algorithm computes coverage locally, on a segment-by-segment
basis; C2D2 can then indicate in real-time whether a particular area of the colon has suffered from
deficient coverage, and if so the endoscopist can return to that area. Our coverage algorithm is
the first such algorithm to be evaluated in a large-scale way; while our depth estimation technique
is the first calibration-free unsupervised method applied to colonoscopies. The C2D2 algorithm
achieves state of the art results in the detection of deficient coverage. On synthetic sequences
with ground truth, it is 2.4 times more accurate than human experts; while on real sequences, C2D2
achieves a 93.0% agreement with experts.
