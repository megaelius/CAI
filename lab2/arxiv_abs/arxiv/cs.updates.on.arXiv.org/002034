While the logical centralization of functional properties of the network in Software-Defined
Networking (SDN) brought advantages such as a faster pace of innovation, it also disrupted some
of the natural defenses of traditional architectures against different threats. The literature
on SDN has mostly been concerned with the functional side, despite some specific works concerning
non-functional properties like 'security' or 'dependability'. Though addressing the latter
in an ad-hoc, piecemeal way, may work, it will most likely lead to efficiency and e effectiveness
problems. We claim that the enforcement of non-functional properties as a pillar of SDN robustness
calls for a systemic approach. We further advocate, for its materialization, the re-iteration
of the successful formula behind SDN - 'logical centralization'. As a general concept, we propose
ANCHOR, a subsystem architecture that promotes the logical centralization of non-functional
properties. To show the effectiveness of the concept, we focus on 'security' in this paper: we identify
the current security gaps in SDNs and we populate the architecture middleware with the appropriate
security mechanisms, in a global and consistent manner. ANCHOR sets to provide essential security
mechanisms such as strong entropy, secure device registration, and association, among other crucial
services. We claim and justify in the paper that centralizing such mechanisms is key for their e ectiveness,
by allowing us to: define and enforce global policies for those properties; ensure higher levels
of robustness for critical services; foster interoperability of the non-functional property
enforcement mechanisms; and finally, better foster the resilience of the architecture itself.
We discuss design and implementation aspects, and we prove and evaluate our algorithms and mechanisms.
