In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), an enormous amount of sensing devices collect and/or generate
various sensory data over time for a wide range of fields and applications. Based on the nature of
the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics
over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions
is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving
technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning
techniques, namely Deep Learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain.
We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT
data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics.
We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data
and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then
discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background
on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research
attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their
intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud
centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges
and potential directions for future research. At the end of each section, we highlight the lessons
learned based on our experiments and review of the recent literature.
