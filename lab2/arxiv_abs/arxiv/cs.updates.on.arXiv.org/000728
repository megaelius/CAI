The robust coding of natural images and the effective compression of encrypted images have been
studied individually in recent years. However, little work has been done in the robust coding of
encrypted images. The existing results in these two individual research areas cannot be combined
directly for the robust coding of encrypted images. This is because the robust coding of natural
images relies on the elimination of spatial correlations using sparse transforms such as discrete
wavelet transform (DWT), which is ineffective to encrypted images due to the weak correlation between
encrypted pixels. Moreover, the compression of encrypted images always generates code streams
with different significance. If one or more such streams are lost, the quality of the reconstructed
images may drop substantially or decoding error may exist, which violates the goal of robust coding
of encrypted images. In this work, we intend to design a robust coder, based on compressive sensing
with structurally random matrix, for encrypted images over packet transmission networks. The
proposed coder can be applied in the scenario that Alice needs a semi-trusted channel provider Charlie
to encode and transmit the encrypted image to Bob. In particular, Alice first encrypts an image using
globally random permutation and then sends the encrypted image to Charlie who samples the encrypted
image using a structural matrix. Through an imperfect channel with packet loss, Bob receives the
compressive measurements and reconstructs the original image by joint decryption and decoding.
Experimental results show that the proposed coder can be considered as an efficient multiple description
coder with a number of descriptions against packet loss.
