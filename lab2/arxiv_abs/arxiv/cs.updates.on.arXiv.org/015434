The popularity and proliferation of electric scooters (e-scooters) as a micromobility solution
in our cities and urban communities has been rapidly rising. Rent-by-the-minute pricing and a healthy
competition between micromobility service providers is also benefiting riders with low trip costs.
However, an unprepared urban infrastructure, combined with uncertain operation policies and
poor regulation enforcement, has resulted in e-scooter riders encroaching public spaces meant
for pedestrians, thus causing significant safety concerns both for themselves and the pedestrians.
As a consequence, it has become critical to understand the current state of pedestrian safety in
our urban communities vis-\`{a}-vis e-scooter services, identify factors that impact pedestrian
safety due to such services, and determine how to support pedestrian safety going forward. Unfortunately,
to date there have been no realistic, data-driven efforts within the research community that address
these issues. In this work, we conduct a field study to empirically investigate and characterize
new safety issues that arise due to the introduction of e-scooter services, from the pedestrians'
perspective. By crowd-sensing real-time \emph{encounter} data between e-scooters and pedestrian
participants on two urban university campuses over a three-month period, we uncover encounter
statistics and mobility trends that could identify potentially unsafe spatio-temporal zones
for pedestrians. This first-of-its-kind work also provides a blueprint on how crowd-sensed micromobility
data can enable similar safety-related studies in other urban communities.
