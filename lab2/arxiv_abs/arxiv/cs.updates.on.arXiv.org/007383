This paper proposes a two-stage segmentation model, variable-input based uncertainty measures
and an uncertainty-guided post-processing method for prostate segmentation on 3D magnetic resonance
images (MRI). The two-stage model was based on 3D dilated U-Nets with the first stage to localize
the prostate and the second stage to obtain an accurate segmentation from cropped images. For data
augmentation, we proposed the variable-input method which crops the region of interest with additional
random variations. Similar to other deep learning models, the proposed model also faced the challenge
of suboptimal performance in certain testing cases due to varied training and testing image characteristics.
Therefore, it is valuable to evaluate the confidence and performance of the network using uncertainty
measures, which are often calculated from the probability maps or their standard deviations with
multiple model outputs for the same testing case. However, few studies have quantitatively compared
different methods of uncertainty calculation. Furthermore, unlike the commonly used Bayesian
dropout during testing, we developed uncertainty measures based on the variable input images at
the second stage and evaluated its performance by calculating the correlation with ground-truth-based
performance metrics, such as Dice score. For performance estimation, we predicted Dice scores
and Hausdorff distance with the most correlated uncertainty measure. For post-processing, we
performed Gaussian filter on the underperformed slices to improve segmentation quality. Using
PROMISE-12 data, we demonstrated the robustness of the two-stage model and showed high correlation
of the proposed variable-input based uncertainty measures with GT-based performance. The uncertainty-guided
post-processing method significantly improved label smoothness.
