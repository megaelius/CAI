Hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis has become a key area in the field of remote sensing as a result
of its ability to exploit richer information in the form of multiple spectral bands. The study of
hyperspectral unmixing (HU) is important in HSI analysis due to the insufficient spatial resolution
of customary imaging spectrometers. The endmembers of an HSI are more likely to be generated by independent
sources and be mixed in a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging
spectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have focused on imposing
auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework
in order to effectively unmix these mixed spectra. Signifying a step forward toward finding an optimum
constraint to extract endmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as
Kurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which incorporates a novel
constraint based on the statistical independence of the probability density functions of endmember
spectra. Imposing this constraint on the conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of
independent endmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data. The proposed
algorithm manages to outperform several state of the art NMF-based algorithms in terms of extracting
endmember spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing data; therefore, it could uplift the performance
of recent deep learning HU methods which utilizes the endmember spectra as supervisory input data
for abundance extraction. We release all code utilized to implement KbSNMF.
