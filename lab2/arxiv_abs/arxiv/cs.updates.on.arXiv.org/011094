Over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural network (CNN) for AD classification from
anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies
due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation
procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly
accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report
a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In
the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First,
we performed a systematic literature review and found that more than half of the surveyed papers
may have suffered from data leakage. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source
framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. Finally, we used this framework
to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test
sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection.
To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process.
Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances
while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform
better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar
populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics.
