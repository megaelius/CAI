The Internet has enabled the emergence of massive online collaborative projects. As the number
of contributors to these projects grows, it becomes increasingly important to understand and predict
whether the edits that users make will eventually impact the project positively. Existing solutions
either rely on a user reputation system or consist of a highly-specialized predictor tailored to
a specific peer-production system. In this work, we explore a different point in the solution space,
which does not involve any content-based feature of the edits. To this end, we formulate a statistical
model of edit outcomes. We view each edit as a game between the editor and the component of the project.
We posit that the probability of a positive outcome is a function of the editor's skill, of the difficulty
of editing the component and of a user-component interaction term. Our model is broadly applicable,
as it only requires observing data about who makes an edit, what the edit affects and whether the edit
survives or not. Then, we consider Wikipedia and the Linux kernel, two examples of large-scale collaborative
projects, and we seek to understand whether this simple model can effectively predict edit survival:
in both cases, we provide a positive answer. Our approach significantly outperforms those based
solely on user reputation and bridges the gap with specialized predictors that use content-based
features. Furthermore, inspecting the model parameters enables us to discover interesting structure
in the data. Our method is simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and it produces interpretable
results; as such, we believe that it is a valuable tool to analyze collaborative systems.
