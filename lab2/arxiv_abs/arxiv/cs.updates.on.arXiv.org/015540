This paper considers a target localization problem where at any given time an agent can choose a region
to query for the presence of the target in that region. The measurement noise is assumed to be increasing
with the size of the query region the agent chooses. Motivated by practical applications such as
initial beam alignment in array processing, heavy hitter detection in networking, and visual search
in robotics, we consider practically important complexity constraints/metrics: \textit{time
complexity}, \textit{computational and memory complexity}, \textit{query geometry}, and \textit{cardinality
of possible query sets}. Two novel search strategy, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$, are proposed. In contrast
to previously proposed algorithms, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$ are of a connected query geometry (i.e.
query set is always a connected set). We also demonstrated how they can be implemented with low computational
and memory complexity. Additionally, $hiePM$ has a hierarchical structure and has a low cardinality
of possible query sets. These make $hiePM$ suitable for applications such as beamforming in array
processing where the extra computation of the query set construction dictates a codebook-based
approach (the choice of query set is constrained to a pre-computed small query set collection),
and the limit of memory enforces a smaller codebook size. Through a unified analysis with Extrinsic
Jensen Shannon (EJS) Divergence, $dyaPM$ is shown to be asymptotically optimal in search time complexity
(asymptotic in both resolution (rate) and error (reliability)). On the other hand, $hiePM$ is shown
to be near-optimal in rate. In addition, via numerical examples, both $hiePM$ and $dyaPM$ are shown
to outperform prior work in the non-asymptotic regime.
