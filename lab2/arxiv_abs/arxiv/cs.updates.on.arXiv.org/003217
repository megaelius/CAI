This article presents an extensive literature review of technology based intervention methodologies
for individuals facing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Reviewed methodologies include: contemporary
Computer Aided Systems (CAS), Computer Vision Assisted Technologies (CVAT) and Virtual Reality
(VR) or Artificial Intelligence-Assisted interventions. The research over the past decade has
provided enough demonstrations that individuals of ASD have a strong interest in technology based
interventions and can connect with them for longer durations without facing any trouble(s). Theses
technology based interventions are useful for individuals facing autism in clinical settings
as well as at home and classrooms. Despite showing great promise, research in developing an advanced
technology based intervention that is clinically quantitative for ASD is minimal. Moreover, the
clinicians are generally not convinced about the potential of the technology based interventions
due to non-empirical nature of published results. A major reason behind this non-acceptability
is a vast majority of studies on distinct intervention methodologies do not follow any specific
standard or research design. Consequently, the data produced by these studies is minimally appealing
to the clinical community. This research domain has a vast social impact as per official statistics
given by the Autism Society of America, autism is the fastest growing developmental disability
in the United States (US). The estimated annual cost in the US for diagnosis and treatment for ASD
is 236-262 Billion US Dollars. The cost of up-bringing an ASD individual is estimated to be 1.4 million
USD while statistics show 1% of the worlds' total population is suffering from ASD.
