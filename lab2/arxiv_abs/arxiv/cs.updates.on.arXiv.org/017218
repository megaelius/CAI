Internet of Things (IoT) is an innovative paradigm envisioned to provide massive applications
that are now part of our daily lives. Millions of smart devices are deployed within complex networks
to provide vibrant functionalities including communications, monitoring, and controlling of
critical infrastructures. However, this massive growth of IoT devices and the corresponding huge
data traffic generated at the edge of the network created additional burdens on the state-of-the-art
centralized cloud computing paradigm due to the bandwidth and resources scarcity. Hence, edge
computing (EC) is emerging as an innovative strategy that brings data processing and storage near
to the end users, leading to what is called EC-assisted IoT. Although this paradigm provides unique
features and enhanced quality of service (QoS), it also introduces huge risks in data security and
privacy aspects. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on security and privacy issues in the
context of EC-assisted IoT. In particular, we first present an overview of EC-assisted IoT including
definitions, applications, architecture, advantages, and challenges. Second, we define security
and privacy in the context of EC-assisted IoT. Then, we extensively discuss the major classifications
of attacks in EC-assisted IoT and provide possible solutions and countermeasures along with the
related research efforts. After that, we further classify some security and privacy issues as discussed
in the literature based on security services and based on security objectives and functions. Finally,
several open challenges and future research directions for secure EC-assisted IoT paradigm are
also extensively provided.
