Offshoring the proprietary Intellectual property (IP) has recently increased the threat of malicious
logic insertion in the form of Hardware Trojan (HT). A potential and stealthy HT is triggered with
nets that switch rarely during regular circuit operation. Detection of HT in the host design requires
exhaustive simulation to activate the HT during pre- and postsilicon. Although the nets with variable
switching probability less than a threshold are primarily chosen as a good candidate for Trojan
triggering, there is no systematic fine-grained approach for earlier detection of rare nets from
word-level measures of input signals. In this paper, we propose a high-level technique to estimate
the nets with the rare activity of arithmetic modules from word-level information. Specifically,
for a given module, we use the knowledge of internal construction of the architecture to detect "low
activity" and "local regions" without resorting to expensive RTL and other low-level simulations.
The presented heuristic method abstracts away from the low-level details of design and describes
the rare activity of bits (modules) in a word (architecture) as a function of signal statistics.
The resulting quick estimates of nets in rare regions allows a designer to develop a compact test
generation algorithm without the knowledge of the bit-level activity. We determine the effect
of different positions of the breakpoint in the input signal to calculate the accuracy of the approach.
We conduct a set of experiments on six adder architectures and four multiplier architectures. The
average error to calculate the rare nets between RTL simulation and estimated values are below 2%
in all architectures.
