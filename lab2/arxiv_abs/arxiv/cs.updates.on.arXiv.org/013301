Monetizing websites and web apps through online advertising is widespread in the web ecosystem.
The online advertising ecosystem nowadays forces publishers to integrate ads from these third-party
domains. On the one hand, this raises several privacy and security concerns that are actively studied
in recent years. On the other hand, given the ability of today's browsers to load dynamic web pages
with complex animations and Javascript, online advertising has also transformed and can have a
significant impact on webpage performance. The performance cost of online ads is critical since
it eventually impacts user satisfaction as well as their Internet bill and device energy consumption.
In this paper, we apply an in-depth and first-of-a-kind performance evaluation of web ads. Unlike
prior efforts that rely primarily on adblockers, we perform a fine-grained analysis on the web browser's
page loading process to demystify the performance cost of web ads. We aim to characterize the cost
by every component of an ad, so the publisher, ad syndicate, and advertiser can improve the ad's performance
with detailed guidance. For this purpose, we develop an infrastructure, adPerf, for the Chrome
browser that classifies page loading workloads into ad-related and main-content at the granularity
of browser activities (such as Javascript and Layout). Our evaluations show that online advertising
entails more than 15% of browser page loading workload and approximately 88% of that is spent on JavaScript.
We also track the sources and delivery chain of web ads and analyze performance considering the origin
of the ad contents. We observe that 2 of the well-known third-party ad domains contribute to 35% of
the ads performance cost and surprisingly, top news websites implicitly include unknown third-party
ads which in some cases build up to more than 37% of the ads performance cost.
