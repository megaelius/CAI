In this study we propose a deformation-based framework to jointly model the influence of aging and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the brain morphological evolution. Our approach combines a spatio-temporal
description of both processes into a generative model. A reference morphology is deformed along
specific trajectories to match subject specific morphologies. It is used to define two imaging
progression markers: 1) a morphological age and 2) a disease score. These markers can be computed
locally in any brain region. The approach is evaluated on brain structural magnetic resonance images
(MRI) from the ADNI database. The generative model is first estimated on a control population, then,
for each subject, the markers are computed for each acquisition. The longitudinal evolution of
these markers is then studied in relation with the clinical diagnosis of the subjects and used to
generate possible morphological evolution. In the model, the morphological changes associated
with normal aging are mainly found around the ventricles, while the Alzheimer's disease specific
changes are more located in the temporal lobe and the hippocampal area. The statistical analysis
of these markers highlights differences between clinical conditions even though the inter-subject
variability is quiet high. In this context, the model can be used to generate plausible morphological
trajectories associated with the disease. Our method gives two interpretable scalar imaging biomarkers
assessing the effects of aging and disease on brain morphology at the individual and population
level. These markers confirm an acceleration of apparent aging for Alzheimer's subjects and can
help discriminate clinical conditions even in prodromal stages. More generally, the joint modeling
of normal and pathological evolutions shows promising results to describe age-related brain diseases
over long time scales.
