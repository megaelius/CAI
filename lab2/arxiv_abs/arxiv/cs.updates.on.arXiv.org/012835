A decade long thrive of cryptocurrency has shown its potential as a source of alternative-finance
and the security and the robustness of the underpinning blockchain technology. However, most cryptocurrencies
fail to show inimitability and their meanings in the real world. As a result, they usually start off
as favourites but quickly become the outcasts of the digital asset market. The blockchain society
attempts to anchor the value of cryptocurrency with real values by employing smart contracts and
link it with computation resources and the digital-productivity that have value and demands in
the real world. But their attempts have some undesirable effects due to a limited number of practical
applications. This limitation is caused by the dilemma between high performance and decentralisation
(universal joinability). The emerging of blockchain sharding models, however, has offered a possible
solution to address this dilemma. In this paper, we explore a financial model for blockchain sharding
that will build an active link between the value of cryptocurrency and computation resources as
well as the market and labour behaviours. Our model can adjust the price of resources and the compensation
for maintaining a system based on those behaviours. We anchor the value of cryptocurrency by the
amount of computation resources participated in and give the cryptocurrency a meaning as the exchange
between computation resources globally. Finally, we present a working example which, through
financial regularities, regulates the behaviour of anonymous participants, also incents/discourages
participation dynamically.
