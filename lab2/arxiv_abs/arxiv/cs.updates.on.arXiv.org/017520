This paper describes a framework for capturing geological structures in a 3D block model and improving
its spatial fidelity given new mesh surfaces. Using surfaces that represent geological boundaries,
the objectives are to identify areas where refinement is needed, increase spatial resolution to
minimize surface approximation error, reduce redundancy to increase the compactness of the model
and identify the geological domain on a block-by-block basis. These objectives are fulfilled by
four system components which perform block-surface overlap detection, spatial structure decomposition,
sub-blocks consolidation and block tagging, respectively. The main contributions are a coordinate-ascent
merging algorithm and a flexible architecture for updating the spatial structure of a block model
when given multiple surfaces, which emphasizes the ability to selectively retain or modify previously
assigned block labels. The techniques employed include block-surface intersection analysis
based on the separable axis theorem and ray-tracing for establishing the location of blocks relative
to surfaces. To demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the proposed block merging strategy
in a more narrow setting, it is used to reduce block fragmentation in an existing model where surfaces
are not given and the minimum block size is fixed. To obtain further insight, a systematic comparison
with octree subblocking subsequently illustrates the inherent constraints of dyadic hierarchical
decomposition and the importance of inter-scale merging. The results show the proposed method
produces merged blocks with less extreme aspect ratios and is highly amenable to parallel processing.
The overall framework is applicable to orebody modelling given geological boundaries, and 3D segmentation
more generally, where there is a need to delineate spatial regions using mesh surfaces within a block
model.
