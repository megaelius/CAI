Document sketching using Jaccard similarity has been a workable effective technique in reducing
near-duplicates in Web page and image search results, and has also proven useful in file system synchronization,
compression and learning applications. Min-wise sampling can be used to derive an unbiased estimator
for Jaccard similarity and taking a few hundred independent consistent samples leads to compact
sketches which provide good estimates of pairwise-similarity. Subsequent works extended this
technique to weighted sets and show how to produce samples with only a constant number of hash evaluations
for any element, independent of its weight. Another improvement by Li et al. shows how to speedup
sketch computations by computing many (near-)independent samples in one shot. Unfortunately
this latter improvement works only for the unweighted case. In this paper we give a simple, fast and
accurate procedure which reduces weighted sets to unweighted sets with small impact on the Jaccard
similarity. This leads to compact sketches consisting of many (near-)independent weighted samples
which can be computed with just a small constant number of hash function evaluations per weighted
element. The size of the produced unweighted set is furthermore a tunable parameter which enables
us to run the unweighted scheme of Li et al. in the regime where it is most efficient. Even when the sets
involved are unweighted, our approach gives a simple solution to the densification problem that
other works attempted to address. Unlike previously known schemes, ours does not result in an unbiased
estimator. However, we prove that the bias introduced by our reduction is negligible and that the
standard deviation is comparable to the unweighted case. We also empirically evaluate our scheme
and show that it gives significant gains in computational efficiency, without any measurable loss
in accuracy.
