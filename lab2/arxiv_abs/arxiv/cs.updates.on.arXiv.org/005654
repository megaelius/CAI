In this chapter we discuss soft concept analysis, a study which identifies an enriched notion of
"conceptual scale" as developed in formal concept analysis with an enriched notion of "linguistic
variable" as discussed in fuzzy logic. The identification "enriched conceptual scale" = "enriched
linguistic variable" was made in a previous paper (Enriched interpretation, Robert E. Kent). In
this chapter we offer further arguments for the importance of this identification by discussing
the philosophy, spirit, and practical application of conceptual scaling to the discovery, conceptual
analysis, interpretation, and categorization of networked information resources. We argue that
a linguistic variable, which has been defined at just the right generalization of valuated categories,
provides a natural definition for the process of soft conceptual scaling. This enrichment using
valuated categories models the relation of indiscernability, a notion of central importance in
rough set theory. At a more fundamental level for soft concept analysis, it also models the derivation
of formal concepts, a process of central importance in formal concept analysis. Soft concept analysis
is synonymous with enriched concept analysis. From one viewpoint, the study of soft concept analysis
that is initiated here extends formal concept analysis to soft computational structures. From
another viewpoint, soft concept analysis provides a natural foundation for soft computation by
unifying and explaining notions from soft computation in terms of suitably generalized notions
from formal concept analysis, rough set theory and fuzzy set theory.
