Extensive study on the complexity of computing Nash Equilibrium has resulted in the definition
of the complexity class PPAD by Papadimitriou \cite{Papa2}, Subsequently shown to be PPAD-complete,
first by Daskalakis, Goldberg, and Papadimitriou \cite{Papa} for $3$ or more and even for the bimatrix
case by Chen and Deng \cite{Chen}. On the other hand, it is well known that Nash equilibria of games
with smooth payoff functions are generally Pareto-inefficient \cite{Dubey} In the spirit of Von
Neumann's Minimax Theorem and its polynomial-time solvability via Linear Programming, Kalantari
\cite{Kalantari} has described a multilinear minimax relaxation (MMR) that provides an approximation
to a convex combination of expected payoffs in any Nash Equilibrium via LP. In this paper, we study
this relaxation for the bimatrix game, solving its corresponding LP formulation and comparing
its solution to the solution computed by the Lemke-Howson algorithm. We also give a game theoretic
interpretation of MMR for the bimatrix game involving a meta-player. Our relaxation has the following
theoretical advantages: (1) It can be computed in polynomial time; (2) For at least one player, the
computed MMR payoff is at least as good any Nash Equilibrium payoff; (3) There exists a convex scaling
of the payoff matrices giving equal payoffs. Such a solution is a satisfactory compromise. Computationally,
we have compared our approach with the state-of-the-art implementation of the Lemke-Howson algorithm
\cite{Lemke}. We have observed the following advantages: (i) MMR outperformed Lemke-Howson in
time complexity; (ii) In about $80\%$ of the cases the MMR payoffs for both players are better than
any Nash Equilibria; (iii) in the remaining $20\%$, while one player's payoff is better than any
Nash Equilibrium payoff, the other player's payoff is only within a relative error of $17\%$.
