Larvae of Hermetia illucens, also commonly known as black soldier fly (BSF) have gained significant
importance in the feed industry, primarily used as feed for aquaculture and other livestock farming.
Mathematical model such as Von Bertalanffy growth model and dynamic energy budget models are available
for modelling the growth of various organisms but have their demerits for their application to the
growth and development of BSF. Also, such dynamic models were not yet applied to the growth of the
BSF larvae despite models proven to be useful for automation of industrial production process (e.g.
feeding, heating/cooling, ventilation, harvesting, etc.). This work primarily focuses on developing
a model based on the principles of the afore mentioned models from literature that can provide accurate
mathematical description of the dry mass changes throughout the life cycle and the transition of
development phases of the larvae. To further improve the accuracy of these models, various factors
affecting the growth and development such as temperature, feed quality, feeding rate, moisture
content in feed, and airflow rate are developed and integrated into the dynamic growth model. An
extensive set of data were aggregated from various literature and used for the model development,
parameter estimation and validation. Models describing the environmental factors were individually
validated based on the data sets collected. In addition, the dynamic growth model was also validated
for dry mass evolution and development stage transition of larvae reared on different substrate
feeding rates. The developed models with the estimated parameters performed well highlighting
its application in decision-support systems and automation for large scale production.
