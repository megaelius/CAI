There is a growing amount of clinical, anatomical and functional evidence for the heterogeneous
presentation of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimers
Disease (AD). Elucidating distinct subtypes of diseases allows a better understanding of neuropathogenesis
and enables the possibility of developing targeted treatment programs. Recent semi-supervised
clustering techniques have provided a data-driven way to understand disease heterogeneity. However,
existing methods do not take into account that subtypes of the disease might present themselves
at different spatial scales across the brain. Here, we introduce a novel method, MAGIC, to uncover
disease heterogeneity by leveraging multi-scale clustering. We first extract multi-scale patterns
of structural covariance (PSCs) followed by a semi-supervised clustering with double cyclic block-wise
optimization across different scales of PSCs. We validate MAGIC using simulated heterogeneous
neuroanatomical data and demonstrate its clinical potential by exploring the heterogeneity of
AD using T1 MRI scans of 228 cognitively normal (CN) and 191 patients. Our results indicate two main
subtypes of AD with distinct atrophy patterns that consist of both fine-scale atrophy in the hippocampus
as well as large-scale atrophy in cortical regions. The evidence for the heterogeneity is further
corroborated by the clinical evaluation of two subtypes, which indicates that there is a subpopulation
of AD patients that tend to be younger and decline faster in cognitive performance relative to the
other subpopulation, which tends to be older and maintains a relatively steady decline in cognitive
abilities.
