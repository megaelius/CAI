As camera quality improves and their deployment moves to areas with limited bandwidth, communication
bottlenecks can impair real-time constraints of an ITS application, such as video-based real-time
pedestrian detection. Video compression reduces the bandwidth requirement to transmit the video
but degrades the video quality. As the quality level of the video decreases, it results in the corresponding
decreases in the accuracy of the vision-based pedestrian detection model. Furthermore, environmental
conditions (e.g., rain and darkness) alter the compression ratio and can make maintaining a high
pedestrian detection accuracy more difficult. The objective of this study is to develop a real-time
error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) strategy to dynamically change the video compression
level depending on different environmental conditions in order to maintain a high pedestrian detection
accuracy. We conduct a case study to show the efficacy of our dynamic EBLC strategy for real-time
vision-based pedestrian detection under adverse environmental conditions. Our strategy selects
the error tolerances dynamically for lossy compression that can maintain a high detection accuracy
across a representative set of environmental conditions. Analyses reveal that our strategy increases
pedestrian detection accuracy up to 14% and reduces the communication bandwidth up to 14x for adverse
environmental conditions compared to the same conditions but without our dynamic EBLC strategy.
Our dynamic EBLC strategy is independent of detection models and environmental conditions allowing
other detection models and environmental conditions to be easily incorporated in our strategy.
