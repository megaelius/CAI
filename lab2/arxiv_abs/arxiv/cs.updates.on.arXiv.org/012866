We are witnessing an increasing use of data-driven predictive models to inform decisions. As decisions
have implications for individuals and society, there is increasing pressure on decision makers
to be transparent about their decision policies. At the same time, individuals may use knowledge,
gained by transparency, to invest effort strategically in order to maximize their chances of receiving
a beneficial decision. Our goal is to find decision policies that are optimal in terms of utility
in such a strategic setting. To this end, we first characterize how strategic investment of effort
by individuals leads to a change in the feature distribution. Using this characterization, we first
show that, in general, we cannot expect to find optimal decision policies in polynomial time and
there are cases in which deterministic policies are suboptimal. Then, we demonstrate that, if the
cost individuals pay to change their features satisfies a natural monotonicity assumption, we
can narrow down the search for the optimal policy to a particular family of decision policies with
a set of desirable properties, which allow for a highly effective polynomial time heuristic search
algorithm using dynamic programming. Finally, under no assumptions on the cost individuals pay
to change their features, we develop an iterative search algorithm that is guaranteed to find locally
optimal decision policies also in polynomial time. Experiments on synthetic and real lending data
illustrate our theoretical findings and show that the decision policies found by our algorithms
achieve higher utility than several competitive baselines.
