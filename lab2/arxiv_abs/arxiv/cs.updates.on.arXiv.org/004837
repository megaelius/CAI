We present a novel algorithm for generating robust and consistent hypotheses for multiple-structure
model fitting. Most of the existing methods utilize random sampling which produce varying results
especially when outlier ratio is high. For a structure where a model is fitted, the inliers of other
structures are regarded as outliers when multiple structures are present. Global optimization
has recently been investigated to provide stable and unique solutions, but the computational cost
of the algorithms is prohibitively high for most image data with reasonable sizes. The algorithm
presented in this paper uses a maximum feasible subsystem (MaxFS) algorithm to generate consistent
initial hypotheses only from partial datasets in spatially overlapping local image regions. Our
assumption is that each genuine structure will exist as a dominant structure in at least one of the
local regions. To refine initial hypotheses estimated from partial datasets and to remove residual
tolerance dependency of the MaxFS algorithm, iterative re-weighted L1 (IRL1) minimization is
performed for all the image data. Initial weights of IRL1 framework are determined from the initial
hypotheses generated in local regions. Our approach is significantly more efficient than those
that use only global optimization for all the image data. Experimental results demonstrate that
the presented method can generate more reliable and consistent hypotheses than random-sampling
methods for estimating single and multiple structures from data with a large amount of outliers.
We clearly expose the influence of algorithm parameter settings on the results in our experiments.
