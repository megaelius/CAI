Cooperative video caching and transcoding in mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture is a new
paradigm for future wireless networks, e.g., 5G and 5G beyond, enabling them to utilize scarce and
expensive network resources in a more efficient manner. Integration of this technique with other
advent technologies, such as network virtualization and multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple
access (MC-NOMA), provides more flexible video delivery opportunities for the system, which leads
to enhancements both for the network's revenue and for the end-users' service experience. This
calls to study related resource allocation frameworks (RAFs) that is the main goal of this paper.
Here, we propose a two-phase RAF for a parallel cooperative joint multi-bitrate video caching and
transcoding in heterogeneous virtualized MEC networks. In the cache placement phase, we propose
novel delivery-aware cache placement strategies (DACPSs) by jointly allocating physical resources
and request scheduling based on stochastic video popularity and channel distribution information
to exploit flexible delivery opportunities. Then, for the delivery phase, we propose a delivery
policy for given caching status, instantaneous requests of users, and channel state information.
The optimization problems corresponding to both phases aim to maximize the total revenue of slices
subject to the quality of services contracted between slices and end-users and the system constraints
based on their own assumptions. Both problems are non-convex and suffer from high-computational
complexities. For each phase, we show how these two problems can be solved efficiently. We also propose
a low-complexity RAF in which the complexity of the delivery algorithm is significantly reduced.
Extensive numerical assessments demonstrate a performance improvement of up to 30% for our proposed
DACPSs over traditional approaches.
