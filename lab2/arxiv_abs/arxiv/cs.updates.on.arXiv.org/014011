A proactive approach to raise awareness while preventing misinformation is a modern-day challenge
in all domains including healthcare. Such awareness and sensitization approaches to prevention
and containment are important components of a strong healthcare system, especially in the times
of outbreaks such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. However, there is a fine balance between continuous
awareness-raising by providing new information and the risk of misinformation. In this work, we
address this gap by creating a life-long learning application that delivers authentic information
to users in Hindi, the most widely used local language in India. It does this by matching sources of
verified and authentic information such as the WHO reports against daily news by using machine learning
and natural language processing. It delivers the narrated content in Hindi by using state-of-the-art
text to speech engines. Finally, the approach allows user input for continuous improvement of news
feed relevance on a daily basis. We demonstrate a focused application of this approach for Water,
Sanitation, Hygiene as it is critical in the containment of the currently raging Covid-19 pandemic
through the WashKaro android application. Thirteen combinations of pre-processing strategies,
word-embeddings, and similarity metrics were evaluated by eight human users via calculation of
agreement statistics. The best performing combination achieved a Cohen's Kappa of 0.54 and was
deployed in the WashKaro application back-end. Interventional studies for evaluating the effectiveness
of the WashKaro application for preventing WASH-related diseases are planned to be carried out
in the Mohalla clinics that provided 3.5 Million consults in 2019 in Delhi, India. Additionally,
the application also features human-curated and vetted information to reach out to the community
as audio-visual content in local languages.
