Particle identification is one of the core tasks in the data analysis pipeline at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Statistically, this entails the identification of rare signal events buried in
immense backgrounds that mimic the properties of the former. In machine learning parlance, particle
identification represents a classification problem characterized by overlapping and imbalanced
classes. Boosted decision trees (BDTs) have had tremendous success in the particle identification
domain but more recently have been overshadowed by deep learning (DNNs) approaches. This work proposes
an algorithm to extract more out of standard boosted decision trees by targeting their main weakness,
susceptibility to overfitting. This novel construction harnesses the meta-learning techniques
of boosting and bagging simultaneously and performs remarkably well on the ATLAS Higgs (H) to tau-tau
data set (ATLAS et al., 2014) which was the subject of the 2014 Higgs ML Challenge (Adam-Bourdarios
et al., 2015). While the decay of Higgs to a pair of tau leptons was established in 2018 (CMS collaboration
et al., 2017) at the 4.9$\sigma$ significance based on the 2016 data taking period, the 2014 public
data set continues to serve as a benchmark data set to test the performance of supervised classification
schemes. We show that the score achieved by the proposed algorithm is very close to the published
winning score which leverages an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs). Although this paper focuses
on a single application, it is expected that this simple and robust technique will find wider applications
in high energy physics.
