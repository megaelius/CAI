The need for wireless communication has driven the communication systems to high performance.
However, the main bottleneck that affects the communication capability is the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT), which is the core of most modulators. This paper presents FPGA implementation of pipeline
digit-slicing multiplier-less radix 22 DIF (Decimation In Frequency) SDF (single path delay feedback)
butterfly for FFT structure. The approach is taken, in order to reduce computation complexity in
butterfly multiplier, the digit-slicing multiplier-less technique was utilized in the critical
path of pipeline Radix-22 DIF SDF FFT structure. The proposed design focused on the trade-off between
the speed and active silicon area for the chip implementation. The multiplier input data was sliced
into four blocks each one with four bits to process at the same time in parallel. The new architecture
was investigated and simulated with MATLAB software. The Verilog HDL code in Xilinx ISE environment
was derived to describe the FFT Butterfly functionality and was downloaded to Virtex II FPGA board.
Consequently, the Virtex-II FG456 Proto board was used to implement and test the design on the real
hardware. As a result, from the findings, the synthesis report indicates the maximum clock frequency
of 555.75 MHz with the total equivalent gate count of 32,146 is a marked and significant improvement
over Radix 22 DIF SDF FFT butterfly. In comparison with the conventional butterfly architecture
design which can only run at a maximum clock frequency of 200.102 MHz and the conventional multiplier
can only run at a maximum clock frequency of 221.140 MHz, the proposed system exhibits better results.
