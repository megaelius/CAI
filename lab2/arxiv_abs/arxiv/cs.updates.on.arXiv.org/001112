Mathematical expressions can be represented as a tree consisting of terminal symbols, such as identifiers
or numbers (leaf nodes), and functions or operators (non-leaf nodes). Expression trees are an important
mechanism for storing and processing mathematical expressions as well as the most frequently used
visualization of the structure of mathematical expressions. Typically, researchers and practitioners
manually visualize expression trees using general-purpose tools. This approach is laborious,
redundant, and error-prone. Manual visualizations represent a user's notion of what the markup
of an expression should be, but not necessarily what the actual markup is. This paper presents VMEXT
- a free and open source tool to directly visualize expression trees from parallel MathML. VMEXT
simultaneously visualizes the presentation elements and the semantic structure of mathematical
expressions to enable users to quickly spot deficiencies in the Content MathML markup that does
not affect the presentation of the expression. Identifying such discrepancies previously required
reading the verbose and complex MathML markup. VMEXT also allows one to visualize similar and identical
elements of two expressions. Visualizing expression similarity can support support developers
in designing retrieval approaches and enable improved interaction concepts for users of mathematical
information retrieval systems. We demonstrate VMEXT's visualizations in two web-based applications.
The first application presents the visualizations alone. The second application shows a possible
integration of the visualizations in systems for mathematical knowledge management and mathematical
information retrieval. The application converts LaTeX input to parallel MathML, computes basic
similarity measures for mathematical expressions, and visualizes the results using VMEXT.
