We study the problem of real time data capture on social media. Due to the different limitations imposed
by those media, but also to the very large amount of information, it is impossible to collect all the
data produced by social networks such as Twitter. Therefore, to be able to gather enough relevant
information related to a predefined need, it is necessary to focus on a subset of the information
sources. In this work, we focus on user-centered data capture and consider each account of a social
network as a source that can be listened to at each iteration of a data capture process, in order to
collect the corresponding produced contents. This process, whose aim is to maximize the quality
of the information gathered, is constrained by the number of users that can be monitored simultaneously.
The problem of selecting a subset of accounts to listen to over time is a sequential decision problem
under constraints, which we formalize as a bandit problem with multiple selections. Therefore,
we propose several bandit models to identify the most relevant users in real time. First, we study
of the case of the stochastic bandit, in which each user corresponds to a stationary distribution.
Then, we introduce two contextual bandit models, one stationary and the other non stationary, in
which the utility of each user can be estimated by assuming some underlying structure in the reward
space. The first approach introduces the notion of profile, which corresponds to the average behavior
of a user. The second approach takes into account the activity of a user in order to predict his future
behavior. Finally, we are interested in models that are able to tackle complex temporal dependencies
between users, with the use of a latent space within which the information transits from one iteration
to the other. Each of the proposed approaches is validated on both artificial and real datasets.
