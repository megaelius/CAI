In a generalized network design (GND) problem, a set of resources are assigned to multiple communication
requests. Each request contributes its weight to the resources it uses and the total load on a resource
is then translated to the cost it incurs via a resource specific cost function. For example, a request
may be to establish a virtual circuit, thus contributing to the load on each edge in the circuit. Motivated
by energy efficiency applications, recently, there is a growing interest in GND using cost functions
that exhibit (dis)economies of scale ((D)oS), namely, cost functions that appear subadditive
for small loads and superadditive for larger loads. The current paper advances the existing literature
on approximation algorithms for GND problems with (D)oS cost functions in various aspects: (1)
we present a generic approximation framework that yields approximation results for a much wider
family of requests in both directed and undirected graphs; (2) our framework allows for unrelated
weights, thus providing the first non-trivial approximation for the problem of scheduling unrelated
parallel machines with (D)oS cost functions; (3) our framework is fully combinatorial and runs
in strongly polynomial time; (4) the family of (D)oS cost functions considered in the current paper
is more general than the one considered in the existing literature, providing a more accurate abstraction
for practical energy conservation scenarios; and (5) we obtain the first approximation ratio for
GND with (D)oS cost functions that depends only on the parameters of the resources' technology and
does not grow with the number of resources, the number of requests, or their weights. The design of
our framework relies heavily on Roughgarden's smoothness toolbox (JACM 2015), thus demonstrating
the possible usefulness of this toolbox in the area of approximation algorithms.
