The evolution of cellular networks is driven by the dream of ubiquitous wireless connectivity:
Any data service is instantly accessible everywhere. With each generation of cellular networks,
we have moved closer to this wireless dream; first by delivering wireless access to voice communications,
then by providing wireless data services, and recently by delivering a WiFi-like experience with
wide-area coverage and user mobility management. The support for high data rates has been the main
objective in recent years, as seen from the academic focus on sum-rate optimization and the efforts
from standardization bodies to meet the peak rate requirements specified in IMT-Advanced. In contrast,
a variety of metrics/objectives are put forward in the technological preparations for 5G networks:
higher peak rates, improved coverage with uniform user experience, higher reliability and lower
latency, better energy efficiency, lower-cost user devices and services, better scalability
with number of devices, etc. These multiple objectives are coupled, often in a conflicting manner
such that improvements in one objective lead to degradation in the other objectives. Hence, the
design of future networks calls for new optimization tools that properly handle the existence and
tradeoffs between multiple objectives. In this article, we provide a review of multi-objective
optimization (MOO), which is a mathematical framework to solve design problems with multiple conflicting
objectives. (...) We provide a survey of the basic definitions, properties, and algorithmic tools
in MOO. This reveals how signal processing algorithms are used to visualize the inherent conflicts
between 5G performance objectives, thereby allowing the network designer to understand the possible
operating points and how to balance the objectives in an efficient and satisfactory way. For clarity,
we provide a case study on massive MIMO.
