Pomset logic introduced by Retor\'e is an extension of linear logic with a self-dual noncommutative
connective. The logic is defined by means of proof-nets, rather than a sequent calculus. Later a
deep inference system BV was developed with an eye to capturing Pomset logic, but equivalence of
system has not been proven up to now. As for a sequent calculus formulation, it has not been known for
either of these logics, and there are convincing arguments that such a sequent calculus in the usual
sense simply does not exist for them. In an on-going work on semantics we discovered a system similar
to Pomset logic, where a noncommutative connective is no longer self-dual. Pomset logic appears
as a degeneration, when the class of models is restricted. Motivated by these semantic considerations,
we define in the current work a semicommutative multiplicative linear logic}, which is multiplicative
linear logic extended with two nonisomorphic noncommutative connectives (not to be confused with
very different Abrusci-Ruet noncommutative logic). We develop a syntax of proof-nets and show
how this logic degenerates to Pomset logic. However, a more interesting problem than just finding
yet another noncommutative logic is to find a sequent calculus for this logic. We introduce decorated
sequents, which are sequents equipped with an extra structure of a binary relation of reachability
on formulas. We define a decorated sequent calculus for semicommutative logic and prove that it
is cut-free, sound and complete. This is adapted to "degenerate" variations, including Pomset
logic. Thus, in particular, we give a variant of sequent calculus formulation for Pomset logic,
which is one of the key results of the paper.
