The discovery of important biomarkers is a significant step towards understanding the molecular
mechanisms of carcinogenesis; enabling accurate diagnosis for, and prognosis of, a certain cancer
type. Before recommending any diagnosis, genomics data such as gene expressions(GE) and clinical
outcomes need to be analyzed. However, complex nature, high dimensionality, and heterogeneity
in genomics data make the overall analysis challenging. Convolutional neural networks(CNN) have
shown tremendous success in solving such problems. However, neural network models are perceived
mostly as `black box' methods because of their not well-understood internal functioning. However,
interpretability is important to provide insights on why a given cancer case has a certain type.
Besides, finding the most important biomarkers can help in recommending more accurate treatments
and drug repositioning. In this paper, we propose a new approach called OncoNetExplainer to make
explainable predictions of cancer types based on GE data. We used genomics data about 9,074 cancer
patients covering 33 different cancer types from the Pan-Cancer Atlas on which we trained CNN and
VGG16 networks using guided-gradient class activation maps++(GradCAM++). Further, we generate
class-specific heat maps to identify significant biomarkers and computed feature importance
in terms of mean absolute impact to rank top genes across all the cancer types. Quantitative and qualitative
analyses show that both models exhibit high confidence at predicting the cancer types correctly
giving an average precision of 96.25%. To provide comparisons with the baselines, we identified
top genes, and cancer-specific driver genes using gradient boosted trees and SHapley Additive
exPlanations(SHAP). Finally, our findings were validated with the annotations provided by the
TumorPortal.
