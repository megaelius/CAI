We present a simple model of a non-equilibrium self-organizing market where asset prices are partially
driven by investment decisions of a bounded-rational agent. The agent acts in a stochastic market
environment driven by various exogenous "alpha" signals, agent's own actions (via market impact),
and noise. Unlike traditional agent-based models, our agent aggregates all traders in the market,
rather than being a representative agent. Therefore, it can be identified with a bounded-rational
component of the market itself, providing a particular implementation of an Invisible Hand market
mechanism. In such setting, market dynamics are modeled as a fictitious self-play of such bounded-rational
market-agent in its adversarial stochastic environment. As rewards obtained by such self-playing
market agent are not observed from market data, we formulate and solve a simple model of such market
dynamics based on a neuroscience-inspired Bounded Rational Information Theoretic Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (BRIT-IRL). This results in effective asset price dynamics with a non-linear mean reversion
- which in our model is generated dynamically, rather than being postulated. We argue that our model
can be used in a similar way to the Black-Litterman model. In particular, it represents, in a simple
modeling framework, market views of common predictive signals, market impacts and implied optimal
dynamic portfolio allocations, and can be used to assess values of private signals. Moreover, it
allows one to quantify a "market-implied" optimal investment strategy, along with a measure of
market rationality. Our approach is numerically light, and can be implemented using standard off-the-shelf
software such as TensorFlow.
