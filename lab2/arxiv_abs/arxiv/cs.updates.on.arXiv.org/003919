This paper considers a different aspect of anatomical face modeling: kinematic modeling of the
jaw, i.e., the Temporo-Mandibular Joint (TMJ). Previous work often relies on simple models of jaw
kinematics, even though the actual physiological behavior of the TMJ is quite complex, allowing
not only for mouth opening, but also for some amount of sideways (lateral) and front-to-back (protrusion)
motions. Fortuitously, the TMJ is the only joint whose kinematics can be accurately measured with
optical methods, because the bones of the lower and upper jaw are rigidly connected to the lower and
upper teeth. We construct a person-specific jaw kinematic model by asking an actor to exercise the
entire range of motion of the jaw while keeping the lips open so that the teeth are at least partially
visible. This performance is recorded with three calibrated cameras. We obtain highly accurate
3D models of the teeth with a standard dental scanner and use these models to reconstruct the rigid
body trajectories of the teeth from the videos (markerless tracking). The relative rigid transformations
samples between the lower and upper teeth are mapped to the Lie algebra of rigid body motions in order
to linearize the rotational motion. Our main contribution is to fit these samples with a three-dimensional
nonlinear model parameterizing the entire range of motion of the TMJ. We show that standard Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) fails to capture the nonlinear trajectories of the moving mandible. However,
we found these nonlinearities can be captured with a special modification of autoencoder neural
networks known as Nonlinear PCA. By mapping back to the Lie group of rigid transformations, we obtain
parameterization of the jaw kinematics which provides an intuitive interface allowing the animators
to explore realistic jaw motions in a user-friendly way.
