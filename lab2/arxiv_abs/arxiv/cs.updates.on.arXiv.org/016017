Finding the most likely path to a set of failure states is important to the analysis of safety-critical
systems that operate over a sequence of time steps, such as aircraft collision avoidance systems
and autonomous cars. In many applications such as autonomous driving, failures cannot be completely
eliminated due to the complex stochastic environment in which the system operates. As a result,
safety validation is not only concerned about whether a failure can occur, but also discovering
which failures are most likely to occur. This article presents adaptive stress testing (AST), a
framework for finding the most likely path to a failure event in simulation. We consider a general
black box setting for partially observable and continuous-valued systems operating in an environment
with stochastic disturbances. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement
learning to optimize it. The approach is simulation-based and does not require internal knowledge
of the system, making it suitable for black-box testing of large systems. We present formulations
for fully observable and partially observable systems. In the latter case, we present a modified
Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that only requires access to the pseudorandom number generator
of the simulator to overcome partial observability. We also present an extension of the framework,
called differential adaptive stress testing (DAST), that can find failures that occur in one system
but not in another. This type of differential analysis is useful in applications such as regression
testing, where we are concerned with finding areas of relative weakness compared to a baseline.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on an aircraft collision avoidance application,
where a prototype aircraft collision avoidance system is stress tested to find the most likely scenarios
of near mid-air collision.
