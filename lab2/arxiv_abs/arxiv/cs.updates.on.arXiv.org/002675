Volumetric attacks, which overwhelm the bandwidth of a destination, are amongst the most common
DDoS attacks today. One practical approach to addressing these attacks is to redirect all destination
traffic (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party, DDoS-protection-as-a-service provider (e.g.,
CloudFlare) that is well provisioned and equipped with filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic
before passing the remaining benign traffic to the destination. An alternative approach is based
on the concept of network capabilities, whereby source sending rates are determined by receiver
consent, in the form of capabilities enforced by the network. While both third-party scrubbing
services and network capabilities can be effective at reducing unwanted traffic at an overwhelmed
destination, DDoS-protection-as-a-service solutions outsource all of the scheduling decisions
(e.g., fairness, priority and attack identi cation) to the provider, while capability-based solutions
require extensive modifications to existing infrastructure to operate. In this paper we introduce
MiddlePolice, which seeks to marry the deployability of DDoS-protection-as-a-service solutions
with the destination-based control of network capability systems. We show that by allowing feedback
from the destination to the provider, MiddlePolice can effeectively enforce destination-chosen
traffic control policies, while requiring no deployment from unrelated parties. Besides the above
technical contributions, we also present what we learned through our industrial interviews with
more than 100 interviewees from over 10 industry segments that are vulnerable to DDoS attacks. These
profound discussions drive us to think what DDoS prevention really means for those who need protection,
which may offer useful insight for the community to bridge the gap between academic research and
industry practice.
