Many resource allocation tasks are challenging global (i.e., non-convex) optimization problems.
The main issue is that the computational complexity of these problems grows exponentially in the
number of variables instead of polynomially as for many convex optimization problems. However,
often the non-convexity stems only from a subset of variables. Conventional global optimization
frameworks like monotonic optimization or DC programming treat all variables as global variables
and require complicated, problem specific decomposition approaches to exploit the convexity
in some variables. To overcome this challenge, we develop an easy-to-use algorithm that inherently
differentiates between convex and non-convex variables, preserving the low computational complexity
in the number of convex variables. Another issue with these widely used frameworks is that they may
suffer from severe numerical problems. We discuss this issue in detail and provide a clear motivating
example. The solution to this problem is to replace the traditional approach of finding an {\epsilon}-approximate
solution by the novel concept of {\epsilon}-essential feasibility. The underlying algorithmic
approach is called successive incumbent transcending (SIT) algorithm and builds the foundation
of our developed algorithm. A further highlight of this algorithm is that it inherently treats fractional
objectives making the use of Dinkelbach's iterative algorithm obsolete. Numerical experiments
show a speed-up of four orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art algorithms and almost three orders
of magnitude of additional speed-up over Dinkelbach's algorithm for fractional programs.
