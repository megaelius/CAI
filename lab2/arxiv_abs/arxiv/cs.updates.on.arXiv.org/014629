The present ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is creating havoc across the world.
The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive drug to cure, has made the situation very grave.
Therefore only few effective tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease,
named as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an announcement of
unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective from the next day. No exercise
of similar scale and magnitude has been ever undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire
mankind. This study aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a kinetic
model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was further constrained by large sets
of realistic parameters pertinent to India in order to capture the ground realities prevailing
in India, such as: (i) true state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise
infection distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii) realistic movements
of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements patterns across different states, (v) migration
patterns across different geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19
outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World Health Organization
(WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix) incubation period as per WHO report. This
model does not attempt to make a long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis;
but to compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In the framework
of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant success of the lockdown in containing
the disease within a tiny fraction of the population and in the absence of it, it would have led to a
very grave situation.
