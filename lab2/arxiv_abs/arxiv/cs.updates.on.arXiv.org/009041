To help mitigate road congestion caused by the unrelenting growth of traffic demand, many transit
authorities have implemented managed lane policies. Managed lanes typically run parallel to a
freeway's standard, general-purpose (GP) lanes, but are restricted to certain types of vehicles.
It was originally thought that managed lanes would improve the use of existing infrastructure through
incentivization of demand-management behaviors like carpooling, but implementations have often
been characterized by unpredicted phenomena that is often to detrimental system performance.
This paper presents several macroscopic traffic modeling tools we have used for study of freeways
equipped with managed lanes, or "managed lane-freeway networks." The proposed framework is based
on the widely-used first-order kinematic wave theory. In this model, the GP and the managed lanes
are modeled as parallel links connected by nodes, where certain type of traffic may switch between
GP and managed lane links. Two types of managed lane topologies are considered: full-access, where
vehicles can switch between the GP and the managed lanes anywhere; and separated, where such switching
is allowed only at certain locations called gates. We also describe methods to incorporate in three
phenomena into our model that are particular to managed lane-freeway networks. The inertia effect
reflects drivers' inclination to stay in their lane as long as possible and switch only if this would
obviously improve their travel condition. The friction effect reflects the empirically-observed
driver fear of moving fast in a managed lane while traffic in the adjacent GP lanes moves slowly due
to congestion. The smoothing effect describes how managed lanes can increase throughput at bottlenecks
by reducing lane changes. We present simple models for each of these phenomena that fit within the
general macroscopic theory.
