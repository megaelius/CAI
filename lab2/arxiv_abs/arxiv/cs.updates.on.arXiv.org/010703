Computer-science-oriented artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved tremendous success
in a variety of scenarios via powerful feature extraction and high-precision data operations.
It is well known, however, that ANNs usually suffer from expensive processing resources and costs.
In contrast, neuroscience-oriented spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising for energy-efficient
information processing benefit from the event-driven spike activities, whereas, they are yet
be evidenced to achieve impressive effectiveness on real complicated tasks. How to combine the
advantage of these two model families is an open question of great interest. Two significant challenges
need to be addressed: (1) lack of benchmark datasets including both ANN-oriented (frames) and SNN-oriented
(spikes) signal resources; (2) the difficulty in jointly processing the synchronous activation
from ANNs and event-driven spikes from SNNs. In this work, we proposed a hybrid paradigm, named as
DashNet, to demonstrate the advantages of combining ANNs and SNNs in a single model. A simulator
and benchmark dataset NFS-DAVIS is built, and a temporal complementary filter (TCF) and attention
module are designed to address the two mentioned challenges, respectively. In this way, it is shown
that DashNet achieves the record-breaking speed of 2083FPS on neuromorphic chips and the best tracking
performance on NFS-DAVIS and PRED18 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, DashNet is the first
framework that can integrate and process ANNs and SNNs in a hybrid paradigm, which provides a novel
solution to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency for high-speed object tracking.
