Distributed representation of words has improved the performance for many natural language tasks.
In many methods, however, only one meaning is considered for one label of a word, and multiple meanings
of polysemous words depending on the context are rarely handled. Although research works have dealt
with polysemous words, they determine the meanings of such words according to a batch of large documents.
Hence, there are two problems with applying these methods to sequential sentences, as in a conversation
that contains ambiguous expressions. The first problem is that the methods cannot sequentially
deal with the interdependence between context and word interpretation, in which context is decided
by word interpretations and the word interpretations are decided by the context. Context estimation
must thus be performed in parallel to pursue multiple interpretations. The second problem is that
the previous methods use large-scale sets of sentences for offline learning of new interpretations,
and the steps of learning and inference are clearly separated. Such methods using offline learning
cannot obtain new interpretations during a conversation. Hence, to dynamically estimate the conversation
context and interpretations of polysemous words in sequential sentences, we propose a method of
Simultaneous Contextualization And INterpreting (SCAIN) based on the traditional Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. By using the SCAIN algorithm, we can sequentially optimize
the interdependence between context and word interpretation while obtaining new interpretations
online. For experimental evaluation, we created two datasets: one from Wikipedia's disambiguation
pages and the other from real conversations. For both datasets, the results confirmed that SCAIN
could effectively achieve sequential optimization of the interdependence and acquisition of
new interpretations.
