Multi-language recipe personalisation and recommendation is an under-explored field of information
retrieval in academic and production systems. The existing gaps in our current understanding are
numerous, even on fundamental questions such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation
can be delivered across languages. In this paper, we introduce the multi-language recipe recommendation
setting and present grounding results that will help to establish the potential and absolute value
of future work in this area. Our work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes and
users from Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a combination
of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings obtained without human intervention.
In modelling, we take a classical approach based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item
metric space towards the interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without
interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts context and recipe
affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to personalisation is stable and easily scales
to new languages. A robust cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline
models and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are presented in
a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to emphasise the language-based goals
of this work. We believe that this is the first large-scale work that comprehensively considers
the value and potential of multi-language recipe recommendation and personalisation as well as
delivering scalable and reliable models.
