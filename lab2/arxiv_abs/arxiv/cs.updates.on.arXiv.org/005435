Cellular networks are constantly lagging in terms of the bandwidth needed to support the growing
high data rate demands. The system needs to efficiently allocate its frequency spectrum such that
the spectrum utilization can be maximized while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) level. Owing
to the coexistence of different types of traffic (e.g., real-time (RT) and non-real-time (nRT))
and different types of networks (e.g., small cell and macrocell), ensuring the QoS level for different
types of users becomes a challenging issue in wireless networks. Fractional frequency reuse (FFR)
is an effective approach for increasing spectrum utilization and reducing interference effects
in orthogonal frequency division multiple access networks. In this paper, we propose a new FFR scheme
in which bandwidth allocation is based on RT/nRT traffic classification. We consider the coexistence
of small cells and macrocells. After applying FFR technique in macrocells, the remaining frequency
bands are efficiently allocated among the small cells overlaid by a macrocell. In our proposed scheme,
total frequency-band allocations for different macrocells are decided on the basis of the traffic
intensity. The transmitted power levels for different frequency bands are controlled based on
the level of interference from a nearby frequency band. Frequency bands with a lower level of interference
are assigned to the RT traffic to ensure a higher QoS level for the RT traffic. RT traffic calls in macrocell
networks are also given a higher priority compared with nRT traffic calls to ensure the low call-blocking
rate. Performance analyses show significant improvement under the proposed scheme compared with
conventional FFR schemes.
