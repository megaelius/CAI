Consider a graph problem that is locally checkable but not locally solvable: given a solution we
can check that it is feasible by verifying all constant-radius neighborhoods, but to find a solution
each node needs to explore the input graph at least up to distance $\Omega(\log n)$ in order to produce
its output. We consider the complexity of such problems from the perspective of volume: how large
a subgraph does a node need to see in order to produce its output. We study locally checkable graph
problems on bounded-degree graphs. We give a number of constructions that exhibit tradeoffs between
deterministic distance, randomized distance, deterministic volume, and randomized volume:
- If the deterministic distance is linear, it is also known that randomized distance is near-linear.
In contrast, we show that there are problems with linear deterministic volume but only logarithmic
randomized volume. - We prove a volume hierarchy theorem for randomized complexity: among problems
with linear deterministic volume complexity, there are infinitely many distinct randomized volume
complexity classes between $\Omega(\log n)$ and $O(n)$. This hierarchy persists even when restricting
to problems whose randomized and deterministic distance complexities are $\Theta(\log n)$. -
Similar hierarchies exist for polynomial distance complexities: for any $k, \ell \in N$ with $k
\leq \ell$, there are problems whose randomized and deterministic distance complexities are $\Theta(n^{1/\ell})$,
randomized volume complexities are $\Theta(n^{1/k})$, and whose deterministic volume complexities
are $\Theta(n)$. Additionally, we consider connections between our volume model and massively
parallel computation (MPC). We give a general simulation argument that any volume-efficient algorithm
can be transformed into a space-efficient MPC algorithm.
