Substance use and abuse is a significant public health problem in the United States. Group-based
intervention programs offer a promising means of preventing and reducing substance abuse. While
effective, unfortunately, inappropriate intervention groups can result in an increase in deviant
behaviors among participants, a process known as deviancy training. This paper investigates the
problem of optimizing the social influence related to the deviant behavior via careful construction
of the intervention groups. We propose a Mixed Integer Optimization formulation that decides on
the intervention groups, captures the impact of the groups on the structure of the social network,
and models the impact of these changes on behavior propagation. In addition, we propose a scalable
hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm that combines Mixed Integer Programming and Large Neighborhood
Search to find near-optimal network partitions. Our algorithm is packaged in the form of GUIDE,
an AI-based decision aid that recommends intervention groups. Being the first quantitative decision
aid of this kind, GUIDE is able to assist practitioners, in particular social workers, in three key
areas: (a) GUIDE proposes near-optimal solutions that are shown, via extensive simulations, to
significantly improve over the traditional qualitative practices for forming intervention groups;
(b) GUIDE is able to identify circumstances when an intervention will lead to deviancy training,
thus saving time, money, and effort; (c) GUIDE can evaluate current strategies of group formation
and discard strategies that will lead to deviancy training. In developing GUIDE, we are primarily
interested in substance use interventions among homeless youth as a high risk and vulnerable population.
GUIDE is developed in collaboration with Urban Peak, a homeless-youth serving organization in
Denver, CO, and is under preparation for deployment.
