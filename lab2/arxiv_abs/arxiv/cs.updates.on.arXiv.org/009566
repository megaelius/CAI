Experimental data is often affected by uncontrolled variables that make analysis and interpretation
difficult. For spatiotemporal systems, this problem is further exacerbated by their intricate
dynamics. Modern machine learning methods are well-suited for modeling complex datasets, but
to be effective in science, the result needs to be interpretable. We demonstrate an unsupervised
learning technique for extracting interpretable physical parameters from noisy spatiotemporal
data and for building a transferable model of the system. In particular, we implement a physics-informed
architecture based on variational autoencoders that is designed for analyzing systems governed
by partial differential equations (PDEs). The architecture is trained end-to-end and extracts
latent parameters that parameterize the dynamics of a learned predictive model for the system.
To test our method, we train the architecture on simulated data from a variety of PDEs with varying
dynamical parameters that act as uncontrolled variables. Specifically, we examine the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation with varying viscosity damping parameter, the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with
varying nonlinearity coefficient, and the convection-diffusion equation with varying diffusion
constant and drift velocity. Numerical experiments show that our method can accurately identify
relevant parameters and extract them from raw and even noisy spatiotemporal data (tested with roughly
10% added noise). These extracted parameters correlate well (linearly with $R^2>0.95$) with the
ground truth physical parameters used to generate the datasets. Our method for discovering interpretable
latent parameters in spatiotemporal systems will allow us to better analyze and understand real-world
phenomena and datasets, which often have uncontrolled variables that alter the system dynamics
and cause varying behaviors that are difficult to disentangle.
