Facebook Disaster Maps (FBDM) is the first platform providing analysis-ready population change
products derived from crowdsourced data targeting disaster relief practices. We evaluate the
representativeness of FBDM data using the Mann-Kendall test and emerging hot and cold spots in an
anomaly analysis to reveal the trend, magnitude, and agglommeration of population displacement
during the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires in California, USA. Our results show that the distribution
of FBDM pre-crisis users fits well with the total population from different sources. Due to usage
habits, the elder population is underrepresented in FBDM data. During the two mega-fires in California,
FBDM data effectively captured the temporal change of population arising from the placing and lifting
of evacuation orders. Coupled with monotonic trends, the fall and rise of cold and hot spots of population
revealed the areas with the greatest population drop and potential places to house the displaced
residents. A comparison between the Mendocino Complex and Woolsey fires indicates that a densely
populated region can be evacuated faster than a scarcely populated one, possibly due to the better
access to transportation. In sparsely populated fire-prone areas, resources should be prioritized
to move people to shelters as the displaced residents do not have many alternative options, while
their counterparts in densely populated areas can utilize their social connections to seek temporary
stay at nearby locations during an evacuation. Integrated with an assessment on underrepresented
communities, FBDM data and the derivatives can provide much needed information of near real-time
population displacement for crisis response and disaster relief. As applications and data generation
mature, FBDM will harness crowdsourced data and aid first responder decision-making.
