Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important as the number of biomedical documents
rapidly grows. With the progress in natural language processing (NLP), extracting valuable information
from biomedical literature has gained popularity among researchers, and deep learning has boosted
the development of effective biomedical text mining models. However, directly applying the advancements
in NLP to biomedical text mining often yields unsatisfactory results due to a word distribution
shift from general domain corpora to biomedical corpora. In this article, we investigate how the
recently introduced pre-trained language model BERT can be adapted for biomedical corpora. We
introduce BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical
Text Mining), which is a domain-specific language representation model pre-trained on large-scale
biomedical corpora. With almost the same architecture across tasks, BioBERT largely outperforms
BERT and previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of biomedical text mining tasks when pre-trained
on biomedical corpora. While BERT obtains performance comparable to that of previous state-of-the-art
models, BioBERT significantly outperforms them on the following three representative biomedical
text mining tasks: biomedical named entity recognition (0.62% F1 score improvement), biomedical
relation extraction (2.80% F1 score improvement) and biomedical question answering (12.24% MRR
improvement). Our analysis results show that pre-training BERT on biomedical corpora helps it
to understand complex biomedical texts. We make the pre-trained weights of BioBERT freely available
at https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained, and the source code for fine-tuning BioBERT
available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert.
