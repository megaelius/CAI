One of the defining moments of the year 2020 is the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19), a
deadly virus affecting the body's respiratory system to the point of needing a breathing aid via
ventilators. As of June 21, 2020 there are 12,929,306 confirmed cases and 569,738 confirmed deaths
across 216 countries, areas or territories. The scale of spread and impact of the pandemic left many
nations grappling with preventive and curative approaches. The infamous lockdown measure introduced
to mitigate the virus spread has altered many aspects of our social routines in which demand for online-based
services skyrocketed. As the virus propagate, so does misinformation and fake news around it via
online social media, which seems to favour virality over veracity. With a majority of the populace
confined to their homes for a long period, vulnerability to the toxic impact of online misinformation
is high. A case in point is the various myths and disinformation associated with the Covid-19, which,
if left unchecked, could lead to a catastrophic outcome and hamper the fight against the virus. While
the scientific community is actively engaged in identifying the virus treatment, there is a growing
interest in combating the associated harmful infodemic. To this end, researchers have been curating
and documenting various datasets about Covid-19. In line with existing studies, we provide an expansive
collection of curated datasets to support the fight against the pandemic, especially concerning
misinformation. The collection consists of 3 categories of Twitter data, information about standard
practices from credible sources and a chronicle of global situation reports. We describe how to
retrieve the hydrated version of the data and proffer some research problems that could be addressed
using the data.
