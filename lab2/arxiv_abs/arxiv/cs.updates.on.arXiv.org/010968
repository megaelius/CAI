Background: Multi-articulate prostheses are capable of performing dexterous hand movements.
However, clinically available control strategies fail to provide users with intuitive, independent
and proportional control over multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) in real-time. New Method: We detail
the use of a modified Kalman filter (MKF) to provide intuitive, independent and proportional control
over six-DOF prostheses such as the DEKA "LUKE" Arm. Input features include neural firing rates
recorded from Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays and mean absolute value of intramuscular electromyographic
(EMG) recordings. Ad-hoc modifications include thresholds and non-unity gains on the output of
a Kalman filter. Results: We demonstrate that both neural and EMG data can be combined effectively.
We also highlight that modifications can be optimized to significantly improve performance relative
to an unmodified Kalman filter. Thresholds significantly reduced unintended movement and promoted
more independent control of the different DOFs. Gain were significantly greater than one and served
to amplify participant effort. Optimal modifications can be determined quickly offline and translate
to functional improvements online. Using a portable take-home system, participants performed
various activities of daily living. Comparison with Existing Methods: In contrast to pattern recognition,
the MKF allows users to continuously modulate their force output, which is critical for fine dexterity.
The MKF is also computationally efficient and can be trained in less than five minutes. Conclusions:
The MKF can be used to explore the functional and psychological benefits associated with long-term,
at-home control of dexterous prosthetic hands.
