Vision-based Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (VSLAM) is a mature problem in Robotics. Most
VSLAM systems are feature based methods, which are robust and present high accuracy, but yield sparse
maps with limited application for further navigation tasks. Most recently, direct methods which
operate directly on image intensity have been introduced, capable of reconstructing richer maps
at the cost of higher processing power. In this work, an edge-based monocular SLAM system (SE-SLAM)
is proposed as a middle point: edges present good localization as point features, while enabling
a structural semidense map reconstruction. However, edges are not easy to associate, track and
optimize over time, as they lack descriptors and biunivocal correspondence, unlike point features.
To tackle these issues, this paper presents a method to match edges between frames in a consistent
manner; a feasible strategy to solve the optimization problem, since its size rapidly increases
when working with edges; and the use of non-linear optimization techniques. The resulting system
achieves comparable precision to state of the art feature-based and dense/semi-dense systems,
while inherently building a structural semi-dense reconstruction of the environment, providing
relevant structure data for further navigation algorithms. To achieve such accuracy, state of
the art non-linear optimization is needed, over a continuous feed of 10000 edgepoints per frame,
to optimize the full semi-dense output. Despite its heavy processing requirements, the system
achieves near to real-time operation, thanks to a custom built solver and parallelization of its
key stages. In order to encourage further development of edge-based SLAM systems, SE-SLAM source
code will be released as open source.
