Purpose: This prospective clinical study assesses the feasibility of training a deep neural network
(DNN) for intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model fitting to diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (DW-MRI) data and evaluates its performance. Methods: Approval for this study was obtained
by the responsible ethics committees and written informed consent was obtained from all accrued
subjects. In May 2011, ten male volunteers (age range: 29 to 53 years, mean: 37 years) underwent DW-MRI
of the upper abdomen on 1.5T and 3.0T magnetic resonance scanners. Regions of interest in the left
and right liver lobe, pancreas, spleen, renal cortex, and renal medulla were delineated independently
by two readers. DNNs were trained for IVIM model fitting using these data; results were compared
to least-squares and Bayesian approaches to IVIM fitting. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients
(ICC) were used to assess consistency of measurements between readers. Intersubject variability
was evaluated using Coefficients of Variation (CV). The fitting error was calculated based on simulated
data and the average fitting time of each method was recorded. Results: DNNs were trained successfully
for IVIM parameter estimation. This approach was associated with high consistency between the
two readers (ICCs between 50 and 97%), low intersubject variability of estimated parameter values
(CVs between 9.2 and 28.4), and the lowest error when compared with least-squares and Bayesian approaches.
Further, fitting by DNNs was several orders of magnitude quicker than the other methods. Conclusion:
DNNs are recommended for accurate and robust IVIM model fitting to DW-MRI data. Suitable software
