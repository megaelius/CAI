One shirt size cannot fit everybody, while we cannot make a unique shirt that fits perfectly for everyone
because of resource limitation. This analogy is true for the policy making. Policy makers cannot
establish a single policy to solve all problems for all regions because each region has its own unique
issue. In the other extreme, policy makers also cannot create a policy for each small village due
to the resource limitation. Would it be better if we can find a set of largest regions such that the
population of each region within this set has common issues and we can establish a single policy for
them? In this work, we propose a framework using regression analysis and minimum description length
(MDL) to find a set of largest areas that have common indicators, which can be used to predict household
incomes efficiently. Given a set of household features, and a multi-resolution partition that
represents administrative divisions, our framework reports a set C* of largest subdivisions that
have a common model for population-income prediction. We formalize a problem of finding C* and propose
the algorithm as a solution. We use both simulation datasets as well as a real-world dataset of Thailand's
population household information to demonstrate our framework performance and application.
The results show that our framework performance is better than the baseline methods. We show the
results of our method can be used to find indicators of income prediction for many areas in Thailand.
By increasing these indicator values, we expect people in these areas to gain more incomes. Hence,
the policy makers can plan to establish the policies by using these indicators in our results as a
guideline to solve low-income issues. Our framework can be used to support policy makers to establish
policies regarding any other dependent variable beyond incomes in order to combat poverty and other
issues.
