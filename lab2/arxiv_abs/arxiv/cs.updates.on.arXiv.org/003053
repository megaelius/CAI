Container technologies, like Docker, are becoming increasingly popular. Containers provide
exceptional developer experience because containers offer lightweight isolation and ease of
software distribution. Containers are also widely used in production environments, where a different
set of challenges arise such as security, networking, service discovery and load balancing. Container
cluster management tools, such as Kubernetes, attempt to solve these problems by introducing a
new control layer with the container as the unit of deployment. However, adding a new control layer
is an extra configuration step and an additional potential source of runtime errors. The virtual
machine technology offered by cloud providers is more mature and proven in terms of security, networking,
service discovery and load balancing. However, virtual machines are heavier than containers for
local development, are less flexible for resource allocation, and suffer longer boot times. This
paper presents an alternative to containers that enjoy the best features of both approaches: (1)
the use of mature, proven cloud vendor technology; (2) no need for a new control layer; and (3) as lightweight
as containers. Our solution is i2kit, a deployment tool based on the immutable infrastructure pattern,
where the virtual machine is the unit of deployment. The i2kit tool accepts a simplified format of
Kubernetes Deployment Manifests in order to reuse Kubernetes' most successful principles, but
it creates a lightweight virtual machine for each Pod using Linuxkit. Linuxkit alleviates the drawback
in size that using virtual machines would otherwise entail, because the footprint of Linuxkit is
approximately 60MB. Finally, the attack surface of the system is reduced since Linuxkit only installs
the minimum set of OS dependencies to run containers, and different Pods are isolated by hypervisor
technology.
