Collective animal movement fascinates children and scientists alike. One of the most commonly
given explanations for collective animal movement is improved foraging. Animals are hypothesized
to gain from searching for food in groups. Here, we use a computer simulation to analyze how moving
in a group assists searching for food. We use a well-established collective movement model that
only assumes local interactions between individuals without any leadership, in order to examine
the benefits of group searching. We focus on how the sensory abilities of the simulated individuals,
and specifically their ability to detect food and to follow neighbours, influence searching dynamics
and searching performance. We show that local interactions between neighbors are sufficient for
the formation of groups, which search more efficiently than independently moving individuals.
Once a member of a group finds food, this information diffuses through the group and results in a convergence
of up to 85\% of group members on the food. Interestingly, this convergence behavior can emerge from
the local interactions between group members without a need to explicitly define it. In order to
understand the principles underlying the group's performance, we perturb many of the model's basic
parameters, including its social, environmental and sensory parameters. We test a wide range of
biological-plausible sensory regimes, relevant to different species and different sensory modalities
and examine how they effect group-foraging performance. This thorough analysis of model parameters
allows for the generalization of our results to a wide range of organisms, which rely on different
sensory modalities, explaining why they move and forage in groups.
