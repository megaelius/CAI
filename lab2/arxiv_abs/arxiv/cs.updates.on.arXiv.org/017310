Quantification of the impact of uncertainty in material properties as well as the input ground motion
on structural responses is an important step in implementing a performance-based earthquake engineering
(PBEE) framework. Among various sources of uncertainty, the variability in the input ground motions,
a.k.a. record-to-record, greatly affects the assessment results. The objective of this paper
is to quantify the uncertainty in structural response with hybrid uncertainty sources. In this
paper, multiple matrix completion methods are proposed and applied on a case study structure. The
matrix completion method is a means to estimate the analyses results for the entire set of input parameters
by conducting analysis for only a small subset of analyses. The main algorithmic contributions
of our proposed method are twofold. First, we develop a sampling technique for choosing a subset
of representative simulations, which allows improving the accuracy of the estimated response.
An unsupervised machine learning technique is used for this purpose. Next, the proposed matrix
completion method for uncertainty quantification is further refined by incorporating a regression
model that is trained on the available partial simulations. The regression model improves the initial
sampling as it provides a rough estimation of the structural responses. Finally, the proposed algorithm
is applied to a multi-degree-of-freedom system, and the structural responses (i.e., displacements
and base shear) are estimated. Results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively estimate
the response from a full set of nonlinear simulations by conducting analyses only on a small portion
of the set.
