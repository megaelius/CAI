We develop and analyse finite volume methods for the Poisson problem with boundary conditions involving
oblique derivatives. We design a generic framework, for finite volume discretisations of such
models, in which internal fluxes are not assumed to have a specific form, but only to satisfy some
(usual) coercivity and consistency properties. The oblique boundary conditions are split into
a normal component, which directly appears in the flux balance on control volumes touching the domain
boundary, and a tangential component which is managed as an advection term on the boundary. This
advection term is discretised using a finite volume method based on a centred discretisation (to
ensure optimal rates of convergence) and stabilised using a vanishing boundary viscosity. A convergence
analysis, based on the 3rd Strang Lemma \cite{DPD18}, is conducted in this generic finite volume
framework, and yields the expected $\mathcal O(h)$ optimal convergence rate in discrete energy
norm. We then describe a specific choice of numerical fluxes, based on a generalised hexahedral
meshing of the computational domain. These fluxes are a corrected version of fluxes originally
introduced in \cite{Medla.et.al2018}. We identify mesh regularity parameters that ensure that
these fluxes satisfy the required coercivity and consistency properties. The theoretical rates
of convergence are illustrated by an extensive set of 3D numerical tests, including some conducted
with two variants of the proposed scheme. A test involving real-world data measuring the disturbing
potential in Earth gravity modelling over Slovakia is also presented.
