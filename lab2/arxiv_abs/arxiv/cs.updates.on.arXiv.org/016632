By 2040, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) will affect approximately 288 million people
worldwide. Identifying individuals at high risk of progression to late AMD, the sight-threatening
stage, is critical for clinical actions, including medical interventions and timely monitoring.
Although deep learning has shown promise in diagnosing/screening AMD using color fundus photographs,
it remains difficult to predict individuals' risks of late AMD accurately. For both tasks, these
initial deep learning attempts have remained largely unvalidated in independent cohorts. Here,
we demonstrate how deep learning and survival analysis can predict the probability of progression
to late AMD using 3,298 participants (over 80,000 images) from the Age-Related Eye Disease Studies
AREDS and AREDS2, the largest longitudinal clinical trials in AMD. When validated against an independent
test dataset of 601 participants, our model achieved high prognostic accuracy (five-year C-statistic
86.4 (95% confidence interval 86.2-86.6)) that substantially exceeded that of retinal specialists
using two existing clinical standards (81.3 (81.1-81.5) and 82.0 (81.8-82.3), respectively).
Interestingly, our approach offers additional strengths over the existing clinical standards
in AMD prognosis (e.g., risk ascertainment above 50%) and is likely to be highly generalizable,
given the breadth of training data from 82 US retinal specialty clinics. Indeed, during external
validation through training on AREDS and testing on AREDS2 as an independent cohort, our model retained
substantially higher prognostic accuracy than existing clinical standards. These results highlight
the potential of deep learning systems to enhance clinical decision-making in AMD patients.
