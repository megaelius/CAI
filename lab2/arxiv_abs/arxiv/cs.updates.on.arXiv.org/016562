The proliferation of real-time applications has spurred much interest in data freshness, captured
by the {\it age-of-information} (AoI) metric. When strategic data sources have private market
information, a fundamental economic challenge is how to incentivize them to acquire fresh data
and optimize the age-related performance. In this work, we consider an information update system
in which a destination acquires, and pays for, fresh data updates from multiple sources. The destination
incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the AoI. Each source is strategic
and incurs a sampling cost, which is its private information and may not be truthfully reported to
the destination. The destination decides on the price of updates, when to get them, and who should
generate them, based on the sources' reported sampling costs. We show that a benchmark that naively
trusts the sources' reports can lead to an arbitrarily bad outcome compared to the case where sources
truthfully report. To tackle this issue, we design an optimal (economic) mechanism for timely information
acquisition following Myerson's seminal work. To this end, our proposed optimal mechanism minimizes
the sum of the destination's age-related cost and its payment to the sources, while ensuring that
the sources truthfully report their private information and will voluntarily participate in the
mechanism. However, finding the optimal mechanisms may suffer from \textit{prohibitively expensive
computational overheads} as it involves solving a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization
problem. We further propose a quantized version of the optimal mechanism that achieves asymptotic
optimality, maintains the other economic properties, and enables one to tradeoff between optimality
and computational overheads.
