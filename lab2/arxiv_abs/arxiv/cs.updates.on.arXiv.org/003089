In this paper, we propose a two-way secure communication scheme where two transceivers exchange
confidential messages via a wireless powered untrusted amplify-and-forward (AF) relay in the
presence of an external jammer. We take into account both friendly jamming (FJ) and Gaussian noise
jamming (GNJ) scenarios. Based on the time switching (TS) architecture at the relay, the data transmission
is done in three phases. In the first phase, both the energy-starved nodes, the untrustworthy relay
and the jammer, are charged by non-information radio frequency (RF) signals from the sources. In
the second phase, the two sources send their information signals and concurrently, the jammer transmits
artificial noise to confuse the curious relay. Finally, the third phase is dedicated to forward
a scaled version of the received signal from the relay to the sources. For the proposed secure transmission
schemes, we derive new closed-form lower-bound expressions for the ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR)
in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We further analyze the asymptotic ESSR to determine
the key parameters; the high SNR slope and the high SNR power offset of the jamming based scenarios.
To highlight the performance advantage of the proposed FJ, we also examine the scenario of without
jamming (WoJ). Finally, numerical examples and discussions are provided to acquire some engineering
insights, and to demonstrate the impacts of different system parameters on the secrecy performance
of the considered communication scenarios. The numerical results illustrate that the proposed
FJ significantly outperforms the traditional one-way communication and the Constellation rotation
approach, as well as our proposed benchmarks, the two-way WoJ and GNJ scenarios.
