Developing an automated vehicle, that can handle complicated driving scenarios and appropriately
interact with other road users, requires the ability to semantically learn and understand driving
environment, oftentimes, based on analyzing massive amounts of naturalistic driving data. An
important paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and gain insights
is understanding the principal compositions of the entire traffic, termed as traffic primitives.
However, the exploding data growth presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from high-dimensional
time-series traffic data with various types of road users engaged. Therefore, automatically extracting
primitives is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways to help autonomous vehicles understand and
predict the complex traffic scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should
1) be appropriate for automated driving applications and also 2) be easily used to generate new traffic
scenarios. However, existing literature does not provide a method to automatically learn these
primitives from large-scale traffic data. The contribution of this paper has two manifolds. The
first one is that we proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of limited
traffic data. The second one is that we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian learning method -- a sticky
hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model -- to automatically extract primitives from
multidimensional traffic data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed
method is then validated using one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment results show that
the nonparametric Bayesian learning method is able to extract primitives from traffic scenarios
where both the binary and continuous events coexist.
