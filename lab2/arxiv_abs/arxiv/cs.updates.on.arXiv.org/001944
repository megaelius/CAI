Ultrasound diagnosis is routinely used in obstetrics and gynecology for fetal biometry, and owing
to its time-consuming process, there has been a great demand for automatic estimation. However,
the automated analysis of ultrasound images is complicated because they are patient-specific,
operator-dependent, and machine-specific. Among various types of fetal biometry, the accurate
estimation of abdominal circumference (AC) is especially difficult to perform automatically
because the abdomen has low contrast against surroundings, non-uniform contrast, and irregular
shape compared to other parameters.We propose a method for the automatic estimation of the fetal
AC from 2D ultrasound data through a specially designed convolutional neural network (CNN), which
takes account of doctors' decision process, anatomical structure, and the characteristics of
the ultrasound image. The proposed method uses CNN to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble,
amniotic fluid, and umbilical vein) and Hough transformation for measuring AC. We test the proposed
method using clinical ultrasound data acquired from 56 pregnant women. Experimental results show
that, with relatively small training samples, the proposed CNN provides sufficient classification
results for AC estimation through the Hough transformation. The proposed method automatically
estimates AC from ultrasound images. The method is quantitatively evaluated, and shows stable
performance in most cases and even for ultrasound images deteriorated by shadowing artifacts.
As a result of experiments for our acceptance check, the accuracies are 0.809 and 0.771 with the expert
1 and expert 2, respectively, while the accuracy between the two experts is 0.905. However, for cases
of oversized fetus, when the amniotic fluid is not observed or the abdominal area is distorted, it
could not correctly estimate AC.
