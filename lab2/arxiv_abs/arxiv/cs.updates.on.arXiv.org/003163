We consider the problem of unforgeable authentication of classical messages in the presence of
quantum adversaries. Formulating and solving this natural problem has been a challenge, as the
familiar classical notions of unforgeability do not directly translate into meaningful notions
in the quantum setting. A particular difficulty is how to capture the notion of "predicting an unqueried
value" of a function in a setting where the adversary can query in quantum superposition. In this
article, we point out some shortcomings of previous definitions of unpredictability against quantum
adversaries, propose a new definition, and support its viability with several constructions and
reductions. We begin by pointing out a weakness in a previous definition of Boneh and Zhandry. Specifically,
we demonstrate a function which is secure according to the (single-query) Boneh-Zhandry definition,
but is clearly vulnerable to a (single-query) quantum forgery attack, whereby a query supported
only on inputs that start with 0 divulges the value of the function on an input that starts with 1. We
then propose a new definition, which we call "blind-unforgeability" (or BU). This notion defines
a function to be predictable if there exists an adversary which can use "partially blinded" oracle
access to predict values in the blinded region. Our definition (BU) coincides with classical unpredictability
(i.e., EUF-CMA) in the purely classical setting. In the quantum setting, it can be satisfied efficiently
using quantum-secure pseudorandom functions. We show that BU satisfies a composition property
(Hash-and-MAC) using Bernoulli-preserving hash functions, a new notion which may be of independent
interest. We also show that BU is amenable to security reductions, by giving a precise bound on the
extent to which quantum algorithms can deviate from their usual behavior due to the blinding in the
BU security experiment.
