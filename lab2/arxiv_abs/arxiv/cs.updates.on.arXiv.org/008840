In this paper, we propose a game theoretical adversarial intervention detection mechanism for
reliable smart road signs. A future trend in intelligent transportation systems is ``smart road
signs" that incorporate smart codes (e.g., visible at infrared) on their surface to provide more
detailed information to smart vehicles. Such smart codes make road sign classification problem
aligned with communication settings more than conventional classification. This enables us to
integrate well-established results in communication theory, e.g., error-correction methods,
into road sign classification problem. Recently, vision-based road sign classification algorithms
have been shown to be vulnerable against (even) small scale adversarial interventions that are
imperceptible for humans. On the other hand, smart codes constructed via error-correction methods
can lead to robustness against small scale intelligent or random perturbations on them. In the recognition
of smart road signs, however, humans are out of the loop since they cannot see or interpret them. Therefore,
there is no equivalent concept of imperceptible perturbations in order to achieve a comparable
performance with humans. Robustness against small scale perturbations would not be sufficient
since the attacker can attack more aggressively without such a constraint. Under a game theoretical
solution concept, we seek to ensure certain measure of guarantees against even the worst case (intelligent)
attackers that can perturb the signal even at large scale. We provide a randomized detection strategy
based on the distance between the decoder output and the received input, i.e., error rate. Finally,
we examine the performance of the proposed scheme over various scenarios.
