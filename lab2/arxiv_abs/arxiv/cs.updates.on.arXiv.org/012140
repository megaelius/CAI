Uncertainty in renewable energy generation and load consumption is a great challenge for microgrid
operation, especially in islanded mode as the microgrid may be small in size and has limited flexible
resources. In this paper, a multi-timescale, two-stage robust unit commitment and economic dispatch
model is proposed to optimize the microgrid operation. The first stage is a combination of day-ahead
hourly and real-time sub-hourly model, which means the day-ahead dispatch result must also satisfy
the real-time condition at the same time. The second stage is to verify the feasibility of the day-ahead
dispatch result in worst-case condition considering high-level uncertainty in renewable energy
dispatch and load consumptions. In the proposed model, battery energy storage system (BESS) and
solar PV units are integrated as a combined solar-storage system. The BESS plays an essential role
to balance the variable output of solar PV units, which keeps the combined solar-storage system
output unchanged on an hourly basis. In this way, it largely neutralizes the impact of solar uncertainty
and makes the microgrid operation grid friendly. Furthermore, in order to enhance the flexibility
and resilience of the microgrid, both BESS and thermal units provide regulating reserve to manage
solar and load uncertainty. The model has been tested in a controlled hardware in loop (CHIL) environment
for the Bronzeville Community Microgrid system in Chicago. The simulation results show that the
proposed model works effectively in managing the uncertainty in solar PV and load and can provide
a flexible dispatch in both grid-connected and islanded modes.
