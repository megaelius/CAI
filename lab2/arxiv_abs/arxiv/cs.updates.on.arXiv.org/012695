Relation Extraction (RE), the task of detecting and characterizing semantic relations between
entities in text, has gained much importance in the last two decades, mainly in the biomedical domain.
Many papers have been published on Relation Extraction using supervised machine learning techniques.
Most of these techniques rely on statistical methods, such as feature-based and tree-kernels-based
methods. Such statistical learning techniques are usually based on a propositional hypothesis
space for representing examples, i.e., they employ an attribute-value representation of features.
This kind of representation has some drawbacks, particularly in the extraction of complex relations
which demand more contextual information about the involving instances, i.e., it is not able to
effectively capture structural information from parse trees without loss of information. In this
work, we present OntoILPER, a logic-based relational learning approach to Relation Extraction
that uses Inductive Logic Programming for generating extraction models in the form of symbolic
extraction rules. OntoILPER takes profit of a rich relational representation of examples, which
can alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The proposed relational approach seems to be more
suitable for Relation Extraction than statistical ones for several reasons that we argue. Moreover,
OntoILPER uses a domain ontology that guides the background knowledge generation process and is
used for storing the extracted relation instances. The induced extraction rules were evaluated
on three protein-protein interaction datasets from the biomedical domain. The performance of
OntoILPER extraction models was compared with other state-of-the-art RE systems. The encouraging
results seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
