To date, there is a need for the development of efficient data and device exchange protocols that
this exchange will provide, since standard protocols used in traditional networks can not fully
meet the needs of a new type of network. The article describes the process of development and implementation
of a full-scale model of noise-resistant and sensor network breaks. The stability of this network
is achieved by building a distributed network, in which all nodes send messages to all available
nodes. Wireless mobile peer-to-peer network (MANET) can be configured automatically, so the nodes
in it can move freely. Wireless networks do not have the complexity of infrastructure and management,
which allows devices to create and join on-the-go networks - anywhere, anytime. In this paper, the
theoretical part of the functioning of such networks and the field of their use is considered. After
that, an initial analysis of the available equipment used for constructing such hardware solutions
was conducted. The software for developing such solutions is considered in detail, as well as examples
of finished models that implement the investigated functional. After that, several variants of
the model of network nodes, as well as the test device for creating a payload on the network, are collected.
For this purpose, third-party open solutions were used in conjunction with their own developments.
The system received a series of tests that made it possible to understand the weak and strong points
of such a network and draw conclusions for the further development of the project and the creation
of an improved working prototype. The article presents the basic electrical circuits of devices,
the list of used equipment and software used and the photographic material of prototypes of the created
system.
