We continue the program of proving circuit lower bounds via circuit satisfiability algorithms.
So far, this program has yielded several concrete results, proving that functions in $\text{Quasi-NP}
= \text{NTIME}[n^{(\log n)^{O(1)}}]$ and $\text{NEXP}$ do not have small circuits from various
circuit classes ${\cal C}$, by showing that ${\cal C}$ admits non-trivial satisfiability and/or
$\#$SAT algorithms which beat exhaustive search by a minor amount. In this paper, we present a new
strong lower bound consequence of non-trivial $\#$SAT algorithm for a circuit class ${\mathcal
C}$. Say a symmetric Boolean function $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is sparse if it outputs $1$ on $O(1)$
values of $\sum_i x_i$. We show that for every sparse $f$, and for all "typical" ${\cal C}$, faster
$\#$SAT algorithms for ${\cal C}$ circuits actually imply lower bounds against the circuit class
$f \circ {\cal C}$, which may be stronger than ${\cal C}$ itself. In particular: $\#$SAT algorithms
for $n^k$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in $2^n/n^k$ time (for all $k$) imply $\text{NEXP}$
does not have $f \circ {\cal C}$-circuits of polynomial size. $\#$SAT algorithms for $2^{n^{\epsilon}}$-size
${\cal C}$-circuits running in $2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ time (for some $\epsilon > 0$) imply $\text{Quasi-NP}$
does not have $f \circ {\cal C}$-circuits of polynomial size. Applying $\#$SAT algorithms from
the literature, one immediate corollary of our results is that $\text{Quasi-NP}$ does not have
$\text{EMAJ} \circ \text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ circuits of polynomial size, where $\text{EMAJ}$
is the "exact majority" function, improving previous lower bounds against $\text{ACC}^0$ [Williams
JACM'14] and $\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ [Williams STOC'14], [Murray-Williams STOC'18].
This is the first nontrivial lower bound against such a circuit class.
