Toric (or sparse) elimination theory is a framework developped during the last decades to exploit
monomial structures in systems of Laurent polynomials. Roughly speaking, this amounts to computing
in a \emph{semigroup algebra}, i.e. an algebra generated by a subset of Laurent monomials. In order
to solve symbolically sparse systems, we introduce \emph{sparse Gr\"obner bases}, an analog of
classical Gr\"obner bases for semigroup algebras, and we propose sparse variants of the $F_5$ and
FGLM algorithms to compute them. Our prototype ''proof-of-concept'' implementation shows large
speed-ups (more than 100 for some examples) compared to optimized (classical) Gr\"obner bases
software. Moreover, in the case where the generating subset of monomials corresponds to the points
with integer coordinates in a normal lattice polytope $\polytope\subset\R^n$ and under regularity
assumptions, we prove complexity bounds which depend on the combinatorial properties of $\polytope$.
These bounds yield new estimates on the complexity of solving $0$-dimensional systems via Gr\"obner
bases when all polynomials share the same Newton polytope (\emph{unmixed case}). For instance,
we generalize the bound $\min(n_1,n_2)+1$ on the maximal degree in a Gr\"obner basis of a $0$-dimensional
bilinear system with blocks of variables of sizes $(n_1,n_2)$ to the multilinear case: $\sum n_i
- \max(n_i)+1$. We also propose a variant of Fr\"oberg's conjecture which allows us to estimate
the complexity of solving overdetermined sparse systems. Finally, our complexity results apply
in the dense (usual) case and, as a surprising by-product, we prove that restrictive assumptions
in usual complexity estimates of classical inhomogeneous Gr\"obner bases algorithms can be removed.
