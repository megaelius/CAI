A major step in developing robust wireless systems is to test and validate the design under a variety
of circumstances. As wireless networks become more complex, it is impractical to perform testing
on a real deployment. As a result, the network administrators rely on network simulators or network
emulators to validate their configurations and design. Unfortunately, network simulation falls
short per it requires users to model the network behavior analytically. On the other hand, network
emulation allows users to employ real network applications on virtualized network devices. Despite
their complex design, the existing network emulation solutions miss full-scale automation rather
they rely on experienced users to write complex configuration scripts making testing. Therefore,
the validation process is prone to human operator errors. Furthermore, they require a significant
amount of computational resources that might not be feasible for many users. Moreover, most network
emulators focus on lower layers of the network thus requiring users to employ their own network applications
to control and measure network performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel wireless
network emulation platform, the system, that provides users a unified, high-level configuration
interface for different layers of wireless networks to reduce management complexities of network
emulators while having a generic, fully-automated platform. Menes is a generic, full-stack, fully-automated
test and validation platform that empowers existing state-of-the-art emulation, virtualization,
and network applications including performance measurement tools. We then provide an implementation
of Menes based on the EMANE with Docker. Our extensive evaluations show that the system requires
much less computing resources, significantly decreases CAPEX and OPEX, and greatly extensible
for different use cases.
