A reliable and accurate forecasting model for crop yields is of crucial importance for efficient
decision-making process in the agricultural sector. However, due to weather extremes and uncertainties,
most forecasting models for crop yield are not reliable and accurate. For measuring the uncertainty
and obtaining further information of future crop yields, a probability density forecasting model
based on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-SJ) is proposed. The nonlinear
structure of random forest is applied to change the quantile regression model for building the probabilistic
forecasting model. Epanechnikov kernel function and solve-the equation plug-in approach of Sheather
and Jones are used in the kernel density estimation. A case study using the annual crop yield of groundnut
and millet in Ghana is presented to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed technique.
The values of the prediction interval coverage probability and prediction interval normalized
average width for the two crops show that the constructed prediction intervals capture the observed
yields with high coverage probability. The probability density curves show that QRF-SJ method
has a very high ability to forecast quality prediction intervals with a higher coverage probability.
The feature importance gave a score of the importance of each weather variable in building the quantile
regression forest model. The farmer and other stakeholders are able to realize the specific weather
variable that affect the yield of a selected crop through feature importance. The proposed method
and its application on crop yield dataset are the first of its kind in literature.
