We study the generalized degrees of freedom (gDoF) of the block-fading noncoherent diamond (parallel
relay) wireless network with asymmetric distributions of link strengths, and a coherence time
of T symbol duration. We first derive an outer bound for this channel and then derive the optimal signaling
structure for this outer bound. Using the optimal signaling structure we solve the outer bound optimization
problem in terms of its gDoF. Using insights from our outer bound signaling solution, we devise an
achievability strategy based on a novel scheme that we call train-scale quantize-map-forward
(TS-QMF). This uses training in the links from the source to the relays, scaling and quantizing at
the relays combined with nontraining-based schemes. We show the optimality of this scheme with
respect to the outer bound in terms of the gDoF. In noncoherent point-to-point multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) channels, where the fading channel is unknown to transmitter and receiver, an important
tradeoff between communication and channel learning was revealed by Zheng and Tse, by demonstrating
that not all the available antennas might be used, as it is suboptimal to learn all their channel parameters.
Our results in this paper for the diamond network demonstrates that in certain regimes the optimal
scheme uses a subnetwork, demonstrating a tradeoff between channel learning and communications.
In some regimes, it is gDoF optimal to do relay selection, i.e, use a part of the network. In the other
regimes, even when it is essential to use the entire network, it is suboptimal to learn the channel
states for all the links in the network, i.e, traditional training-based schemes are suboptimal
in these regimes.
