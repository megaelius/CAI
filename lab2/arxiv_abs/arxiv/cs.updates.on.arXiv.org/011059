Context: Neural Network (NN) algorithms have been successfully adopted in a number of Safety-Critical
Cyber-Physical Systems (SCCPSs). Testing and Verification (T&V) of NN-based control software
in safety-critical domains are gaining interest and attention from both software engineering
and safety engineering researchers and practitioners. Objective: With the increase in studies
on the T&V of NN-based control software in safety-critical domains, it is important to systematically
review the state-of-the-art T&V methodologies, to classify approaches and tools that are invented,
and to identify challenges and gaps for future studies. Method: We retrieved 950 papers on the T&V
of NN-based Safety-Critical Control Software (SCCS). To reach our result, we filtered 83 primary
papers published between 2001 and 2018, applied the thematic analysis approach for analyzing the
data extracted from the selected papers, presented the classification of approaches, and identified
challenges. Conclusion: The approaches were categorized into five high-order themes: assuring
robustness of NNs, assuring safety properties of NN-based control software, improving the failure
resilience of NNs, measuring and ensuring test completeness, and improving the interpretability
of NNs. From the industry perspective, improving the interpretability of NNs is a crucial need in
safety-critical applications. We also investigated nine safety integrity properties within
four major safety lifecycle phases to investigate the achievement level of T&V goals in IEC 61508-3.
Results show that correctness, completeness, freedom from intrinsic faults, and fault tolerance
have drawn most attention from the research community. However, little effort has been invested
in achieving repeatability; no reviewed study focused on precisely defined testing configuration
or on defense against common cause failure.
