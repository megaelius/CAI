Zero-Knowledge Proof-of-Identity from trusted public certificates (e.g., national identity
cards and/or ePassports; eSIM) is introduced here to permissionless blockchains in order to remove
the inefficiencies of Sybil-resistant mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (i.e., high energy and
environmental costs) and Proof-of-Stake (i.e., capital hoarding and lower transaction volume).
The proposed solution effectively limits the number of mining nodes a single individual would be
able to run while keeping membership open to everyone, circumventing the impossibility of full
decentralization and the blockchain scalability trilemma when instantiated on a blockchain with
a consensus protocol based on the cryptographic random selection of nodes. Resistance to collusion
is also considered. Solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchains, a zk-PoI cryptocurrency
is proved to have the following advantageous properties: - an incentive-compatible protocol for
the issuing of cryptocurrency rewards based on a unique Nash equilibrium - strict domination of
mining over all other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies, thus the zk-PoI cryptocurrency becoming the preferred
choice by miners is proved to be a Nash equilibrium and the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy - PoW/PoS
cryptocurrencies are condemned to pay the Price of Crypto-Anarchy, redeemed by the optimal efficiency
of zk-PoI as it implements the social optimum - the circulation of a zk-PoI cryptocurrency Pareto
dominates other PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies - the network effects arising from the social networks
inherent to national identity cards and ePassports dominate PoW/PoS cryptocurrencies - the lower
costs of its infrastructure imply the existence of a unique equilibrium where it dominates other
forms of payment
