Traditional nearest points methods use all the samples in an image set to construct a single convex
or affine hull model for classification. However, strong artificial features and noisy data may
be generated from combinations of training samples when significant intra-class variations and/or
noise occur in the image set. Existing multi-model approaches extract local models by clustering
each image set individually only once, with fixed clusters used for matching with various image
sets. This may not be optimal for discrimination, as undesirable environmental conditions (eg.
illumination and pose variations) may result in the two closest clusters representing different
characteristics of an object (eg. frontal face being compared to non-frontal face). To address
the above problem, we propose a novel approach to enhance nearest points based methods by integrating
affine/convex hull classification with an adapted multi-model approach. We first extract multiple
local convex hulls from a query image set via maximum margin clustering to diminish the artificial
variations and constrain the noise in local convex hulls. We then propose adaptive reference clustering
(ARC) to constrain the clustering of each gallery image set by forcing the clusters to have resemblance
to the clusters in the query image set. By applying ARC, noisy clusters in the query set can be discarded.
Experiments on Honda, MoBo and ETH-80 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms single
model approaches and other recent techniques, such as Sparse Approximated Nearest Points, Mutual
Subspace Method and Manifold Discriminant Analysis.
