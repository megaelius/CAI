Advances in Data Science permeate every field of Transportation Science and Engineering, making
it straightforward to imagine that developments in the transportation sector will be data-driven.
Nowadays, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) could be arguably approached as a "story"
intensively producing and consuming large amounts of data. A diversity of sensing devices densely
spread over the infrastructure, vehicles or the travelers' personal devices act as sources of data
flows that are eventually fed to software running on automatic devices, actuators or control systems
producing, in turn, complex information flows between users, traffic managers, data analysts,
traffic modeling scientists, etc. These information flows provide enormous opportunities to
improve model development and decision-making. This work aims to describe how data, coming from
diverse ITS sources, can be used to learn and adapt data-driven models for efficiently operating
ITS assets, systems and processes; in other words, for data-based models to fully become actionable.
Grounded on this described data modeling pipeline for ITS, we define the characteristics, engineering
requisites and challenges intrinsic to its three compounding stages, namely, data fusion, adaptive
learning and model evaluation. We deliberately generalize model learning to be adaptive, since,
in the core of our paper is the firm conviction that most learners will have to adapt to the ever-changing
phenomenon scenario underlying the majority of ITS applications. Finally, we provide a prospect
of current research lines within Data Science that can bring notable advances to data-based ITS
modeling, which will eventually bridge the gap towards the practicality and actionability of such
models.
