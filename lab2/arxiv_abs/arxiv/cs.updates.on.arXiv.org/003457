This paper presents an online learning with regularized kernel based one-class extreme learning
machine (ELM) classifier and is referred as online RK-OC-ELM. The baseline kernel hyperplane model
considers whole data in a single chunk with regularized ELM approach for offline learning in case
of one-class classification (OCC). Further, the basic hyper plane model is adapted in an online
fashion from stream of training samples in this paper. Two frameworks viz., boundary and reconstruction
are presented to detect the target class in online RKOC-ELM. Boundary framework based one-class
classifier consists of single node output architecture and classifier endeavors to approximate
all data to any real number. However, one-class classifier based on reconstruction framework is
an autoencoder architecture, where output nodes are identical to input nodes and classifier endeavor
to reconstruct input layer at the output layer. Both these frameworks employ regularized kernel
ELM based online learning and consistency based model selection has been employed to select learning
algorithm parameters. The performance of online RK-OC-ELM has been evaluated on standard benchmark
datasets as well as on artificial datasets and the results are compared with existing state-of-the
art one-class classifiers. The results indicate that the online learning one-class classifier
is slightly better or same as batch learning based approaches. As, base classifier used for the proposed
classifiers are based on the ELM, hence, proposed classifiers would also inherit the benefit of
the base classifier i.e. it will perform faster computation compared to traditional autoencoder
based one-class classifier.
