Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power
applications such as the Internet of Things, Radio Frequency identification (RFID) networks,
etc. Although there has been some progress towards multi-antenna multi-sine WPT design, the large-scale
design of WPT, reminiscent of massive MIMO in communications, remains an open challenge. In this
paper, we derive efficient multiuser algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework,
in order to design transmit sinewaves that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output
DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity introduced by the rectification
process on the design of waveforms in multiuser systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case,
the optimal spatial domain beamforming, obtained prior to the frequency domain power allocation
optimization, turns out to be Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). In contrast, in the general weighted
sum criterion maximization problem, the spatial domain beamforming optimization and the frequency
domain power allocation optimization are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, low-complexity
algorithms are proposed based on asymptotic analysis, to maximize the two criteria. The structure
of the asymptotically optimal spatial domain precoder can be found prior to the optimization. The
performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Numerical results confirm the inefficiency
of the linear model-based design for the single and multi-user scenarios. It is also shown that as
nonlinear model-based designs, the proposed algorithms can benefit from an increasing number
of sinewaves.
