In the real-time decision-making and local planning process of autonomous vehicles in dynamic
environments, the autonomous driving system may fail to find a reasonable policy or even gets trapped
in some situation due to the complexity of global tasks and the incompatibility between upper-level
maneuver decisions with the low-level lower level trajectory planning. To solve this problem,
this paper presents a synchronous maneuver searching and trajectory planning (SMSTP) algorithm
based on the topological concept of homotopy. Firstly, a set of alternative maneuvers with boundary
limits are enumerated on a multi-lane road. Instead of sampling numerous paths in the whole spatio-temporal
space, we, for the first time, propose using Trajectory Profiles (TPs) to quickly construct the
topological maneuvers represented by different routes, and put forward a corridor generation
algorithm based on graph-search. The bounded corridor further constrains the maneuver's space
in the spatial space. A step-wise heuristic optimization algorithm is then proposed to synchronously
generate a feasible trajectory for each maneuver. To achieve real-time performance, we initialize
the states to be optimized with the boundary constraints of maneuvers, and we set some heuristic
states as terminal targets in the quadratic cost function. The solution of a feasible trajectory
is always guaranteed only if a specific maneuver is given. The simulation and realistic driving-test
experiments verified that the proposed SMSTP algorithm has a short computation time which is less
than 37ms, and the experimental results showed the validity and effectiveness of the SMSTP algorithm.
