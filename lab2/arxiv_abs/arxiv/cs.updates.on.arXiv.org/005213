Inherent fuzzy entropy is an objective measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) complexity,
reflecting the robustness of brain systems. In this study, we present a novel application of multi-scale
relative inherent fuzzy entropy using repetitive steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs)
to investigate EEG complexity change between two migraine phases, i.e. inter-ictal (baseline)
and pre-ictal (before migraine attacks) phases. We used a wearable headband EEG device with O1,
Oz, O2 and Fpz electrodes to collect EEG signals from 80 participants (40 migraine patients and 40
healthy controls [HCs]) under the following two conditions: during resting state and SSVEPs with
five 15-Hz photic stimuli. We found a significant enhancement in occipital EEG entropy with increasing
stimulus times in both HCs and patients in the inter-ictal phase but a reverse trend in patients in
the pre-ictal phase. In the 1st SSVEP , occipital EEG entropy of the HCs was significantly higher
than that of patents in the pre-ictal phase (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). Regarding the transitional
variance of EEG entropy between the 1st and 5th SSVEPs, patients in the pre-ictal phase exhibited
significantly lower values than patients in the inter-ictal phase (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). Furthermore,
in the classification model, the AdaBoost ensemble learning showed an accuracy of 81% and AUC of
0.87 for classifying inter-ictal and pre-ictal phases. In contrast, there were no differences
in EEG entropy among groups or sessions by using other competing entropy models, including approximate
entropy, sample entropy and fuzzy entropy on the same dataset. In conclusion, inherent fuzzy entropy
offers novel applications in visual stimulus environments and may have the potential to provide
a pre-ictal alert to migraine patients.
