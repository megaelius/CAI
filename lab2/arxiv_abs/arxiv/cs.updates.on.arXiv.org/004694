An impurity measures $I:{R}^k \to {R}^+$ maps a $k$-dimensional vector ${\bf v}$ to a non-negative
value $I({\bf v})$ so that the more homogeneous ${\bf v}$, the larger its impurity. We study clustering
based on impurity measures: given a collection $V$ of $n$ many $k$-dimensional vectors and an impurity
measure $I$, the goal is to find a partition ${\cal P}$ of $V$ into $L$ groups $V_1,\ldots,V_L$ that
minimizes the total impurities of the groups in ${\cal P}$, i.e., $I({\cal P})= \sum_{m=1}^{L}
I(\sum_{{\bf v} \in V_m}{\bf v}).$ Impurity minimization is widely used as quality assessment
measure in probability distribution clustering and in categorical clustering where it is not possible
to rely on geometric properties of the data set. However, in contrast to the case of metric based clustering,
the current knowledge of impurity measure based clustering in terms of approximation and inapproximability
results is very limited. Our research contributes to fill this gap. We first present a simple linear
time algorithm that simultaneously achieves $3$-approximation for the Gini impurity measure
and $O(\log(\sum_{{\bf v} \in V} \| {\bf v} \|_1))$-approximation for the Entropy impurity measure.
Then, for the Entropy impurity measure---where we also show that finding the optimal clustering
is strongly NP-hard---we are able to design a polynomial time $O(\log^2(\min\{k,L\}))$-approximation
algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a nontrivial characterization of a class of clusterings that
necessarily includes a partition achieving $O(\log^2(\min\{k,L\}))$--approximation of the
impurity of the optimal partition. Remarkably, this is the first polynomial time algorithm with
approximation guarantee independent of the number of points/vector and not relying on any restriction
on the components of the vectors for producing clusterings with minimum entropy.
