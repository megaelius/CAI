The degree-$d$ Chow parameters of a Boolean function $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ are its degree
at most $d$ Fourier coefficients. It is well-known that degree-$d$ Chow parameters uniquely characterize
degree-$d$ polynomial threshold functions (PTFs) within the space of all bounded functions. In
this paper, we prove a robust version of this theorem: For $f$ any Boolean degree-$d$ PTF and $g$ any
bounded function, if the degree-$d$ Chow parameters of $f$ are close to the degree-$d$ Chow parameters
of $g$ in $\ell_2$-norm, then $f$ is close to $g$ in $\ell_1$-distance. Notably, our bound relating
the two distances is completely independent of the dimension $n$. That is, we show that Boolean degree-$d$
PTFs are {\em robustly identifiable} from their degree-$d$ Chow parameters. Results of this form
had been shown for the $d=1$ case~\cite{OS11:chow, DeDFS14}, but no non-trivial bound was previously
known for $d >1$. Our robust identifiability result gives the following algorithmic applications:
First, we show that Boolean degree-$d$ PTFs can be efficiently approximately reconstructed from
approximations to their degree-$d$ Chow parameters. This immediately implies that degree-$d$
PTFs are efficiently learnable in the uniform distribution $d$-RFA model~\cite{BenDavidDichterman:98}.
As a byproduct of our approach, we also obtain the first low integer-weight approximations of degree-$d$
PTFs, for $d>1$. As our second application, our robust identifiability result gives the first efficient
algorithm, with dimension-independent error guarantees, for malicious learning of Boolean degree-$d$
PTFs under the uniform distribution.
