We study the spread of information in finite and infinite inhomogeneous spatial random graphs.
We assume that each edge has a transmission cost that is a product of an i.i.d. random variable L and
a penalty factor: edges between vertices of expected degrees w_1 and w_2 are penalised by a factor
of (w_1w_2)^\mu for all \mu >0. We study this process for scale-free percolation, for (finite and
infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and for Hyperbolic Random Graphs, all with power
law degree distributions with exponent \tau > 1. For \tau < 3, we find a threshold behaviour, depending
on how fast the cumulative distribution function of L decays at zero. If it decays at most polynomially
with exponent smaller than (3-\tau)/(2\mu) then explosion happens, i.e., with positive probability
we can reach infinitely many vertices with finite cost (for the infinite models), or reach a linear
fraction of all vertices with bounded costs (for the finite models). On the other hand, if the cdf
of L decays at zero at least polynomially with exponent larger than (3-\tau)/(2\mu), then no explosion
happens. This behaviour is arguably a better representation of information spreading processes
in social networks than the case without penalising factor, in which explosion always happens unless
the cdf of L is doubly exponentially flat around zero. Finally, we extend the results to other penalty
functions, including arbitrary polynomials in w_1 and w_2. In some cases the interesting phenomenon
occurs that the model changes behaviour (from explosive to conservative and vice versa) when we
reverse the role of w_1 and w_2. Intuitively, this could corresponds to reversing the flow of information:
gathering information might take much longer than sending it out.
