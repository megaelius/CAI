Given a tree and a set P of non-trivial simple paths on it, VPT(P) is the VPT graph (i.e. the vertex intersection
graph) of the paths P, and EPT(P) is the EPT graph (i.e. the edge intersection graph) of P. These graphs
have been extensively studied in the literature. Given two (edge) intersecting paths in a graph,
their split vertices is the set of vertices having degree at least 3 in their union. A pair of (edge)
intersecting paths is termed non-splitting if they do not have split vertices (namely if their union
is a path). We define the graph ENPT(P) of edge intersecting non-splitting paths of a tree, termed
the ENPT graph, as the graph having a vertex for each path in P, and an edge between every pair of vertices
representing two paths that are both edge-intersecting and non-splitting. A graph G is an ENPT graph
if there is a tree T and a set of paths P of T such that G=ENPT(P), and we say that <T,P> is a representation
of G. Our goal is to characterize the representation of chordless ENPT cycles (holes). To achieve
this goal, we first assume that the EPT graph induced by the vertices of an ENPT hole is given. In [2]
we introduce three assumptions (P1), (P2), (P3) defined on EPT, ENPT pairs of graphs. In the same
study, we define two problems HamiltonianPairRec, P3-HamiltonianPairRec and characterize the
representations of ENPT holes that satisfy (P1), (P2), (P3). In this work, we continue our work by
relaxing these three assumptions one by one. We characterize the representations of ENPT holes
satisfying (P3) by providing a polynomial-time algorithm to solve P3-HamiltonianPairRec. We
also show that there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm to solve HamiltonianPairRec, unless
P=NP.
