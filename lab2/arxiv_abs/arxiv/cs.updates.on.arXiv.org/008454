The consumer UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) market has grown significantly over the past few years.
Despite its huge potential in spurring economic growth by supporting various applications, the
increase of consumer UAVs poses potential risks to public security and personal privacy. To minimize
the risks, efficiently detecting and identifying invading UAVs is in urgent need for both invasion
detection and forensics purposes. Given the fact that consumer UAVs are usually used in a civilian
environment, existing physical detection methods (such as radar, vision, and sound) may become
ineffective in many scenarios. Aiming to complement the existing physical detection mechanisms,
we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV identification over encrypted Wi-Fi
traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and
video streaming. The proposed framework extracts features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival
time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can efficiently detect UAVs and identify their operation modes.
In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted $\ell_1$-norm
regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features.
This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective
function. To tackle the packet inter-arrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between
the detection accuracy and delay, we utilize Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method to estimate
the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of eight
types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method.
