Analytical solutions and a vast majority of numerical ones for fracture propagation in saturated
porous media yield smooth behavior while experiments, field observations and a few numerical solutions
reveal stepwise crack advancement and pressure oscillations. To explain this fact, we invoke self-organization
of rupture observed in fracturing solids, both dry and fully saturated, when two requirements are
satisfied: i) the external drive has a much slower timescale than fracture propagation; and ii)
the increment of the external load (drive) is applied only when the internal rearrangement of fracture
is over. These requirements are needed to obtain clean Self Organised Criticality (SOC) in quasi-static
situations. They imply that there should be no restriction on the fracture velocity i.e. algorithmically
the fracture advancement rule should always be independent of the crack velocity. Generally, this
is not the case when smooth answers are obtained which are often unphysical. Under the above conditions
hints of Self Organized Criticality are evident in heterogeneous porous media in quasi-static
conditions using a lattice model, showing stepwise advancement of the fracture and pressure oscillations.
We extend this model to incorporate inertia forces and show that this behavior still holds. By incorporating
the above requirements in numerical fracture advancement algorithms for cohesive fracture in
saturated porous continua we also reproduce stepwise advancements and pressure oscillations
both in quasi-static and dynamic situations. Since dynamic tests of dry specimens show that the
fracture advancement velocity is not constant we replicate such an effect with a model of a debonding
beam on elastic foundation. This is the first step before introducing the interaction with a fluid.
