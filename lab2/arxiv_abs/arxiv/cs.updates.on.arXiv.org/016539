Naor, Parter, and Yogev [SODA 2020] recently designed a compiler for automatically translating
standard centralized interactive protocols to distributed interactive protocols, as introduced
by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena [PODC 2018]. In particular, by using this compiler, every linear-time
algorithm for deciding the membership to some fixed graph class can be translated into a $\mathsf{dMAM}(O(\log
n))$ protocol for this class, that is, a distributed interactive protocol with $O(\log n)$-bit
proof size in $n$-node graphs, and three interactions between the (centralizer) computationally-unbounded
but non-trustable prover Merlin, and the (decentralized) randomized computationally-limited
verifier Arthur. As a corollary, there is a $\mathsf{dMAM}(O(\log n))$ protocol for the class of
planar graphs, as well as for the class of graphs with bounded genus. We show that there exists a distributed
interactive protocol for the class of graphs with bounded genus performing just a single interaction,
from the prover to the verifier, yet preserving proof size of $O(\log n)$ bits. This result also holds
for the class of graphs with bounded demi-genus, that is, graphs that can be embedded on a non-orientable
surface of bounded genus. The interactive protocols described in this paper are actually proof-labeling
schemes, i.e., a subclass of interactive protocols, previously introduced by Korman, Kutten,
and Peleg [PODC 2005]. In particular, these schemes do not require any randomization from the verifier,
and the proofs may often be computed a priori, at low cost, by the nodes themselves. Our results thus
extend the recent proof-labeling scheme for planar graphs by Feuilloley et al. [PODC 2020], to graphs
of bounded genus, and to graphs of bounded demigenus.
