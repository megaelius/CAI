This article presents evidence for the idea that much of human perception and thinking, and much
of computing and mathematics, may be understood as compression of information. This is the basis
for the "SP theory of intelligence", outlined in the article and fully described elsewhere. Relevant
evidence may be seen: in empirical support for the SP theory; in some advantages of information compression
(IC) in terms of biology and engineering; in our use of shorthands and ordinary words in language;
in how we merge successive views of any one thing; in visual recognition; in binocular vision; in
visual adaptation; in how we learn lexical and grammatical structures in language; and in perceptual
constancies. IC via the matching and unification of patterns may be seen in both computing and mathematics:
in IC via equations; in the matching and unification of names; in the reduction or removal of redundancy
from unary numbers; in the workings of Post's Canonical System and the transition function in the
Universal Turing Machine; in the way computers retrieve information from memory; in systems like
Prolog; and in the query-by-example technique for information retrieval. The chunking-with-codes
technique for IC may be seen in the use of named functions to avoid repetition of computer code. The
schema-plus-correction technique may be seen in functions with parameters and in the use of classes
in object-oriented programming. And the run-length coding technique may be seen in multiplication,
in division, and in several other devices in mathematics and computing. The SP theory resolves the
apparent paradox of "decompression by compression". And computing and cognition as IC is compatible
with the uses of redundancy in such things as backup copies to safeguard data and understanding speech
in a noisy environment.
