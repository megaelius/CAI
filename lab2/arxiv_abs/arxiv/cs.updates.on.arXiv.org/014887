Given a graph $G$, the maximal induced subgraphs problem asks to enumerate all maximal induced subgraphs
of $G$ that belong to a certain hereditary graph class. While its optimization version, known as
the minimum vertex deletion problem in literature, has been intensively studied, enumeration
algorithms are known for a few simple graph classes, e.g., independent sets, cliques, and forests,
until very recently [Conte and Uno, STOC 2019]. There is also a connected variation of this problem,
where one is concerned with only those induced subgraphs that are connected. We introduce two new
approaches, which enable us to develop algorithms that solve both variations for a number of important
graph classes. A general technique that has been proved very powerful in enumeration algorithms
is to build a solution map, i.e., a multiple digraph on all the solutions of the problem, and the key
of this approach is to make the solution map strongly connected, so that a simple traversal of the
solution map solves the problem. We introduce retaliation-free paths to certificate strong connectedness
of the solution map we build. Generalizing the idea of Cohen, Kimelfeld, and Sagiv [JCSS 2008], we
introduce the $t$-restricted version, $t$ being a positive integer, of the maximal (connected)
induced subgraphs problem, and show that it is equivalent to the original problem in terms of solvability
in incremental polynomial time. Moreover, we give reductions between the two variations, so that
it suffices to solve one of the variations for each class we study. Our work also leads to direct and
simpler proofs of several important known results.
