While deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a large number of
complex tasks, it remains a big challenge to deploy such networks for practical, on-device edge
scenarios such as on mobile devices, consumer devices, drones, and vehicles. In this study, we take
a deeper exploration into a human-machine collaborative design approach for creating highly efficient
deep neural networks through a synergy between principled network design prototyping and machine-driven
design exploration. The efficacy of human-machine collaborative design is demonstrated through
the creation of AttoNets, a family of highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device edge deep
learning. Each AttoNet possesses a human-specified network-level macro-architecture comprising
of custom modules with unique machine-designed module-level macro-architecture and micro-architecture
designs, all driven by human-specified design requirements. Experimental results for the task
of object recognition showed that the AttoNets created via human-machine collaborative design
has significantly fewer parameters and computational costs than state-of-the-art networks designed
for efficiency while achieving noticeably higher accuracy (with the smallest AttoNet achieving
~1.8% higher accuracy while requiring ~10x fewer multiply-add operations and parameters than
MobileNet-V1). Furthermore, the efficacy of the AttoNets is demonstrated for the task of instance-level
object segmentation and object detection, where an AttoNet-based Mask R-CNN network was constructed
with significantly fewer parameters and computational costs (~5x fewer multiply-add operations
and ~2x fewer parameters) than a ResNet-50 based Mask R-CNN network.
