We prove three new lower bounds for graph connectivity in the $1$-bit broadcast congested clique
model, BCC$(1)$. First, in the KT-$0$ version of BCC$(1)$, in which nodes are aware of neighbors
only through port numbers, we show an $\Omega(\log n)$ round lower bound for CONNECTIVITY even for
constant-error randomized Monte Carlo algorithms. The deterministic version of this result can
be obtained via the well-known "edge-crossing" argument, but, the randomized version of this result
requires establishing new combinatorial results regarding the indistinguishability graph induced
by inputs. In our second result, we show that the $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound result extends to the
KT-$1$ version of the BCC$(1)$ model, in which nodes are aware of IDs of all neighbors, though our
proof works only for deterministic algorithms. Since nodes know IDs of their neighbors in the KT-$1$
model, it is no longer possible to play "edge-crossing" tricks; instead we present a reduction from
the 2-party communication complexity problem PARTITION in which Alice and Bob are give two set partitions
on $[n]$ and are required to determine if the join of these two set partitions equals the trivial one-part
set partition. While our KT-$1$ CONNECTIVITY lower bound holds only for deterministic algorithms,
in our third result we extend this $\Omega(\log n)$ KT-1 lower bound to constant-error Monte Carlo
algorithms for the closely related CONNECTED COMPONENTS problem. We use information-theoretic
techniques to obtain this result. All our results hold for the seemingly easy special case of CONNECTIVITY
in which an algorithm has to distinguish an instance with one cycle from an instance with multiple
cycles. Our results showcase three rather different lower bound techniques and lay the groundwork
for further improvements in lower bounds for CONNECTIVITY in the BCC$(1)$ model.
