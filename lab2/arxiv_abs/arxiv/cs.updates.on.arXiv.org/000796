This paper studies the uplink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) where the cell sites are connected
to a cloud-computing-based central processor (CP) with noiseless backhaul links with finite capacities.
We employ a simple compress-and-forward scheme in which the base-stations(BSs) quantize the received
signals and send the quantized signals to the CP using either distributed Wyner-Ziv coding or single-user
compression. The CP decodes the quantization codewords first, then decodes the user messages as
if the remote users and the cloud center form a virtual multiple-access channel (VMAC). This paper
formulates the problem of optimizing the quantization noise levels for weighted sum rate maximization
under a sum backhaul capacity constraint. We propose an alternating convex optimization approach
to find a local optimum solution to the problem efficiently, and more importantly, establish that
setting the quantization noise levels to be proportional to the background noise levels is near
optimal for sum-rate maximization when the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is high.
In addition, with Wyner-Ziv coding, the approximate quantization noise level is shown to achieve
the sum-capacity of the uplink C-RAN model to within a constant gap. With single-user compression,
a similar constant-gap result is obtained under a diagonal dominant channel condition. These results
lead to an efficient algorithm for allocating the backhaul capacities in C-RAN. The performance
of the proposed scheme is evaluated for practical multicell and heterogeneous networks. It is shown
that multicell processing with optimized quantization noise levels across the BSs can significantly
improve the performance of wireless cellular networks.
