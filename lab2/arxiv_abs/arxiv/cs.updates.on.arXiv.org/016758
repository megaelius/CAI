Deep generative models are often used for human motion prediction as they are able to model multi-modal
data distributions and characterize diverse human behavior. While much care has been taken into
designing and learning deep generative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from
a deep generative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem. To obtain samples
from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative human motion prediction methods
draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes and convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this
random sampling strategy is not guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent
sampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based solely on likelihood which
may only produce samples that correspond to the major modes of the data distribution. To address
these problems, we propose a novel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce
a diverse set of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random (independent) sampling,
the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single random variable and then maps it with a set of learnable
mapping functions to a set of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded
into a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a diversity-promoting prior over samples
as an objective to optimize the latent mappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior
is highly flexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features (e.g.,
similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments demonstrate that DLow outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of sample diversity and accuracy. Our code is released
