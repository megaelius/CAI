Prognostic tumor growth modeling via volumetric medical imaging observations can potentially
lead to better outcomes of tumor treatment and surgical planning. Recent advances of convolutional
networks have demonstrated higher accuracy than traditional mathematical models in predicting
future tumor volumes. This indicates that deep learning-based techniques may have great potentials
on addressing such problem. However, current 2D patch-based modeling approaches cannot make full
use of the spatio-temporal imaging context of the tumor's longitudinal 4D (3D + time) data. Moreover,
they are incapable to predict clinically-relevant tumor properties, other than volumes. In this
paper, we exploit to formulate the tumor growth process through convolutional Long Short-Term
Memory (ConvLSTM) that extract tumor's static imaging appearances and capture its temporal dynamic
changes within a single network. We extend ConvLSTM into the spatio-temporal domain (ST-ConvLSTM)
by jointly learning the inter-slice 3D contexts and the longitudinal or temporal dynamics from
multiple patient studies. Our approach can incorporate other non-imaging patient information
in an end-to-end trainable manner. Experiments are conducted on the largest 4D longitudinal tumor
dataset of 33 patients to date. Results validate that the ST-ConvLSTM produces a Dice score of 83.2%+-5.1%
and a RVD of 11.2%+-10.8%, both significantly outperforming (p<0.05) other compared methods of
linear model, ConvLSTM, and generative adversarial network (GAN) under the metric of predicting
future tumor volumes. Additionally, our new method enables the prediction of both cell density
and CT intensity numbers. Last, we demonstrate the generalizability of ST-ConvLSTM by employing
it in 4D medical image segmentation task, which achieves an averaged Dice score of 86.3+-1.2% for
left-ventricle segmentation in 4D ultrasound with 3 seconds per patient.
