We introduce a new coordination problem in distributed computing that we call the population stability
problem. A system of agents each with limited memory and communication, as well as the ability to
replicate and self-destruct, is subjected to attacks by a worst-case adversary that can at a bounded
rate (1) delete agents chosen arbitrarily and (2) insert additional agents with arbitrary initial
state into the system. The goal is perpetually to maintain a population whose size is within a constant
factor of the target size $N$. The problem is inspired by the ability of complex biological systems
composed of a multitude of memory-limited individual cells to maintain a stable population size
in an adverse environment. Such biological mechanisms allow organisms to heal after trauma or to
recover from excessive cell proliferation caused by inflammation, disease, or normal development.
We present a population stability protocol in a communication model that is a synchronous variant
of the population model of Angluin et al. In each round, pairs of agents selected at random meet and
exchange messages, where at least a constant fraction of agents is matched in each round. Our protocol
uses three-bit messages and $\omega(\log^2 N)$ states per agent. We emphasize that our protocol
can handle an adversary that can both insert and delete agents, a setting in which existing approximate
counting techniques do not seem to apply. The protocol relies on a novel coloring strategy in which
the population size is encoded in the variance of the distribution of colors. Individual agents
can locally obtain a weak estimate of the population size by sampling from the distribution, and
make individual decisions that robustly maintain a stable global population size.
