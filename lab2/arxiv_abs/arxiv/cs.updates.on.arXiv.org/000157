The Euler genus of a graph is a fundamental and well-studied parameter in graph theory and topology.
Computing it has been shown to be NP-hard [Thomassen 1989, 1993], and it is known to be fixed-parameter
tractable. However, the approximability of the Euler genus is wide open. While the existence of
an O(1)-approximation is not ruled out, only an O(sqrt(n))-approximation is known [Chen, Kanchi,
and Kanevsky, 1997] even in bounded degree graphs. In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm
which on input a bounded-degree graph of Euler genus g, computes a drawing into a surface of Euler
genus g^O(1) * log^O(1) n. Combined with the upper bound from [Chen, Kanchi, and Kanevsky, 1997],
our result also implies a O(n^(1/2 - alpha)-approximation, for some constant alpha>0. Using
our algorithm for approximating the Euler genus as a subroutine, we obtain, in a unified fashion,
algorithms with approximation ratios of the form OPT^O(1) * log^O(1) n for several related problems
on bounded degree graphs. These include the problems of orientable genus, crossing number, and
planar edge and vertex deletion problems. Our algorithm and proof of correctness for the crossing
number problem is shorter and simpler compared to the long and difficult proof in the recent (80 pages
long) breakthrough by [Chuzhoy 2011], while essentially obtaining a qualitatively similar result.
For planar edge and vertex deletion problems our results are the first to obtain a bound of the form
poly(OPT, log n). We also highlight some further applications of our results in the design of algorithms
for graphs with small genus. Many such algorithms require that a drawing of the graph is given as part
of the input. Our results imply that in several interesting cases, we can implement such algorithms
even when the drawing is unknown.
