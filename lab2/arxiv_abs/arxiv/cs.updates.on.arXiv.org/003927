Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have emerged as a promising technique to rapidly provide
wireless coverage to a geographical area, where a flying UAV can be fast deployed to serve as cell
site. Existing work on UAV-enabled wireless networks overlook the fast UAV deployment for wireless
coverage, and such deployment problems have only been studied recently in sensor networks. Unlike
sensors, UAVs should be deployed to the air and they are generally different in flying speed, operating
altitude and wireless coverage radius. By considering such UAV heterogeneity to cover the whole
target area, this paper studies two fast UAV deployment problems: one is to minimize the maximum
deployment delay among all UAVs (min-max) for fairness consideration, and the other is to minimize
the total deployment delay (min-sum) for efficiency consideration. We prove both min-max and min-sum
problems are NP-complete in general. When dispatching UAVs from the same location, we present an
optimal algorithm of low computational complexity $O(n^2)$ for the min-max problem. When UAVs
are dispatched from different locations, we propose to preserve their location order during deployment
and successfully design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) of computation complexity
$O(n^2 \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ to arbitrarily approach the global optimum with relative error
$\epsilon$. The min-sum problem is more challenging. When UAVs are dispatched from the same initial
location, we present an approximation algorithm of linear time. As for the general case, we further
reformulate it as a dynamic program and propose a pseudo polynomial-time algorithm to solve it optimally.
