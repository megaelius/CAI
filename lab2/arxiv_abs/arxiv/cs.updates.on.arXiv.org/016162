We explore connections between the phenomenon of correlation decay and the location of Lee-Yang
and Fisher zeros for various spin systems. In particular we show that, in many instances, proofs
showing that weak spatial mixing on the Bethe lattice (infinite $\Delta$-regular tree) implies
strong spatial mixing on all graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be lifted to the complex plane,
establishing the absence of zeros of the associated partition function in a complex neighborhood
of the region in parameter space corresponding to strong spatial mixing. This allows us to give unified
proofs of several recent results of this kind, including the resolution by Peters and Regts of the
Sokal conjecture for the partition function of the hard core lattice gas. It also allows us to prove
new results on the location of Lee-Yang zeros of the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model. We show further
that our methods extend to the case when weak spatial mixing on the Bethe lattice is not known to be
equivalent to strong spatial mixing on all graphs. In particular, we show that results on strong
spatial mixing in the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model can be lifted to the complex plane to give new
zero-freeness results for the associated partition function. This extension allows us to give
the first deterministic FPTAS for counting the number of $q$-colorings of a graph of maximum degree
$\Delta$ provided only that $q\ge 2\Delta$. This matches the natural bound for randomized algorithms
obtained by a straightforward application of Markov chain Monte Carlo. We also give an improved
version of this result for triangle-free graphs. Finally, on trees of maximum degree $\Delta$,
we show zero-freeness of the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model partition function under the condition
$q \geq \Delta + 1$, which matches the threshold for weak spatial mixing.
