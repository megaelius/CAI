With the great achievement of artificial intelligence, vehicle technologies have advanced significantly
from human centric driving towards fully automated driving. An intelligent vehicle should be able
to understand the driver's perception of the environment as well as controlling behavior of the
vehicle. Since high digital map information has been available to provide rich environmental context
about static roads, buildings and traffic infrastructures, it would be worthwhile to explore map
data capability for driving task understanding. Alternative to commercial used maps, the OpenStreetMap
(OSM) data is a free open dataset, which makes it unique for the exploration research. This study
is focused on two tasks that leverage OSM for driving environment understanding. First, driving
scenario attributes are retrieved from OSM elements, which are combined with vehicle dynamic signals
for the driving event recognition. Utilizing steering angle changes and based on a Bi-directional
Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN), a driving sequence is segmented and classified as lane-keeping,
lane-change-left, lane-change-right, turn-left, and turn-right events. Second, for autonomous
driving perception, OSM data can be used to render virtual street views, represented as prior knowledge
to fuse with vision/laser systems for road semantic segmentation. Five different types of road
masks are generated from OSM, images, and Lidar points, and fused to characterize the drivable space
at the driver's perspective. An alternative data-driven approach is based on a Fully Convolutional
Network (FCN), OSM availability for deep learning methods are discussed to reveal potential usage
on compensating street view images and automatic road semantic annotation.
