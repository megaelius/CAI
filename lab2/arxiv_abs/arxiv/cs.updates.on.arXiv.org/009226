In object detection, the intersection over union (IoU) threshold is frequently used to define positives/negatives.
The threshold used to train a detector defines its \textit{quality}. While the commonly used threshold
of 0.5 leads to noisy (low-quality) detections, detection performance frequently degrades for
larger thresholds. This paradox of high-quality detection has two causes: 1) overfitting, due
to vanishing positive samples for large thresholds, and 2) inference-time quality mismatch between
detector and test hypotheses. A multi-stage object detection architecture, the Cascade R-CNN,
composed of a sequence of detectors trained with increasing IoU thresholds, is proposed to address
these problems. The detectors are trained sequentially, using the output of a detector as training
set for the next. This resampling progressively improves hypotheses quality, guaranteeing a positive
training set of equivalent size for all detectors and minimizing overfitting. The same cascade
is applied at inference, to eliminate quality mismatches between hypotheses and detectors. An
implementation of the Cascade R-CNN without bells or whistles achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the COCO dataset, and significantly improves high-quality detection on generic and specific
object detection datasets, including VOC, KITTI, CityPerson, and WiderFace. Finally, the Cascade
R-CNN is generalized to instance segmentation, with nontrivial improvements over the Mask R-CNN.
