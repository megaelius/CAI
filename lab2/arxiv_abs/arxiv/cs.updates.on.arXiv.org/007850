Tomography medical imaging is essential in the clinical workflow of modern cancer radiotherapy.
Radiation oncologists identify cancerous tissues, applying delineation on treatment regions
throughout all image slices. This kind of task is often formulated as a volumetric segmentation
task by means of 3D convolutional networks with considerable computational cost. Instead, inspired
by the treating methodology of considering meaningful information across slices, we used Gated
Graph Neural Network to frame this problem more efficiently. More specifically, we propose convolutional
recurrent Gated Graph Propagator (GGP) to propagate high-level information through image slices,
with learnable adjacency weighted matrix. Furthermore, as physicians often investigate a few
specific slices to refine their decision, we model this slice-wise interaction procedure to further
improve our segmentation result. This can be set by editing any slice effortlessly as updating predictions
of other slices using GGP. To evaluate our method, we collect an Esophageal Cancer Radiotherapy
Target Treatment Contouring dataset of 81 patients which includes tomography images with radiotherapy
target. On this dataset, our convolutional graph network produces state-of-the-art results and
outperforms the baselines. With the addition of interactive setting, performance is improved
even further. Our method has the potential to be easily applied to diverse kinds of medical tasks
with volumetric images. Incorporating both the ability to make a feasible prediction and to consider
the human interactive input, the proposed method is suitable for clinical scenarios.
