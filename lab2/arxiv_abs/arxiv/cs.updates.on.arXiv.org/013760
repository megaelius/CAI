This thesis is concerned with deriving planning algorithms for robot manipulators. Manipulation
has two effects, the robot has a physical effect on the object, and it also acquires information about
the object. This thesis presents algorithms that treat both problems. First, I present an extension
of the well-known piano mover's problem where a robot pushing an object must plan its movements as
well as those of the object. This requires simultaneous planning in the joint space of the robot and
the configuration space of the object, in contrast to the original problem which only requires planning
in the latter space. The effects of a robot action on the object configuration are determined by the
non-invertible rigid body mechanics. Second, I consider planning under uncertainty and in particular
planning for information effects. I consider the case where a robot has to reach and grasp an object
under pose uncertainty caused by shape incompleteness. The approach presented in this report is
to study and possibly extend a new approach to artificial intelligence (A.I.) which has emerged
in the last years in response to the necessity of building intelligent controllers for agents operating
in unstructured stochastic environments. Such agents require the ability to learn by interaction
with its environment an optimal action-selection behaviour. The main issue is that real-world
problems are usually dynamic and unpredictable. Thus, the agent needs to update constantly its
current image of the world using its sensors, which provide only a noisy description of the surrounding
environment. Although there are different schools of thinking, with their own set of techniques,
a brand new direction which unifies many A.I. researches is to formalise such agent/environment
interactions as embedded systems with stochastic dynamics.
