We examine deterministic broadcasting on multiple-access channels for a scenario when packets
are injected continuously by an adversary to the buffers of the devices at rate $\rho$ packages per
round. The aim is to maintain system stability, that is, bounded queues. In contrast to previous
work we assume that there is a strict limit of available power, defined as the total number of stations
allowed to transmit or listen to the channel at a given time, that can never be exceeded. We study how
this constraint influences the quality of services with particular focus on stability. We show
that in the regime of deterministic algorithms, the significance of energy restriction depends
strongly on communication capabilities of broadcasting protocols. For the adaptive and full-sensing
protocols, wherein stations may substantially adopt their behavior to the injection pattern,
one can construct efficient algorithms using very small amounts of power without sacrificing throughput
or stability of the system. In particular, we construct constant-energy adaptive and full sensing
protocols stable for $\rho=1$ and any $\rho<1$, respectively, even for worst case (adversarial)
injection patterns. Surprisingly, for the case of acknowledgment based algorithms that cannot
adopt to the situation on the channel (i.e., their transmitting pattern is fixed in advance), limiting
power leads to reducing the throughput. That is, for this class of protocols in order to preserve
stability we need to reduce injection rate significantly. We support our theoretical analysis
by simulation results of algorithms constructed in the paper. We depict how they work for systems
of moderate, realistic sizes. We also provide a comprehensive simulation to compare our algorithms
with backoff algorithms, which are common in real-world implementations, in terms of queue sizes
and energy consumption.
