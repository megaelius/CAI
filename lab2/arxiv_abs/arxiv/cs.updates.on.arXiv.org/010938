The exploration of small bodies in the Solar System is a high priority planetary science. Asteroids,
comets, and planetary moons yield important information about the evolution of the Solar System.
Additionally, they could provide resources for a future space economy. While much research has
gone into exploring asteroids and comets, dedicated spacecraft missions to planetary moons are
few and far between. There are three fundamental challenges of a spacecraft mission to the planetary
moons: The first challenge is that the spheres of influence of most moons (except that of Earth) are
small and, in many cases, virtually absent. The second is that many moons are tidally locked to their
planets, which means that an observer on the planet will have an entire hemisphere, which is always
inaccessible. The third challenge is that at a given time about half of the region will be in the Sun's
shadow. Therefore, a single spacecraft mission to observe the planetary moon cannot provide complete
coverage. Such a complex task can be solved using a swarm approach, where the mapping task is delegated
to multiple low-cost spacecraft. Clearly, the design of a swarm mission for such a dynamic environment
is challenging. For this reason, we have proposed the Integrated Design Engineering & Automation
of Swarms (IDEAS) software to perform automated end-to-end design of swarm missions. Specifically,
it will use a sub-module known as the Automated Swarm Designer module to find optimal swarm configurations
suited for a given mission. In our previous work, we have developed the Automated Swarm Design module
to find swarm configurations for asteroid mapping operations. In this work, we will evaluate the
capability of the Automated Swarm module to design missions to planetary moons.
