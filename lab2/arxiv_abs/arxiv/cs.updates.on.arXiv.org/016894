A recent trend to recognize facial expressions in the real-world scenario is to deploy attention
based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) locally to signify the importance of facial regions
and, combine it with global facial features and/or other complementary context information for
performance gain. However, in the presence of occlusions and pose variations, different channels
respond differently, and further that the response intensity of a channel differ across spatial
locations. Also, modern facial expression recognition(FER) architectures rely on external sources
like landmark detectors for defining attention. Failure of landmark detector will have a cascading
effect on FER. Additionally, there is no emphasis laid on the relevance of features that are input
to compute complementary context information. Leveraging on the aforementioned observations,
an end-to-end architecture for FER is proposed in this work that obtains both local and global attention
per channel per spatial location through a novel spatio-channel attention net (SCAN), without
seeking any information from the landmark detectors. SCAN is complemented by a complementary context
information (CCI) branch. Further, using efficient channel attention (ECA), the relevance of
features input to CCI is also attended to. The representation learnt by the proposed architecture
is robust to occlusions and pose variations. Robustness and superior performance of the proposed
model is demonstrated on both in-lab and in-the-wild datasets (AffectNet, FERPlus, RAF-DB, FED-RO,
SFEW, CK+, Oulu-CASIA and JAFFE) along with a couple of constructed face mask datasets resembling
masked faces in COVID-19 scenario. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/1980x/SCAN-CCI-FER
