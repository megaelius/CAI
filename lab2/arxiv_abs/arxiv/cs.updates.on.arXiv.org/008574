In recent years, we have seen a tenfold increase in volume and complexity of digital data acquired
for cultural heritage documentation. Meanwhile, open data and open science have become leading
trends in digital humanities. The convergence of those two parameters compels us to deliver, in
an interoperable fashion, datasets that are vastly heterogeneous both in content and format and,
moreover, in such a way that they fit the expectation of a broad array of researchers and an even broader
public audience. Tackling those issues is one of the main goal of the "HeritageS" digital platform
project supported by the "Intelligence des Patrimoines" research program. This platform is designed
to allow research projects from many interdisciplinary fields to share, integrate and valorize
cultural and natural heritage datasets related to the Loire Valley. In this regard, one of our main
project is the creation of the "Renaissance Transmedia Lab". Its core element is a website which
acts as a hub to access various interactive experiences linked to project about the Renaissance
period: augmented web-documentary, serious game, virtual reality, 3D application. We expect
to leverage those transmedia experiences to foster better communication between researchers
and the public while keeping the quality of scientific discourse. By presenting the current and
upcoming productions, we intend to share our experience with other participants: preparatory
work and how we cope with researchers to produce, in concertation, tailor-made experiences that
convey the desired scientific discourse while remaining appealing to the general public.
