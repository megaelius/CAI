Network representations can help reveal the behavior of complex systems. Useful information can
be derived from the network properties and invariants, such as components, clusters or cliques,
as well as from their changes over time. The evolution of clusters of nodes (or communities) is one
of the major focus of research. However, the time dimension increases complexity, introducing
new constructs and requiring novel and enhanced algorithms. In spite of recent improvements, the
relative scarcity of timestamped representations of empiric networks, with known ground truth,
hinders algorithm validation. A few approaches have been proposed to generate synthetic temporal
networks that conform to static topological specifications while in general adopting an ad-hoc
approach to temporal evolution. We believe there is still a need for a principled synthetic network
generator that conforms to problem domain topological specifications from a static as well as temporal
perspective. Here we present such a system. The unique attributes of our system include accepting
arbitrary node degree and cluster size distributions and temporal evolution under user control,
while supporting tunable joint distribution and temporal correlation of node degrees. Theoretical
contributions include the analysis of conditions for "graphability" of sequences of inter and
intra cluster node degrees and cluster sizes and the development of a heuristic to search for the
cluster membership of nodes that minimizes the shared information distance between clusterings.
Our work shows that this system is capable of generating networks under user controlled topology
with up to thousands of nodes and hundreds of clusters with strong topology adherence. Much larger
networks are possible with relaxed requirements. The generated networks support algorithm validation
as well as problem domain analysis.
