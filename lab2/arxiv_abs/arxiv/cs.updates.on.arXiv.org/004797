Tumor proliferation is an important biomarker indicative of the prognosis of breast cancer patients.
Assessment of tumor proliferation in a clinical setting is highly subjective and labor-intensive
task. Previous efforts to automate tumor proliferation assessment by image analysis only focused
on mitosis detection in predefined tumor regions. However, in a real-world scenario, automatic
mitosis detection should be performed in whole-slide images (WSIs) and an automatic method should
be able to produce a tumor proliferation score given a WSI as input. To address this, we organized
the TUmor Proliferation Assessment Challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) on prediction of tumor proliferation
scores from WSIs. The challenge dataset consisted of 500 training and 321 testing breast cancer
histopathology WSIs. In order to ensure fair and independent evaluation, only the ground truth
for the training dataset was provided to the challenge participants. The first task of the challenge
was to predict mitotic scores, i.e., to reproduce the manual method of assessing tumor proliferation
by a pathologist. The second task was to predict the gene expression based PAM50 proliferation scores
from the WSI. The best performing automatic method for the first task achieved a quadratic-weighted
Cohen's kappa score of $\kappa$ = 0.567, 95% CI [0.464, 0.671] between the predicted scores and the
ground truth. For the second task, the predictions of the top method had a Spearman's correlation
coefficient of r = 0.617, 95% CI [0.581 0.651] with the ground truth. This was the first study that
investigated tumor proliferation assessment from WSIs. The achieved results are promising given
the difficulty of the tasks and weakly-labelled nature of the ground truth. However, further research
is needed to improve the practical utility of image analysis methods for this task.
