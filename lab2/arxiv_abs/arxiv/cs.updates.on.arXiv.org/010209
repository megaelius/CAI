This paper studies an $n$-dimensional additive Gaussian noise channel with a peak-power-constrained
input. It is well known that, in this case, when $n=1$ the capacity-achieving input distribution
is discrete with finitely many mass points, and when $n>1$ the capacity-achieving input distribution
is supported on finitely many concentric shells. However, due to the previous proof technique,
neither the exact number of mass points/shells of the optimal input distribution nor a bound on it
was available. This paper provides an alternative proof of the finiteness of the number mass points/shells
of the capacity-achieving input distribution and produces the first firm bounds on the number of
mass points and shells, paving an alternative way for approaching many such problems. Roughly,
the paper consists of three parts. The first part considers the case of $n=1$. The first result, in
this part, shows that the number of mass points in the capacity-achieving input distribution is
within a factor of two from the downward shifted capacity-achieving output probability density
function (pdf). The second result, by showing a bound on the number of zeros of the downward shifted
capacity-achieving output pdf, provides a first firm upper on the number of mass points. Specifically,
it is shown that the number of mass points is given by $O(\mathsf{A}^2)$ where $\mathsf{A}$ is the
constraint on the input amplitude. The second part generalizes the results of the first part to the
case of $n>1$. In particular, for every dimension $n>1$, it is shown that the number of shells is given
by $O(\mathsf{A}^2)$ where $\mathsf{A}$ is the constraint on the input amplitude. Finally, the
third part provides bounds on the number of points for the case of $n=1$ with an additional power constraint.
