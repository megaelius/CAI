The design and organization of complex robotic systems traditionally requires laborious trial-and-error
processes to ensure both hardware and software components are correctly connected with the resources
necessary for computation. This paper presents a novel generalization of the quadratic assignment
and routing problem, introducing formalisms for selecting components and interconnections to
synthesize a complete system capable of providing some user-defined functionality. By introducing
mission context, functional requirements, and modularity directly into the assignment problem,
we derive a solution where components are automatically selected and then organized into an optimal
hardware and software interconnection structure, all while respecting restrictions on component
viability and required functionality. The ability to generate \emph{complete} functional systems
directly from individual components reduces manual design effort by allowing for a guided exploration
of the design space. Additionally, our formulation increases resiliency by quantifying resource
margins and enabling adaptation of system structure in response to changing environments, hardware
or software failure. The proposed formulation is cast as an integer linear program which is provably
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard. Two case studies are developed and analyzed to highlight the expressiveness
and complexity of problems that can be addressed by this approach: the first explores the iterative
development of a ground-based search-and-rescue robot in a variety of mission contexts, while
the second explores the large-scale, complex design of a humanoid disaster robot for the DARPA Robotics
Challenge. Numerical simulations quantify real world performance and demonstrate tractable
time complexity for the scale of problems encountered in many modern robotic systems.
