The current business model for existing recommender services is centered around the availability
of users' personal data at their side whereas consumers have to trust that the recommender service
providers will not use their data in a malicious way. With the increasing number of cases for privacy
breaches, different countries and corporations have issued privacy laws and regulations to define
the best practices for the protection of personal information. The data protection directive 95/46/EC
and the privacy principles established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) are examples of such regulation frameworks. In this paper, we assert that utilizing third-party
recommender services to generate accurate referrals are feasible, while preserving the privacy
of the users' sensitive information which will be residing on a clear form only on his/her own device.
As a result, each user who benefits from the third-party recommender service will have absolute
control over what to release from his/her own preferences. We proposed a collaborative privacy
middleware that executes a two stage concealment process within a distributed data collection
protocol in order to attain this claim. Additionally, the proposed solution complies with one of
the common privacy regulation frameworks for fair information practice in a natural and functional
way -which is OECD privacy principles. The approach presented in this paper is easily integrated
into the current business model as it is implemented using a middleware that runs at the end-users
side and utilizes the social nature of content distribution services to implement a topological
data collection protocol.
