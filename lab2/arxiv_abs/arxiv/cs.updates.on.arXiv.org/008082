This paper tackles the challenging problem of constrained hexahedral meshing. An algorithm is
introduced to build combinatorial hexahedral meshes whose boundary facets exactly match a given
quadrangulation of the topological sphere. This algorithm is the first practical solution to the
problem. It is able to compute small hexahedral meshes of quadrangulations for which the previously
known best solutions could only be built by hand or contained thousands of hexahedra. These challenging
quadrangulations include the boundaries of transition templates that are critical for the success
of general hexahedral meshing algorithms. The algorithm proposed in this paper is dedicated to
building combinatorial hexahedral meshes of small quadrangulations and ignores the geometrical
problem. The key idea of the method is to exploit the equivalence between quad flips in the boundary
and the insertion of hexahedra glued to this boundary. The tree of all sequences of flipping operations
is explored, searching for a path that transforms the input quadrangulation Q into a new quadrangulation
for which a hexahedral mesh is known. When a small hexahedral mesh exists, a sequence transforming
Q into the boundary of a cube is found; otherwise, a set of pre-computed hexahedral meshes is used.
A novel approach to deal with the large number of problem symmetries is proposed. Combined with an
efficient backtracking search, it allows small shellable hexahedral meshes to be found for all
even quadrangulations with up to 20 quadrangles. All 54,943 such quadrangulations were meshed
using no more than 72 hexahedra. This algorithm is also used to find a construction to fill arbitrary
domains, thereby proving that any ball-shaped domain bounded by n quadrangles can be meshed with
no more than 78 n hexahedra. This very significantly lowers the previous upper bound of 5396 n.
