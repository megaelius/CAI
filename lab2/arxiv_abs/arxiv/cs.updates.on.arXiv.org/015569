As one of the representative blockchain platforms, Ethereum has attracted lots of attacks. Due
to the potential financial loss, there is a pressing need to detect malicious smart contracts and
understand their behaviors. Though there exist multiple systems for smart contract analysis,
they cannot efficiently analyze a large number of transactions and re-execute smart contracts
to introspect malicious behaviors. In this paper, we urge for a transaction-centric security analytics
framework for Ethereum, which provides an efficient way to quickly locate suspicious ones from
a large number of transactions and extensible way to detect malicious smart contracts with analyst-provided
scripts. We present the system design in the paper, which solves three technical challenges, i.e.,
incomplete states, scalability and extensibility. We have implemented a prototype system named
EthScope to solve these challenges. In particular, the first component Data Aggregator collects
and recovers critical blockchain states. The second component Replay Engine is able to {replay}
arbitrary and a large number of transactions. The third component Instrumentation Framework exposes
interfaces for an analyst to dynamically instrument smart contracts and introspect the execution
of suspicious transactions. The comprehensive evaluation with six types of attacks demonstrated
the effectiveness of our system. The performance evaluation shows that our system can perform a
large-scale analysis on suspicious transactions (more than 8 million ones) and has a speed up of
around 2,300x compared with the JSTracer provided by Go-Ethereum. To engage the community, we will
release our system and a dataset of detected attacks on https://github.com/zjuicsr/ethscope.
