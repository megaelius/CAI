Due to the large combinatorial problem, current beam orientation optimization algorithms for
radiotherapy, such as column generation (CG), are typically heuristic or greedy in nature, leading
to suboptimal solutions. We propose a reinforcement learning strategy using Monte Carlo Tree Search
capable of finding a superior beam orientation set and in less time than CG.We utilized a reinforcement
learning structure involving a supervised learning network to guide Monte Carlo tree search (GTS)
to explore the decision space of beam orientation selection problem. We have previously trained
a deep neural network (DNN) that takes in the patient anatomy, organ weights, and current beams,
and then approximates beam fitness values, indicating the next best beam to add. This DNN is used
to probabilistically guide the traversal of the branches of the Monte Carlo decision tree to add
a new beam to the plan. To test the feasibility of the algorithm, we solved for 5-beam plans, using
13 test prostate cancer patients, different from the 57 training and validation patients originally
trained the DNN. To show the strength of GTS to other search methods, performances of three other
search methods including a guided search, uniform tree search and random search algorithms are
also provided. On average GTS outperforms all other methods, it find a solution better than CG in
237 seconds on average, compared to CG which takes 360 seconds, and outperforms all other methods
in finding a solution with lower objective function value in less than 1000 seconds. Using our guided
tree search (GTS) method we were able to maintain a similar planning target volume (PTV) coverage
within 1% error, and reduce the organ at risk (OAR) mean dose for body, rectum, left and right femoral
heads, but a slight increase of 1% in bladder mean dose.
