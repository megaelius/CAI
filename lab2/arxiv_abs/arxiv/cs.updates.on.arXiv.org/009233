Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving both spectrum
and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. However, existing works on
IRS mainly consider frequency-flat channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information
(CSI) at the transmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective channels and propose a practical
transmission protocol with channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training
and estimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel IRS elements grouping
method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent IRS elements that share a common reflection
coefficient. Based on this grouping method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where
only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the training
overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we formulate the problem to maximize
the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array
reflection coefficients. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to
solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by
alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array coefficients in an iterative
manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the
proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without
using IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements grouping which
achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off between the training overhead and IRS
passive beamforming flexibility.
