Background and Objectives: Chest x-rays are the most commonly performed, cost-effective diagnostic
imaging tests ordered by physicians. A clinically validated, automated artificial intelligence
system that can reliably separate normal from abnormal would be invaluable in addressing the problem
of reporting backlogs and the lack of radiologists in low-resource settings. The aim of this study
was to develop and validate a deep learning system to detect chest x-ray abnormalities. Methods:
A deep learning system was trained on 1.2 million x-rays and their corresponding radiology reports
to identify abnormal x-rays and the following specific abnormalities: blunted costophrenic angle,
calcification, cardiomegaly, cavity, consolidation, fibrosis, hilar enlargement, opacity
and pleural effusion. The system was tested versus a 3-radiologist majority on an independent,
retrospectively collected de-identified set of 2000 x-rays. The primary accuracy measure was
area under the ROC curve (AUC), estimated separately for each abnormality as well as for normal versus
abnormal reports. Results: The deep learning system demonstrated an AUC of 0.93(CI 0.92-0.94)
for detection of abnormal scans, and AUC(CI) of 0.94(0.92-0.97),0.88(0.85-0.91), 0.97(0.95-0.99),
0.92(0.82-1), 0.94(0.91-0.97), 0.92(0.88-0.95), 0.89(0.84-0.94), 0.93(0.92-0.95), 0.98(0.97-1),
0.93(0.0.87-0.99) for the detection of blunted CP angle, calcification, cardiomegaly, cavity,
consolidation, fibrosis,hilar enlargement, opacity and pleural effusion respectively. Conclusions
and Relevance: Our study shows that a deep learning algorithm trained on a large quantity of labelled
data can accurately detect abnormalities on chest x-rays. As these systems further increase in
accuracy, the feasibility of using artificial intelligence to extend the reach of chest x-ray interpretation
and improve reporting efficiency will increase in tandem.
