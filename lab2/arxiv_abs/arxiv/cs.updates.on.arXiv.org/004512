Computing the smallest number $q$ such that the vertices of a given graph can be properly $q$-colored
is one of the oldest and most fundamental problems in combinatorial optimization. The $q$-Coloring
problem has been studied intensively using the framework of parameterized algorithmics, resulting
in a very good understanding of the best-possible algorithms for several parameterizations based
on the structure of the graph. While there is an abundance of work for parameterizations based on
decompositions of the graph by vertex separators, almost nothing is known about parameterizations
based on edge separators. We fill this gap by studying $q$-Coloring parameterized by cutwidth,
and parameterized by pathwidth in bounded-degree graphs. Our research uncovers interesting new
ways to exploit small edge separators. We present two algorithms for $q$-Coloring parameterized
by cutwidth $cutw$: a deterministic one that runs in time $O^*(2^{\omega \cdot cutw})$, where $\omega$
is the matrix multiplication constant, and a randomized one with runtime $O^*(2^{cutw})$. In sharp
contrast to earlier work, the running time is independent of $q$. The dependence on cutwidth is optimal:
we prove that even 3-Coloring cannot be solved in $O^*((2-\varepsilon)^{cutw})$ time assuming
the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Our algorithms rely on a new rank bound for a matrix
that describes compatible colorings. Combined with a simple communication protocol for evaluating
a product of two polynomials, this also yields an $O^*((\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1)^{pw})$ time randomized
algorithm for $q$-Coloring on graphs of pathwidth $pw$ and maximum degree $d$. Such a runtime was
first obtained by Bj\"orklund, but only for graphs with few proper colorings. We also prove that
this result is optimal in the sense that no $O^*((\lfloor d/2\rfloor+1-\varepsilon)^{pw})$-time
algorithm exists assuming SETH.
