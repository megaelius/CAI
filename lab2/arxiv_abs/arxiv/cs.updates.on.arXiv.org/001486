In everyday life, we often observe unusually frequent interactions among people before or during
important events, e.g., people send/receive more greetings to/from their friends on holidays
than regular days. We also observe that some videos or hashtags suddenly go viral through people's
sharing on online social networks (OSNs). Do these seemingly different phenomena share a common
structure? All these phenomena are associated with sudden surges of user interactions in networks,
which we call "bursts" in this work. We uncover that the emergence of a burst is accompanied with the
formation of triangles in some properly defined networks. This finding motivates us to propose
a new and robust method to detect bursts on OSNs. We first introduce a new measure, "triadic cardinality
distribution", corresponding to the fractions of nodes with different numbers of triangles, i.e.,
triadic cardinalities, in a network. We show that this distribution not only changes when a burst
occurs, but it also has a robustness property that it is immunized against common spamming social-bot
attacks. Hence, by tracking triadic cardinality distributions, we can more reliably detect bursts
than simply counting interactions on OSNs. To avoid handling massive activity data generated by
OSN users during the triadic tracking, we design an efficient "sample-estimate" framework to provide
maximum likelihood estimate on the triadic cardinality distribution. We propose several sampling
methods, and provide insights about their performance difference, through both theoretical analysis
and empirical experiments on real world networks.
