Clock synchronization has become essential to modern societies since many critical infrastructures
depend on a precise notion of time. This paper analyzes security aspects of high-precision clock
synchronization protocols, particularly their alleged protection against delay attacks when
clock synchronization traffic is encrypted using standard network security protocols such as
IPsec, MACsec, or TLS. We use the Precision Time Protocol (PTP), the most widely used protocol for
high-precision clock synchronization, to demonstrate that statistical traffic analysis can
identify properties that support selective message delay attacks even for encrypted traffic.
We furthermore identify a fundamental conflict in secure clock synchronization between the need
of deterministic traffic to improve precision and the need to obfuscate traffic in order to mitigate
delay attacks. A theoretical analysis of clock synchronization protocols isolates the characteristics
that make these protocols vulnerable to delay attacks and argues that such attacks cannot be prevented
entirely but only be mitigated. Knowledge of the underlying communication network in terms of one-way
delays and knowledge on physical constraints of these networks can help to compute guaranteed maximum
bounds for slave clock offsets. These bounds are essential for detecting delay attacks and minimizing
their impact. In the general case, however, the precision that can be guaranteed in adversarial
settings is orders of magnitude lower than required for high-precision clock synchronization
in critical infrastructures, which, therefore, must not rely on a precise notion of time when using
untrusted networks.
