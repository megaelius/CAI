Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special type of Neural Networks, which has shown exemplary
performance on several competitions related to Computer Vision and Image Processing. Some of the
exciting application areas of CNN include Image Classification and Segmentation, Object Detection,
Video Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Speech Recognition. The powerful learning
ability of deep CNN is primarily due to the use of multiple feature extraction stages that can automatically
learn representations from the data. The availability of a large amount of data and improvement
in the hardware technology has accelerated the research in CNNs, and recently interesting deep
CNN architectures have been reported. Several inspiring ideas to bring advancements in CNNs have
been explored, such as the use of different activation and loss functions, parameter optimization,
regularization, and architectural innovations. However, the significant improvement in the
representational capacity of the deep CNN is achieved through architectural innovations. Notably,
the ideas of exploiting spatial and channel information, depth and width of architecture, and multi-path
information processing have gained substantial attention. Similarly, the idea of using a block
of layers as a structural unit is also gaining popularity. This survey thus focuses on the intrinsic
taxonomy present in the recently reported deep CNN architectures and, consequently, classifies
the recent innovations in CNN architectures into seven different categories. These seven categories
are based on spatial exploitation, depth, multi-path, width, feature-map exploitation, channel
boosting, and attention. Additionally, the elementary understanding of CNN components, current
challenges, and applications of CNN are also provided.
