For humans accustomed to 1-G environments on Earth, microgravity conditions in orbit and on celestial
bodies with lower gravitational field, such as the Moon, can be physiologically compromising.
Of these, motor and fine-dexterity tasks involving the extremities, particularly in locomotion,
grasp and release, are influenced becoming delayed and placing greater force demands. The authors
hereby propose incorporating this same technological innovation into loading suits designed
for use in orbit or celestial environment. Current prosthetic systems use electromyography (EMG)-based
techniques for creating functional sensorimotor platforms. This model sustains a sensorimotor
platform for prosthesis users. However, several limitations in practical use and signal detection
have been identified in these systems. Accelerometer-based sensorimotor systems have been suggested
to overcome these limitations but only proof-of-concept has been demonstrated. Our group previously
suggested the combined application of prosthetic accelerometers in loading suits and EMGs for
input signal detection, quantification, and predictive output modelling necessary for improved
motion adjustments under microgravity conditions. It is anticipated this technology can enhance
tasks such as repairs or construction or perhaps in recreational design when considering commercial
and private human access to space. The incorporation of a prosthetic biomechanical sensorimotor
system in loading suits to enhance locomotion under microgravity conditions are conceivable;
however, demonstration of a proof-of-concept is required before implementation.
