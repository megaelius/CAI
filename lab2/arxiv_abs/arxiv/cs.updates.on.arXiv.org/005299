Objective: Ultrahigh-resolution optical coherence microscopy (OCM) has recently demonstrated
its potential for accurate diagnosis of human cervical diseases. One major challenge for clinical
adoption, however, is the steep learning curve clinicians need to overcome to interpret OCM images.
Developing an intelligent technique for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) to accurately interpret
OCM images will facilitate clinical adoption of the technology and improve patient care. Methods:
497 high-resolution 3-D OCM volumes (600 cross-sectional images each) were collected from 159
ex vivo specimens of 92 female patients. OCM image features were extracted using a convolutional
neural network (CNN) model, concatenated with patient information (e.g., age, HPV results), and
classified using a support vector machine classifier. Ten-fold cross-validations were utilized
to test the performance of the CADx method in a five-class classification task and a binary classification
task. Results: An 88.3 plus or minus 4.9% classification accuracy was achieved for five fine-grained
classes of cervical tissue, namely normal, ectropion, low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions (LSIL and HSIL), and cancer. In the binary classification task (low-risk [normal, ectropion
and LSIL] vs. high-risk [HSIL and cancer]), the CADx method achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC)
value of 0.959 with an 86.7 plus or minus 11.4% sensitivity and 93.5 plus or minus 3.8% specificity.
Conclusion: The proposed deep-learning based CADx method outperformed three human experts. It
was also able to identify morphological characteristics in OCM images that were consistent with
histopathological interpretations. Significance: Label-free OCM imaging, combined with deep-learning
based CADx methods, hold a great promise to be used in clinical settings for the effective screening
and diagnosis of cervical diseases.
