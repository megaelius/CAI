Automatic segmentation of pathological shoulder muscles in patients with musculo-skeletal diseases
is a challenging task due to the huge variability in muscle shape, size, location, texture and injury.
A reliable fully-automated segmentation method from magnetic resonance images could greatly
help clinicians to plan therapeutic interventions and predict interventional outcomes while
eliminating time consuming manual segmentation efforts. The purpose of this work is three-fold.
First, we investigate the feasibility of pathological shoulder muscle segmentation using deep
learning techniques, given a very limited amount of available annotated pediatric data. Second,
we address the learning transferability from healthy to pathological data by comparing different
learning schemes in terms of model generalizability. Third, extended versions of deep convolutional
encoder-decoder architectures using encoders pre-trained on non-medical data are proposed to
improve the segmentation accuracy. Methodological aspects are evaluated in a leave-one-out fashion
on a dataset of 24 shoulder examinations from patients with obstetrical brachial plexus palsy and
focus on 4 different muscles including deltoid as well as infraspinatus, supraspinatus and subscapularis
from the rotator cuff. The most relevant segmentation model is partially pre-trained on ImageNet
and jointly exploits inter-patient healthy and pathological annotated data. Its performance
reaches Dice scores of 82.4%, 82.0%, 71.0% and 82.8% for deltoid, infraspinatus, supraspinatus
and subscapularis muscles. Absolute surface estimation errors are all below 83mm$^2$ except for
supraspinatus with 134.6mm$^2$. These contributions offer new perspectives for force inference
in the context of musculo-skeletal disorder management.
