In recent times, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) based systems have evolved
and scaled across different industries such as finance, retail, insurance, energy utilities,
etc. Among other things, they have been used to predict patterns of customer behavior, to generate
pricing models, and to predict the return on investments. But the successes in deploying machine
learning models at scale in those industries have not translated into the healthcare setting. There
are multiple reasons why integrating ML models into healthcare has not been widely successful,
but from a technical perspective, general-purpose commercial machine learning platforms are
not a good fit for healthcare due to complexities in handling data quality issues, mandates to demonstrate
clinical relevance, and a lack of ability to monitor performance in a highly regulated environment
with stringent security and privacy needs. In this paper, we describe Isthmus, a turnkey, cloud-based
platform which addresses the challenges above and reduces time to market for operationalizing
ML/AI in healthcare. Towards the end, we describe three case studies which shed light on Isthmus
capabilities. These include (1) supporting an end-to-end lifecycle of a model which predicts trauma
survivability at hospital trauma centers, (2) bringing in and harmonizing data from disparate
sources to create a community data platform for inferring population as well as patient level insights
for Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), and (3) ingesting live-streaming data from various IoT
sensors to build models, which can leverage real-time and longitudinal information to make advanced
time-sensitive predictions.
