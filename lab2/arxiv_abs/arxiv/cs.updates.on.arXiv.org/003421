The Localization of the target object for data retrieval is a key issue in the Intelligent and Connected
Transportation Systems (ICTS). However, due to lack of intelligence in the traditional transportation
system, it can take tremendous resources to manually retrieve and locate the queried objects among
a large number of images. In order to solve this issue, we propose an effective method to query-based
object localization that uses artificial intelligence techniques to automatically locate the
queried object in the complex background. The presented method is termed as Fine-grained and Progressive
Attention Localization Network (FPAN), which uses an image and a queried object as input to accurately
locate the target object in the image. Specifically, the fine-grained attention module is naturally
embedded into each layer of the convolution neural network (CNN), thereby gradually suppressing
the regions that are irrelevant to the queried object and eventually shrinking attention to the
target area. We further employ top-down attentions fusion algorithm operated by a learnable cascade
up-sampling structure to establish the connection between the attention map and the exact location
of the queried object in the original image. Furthermore, the FPAN is trained by multi-task learning
with box segmentation loss and cosine loss. At last, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both
queried-based digit localization and object tracking with synthetic and benchmark datasets,
respectively. The experimental results show that our algorithm is far superior to other algorithms
in the synthesis datasets and outperforms most existing trackers on the OTB and VOT datasets.
