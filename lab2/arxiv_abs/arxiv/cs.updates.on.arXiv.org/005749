Human activity recognition (HAR) is a classification task that aims to classify human activities
or predict human behavior by means of features extracted from sensors data. Typical HAR systems
use wearable sensors and/or handheld and mobile devices with built-in sensing capabilities. Due
to the widespread use of smartphones and to the inclusion of various sensors in all contemporary
smartphones (e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes), they are commonly used for extracting and
collecting data from sensors and even for implementing HAR systems. When using mobile devices,
e.g., smartphones, HAR systems need to deal with several constraints regarding battery, computation
and memory. These constraints enforce the need of a system capable of managing its resources and
maintain acceptable levels of classification accuracy. Moreover, several factors can influence
activity recognition, such as classification models, sensors availability and size of data window
for feature extraction, making stable accuracy a difficult task. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised
classifier and a study regarding the influence of hyperparameter configuration in classification
accuracy, depending on the user and the activities performed by each user. This study focuses on
sensing data provided by the PAMAP2 dataset. Experimental results show that it is possible to maintain
classification accuracy by adjusting hyperparameters, like window size and windows overlap factor,
depending on user and activity performed. These experiments motivate the development of a system
able to automatically adapt hyperparameter settings for the activity performed by each user.
