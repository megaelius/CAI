In the recent years, intensive research work has been dedicated to prove conditional lower bounds
in order to reveal the inner structure of the class P. These conditional lower bounds are based on
many popular conjectures on well-studied problems. One of the most heavily used conjectures is
the celebrated Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). It turns out that conditional hardness
proved based on SETH goes, in many cases, through an intermediate problem - the Orthogonal Vectors
(OV) problem. Almost all research work regarding conditional lower bound was concentrated on time
complexity. Very little attention was directed toward space complexity. In a recent work, Goldstein
et al.[ESA 2016] set the stage for proving conditional lower bounds regarding space and its interplay
with time. In this spirit, it is tempting to investigate the space complexity of a data structure
variant of OV which is called \emph{OV indexing}. In this problem $n$ boolean vectors of size $c\log{n}$
are given for preprocessing. As a query, a vector $v$ is given and we are required to verify if there
is an input vector that is orthogonal to it or not. This OV indexing problem is interesting in its own,
but it also likely to have strong implications on problems known to be conditionally hard, in terms
of time complexity, based on OV. Having this in mind, we study OV indexing in this paper from many aspects.
We give some space-efficient algorithms for the problem, show a tradeoff between space and query
time, describe how to solve its reporting variant, shed light on an interesting connection between
this problem and the well-studied SetDisjointness problem and demonstrate how it can be solved
more efficiently on random input.
