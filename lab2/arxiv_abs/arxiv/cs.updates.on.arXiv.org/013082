Society is experimenting changes in information consumption, as new information channels such
as social networks let people share news that do not necessarily be trust worthy. Sometimes, these
sources of information produce fake news deliberately with doubtful purposes and the consumers
of that information share it to other users thinking that the information is accurate. This transmission
of information represents an issue in our society, as can influence negatively the opinion of people
about certain figures, groups or ideas. Hence, it is desirable to design a system that is able to detect
and classify information as fake and categorize a source of information as trust worthy or not. Current
systems experiment difficulties performing this task, as it is complicated to design an automatic
procedure that can classify this information independent on the context. In this work, we propose
a mechanism to detect fake news through a classifier based on weighted causal graphs. These graphs
are specific hybrid models that are built through causal relations retrieved from texts and consider
the uncertainty of causal relations. We take advantage of this representation to use the probability
distributions of this graph and built a fake news classifier based on the entropy and KL divergence
of learned and new information. We believe that the problem of fake news is accurately tackled by
this model due to its hybrid nature between a symbolic and quantitative methodology. We describe
the methodology of this classifier and add empirical evidence of the usefulness of our proposed
approach in the form of synthetic experiments and a real experiment involving lung cancer.
