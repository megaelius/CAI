Consensus problem of high-order integral multi-agent systems under switching directed topology
is considered in this study. Depending on whether the agent's full state is available or not, two
distributed protocols are proposed to ensure that states of all agents can be convergent to a same
stationary value. In the proposed protocols, the gain vector associated with the agent's (estimated)
state and the gain vector associated with the relative (estimated) states between agents are designed
in a sophisticated way. By this particular design, the high-order integral multi-agent system
can be transformed into a first-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed
first-order integral agent's state indicates the convergence of the original high-order integral
agent's state if and only if all roots of the polynomial, whose coefficients are the entries of the
gain vector associated with the relative (estimated) states between agents, are in the open left-half
complex plane. Therefore, many analysis techniques in the first-order integral multi-agent system
can be directly borrowed to solve the problems in the high-order integral multi-agent system. Due
to this property, it is proved that to reach a consensus, the switching directed topology of multi-agent
system is only required to be "uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected", which seems the mildest
connectivity condition in the literature. In addition, the consensus problem of discrete-time
high-order integral multi-agent systems is studied. The corresponding consensus protocol and
performance analysis are presented. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
