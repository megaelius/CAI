Our aim was to enhance visual quality and quantitative accuracy of dynamic positron emission tomography
(PET)uptake images by improved image reconstruction, using sophisticated sparse penalty models
that incorporate both 2D spatial+1D temporal (3DT) information. We developed two new 3DT PET reconstruction
algorithms, incorporating different temporal and spatial penalties based on discrete cosine
transform (DCT)w/ patches, and tensor nuclear norm (TNN) w/ patches, and compared to frame-by-frame
methods; conventional 2D ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) w/ post-filtering
and 2D-DCT and 2D-TNN. A 3DT brain phantom with kinetic uptake (2-tissue model), and a moving 3DT
cardiac/lung phantom was simulated and reconstructed. For the cardiac/lung phantom, an additional
cardiac gated 2D-OSEM set was reconstructed. The structural similarity index (SSIM) and relative
root mean squared error (rRMSE) relative ground truth was investigated. The image derived left
ventricular (LV) volume for the cardiac/lung images was found by region growing and parametric
images of the brain phantom were calculated. For the cardiac/lung phantom, 3DT-TNN yielded optimal
images, and 3DT-DCT was best for the brain phantom. The optimal LV volume from the 3DT-TNN images
was on average 11 and 55 percentage points closer to the true value compared to cardiac gated 2D-OSEM
and 2D-OSEM respectively. Compared to 2D-OSEM, parametric images based on 3DT-DCT images generally
had smaller bias and higher SSIM. Our novel methods that incorporate both 2D spatial and 1D temporal
penalties produced dynamic PET images of higher quality than conventional 2D methods, w/o need
for post-filtering. Breathing and cardiac motion were simultaneously captured w/o need for respiratory
or cardiac gating. LV volumes were better recovered, and subsequently fitted parametric images
were generally less biased and of higher quality.
