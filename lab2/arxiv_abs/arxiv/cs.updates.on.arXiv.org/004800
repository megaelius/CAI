We consider the classic maximal and maximum independent set problems in three models of graph streams:
In the edge-arrival model we see a stream of edges which collectively define a graph, this model has
been well-studied for a variety of problems. We first show that the space complexity for a one-pass
streaming algorithm to find a maximal independent set is quadratic (i.e. we must store all edges).
We further show that the problem does not become much easier if we only require approximate maximality.
In the "explicit" vertex stream model, the input stream is a sequence of vertices making up the graph,
where every vertex arrives along with its incident edges that connect to previously arrived vertices.
Various graph problems require substantially less space to solve in this setting than for edge-arrival
streams. We show that every one-pass $c$-approximation algorithm for maximum independent set
(MIS) on explicit vertex streams requires space $\Omega(\frac{n^2}{c^7})$, where $n$ is the number
of vertices of the input graph, and it is already known that space $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{n^2}{c^2})$
is necessary and sufficient in the edge arrival model (Halld\'orsson et al. 2012). The MIS problem
is thus not significantly easier to solve under the explicit vertex arrival order assumption. Our
result is proved via a reduction to a new multi-party communication problem closely related to pointer
jumping. In the "implicit" vertex stream model, the input stream consists of a sequence of objects,
one per vertex. The algorithm is equipped with a function that can map a pair of objects to the presence
or absence of an edge, thus defining the graph. This model captures, for example, geometric intersection
graphs such as unit disc graphs. Our final set of results consists of several improved upper and lower
bounds for ball intersection graphs, in both explicit and implicit streams.
