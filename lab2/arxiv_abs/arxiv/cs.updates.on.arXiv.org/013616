Spectral measures arise in numerous applications such as quantum mechanics, signal processing,
resonance phenomena, and fluid stability analysis. Similarly, spectral decompositions (pure
point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous) often characterise relevant physical
properties such as long-time dynamics of quantum systems. Despite new results on computing spectra,
there remains no general method able to compute spectral measures or decompositions of infinite-dimensional
normal operators. Previous efforts have focused on specific examples where analytical formulae
are available (or perturbations thereof), and hence this computational problem is predominantly
open. We solve this problem by providing the first set of general algorithms that compute spectral
measures and decompositions of a wide class of operators. Given a matrix representation of a self-adjoint
or unitary operator, such that each column decays at infinity at a known asymptotic rate, we show
how to compute spectral measures and decompositions. We discuss how these results allow computation
of objects such as the functional calculus and generalise to a large class of partial differential
operators, allowing solutions to evolution PDEs such as the linear Schr\"odinger equation on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$.
Computational spectral problems in infinite dimensions have led to the Solvability Complexity
Index (SCI) hierarchy, which classifies the difficulty of computational problems. We classify
the computation of measures, measure decompositions, types of spectra, functional calculus,
and Radon-Nikodym derivatives in the SCI hierarchy. The new algorithms are demonstrated to be efficient
on examples taken from orthogonal polynomials on the real line and unit circle, and are applied to
evolution equations on a two-dimensional quasicrystal.
