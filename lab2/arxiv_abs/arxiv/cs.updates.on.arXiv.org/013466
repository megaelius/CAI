Internet of underwater things (IoUT) is a technological revolution that could mark a new era for
scientific, industrial, and military underwater applications. To mitigate the hostile underwater
channel characteristics, this paper hybridizes underwater acoustic and optical wireless communications
to achieve a ubiquitous control and high-speed low-latency networking performance, respectively.
Since underwater optical wireless communications (UOWC) suffers from limited range, it requires
effective multi-hop routing solutions. In this regard, we propose a Sector-based Opportunistic
Routing (SectOR) protocol. Unlike the traditional routing (TR) techniques which unicast packets
to a unique relay, opportunistic routing (OR) targets a set of candidate relays by leveraging the
broadcast nature of the UOWC channel. OR improves the packet delivery ratio as the likelihood of
having at least one successful packet reception is much higher than that in conventional unicast
routing. Contingent upon the performance characterization of a single-hop link, we obtain a variety
of local and global metrics to evaluate the fitness of a candidate set (CS) and prioritize the members
of a CS. Since rate-error and range-beamwidth tradeoffs yield different candidate set diversities,
we develop a candidate filtering and searching algorithm to find the optimal sector-shaped coverage
region by scanning the feasible search space. Moreover, a hybrid acoustic/optic coordination
mechanism is considered to avoid duplicate transmission of the relays. Numerical results show
that SectOR protocol can perform even better than an optimal unicast routing protocol in well-connected
UOWNs.
