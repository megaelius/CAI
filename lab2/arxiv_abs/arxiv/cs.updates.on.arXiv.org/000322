Simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels potentially offers great
convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its
hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet
able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general
receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with
adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special
cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting
(OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we
propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information
and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated
receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures
are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy
is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption
taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case
when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In
addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup
that employs practical modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical
receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT).
