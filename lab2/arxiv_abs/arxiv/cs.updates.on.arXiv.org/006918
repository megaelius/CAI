One of the consequences of passing from mass production to mass customization paradigm in the nowadays
industrialized world is the need to increase flexibility and responsiveness of manufacturing
companies. The high-mix / low-volume production forces constant accommodations of unknown product
variants, which ultimately leads to high periods of machine calibration. The difficulty related
with machine calibration is that experience is required together with a set of experiments to meet
the final product quality. Unfortunately, all possible combinations of machine parameters is
so high that is difficult to build empirical knowledge. Due to this fact, normally trial and error
approaches are taken making one-of-a-kind products not viable. Therefore, a Zero-Shot Learning
(ZSL) based approach called hyper-process model (HPM) to learn the relation among multiple tasks
is used as a way to shorten the calibration phase. Assuming each product variant is a task to solve,
first, a shape analysis on data to learn common modes of deformation between tasks is made, and secondly,
a mapping between these modes and task descriptions is performed. Ultimately, the present work
has two main contributions: 1) Formulation of an industrial problem into a ZSL setting where new
process models can be generated for process optimization and 2) the definition of a regression problem
in the domain of ZSL. For that purpose, a 2-d deep drawing simulated process was used based on data
collected from the Abaqus simulator, where a significant number of process models were collected
to test the effectiveness of the approach. The obtained results show that is possible to learn new
tasks without any available data (both labeled and unlabeled) by leveraging information about
already existing tasks, allowing to speed up the calibration phase and make a quicker integration
of new products into manufacturing systems.
