As people rely on social media as their primary sources of news, the spread of misinformation has
become a significant concern. In this large-scale study of news in social media we analyze eleven
million posts and investigate propagation behavior of users that directly interact with news accounts
identified as spreading trusted versus malicious content. Unlike previous work, which looks at
specific rumors, topics, or events, we consider all content propagated by various news sources.
Moreover, we analyze and contrast population versus sub-population behaviour (by demographics)
when spreading misinformation, and distinguish between two types of propagation, i.e., direct
retweets and mentions. Our evaluation examines how evenly, how many, how quickly, and which users
propagate content from various types of news sources on Twitter. Our analysis has identified several
key differences in propagation behavior from trusted versus suspicious news sources. These include
high inequity in the diffusion rate based on the source of disinformation, with a small group of highly
active users responsible for the majority of disinformation spread overall and within each demographic.
Analysis by demographics showed that users with lower annual income and education share more from
disinformation sources compared to their counterparts. News content is shared significantly
more quickly from trusted, conspiracy, and disinformation sources compared to clickbait and propaganda.
Older users propagate news from trusted sources more quickly than younger users, but they share
from suspicious sources after longer delays. Finally, users who interact with clickbait and conspiracy
sources are likely to share from propaganda accounts, but not the other way around.
