The rigorous quantification of uncertainty in geophysical inversions is a challenging problem.
Inversions are often ill-posed and the likelihood surface may be multi-modal; properties of any
single mode become inadequate uncertainty measures, and sampling methods become inefficient
for irregular posteriors or high-dimensional parameter spaces. We explore the influences of different
choices made by the practitioner on the efficiency and accuracy of Bayesian geophysical inversion
methods that rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to assess uncertainty, using a multi-sensor
inversion of the three-dimensional structure and composition of a region in the Cooper Basin of
South Australia as a case study. The inversion is performed using an updated version of the Obsidian
distributed inversion software. We find that the posterior for this inversion has complex local
covariance structure, hindering the efficiency of adaptive sampling methods that adjust the proposal
based on the chain history. Within the context of a parallel-tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme
for exploring high-dimensional multi-modal posteriors, a preconditioned Crank-Nicholson proposal
outperforms more conventional forms of random walk. Aspects of the problem setup, such as priors
on petrophysics or on 3-D geological structure, affect the shape and separation of posterior modes,
influencing sampling performance as well as the inversion results. Use of uninformative priors
on sensor noise can improve inversion results by enabling optimal weighting among multiple sensors
even if noise levels are uncertain. Efficiency could be further increased by using posterior gradient
information within proposals, which Obsidian does not currently support, but which could be emulated
using posterior surrogates.
