High performance computing (HPC) facilities consist of a large number of interconnected computing
units (or nodes) that execute highly complex scientific simulations to support scientific research.
Monitoring such facilities, in real-time, is essential to ensure that the system operates at peak
efficiency. Such systems are typically monitored using a variety of measurement and log data which
capture the state of the various components within the system at regular intervals of time. As modern
HPC systems grow in capacity and complexity, the data produced by current resource monitoring tools
is at a scale that it is no longer feasible to be visually monitored by analysts. We propose a method
that transforms the multi-dimensional output of resource monitoring tools to a low dimensional
representation that facilitates the understanding of the behavior of a High Performance Computing
(HPC) system. The proposed method automatically extracts the low-dimensional signal in the data
which can be used to track the system efficiency and identify performance anomalies. The method
models the resource usage data as a three dimensional tensor (capturing resource usage of all compute
nodes for difference resources over time). A dynamic matrix factorization algorithm, called dynamicMF,
is proposed to extract a low-dimensional temporal signal for each node, which is subsequently fed
into an anomaly detector. Results on resource usage data collected from the Lonestar 4 system at
the Texas Advanced Computing Center show that the identified anomalies are correlated with actual
anomalous events reported in the system log messages.
