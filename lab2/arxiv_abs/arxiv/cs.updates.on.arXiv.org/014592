Finding roots of univariate polynomials is one of the fundamental tasks of numerics, and there is
still a wide gap between root finders that are well understood in theory and those that perform well
in practice. We investigate the root finding method of Weierstrass, a root finder that tries to approximate
all roots of a given polynomial in parallel (in the Jacobi version, i.e., with parallel updates).
This method has a good reputation for finding all roots in practice except in obvious cases of symmetry,
but very little is known about its global dynamics and convergence properties. We show that the Weierstrass
method, like the well known Newton method, is not generally convergent: there are open sets of polynomials
$p$ of every degree $d \ge 3$ such that the dynamics of the Weierstrass method applied to $p$ exhibits
attracting periodic orbits. Specifically, all polynomials sufficiently close to $Z^3 + Z + 180$
have attracting cycles of period $4$. Here, period $4$ is minimal: we show that for cubic polynomials,
there are no periodic orbits of length $2$ or $3$ that attract open sets of starting points. We also
establish another convergence problem for the Weierstrass method: for almost every polynomial
of degree $d\ge 3$ there are orbits that are defined for all iterates but converge to $\infty$; this
is a problem that does not occur for Newton's method. Our results are obtained by first interpreting
the original problem coming from numerical mathematics in terms of higher-dimensional complex
dynamics, then phrasing the question in algebraic terms in such a way that we could finally answer
it by applying methods from computer algebra.
