In order to mitigate the high communication cost in distributed and federated learning, various
vector compression schemes, such as quantization, sparsification and dithering, have become
very popular. In designing a compression method, one aims to communicate as few bits as possible,
which minimizes the cost per communication round, while at the same time attempting to impart as
little distortion (variance) to the communicated messages as possible, which minimizes the adverse
effect of the compression on the overall number of communication rounds. However, intuitively,
these two goals are fundamentally in conflict: the more compression we allow, the more distorted
the messages become. We formalize this intuition and prove an {\em uncertainty principle} for randomized
compression operators, thus quantifying this limitation mathematically, and {\em effectively
providing lower bounds on what might be achievable with communication compression}. Motivated
by these developments, we call for the search for the optimal compression operator. In an attempt
to take a first step in this direction, we construct a new unbiased compression method inspired by
the Kashin representation of vectors, which we call {\em Kashin compression (KC)}. In contrast
to all previously proposed compression mechanisms, we prove that KC enjoys a {\em dimension independent}
variance bound with an explicit formula even in the regime when only a few bits need to be communicate
per each vector entry. We show how KC can be provably and efficiently combined with several existing
optimization algorithms, in all cases leading to communication complexity improvements on previous
state of the art.
