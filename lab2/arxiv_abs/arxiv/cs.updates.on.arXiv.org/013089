Lightning strokes create powerful electromagnetic pulses that routinely cause very low frequency
(VLF) waves to propagate across hemispheres along geomagnetic field lines. VLF antenna receivers
can be used to detect these whistler waves generated by these lightning strokes. The particular
time/frequency dependence of the received whistler wave enables the estimation of electron density
in the plasmasphere region of the magnetosphere. Therefore the identification and characterisation
of whistlers are important tasks to monitor the plasmasphere in real-time and to build large databases
of events to be used for statistical studies. The current state of the art in detecting whistler is
the Automatic Whistler Detection (AWD) method developed by Lichtenberger (2009). This method
is based on image correlation in 2 dimensions and requires significant computing hardware situated
at the VLF receiver antennas (e.g. in Antarctica). The aim of this work is to develop a machine learning-based
model capable of automatically detecting whistlers in the data provided by the VLF receivers. The
approach is to use a combination of image classification and localisation on the spectrogram data
generated by the VLF receivers to identify and localise each whistler. The data at hand has around
2300 events identified by AWD at SANAE and Marion and will be used as training, validation, and testing
data. Three detector designs have been proposed. The first one using a similar method to AWD, the
second using image classification on regions of interest extracted from a spectrogram, and the
last one using YOLO, the current state of the art in object detection. It has been shown that these
detectors can achieve a misdetection and false alarm of less than 15% on Marion's dataset.
