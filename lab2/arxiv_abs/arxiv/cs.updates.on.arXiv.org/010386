This paper presents a novel methodology for fast simulation and analysis of transient heat transfer.
The proposed methodology is suitable for real-time applications owing to (i) establishing the
solution method from the viewpoint of computationally efficient explicit dynamics, (ii) proposing
an element-level thermal load computation to eliminate the need for assembling global thermal
stiffness, leading to (iii) an explicit formulation of nodal temperature computation to eliminate
the need for iterations anywhere in the algorithm, (iv) pre-computing the constant matrices and
simulation parameters to facilitate online calculation, and (v) utilising computationally efficient
finite elements to efficiently obtain thermal responses in the spatial domain, all of which lead
to a significant reduction in computation time for fast run-time simulation. The proposed fast
explicit dynamics finite element algorithm (FED-FEM) employs nonlinear thermal material properties,
such as temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, and nonlinear
thermal boundary conditions, such as heat convection and radiation, to account for nonlinear characteristics
of transient heat transfer. Simulations and comparison analyses demonstrate that not only can
the proposed methodology handle isotropic, orthotropic, anisotropic and temperature-dependent
thermal properties but also satisfy the standard patch tests and achieve good agreement with those
of the commercial finite element analysis packages for numerical accuracy, for 3-D heat conduction,
convection, radiation, and thermal gradient concentration problems. Furthermore, the proposed
FED-FEM algorithm is computationally efficient and only consumes a small computation time, capable
of achieving real-time computational performance, leading to a novel methodology suitable for
real-time simulation and analysis of transient heat transfer.
