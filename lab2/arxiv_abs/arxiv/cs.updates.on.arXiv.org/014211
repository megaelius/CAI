Layout camouflaging can protect the intellectual property of modern circuits. Most prior art,
however, incurs excessive layout overheads and necessitates customization of active-device
manufacturing processes, i.e., the front-end-of-line (FEOL). As a result, camouflaging has typically
been applied selectively, which can ultimately undermine its resilience. Here, we propose a low-cost
and generic scheme---full-chip camouflaging can be finally realized without reservations. Our
scheme is based on obfuscating the interconnects, i.e., the back-end-of-line (BEOL), through
design-time handling for real and dummy wires and vias. To that end, we implement custom, BEOL-centric
obfuscation cells, and develop a CAD flow using industrial tools. Our scheme can be applied to any
design and technology node without FEOL-level modifications. Considering its BEOL-centric nature,
we advocate applying our scheme in conjunction with split manufacturing, to furthermore protect
against untrusted fabs. We evaluate our scheme for various designs at the physical, DRC-clean layout
level. Our scheme incurs a significantly lower cost than most of the prior art. Notably, for fully
camouflaged layouts, we observe average power, performance, and area overheads of 24.96%, 19.06%,
and 32.55%, respectively. We conduct a thorough security study addressing the threats (attacks)
related to untrustworthy FEOL fabs (proximity attacks) and malicious end-users (SAT-based attacks).
An empirical key finding is that only large-scale camouflaging schemes like ours are practically
secure against powerful SAT-based attacks. Another key finding is that our scheme hinders both
placement- and routing-centric proximity attacks; correct connections are reduced by 7.47X,
and complexity is increased by 24.15X, respectively, for such attacks.
