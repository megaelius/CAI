A new era of Information Warfare has arrived. Various actors, including state-sponsored ones,
are weaponizing information on Online Social Networks to run false information campaigns with
targeted manipulation of public opinion on specific topics. These false information campaigns
can have dire consequences to the public: mutating their opinions and actions, especially with
respect to critical world events like major elections. Evidently, the problem of false information
on the Web is a crucial one, and needs increased public awareness, as well as immediate attention
from law enforcement agencies, public institutions, and in particular, the research community.
In this paper, we make a step in this direction by providing a taxonomy of the Web's false information
ecosystem, comprising various types of false information, actors, and their motives. We report
a comprehensive overview of existing research on the false information ecosystem by identifying
several lines of work: 1) how the public perceives false information; 2) understanding the propagation
of false information; 3) detecting and containing false information on the Web; and 4) false information
on the political stage. In this work, we pay particular attention to political false information
as: 1) it can have dire consequences to the community (e.g., when election results are mutated) and
2) previous work show that this type of false information propagates faster and further when compared
to other types of false information. Finally, for each of these lines of work, we report several future
research directions that can help us better understand and mitigate the emerging problem of false
information dissemination on the Web.
