Obtaining a non-trivial (super-linear) lower bound for computation of the Fourier transform in
the linear circuit model has been a long standing open problem. All lower bounds so far have made strong
restrictions on the computational model. An early result by Morgenstern from 1973, provides an
$\Omega(n \log n)$ lower bound for the \emph{unnormalized} FFT when the constants used in the computation
are bounded. The proof uses a potential function related to a determinant. The determinant of the
unnormalized Fourier transform is $n^{n/2}$, and thus by showing that it can grow by at most a constant
factor after each step yields the result. This classic result does not explain why the normalized
Fourier transform (of unit determinant) should require $\Omega(n\log n)$ steps. More recently,
Ailon (2013) showed that if only unitary 2-by-2 gates are used, one obtains an $\Omega(n\log n)$
lower bound. The normalized FFT works in this model. In this work we take another step and show an $\Omega(n\log
n)$ lower bound in a considerably less restricted computational model. In this model, we allow the
gates to perform any nonsingular (not necessarily unitary) transformation. Our restriction is
that, at any moment, the corresponding transformation is well conditioned with constant $R$. This
is a practical requirement from an engineering point of view because an ill conditioned transformation
must result in numerical instability for certain inputs. The main technical technique is extending
the notion of matrix entropy of Ailon (2013) to the nonsingular group. For the unitary subgroup this
was easily defined as Shannon entropy of the distribution defined using the matrix elements squared.
For nonsingular matrices, it turns out that the correct way to define this potential is by using both
the matrix and its inverse, and also to allow ``negative probabilities''.
