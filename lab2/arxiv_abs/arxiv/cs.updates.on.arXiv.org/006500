To support Machine Type Communications (MTC) in next generation mobile networks, NarrowBand-IoT
(NB-IoT) has been released by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a promising solution
to provide extended coverage and low energy consumption for low cost MTC devices. However, the existing
Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) scheme in NB-IoT cannot provide connectivity for a massive number
of MTC devices. In parallel with the development of NB-IoT, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA),
introduced for the fifth generation wireless networks, is deemed to significantly improve the
network capacity by providing massive connectivity through sharing the same spectral resources.
To leverage NOMA in the context of NB-IoT, we propose a power domain NOMA scheme with user clustering
for an NB-IoT system. In particular, the MTC devices are assigned to different ranks within the NOMA
clusters where they transmit over the same frequency resources. Then, we formulate an optimization
problem to maximize the total throughput of the network by optimizing the resource allocation of
MTC devices and NOMA clustering while satisfying the transmission power and quality of service
requirements. We prove the NP-hardness of the proposed optimization problem. We further design
an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem by jointly optimizing
NOMA clustering and resource allocation of MTC devices. Furthermore, we prove that the reduced
optimization problem of power control is a convex optimization task. Simulation results are presented
to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
