Bidimensionality is the most common technique to design subexponential-time parameterized algorithms
on special classes of graphs, particularly planar graphs. The core engine behind it is a combinatorial
lemma of Robertson, Seymour and Thomas that states that every planar graph either has a $\sqrt{k}\times
\sqrt{k}$-grid as a minor, or its treewidth is $O(\sqrt{k})$. However, bidimensionality theory
cannot be extended directly to several well-known classes of geometric graphs. Nevertheless,
a relaxation of this lemma has been proven useful for unit disk graphs. Inspired by this, we prove
a new decomposition lemma for map graphs. Informally, our lemma states the following. For any map
graph $G$, there exists a collection $(U_1,\ldots,U_t)$ of cliques of $G$ with the following property:
$G$ either contains a $\sqrt{k}\times \sqrt{k}$-grid as a minor, or it admits a tree decomposition
where every bag is the union of $O(\sqrt{k})$ of the cliques in the above collection. The new lemma
appears to be a handy tool in the design of subexponential parameterized algorithms on map graphs.
We demonstrate its usability by designing algorithms on map graphs with running time $2^{O({\sqrt{k}\log{k}})}
\cdot n^{O(1)}$ for the Connected Planar $\cal F$-Deletion problem (that encompasses problems
such as Feedback Vertex Set and Vertex Cover). Obtaining subexponential algorithms for Longest
Cycle/Path and Cycle Packing is more challenging. We have to construct tree decompositions with
more powerful properties and to prove sublinear bounds on the number of ways an optimum solution
could "cross" bags in these decompositions. For Longest Cycle/Path, these are the first subexponential-time
parameterized algorithms on map graphs. For Feedback Vertex Set and Cycle Packing, we improve upon
known $2^{O({k^{0.75}\log{k}})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithms on map graphs.
