Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims to simplify deployment of network services by running
Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on commercial off-the-shelf servers. Service deployment involves
placement of VNFs and in-sequence routing of traffic flows through VNFs comprising a Service Chain
(SC). The joint VNF placement and traffic routing is called SC mapping. In a Wide-Area Network (WAN),
a situation may arise where several traffic flows, generated by many distributed node pairs, require
the same SC; then, a single instance (or occurrence) of that SC might not be enough. SC mapping with
multiple SC instances for the same SC turns out to be a very complex problem, since the sequential
traversal of VNFs has to be maintained while accounting for traffic flows in various directions.
Our study is the first to deal with the problem of SC mapping with multiple SC instances to minimize
network resource consumption. We first propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to solve this problem.
Since ILP does not scale to large networks, we develop a column-generation-based ILP (CG-ILP) model.
However, we find that exact mathematical modeling of the problem results in quadratic constraints
in our CG-ILP. The quadratic constraints are made linear but even the scalability of CG-ILP is limited.
Hence, we also propose a two-phase column-generation-based approach to get results over large
network topologies within reasonable computational times. Using such an approach, we observe
that an appropriate choice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to a solution very close to the
minimum bandwidth consumption. Further, this approach also helps us to analyze the effects of number
of VNF replicas and number of NFV nodes on bandwidth consumption when deploying these minimum number
of SC instances.
