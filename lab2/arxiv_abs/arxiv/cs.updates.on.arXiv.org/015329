Learning Path Recommendation is the heart of adaptive learning, the educational paradigm of an
Interactive Educational System (IES) providing a personalized learning experience based on the
student's history of learning activities. In typical existing IESs, the student must fully consume
a recommended learning item to be provided a new recommendation. This workflow comes with several
limitations. For example, there is no opportunity for the student to give feedback on the choice
of learning items made by the IES. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the choice is made is opaque
to the student, limiting the student's ability to track their learning. To this end, we introduce
Rocket, a Tinder-like User Interface for a general class of IESs. Rocket provides a visual representation
of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-extracted features of learning materials, allowing the student
to quickly decide whether the material meets their needs. The student can choose between engaging
with the material and receiving a new recommendation by swiping or tapping. Rocket offers the following
potential improvements for IES User Interfaces: First, Rocket enhances the explainability of
IES recommendations by showing students a visual summary of the meaningful AI-extracted features
used in the decision-making process. Second, Rocket enables self-personalization of the learning
experience by leveraging the students' knowledge of their own abilities and needs. Finally, Rocket
provides students with fine-grained information on their learning path, giving them an avenue
to assess their own skills and track their learning progress. We present the source code of Rocket,
in which we emphasize the independence and extensibility of each component, and make it publicly
available for all purposes.
