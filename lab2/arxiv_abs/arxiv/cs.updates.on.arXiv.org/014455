In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient framework for an electric vehicle (EV) network
using a contract theoretic-based economic model to maximize the profits of charging stations (CSs)
and improve the social welfare of the network. Specifically, we first introduce CS-based and CS
clustering-based decentralized federated energy learning (DFEL) approaches which enable the
CSs to train their own energy transactions locally to predict energy demands. In this way, each CS
can exchange its learned model with other CSs to improve prediction accuracy without revealing
actual datasets and reduce communication overhead among the CSs. Based on the energy demand prediction,
we then design a multi-principal one-agent (MPOA) contract-based method. In particular, we formulate
the CSs' utility maximization as a non-collaborative energy contract problem in which each CS maximizes
its utility under common constraints from the smart grid provider (SGP) and other CSs' contracts.
Then, we prove the existence of an equilibrium contract solution for all the CSs and develop an iterative
algorithm at the SGP to find the equilibrium. Through simulation results using the dataset of CSs'
transactions in Dundee city, the United Kingdom between 2017 and 2018, we demonstrate that our proposed
method can achieve the energy demand prediction accuracy improvement up to 24.63% and lessen communication
overhead by 96.3% compared with other machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our proposed
method can outperform non-contract-based economic models by 35% and 36% in terms of the CSs' utilities
and social welfare of the network, respectively.
