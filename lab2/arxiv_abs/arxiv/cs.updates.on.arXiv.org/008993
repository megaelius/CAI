Medical ultrasound technology is widely used in routine clinical applications such as disease
diagnosis and treatment as well as other applications like real-time monitoring of human tongue
shapes and motions as visual feedback in second language training. Due to the low-contrast characteristic
and noisy nature of ultrasound images, it might require expertise for non-expert users to recognize
tongue gestures. Manual tongue segmentation is a cumbersome, subjective, and error-prone task.
Furthermore, it is not a feasible solution for real-time applications. In the last few years, deep
learning methods have been used for delineating and tracking tongue dorsum. Deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNNs), which have shown to be successful in medical image analysis tasks, are
typically weak for the same task on different domains. In many cases, DCNNs trained on data acquired
with one ultrasound device, do not perform well on data of varying ultrasound device or acquisition
protocol. Domain adaptation is an alternative solution for this difficulty by transferring the
weights from the model trained on a large annotated legacy dataset to a new model for adapting on another
different dataset using fine-tuning. In this study, after conducting extensive experiments,
we addressed the problem of domain adaptation on small ultrasound datasets for tongue contour extraction.
We trained a U-net network comprises of an encoder-decoder path from scratch, and then with several
surrogate scenarios, some parts of the trained network were fine-tuned on another dataset as the
domain-adapted networks. We repeat scenarios from target to source domains to find a balance point
for knowledge transfer from source to target and vice versa. The performance of new fine-tuned networks
was evaluated on the same task with images from different domains.
