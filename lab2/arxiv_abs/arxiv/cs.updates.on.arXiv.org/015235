The aviation and transport security industries face the challenge of screening high volumes of
baggage for threats and contraband in the minimum time possible. Automation and semi-automation
of this procedure offers the potential to increase security by detecting more threats and improve
the customer experience by speeding up the process. Traditional 2D x-ray images are often extremely
difficult to examine due to the fact that they are tightly packed and contain a wide variety of cluttered
and occluded objects. Because of these limitations, major airports are introducing 3D x-ray Computed
Tomography (CT) baggage scanning. We investigate whether we can automate the process of detecting
electric devices in these 3D images of luggage. Detecting electrical devices is of particular concern
as they can be used to conceal explosives. Given the massive volume of luggage that needs to be screened
for this threat, the best way to automate the detection is to first filter whether a bag contains an
electric device or not, and if it does, to identify the number of devices and their location. We present
an algorithm, Unpack, Predict, eXtract, Repack (UXPR), which involves unpacking through segmenting
the data at a range of scales using an algorithm known as the Sieve, predicting whether a segment is
electrical or not based on the histogram of voxel intensities, then repacking the bag by ensembling
the segments and predictions to identify the devices in bags. Through a range of experiments using
data provided by ALERT (Awareness and Localization of Explosives-Related Threats) we show that
this system can find a high proportion of devices with unsupervised segmentation if a similar device
has been seen before, and shows promising results for detecting devices not seen at all based on the
properties of its constituent parts.
