Drug promiscuity and polypharmacology are much discussed topics in pharmaceutical research.
Drug repositioning applies established drugs to new disease indications with increasing success.
As polypharmacology, defined a drug's ability to bind to several targets but due to possible side
effects, this feature is not taken into consideration. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry focused
on the development of highly selective single-target drugs. Nowadays after lot of researches,
it is clear that polypharmacology is important for the efficacy of drugs. There are side effects
but on the other hand, this gives the opportunity to uncover new uses for already known drugs and especially
for complex diseases. Thus, it is clear that there are two sides of the same coin. There are several
approaches to discover new drugs targets, as analysis of genome wide association, gene expression
data and networks, structural approaches with alignment methods etc. Computational drug discovery
and design has experienced a rapid increase in development which is mainly due to the increasing
cost for discovering new compounds. Since drug development is a very costly venture, the pharmaceutical
industry puts effort in the repositioning of withdrawn or already approved drugs. The costs for
bringing such a drug to market are 60% lower than the development of a novel drug, which costs roughly
one billion US dollars. Thus, target prediction, drug repositioning approaches, protein-ligand
docking and scoring algorithms, virtual screening and other computational techniques have gained
the interest of researchers and pharmaceutical companies.
