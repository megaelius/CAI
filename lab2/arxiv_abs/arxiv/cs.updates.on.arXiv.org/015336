Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world since it came in sight
in December 2019. It has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions
worldwide. Any technological tool that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time,
effort, and possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently use
to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Computed
Tomography (CT), which require significant time, resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging
is a common and easily accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study,
we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images. Despite the importance
of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced not so satisfactory results due to the limited
datasets available for training. Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art
performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large datasets, such data
scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches
such as representation-based classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might
provide satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall short in
performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address this deficiency, Convolution
Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently been proposed as a bridge between model-based and
Deep Learning approaches by providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally
sparse representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class decision
in representation based techniques.
