This work investigates an elliptic optimal control problem defined on uncertain domains and discretized
by a fictitious domain finite element method and cut elements. Key ingredients of the study are to
manage cases considering the usually computationally "forbidden" combination of poorly conditioned
equation system matrices due to challenging geometries, optimal control searches with iterative
methods, slow convergence to system solutions on deterministic and non--deterministic level,
and expensive remeshing due to geometrical changes. We overcome all these difficulties, utilizing
the advantages of proper preconditioners adapted to unfitted mesh methods, improved types of Monte
Carlo methods, and mainly employing the advantages of embedded FEMs, based on a fixed background
mesh computed once even if geometrical changes are taking place. The sensitivity of the control
problem is introduced in terms of random domains, employing a Quasi--Monte Carlo method. The variational
discretization concept is adopted, optimal error estimates for the state, adjoint state and control
are derived that confirm the efficiency of the cut finite element method in challenging geometries.
The performance of a multigrid scheme especially developed for unfitted finite element discretizations
adapted to the optimal control problem is also tested. Some fundamental preconditioners are applied
to the arising sparse linear systems coming from the discretization of the state and adjoint state
variational forms in the spatial domain. The corresponding convergence rates along with the quality
of the prescribed preconditioners are verified by numerical examples. Further, a practical error
estimate for the Quasi--Monte Carlo method is derived, showing that it yields the theoretically
predicted convergence rate.
