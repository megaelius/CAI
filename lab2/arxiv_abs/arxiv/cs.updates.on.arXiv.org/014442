The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines the importance of understanding
human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer
a suitable environment for infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement
patterns and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus critical
to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For instance previous work has explored
the impact of recurring patterns inherent in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered
other dimensions such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider multiple
mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for the design of effective
intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide smart card travel data collected in Sydney,
Australia to classify bus passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration,
the distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate disease spread
on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We investigate in detail the transmissions
between the classified groups while varying the infection probability and the suspension time
of pathogens. Our results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions simultaneously
uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different groups of passengers, that would
remain hidden when considering only a single dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential
than others given specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination
efforts.
