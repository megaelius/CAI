Large scale veterinary clinical records can become a powerful resource for patient care and research.
However, clinicians lack the time and resource to annotate patient records with standard medical
diagnostic codes and most veterinary visits are captured in free text notes. The lack of standard
coding makes it challenging to use the clinical data to improve patient care. It is also a major impediment
to cross-species translational research, which relies on the ability to accurately identify patient
cohorts with specific diagnostic criteria in humans and animals. In order to reduce the coding burden
for veterinary clinical practice and aid translational research, we have developed a deep learning
algorithm, DeepTag, which automatically infers diagnostic codes from veterinary free text notes.
DeepTag is trained on a newly curated dataset of 112,558 veterinary notes manually annotated by
experts. DeepTag extends multi-task LSTM with an improved hierarchical objective that captures
the semantic structures between diseases. To foster human-machine collaboration, DeepTag also
learns to abstain in examples when it is uncertain and defers them to human experts, resulting in
improved performance. DeepTag accurately infers disease codes from free text even in challenging
cross-hospital settings where the text comes from different clinical settings than the ones used
for training. It enables automated disease annotation across a broad range of clinical diagnoses
with minimal pre-processing. The technical framework in this work can be applied in other medical
domains that currently lack medical coding resources.
