In recent times, the manufacturing processes are faced with many external or internal (the increase
of customized product rescheduling , process reliability,..) changes. Therefore, monitoring
and quality management activities for these manufacturing processes are difficult. Thus, the
managers need more proactive approaches to deal with this variability. In this study, a proactive
quality monitoring and control approach based on classifiers to predict defect occurrences and
provide optimal values for factors critical to the quality processes is proposed. In a previous
work (Noyel et al. 2013), the classification approach had been used in order to improve the quality
of a lacquering process at a company plant; the results obtained are promising, but the accuracy
of the classification model used needs to be improved. One way to achieve this is to construct a committee
of classifiers (referred to as an ensemble) to obtain a better predictive model than its constituent
models. However, the selection of the best classification methods and the construction of the final
ensemble still poses a challenging issue. In this study, we focus and analyze the impact of the choice
of classifier types on the accuracy of the classifier ensemble; in addition, we explore the effects
of the selection criterion and fusion process on the ensemble accuracy as well. Several fusion scenarios
were tested and compared based on a real-world case. Our results show that using an ensemble classification
leads to an increase in the accuracy of the classifier models. Consequently, the monitoring and
control of the considered real-world case can be improved.
