The past decade has seen a growth in the development and deployment of educational technologies
for assisting college-going students in choosing majors, selecting courses and acquiring feedback
based on past academic performance. Grade prediction methods seek to estimate a grade that a student
may achieve in a course that she may take in the future (e.g., next term). Accurate and timely prediction
of students' academic grades is important for developing effective degree planners and early warning
systems, and ultimately improving educational outcomes. Existing grade pre- diction methods
mostly focus on modeling the knowledge components associated with each course and student, and
often overlook other factors such as the difficulty of each knowledge component, course instructors,
student interest, capabilities and effort. In this paper, we propose additive latent effect models
that incorporate these factors to predict the student next-term grades. Specifically, the proposed
models take into account four factors: (i) student's academic level, (ii) course instructors,
(iii) student global latent factor, and (iv) latent knowledge factors. We compared the new models
with several state-of-the-art methods on students of various characteristics (e.g., whether
a student transferred in or not). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly outperform the baselines on grade prediction problem. Moreover, we perform a thorough
analysis on the importance of different factors and how these factors can practically assist students
in course selection, and finally improve their academic performance.
