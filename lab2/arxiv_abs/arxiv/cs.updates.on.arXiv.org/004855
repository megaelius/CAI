The tracking method based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) is efficient and effective. ELM
randomly generates input weights and biases in the hidden layer, and then calculates and computes
the output weights by reducing the iterative solution to the problem of linear equations. Therefore,
ELM offers the satisfying classification performance and fast training time than other discriminative
models in tracking. However, the original ELM method often suffers from the problem of the imbalanced
classification distribution, which is caused by few target objects, leading to under-fitting
and more background samples leading to over-fitting. Worse still, it reduces the robustness of
tracking under special conditions including occlusion, illumination, etc. To address above problems,
in this paper, we present a robust tracking algorithm. First, we introduce the local weight matrix
that is the dynamic creation from the data distribution at the current frame in the original ELM so
as to balance between the empirical and structure risk, and fully learn the target object to enhance
the classification performance. Second, we improve it to the incremental learning method ensuring
tracking real-time and efficient. Finally, the forgetting factor is used to strengthen the robustness
for changing of the classification distribution with time. Meanwhile, we propose a novel optimized
method to obtain the optimal sample as the target object, which avoids tracking drift resulting
from noisy samples. Therefore, our tracking method can fully learn both of the target object and
background information to enhance the tracking performance, and it is evaluated in 20 challenge
image sequences with different attributes including illumination, occlusion, deformation,
etc., which achieves better performance than several state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness
and robustness.
