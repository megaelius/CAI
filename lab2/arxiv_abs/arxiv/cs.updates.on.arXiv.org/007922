We address the following dynamic version of the school choice question: a city, named City, admits
students in two temporally-separated rounds, denoted $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$.
In round $\mathcal{R}_1$, the capacity of each school is fixed but in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, the
City is happy to allocate extra seats to specific schools per the recommendation of the mechanism;
in turn, the latter has to meet specified requirements. We study three natural settings of this model,
with the requirements getting increasingly stringent. For Settings I and II, we give pairs of polynomial
time mechanisms $(\mathcal{M}_1, \mathcal{M}_2)$ which, besides addressing the specific requirements,
find stable matchings, are dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) w.r.t. reporting preference
lists of students, and never break, in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, a match created in round $\mathcal{R}_1$.
In Setting III, the mechanism needs to deal with residents of the City who try to game the system by
not appearing in round $\mathcal{R}_1$ and only showing up in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, in addition
to gaming by misreporting preference lists. We note that the mechanisms described above were all
oblivious in that they needed to know only the preference lists of students being considered for
admission and not those who were not participating. After proving that no oblivious mechanism can
satisfy the rather stringent requirements of Situation III in a stability-preserving, DISC manner,
we turn to non-oblivious mechanisms. Moreover, since we were unable to achieve DSIC, we relax this
notion to weak incentive compatible (WIC) and give such a pair of mechanisms. Finally, we also give
a procedure that outputs all possible stability-preserving extensions of a given stable matching
(which may be exponentially many) with polynomial delay.
