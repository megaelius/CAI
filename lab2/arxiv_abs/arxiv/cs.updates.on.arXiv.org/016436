The independent set polynomial is important in many areas. For every integer $\Delta\geq 2$, the
Shearer threshold is the value $\lambda^*(\Delta)=(\Delta-1)^{\Delta-1}/\Delta^{\Delta}$
. It is known that for $\lambda < - \lambda^*(\Delta)$, there are graphs~$G$ with maximum degree~$\Delta$
whose independent set polynomial, evaluated at~$\lambda$, is at most~$0$. Also, there are no such
graphs for any $\lambda > -\lambda^*(\Delta)$. This paper is motivated by the computational problem
of approximating the independent set polynomial when $\lambda < - \lambda^*(\Delta)$. The key
issue in complexity bounds for this problem is "implementation". Informally, an implementation
of a real number $\lambda'$ is a graph whose hard-core partition function, evaluated at~$\lambda$,
simulates a vertex-weight of~$\lambda'$ in the sense that $\lambda'$ is the ratio between the contribution
to the partition function from independent sets containing a certain vertex and the contribution
from independent sets that do not contain that vertex. Implementations are the cornerstone of intractability
results for the problem of approximately evaluating the independent set polynomial. Our main result
is that, for any $\lambda < - \lambda^*(\Delta)$, it is possible to implement a set of values that
is dense over the reals. The result is tight in the sense that it is not possible to implement a set of
values that is dense over the reals for any $\lambda> \lambda^*(\Delta)$. Our result has already
been used in a paper with \bezakova{} (STOC 2018) to show that it is \#P-hard to approximate the evaluation
of the independent set polynomial on graphs of degree at most~$\Delta$ at any value $\lambda<-\lambda^*(\Delta)$.
In the appendix, we give an additional incomparable inapproximability result (strengthening
the inapproximability bound to an exponential factor, but weakening the hardness to NP-hardness).
