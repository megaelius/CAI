Let ${\cal G}=(G,\lambda)$ be a labeled graph on $n$ vertices with $\lambda:E_G\to \mathbb{N}$
a locally injective mapping that assigns to every edge a single integer label. The label is seen as
a discrete time when the edge is present. This graph is {\em temporally connected} if a path exists
with increasing labels from every vertex to every other vertex. In a seminal paper, Kempe, Kleinberg,
and Kumar (JCSS 2002) asked whether, given such a labeled graph, a {\em sparse} subset of edges can
always be found that preserves temporal connectivity if the other edges are removed -- we call such
subsets {\em temporal spanners}. Recently, Axiotis and Fotakis (ICALP 2016) answered negatively,
exhibiting a family of minimally connected temporal graphs with $\Omega(n^2)$ edges. The natural
question then becomes whether sparse spanners can be found in specific classes of dense graphs.
In this article, we settle the question {\em positively} for complete graphs, showing that one can
always remove all but $o(n^2)$ edges, whatever the labels, while preserving temporal connectivity.
The best approach so far led to removing only $O(n)$ edges, leaving the asymptotic density of the
graph unchanged (Akrida et al., ToCS 2017). We start by observing that the same argument can be generalized
to removing $O(n^2)$ edges (a sixth of the edges). Then, using a completely different approach,
we establish a gradual set of results, showing that a quarter of the edges can be removed, then half
of the edges, and eventually {\em all} but $O(n \log n)$ edges. This result is robust in the sense that
it extends, under mild assumptions, to more general models of temporal cliques where the labels
may not be locally unique and a same edge may have several labels. The main open question is now to understand
where the separation occurs between graphs that admit sparse spanners and graphs that do not.
