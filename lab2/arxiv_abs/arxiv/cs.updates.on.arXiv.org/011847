New technologies allow ordinary people to access Virtual Reality at affordable prices in their
homes. One of the most important tasks when interacting with immersive Virtual Reality is to navigate
the virtual environments (VEs). Arguably, the best methods to accomplish this use of direct control
interfaces. Among those, natural walking (NW) makes for enjoyable user experience. However, common
techniques to support direct control interfaces in VEs feature constraints that make it difficult
to use those methods in cramped home environments. Indeed, NW requires unobstructed and open space.
To approach this problem, we propose a new virtual locomotion technique, Combined Walking in Place
(CWIP). CWIP allows people to take advantage of the available physical space and empowers them to
use NW to navigate in the virtual world. For longer distances, we adopt Walking in Place (WIP) to enable
them to move in the virtual world beyond the confines of a cramped real room. However, roaming in immersive
alternate reality, while moving in the confines of a cluttered environment can lead people to stumble
and fall. To approach these problems, we developed Augmented Virtual Reality (AVR), to inform users
about real-world hazards, such as chairs, drawers, walls via proxies and signs placed in the virtual
world. We propose thus CWIP-AVR as a way to safely explore VR in the cramped confines of your own home.
To our knowledge, this is the first approach to combined different locomotion modalities in a safe
manner. We evaluated it in a user study with 20 participants to validate their ability to navigate
a virtual world while walking in a confined and cluttered real space. Our results show that CWIP-AVR
allows people to navigate VR safely, switching between locomotion modes flexibly while maintaining
a good immersion.
