Many quantities of interest (qois) arising from differential-equation-centric models can be
resolved into functions of scalar fields. Examples of such qois include the lift over an airfoil
or the displacement of a loaded structure; examples of corresponding fields are the static pressure
field in a computational fluid dynamics solution, and the strain field in the finite element elasticity
analysis. These scalar fields are evaluated at each node within a discretized computational domain.
In certain scenarios, the field at a certain node is only weakly influenced by far-field perturbations;
it is likely to be strongly governed by local perturbations, which in turn can be caused by uncertainties
in the geometry. One can interpret this as a strong anisotropy of the field with respect to uncertainties
in prescribed inputs. We exploit this notion of localized scalar-field influence for approximating
global qois, which often are integrals of certain field quantities. We formalize our ideas by assigning
ridge approximations for the field at select nodes. This embedded ridge approximation has favorable
theoretical properties for approximating a global qoi in terms of the reduced number of computational
evaluations required. Parallels are drawn between our proposed approach, active subspaces and
vector-valued dimension reduction. Additionally, we study the ridge directions of adjacent nodes
and devise algorithms that can recover field quantities at selected nodes, when storing the ridge
profiles at a subset of nodes---paving the way for novel reduced order modeling strategies. Our
paper offers analytical and simulation-based examples that expose different facets of embedded
ridge approximations.
