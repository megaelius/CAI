A building's environment has profound influence on occupant comfort and health. Continuous monitoring
of building occupancy and environment is essential to fault detection, intelligent control, and
building commissioning. Though many solutions for environmental measuring based on wireless
sensor networks exist, they are not easily accessible to households and building owners who may
lack time or technical expertise needed to set up a system and get quick and detailed overview of environmental
conditions. Building-in-Briefcase (BiB) is a portable sensor network platform that is trivially
easy to deploy in any building environment. Once the sensors are distributed, the environmental
data is collected and communicated to the BiB router via TCP/IP protocol and WiFi technology which
then forwards the data to the central database securely over the internet through a 3G radio. The
user, with minimal effort, can access the aggregated data and visualize the trends in real time on
the BiB web portal. Paramount to the adoption and continued operation of an indoor sensing platform
is battery lifetime. This design has achieved a multi-year lifespan by careful selection of components,
an efficient binary communications protocol and data compression. Our BiB sensor is capable of
collecting a rich set of environmental parameters, and is expandable to measure others, such as
CO2. This paper describes the power characteristics of BiB sensors and their occupancy estimation
and activity recognition functionality. Our vision is large-scale deployment of BiB in thousands
of buildings, which would provide ample research opportunities and opportunities to identify
ways to improve the building environment and energy efficiency.
