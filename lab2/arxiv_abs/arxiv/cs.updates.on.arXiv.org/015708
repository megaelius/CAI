Enabling users to move to different geographical locations within a network and still be able to
maintain their connectivity and most essentially, continuity of service, is what makes any wireless
network ubiquitous. Whilst challenging, modern day wireless networks, such as 3GPP-LTE, provision
satisfactory mobility management (MM) performance. However, it is estimated that the number of
mobile subscriptions will approximately touch 9 billion and the amount of data traffic will expand
by 5 times in 2024 as compared to 2018. Further, it is expected that this trend of exponential growth
will be maintained well into the future. To cope with such an exponential increase in cellular traffic
and users alongside a burgeoning demand for higher Quality of Service (QoS), the future networks
are expected to be highly dense and heterogeneous. This will severely challenge the existing MM
solutions and ultimately render them ineffective as they will not be able to provide the required
reliability, flexibility, and scalability. Consequently, to serve the 5G and beyond 5G networks,
a new perspective to MM is required. Hence, in this article we present a novel discussion of the functional
requirements from MM strategies for these networks. We present a novel qualitative assessment
of the state-of-the-art mechanisms based on their ability to satisfy the reliability, flexibility
and scalability criteria for future MM strategies. We then present a study detailing the research
challenges that exist in the design and implementation of MM strategies for 5G and beyond networks.
Further, we chart out the potential MM solutions and the associated capabilities they offer to tackle
the persistent challenges. We conclude this paper with a vision for the 5G and beyond MM mechanisms.
