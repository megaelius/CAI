As the advancement of deep learning (DL), the Internet of Things and cloud computing techniques
for biomedical and healthcare problems, mobile healthcare systems have received unprecedented
attention. Since DL techniques usually require enormous amount of computation, most of them cannot
be directly deployed on the resource-constrained mobile and IoT devices. Hence, most of the mobile
healthcare systems leverage the cloud computing infrastructure, where the data collected by the
mobile and IoT devices would be transmitted to the cloud computing platforms for analysis. However,
in the contested environments, relying on the cloud might not be practical at all times. For instance,
the satellite communication might be denied or disrupted. We propose SAIA, a Split Artificial Intelligence
Architecture for mobile healthcare systems. Unlike traditional approaches for artificial intelligence
(AI) which solely exploits the computational power of the cloud server, SAIA could not only relies
on the cloud computing infrastructure while the wireless communication is available, but also
utilizes the lightweight AI solutions that work locally on the client side, hence, it can work even
when the communication is impeded. In SAIA, we propose a meta-information based decision unit,
that could tune whether a sample captured by the client should be operated by the embedded AI (i.e.,
keeping on the client) or the networked AI (i.e., sending to the server), under different conditions.
In our experimental evaluation, extensive experiments have been conducted on two popular healthcare
datasets. Our results show that SAIA consistently outperforms its baselines in terms of both effectiveness
and efficiency.
