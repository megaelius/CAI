One can point to a variety of historical milestones for gender equality in STEM (science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics), however, practical effects are incremental and ongoing. It is
important to quantify gender differences in subdomains of scientific work in order to detect potential
biases and monitor progress. In this work, we study the relevance of gender in scientific collaboration
patterns in the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS), a professional
society with sixteen peer-reviewed journals. Using their publication data from 1952 to 2016, we
constructed a large temporal bipartite network between authors and publications, and augmented
the author nodes with gender labels. We characterized differences in several basic statistics
of this network over time, highlighting how they have changed with respect to relevant historical
events. We find a steady increase in participation by women (e.g., fraction of authorships by women
and of new women authors) starting around 1980. However, women still comprise less than 25% of the
INFORMS society and an even smaller fraction of authors with many publications. Moreover, we describe
a methodology for quantifying the structural role of an authorship with respect to the overall connectivity
of the network, using it to measure subtle differences between authorships by women and by men. Specifically,
as measures of structural importance of an authorship, we use effective resistance and contraction
importance, two measures related to diffusion throughout a network. As a null model, we propose
a degree-preserving temporal and geometric network model with emergent communities. Our results
suggest the presence of systematic differences between the collaboration patterns of men and women
that cannot be explained by only local statistics.
