This paper presents Capsule GAN, a Generative adversarial network using Capsule Network not only
in the discriminator but also in the generator. Recently, Generative adversarial networks (GANs)
has been intensively studied. However, generating images by GANs is difficult. Therefore, GANs
sometimes generate poor quality images. These GANs use convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
However, CNNs have the defect that the relational information between features of the image may
be lost. Capsule Network, proposed by Hinton in 2017, overcomes the defect of CNNs. Capsule GAN reported
previously uses Capsule Network in the discriminator. However, instead of using Capsule Network,
Capsule GAN reported in previous studies uses CNNs in generator architecture like DCGAN. This paper
introduces two approaches to use Capsule Network in the generator. One is to use DigitCaps layer
from the discriminator as the input to the generator. DigitCaps layer is the output layer of Capsule
Network. It has the features of the input images of the discriminator. The other is to use the reverse
operation of recognition process in Capsule Network in the generator. We compare Capsule GAN proposed
in this paper with conventional GAN using CNN and Capsule GAN which uses Capsule Network in the discriminator
only. The datasets are MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and color images. We show that Capsule GAN outperforms
the GAN using CNN and the GAN using Capsule Network in the discriminator only. The architecture of
Capsule GAN proposed in this paper is a basic architecture using Capsule Network. Therefore, we
can apply the existing improvement techniques for GANs to Capsule GAN.
