Sequential recommendation is a fundamental task for network applications, and it usually suffers
from the item cold start problem due to the insufficiency of user feedbacks. There are currently
three kinds of popular approaches which are respectively based on matrix factorization (MF) of
collaborative filtering, Markov chain (MC), and recurrent neural network (RNN). Although widely
used, they have some limitations. MF based methods could not capture dynamic user's interest. The
strong Markov assumption greatly limits the performance of MC based methods. RNN based methods
are still in the early stage of incorporating additional information. Based on these basic models,
many methods with additional information only validate incorporating one modality in a separate
way. In this work, to make the sequential recommendation and deal with the item cold start problem,
we propose a Multi-View Recurrent Neural Network (MV-RNN}) model. Given the latent feature, MV-RNN
can alleviate the item cold start problem by incorporating visual and textual information. First,
At the input of MV-RNN, three different combinations of multi-view features are studied, like concatenation,
fusion by addition and fusion by reconstructing the original multi-modal data. MV-RNN applies
the recurrent structure to dynamically capture the user's interest. Second, we design a separate
structure and a united structure on the hidden state of MV-RNN to explore a more effective way to handle
multi-view features. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MV-RNN can effectively
generate the personalized ranking list, tackle the missing modalities problem and significantly
alleviate the item cold start problem.
