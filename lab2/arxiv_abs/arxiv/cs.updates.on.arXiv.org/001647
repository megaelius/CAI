With the digital breakthrough, smart phones have become very essential component. Mobile devices
are very attractive attack surface for cyber thieves as they hold personal details (accounts, locations,
contacts, photos) and have potential capabilities for eavesdropping (with cameras/microphone,
wireless connections). Android, being the most popular, is the target of malicious hackers who
are trying to use Android app as a tool to break into and control device. Android malware authors use
many anti-analysis techniques to hide from analysis tools. Academic researchers and commercial
anti-malware companies are putting great effort to detect such malicious apps. They are making
use of the combinations of static, dynamic and behavior based analysis techniques. Despite of all
the security mechanisms provided by Android, apps can carry out malicious actions through collusion.
In collusion malicious functionality is divided across multiple apps. Each participating app
accomplish its part and communicate information to another app through Inter Component Communication
(ICC). ICC do not require any special permissions. Also, there is no compulsion to inform user about
the communication. Each participating app needs to request a minimal set of privileges, which may
make it appear benign to current state-of-the-art techniques that analyze one app at a time. There
are many surveys on app analysis techniques in Android; however they focus on single-app analysis.
This survey augments this through focusing only on collusion among multiple-apps. In this paper,
we present Android vulnerabilities that may be exploited for a possible collusion attack. We cover
the existing threat analysis, scenarios, and a detailed comparison of tools for intra and inter-app
analysis. To the best of our knowledge this is the first survey on app collusion and state-of-the-art
detection tools in Android.
