Machine learning is revolutionizing biology by facilitating the prediction of outcomes from complex
patterns found in massive data sets. Large biological data sets, like those generated by transcriptome
or microbiome studies,measure many relevant components that interact in vivo with one another
in modular ways.Identifying the high-order interactions that machine learning models use to make
predictions would facilitate the development of hypotheses linking combinations of measured
components to outcome. By using the structure of random forests, a new algorithmic approach, termed
JigSaw,was developed to aid in the discovery of patterns that could explain predictions made by
the forest. By examining the patterns of individual decision trees JigSaw identifies high-order
interactions between measured features that are strongly associated with a particular outcome
and identifies the relevant decision thresholds. JigSaw's effectiveness was tested in simulation
studies where it was able to recover multiple ground truth patterns;even in the presence of significant
noise. It was then used to find patterns associated with outcomes in two real world data sets.It was
first used to identify patterns clinical measurements associated with heart disease. It was then
used to find patterns associated with breast cancer using metabolites measured in the blood. In
heart disease, JigSaw identified several three-way interactions that combine to explain most
of the heart disease records (66%) with high precision (93%). In breast cancer, three two-way interactions
were recovered that can be combined to explain almost all records (92%) with good precision (79%).
JigSaw is an efficient method for exploring high-dimensional feature spaces for rules that explain
statistical associations with a given outcome and can inspire the generation of testable hypotheses.
