Continuous monitoring of cardiac health under free living condition is crucial to provide effective
care for patients undergoing post operative recovery and individuals with high cardiac risk like
the elderly. Capacitive Electrocardiogram (cECG) is one such technology which allows comfortable
and long term monitoring through its ability to measure biopotential in conditions without having
skin contact. cECG monitoring can be done using many household objects like chairs, beds and even
car seats allowing for seamless monitoring of individuals. This method is unfortunately highly
susceptible to motion artifacts which greatly limits its usage in clinical practice. The current
use of cECG systems has been limited to performing rhythmic analysis. In this paper we propose a novel
end-to-end deep learning architecture to perform the task of denoising capacitive ECG. The proposed
network is trained using motion corrupted three channel cECG and a reference LEAD I ECG collected
on individuals while driving a car. Further, we also propose a novel joint loss function to apply
loss on both signal and frequency domain. We conduct extensive rhythmic analysis on the model predictions
and the ground truth. We further evaluate the signal denoising using Mean Square Error(MSE) and
Cross Correlation between model predictions and ground truth. We report MSE of 0.167 and Cross Correlation
of 0.476. The reported results highlight the feasibility of performing morphological analysis
using the filtered cECG. The proposed approach can allow for continuous and comprehensive monitoring
of the individuals in free living conditions.
