High levels of air pollution may seriously affect people's living environment and even endanger
their lives. In order to reduce air pollution concentrations, and warn the public before the occurrence
of hazardous air pollutants, it is urgent to design an accurate and reliable air pollutant forecasting
model. However, most previous research have many deficiencies, such as ignoring the importance
of predictive stability, and poor initial parameters and so on, which have significantly effect
on the performance of air pollution prediction. Therefore, to address these issues, a novel hybrid
model is proposed in this study. Specifically, a powerful data preprocessing techniques is applied
to decompose the original time series into different modes from low- frequency to high- frequency.
Next, a new multi-objective algorithm called MOHHO is first developed in this study, which are introduced
to tune the parameters of ELM model with high forecasting accuracy and stability for air pollution
series prediction, simultaneously. And the optimized ELM model is used to perform the time series
prediction. Finally, a scientific and robust evaluation system including several error criteria,
benchmark models, and several experiments using six air pollutant concentrations time series
from three cities in China is designed to perform a compressive assessment for the presented hybrid
forecasting model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid model can guarantee
a more stable and higher predictive performance compared to others, whose superior prediction
ability may help to develop effective plans for air pollutant emissions and prevent health problems
caused by air pollution.
