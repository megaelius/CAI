Dual-energy (DE) chest radiographs provide greater diagnostic information than standard radiographs
by separating the image into bone and soft tissue, revealing suspicious lesions which may otherwise
be obstructed from view. However, acquisition of DE images requires two physical scans, necessitating
specialized hardware and processing, and images are prone to motion artifact. Generation of virtual
DE images from standard, single-shot chest radiographs would expand the diagnostic value of standard
radiographs without changing the acquisition procedure. We present a Multi-scale Conditional
Adversarial Network (MCA-Net) which produces high-resolution virtual DE bone images from standard,
single-shot chest radiographs. Our proposed MCA-Net is trained using the adversarial network
so that it learns sharp details for the production of high-quality bone images. Then, the virtual
DE soft tissue image is generated by processing the standard radiograph with the virtual bone image
using a cross projection transformation. Experimental results from 210 patient DE chest radiographs
demonstrated that the algorithm can produce high-quality virtual DE chest radiographs. Important
structures were preserved, such as coronary calcium in bone images and lung lesions in soft tissue
images. The average structure similarity index and the peak signal to noise ratio of the produced
bone images in testing data were 96.4 and 41.5, which are significantly better than results from
previous methods. Furthermore, our clinical evaluation results performed on the publicly available
dataset indicates the clinical values of our algorithms. Thus, our algorithm can produce high-quality
DE images that are potentially useful for radiologists, computer-aided diagnostics, and other
diagnostic tasks.
