The procure to pay process (P2P) in large enterprises is a back-end business process which deals
with the procurement of products and services for enterprise operations. Procurement is done by
issuing purchase orders to impaneled vendors and invoices submitted by vendors are paid after they
go through a rigorous validation process. Agents orchestrating P2P process often encounter the
problem of matching a product or service descriptions in the invoice to those in purchase order and
verify if the ordered items are what have been supplied or serviced. For example, the description
in the invoice and purchase order could be TRES 739mL CD KER Smooth and TRES 0.739L CD KER Smth which
look different at word level but refer to the same item. In a typical P2P process, agents are asked
to manually select the products which are similar before invoices are posted for payment. This step
in the business process is manual, repetitive, cumbersome, and costly. Since descriptions are
not well-formed sentences, we cannot apply existing semantic and syntactic text similarity approaches
directly. In this paper, we present two approaches to solve the above problem using various types
of available agent's recorded feedback data. If the agent's feedback is in the form of a relative
ranking between descriptions, we use similarity ranking algorithm. If the agent's feedback is
absolute such as match or no-match, we use classification similarity algorithm. We also present
the threats to the validity of our approach and present a possible remedy making use of product taxonomy
and catalog. We showcase the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches
over many benchmarks and real-world data sets.
