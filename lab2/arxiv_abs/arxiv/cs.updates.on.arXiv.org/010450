We consider the scenario where N utilities strategically bid for electricity in the day-ahead market
and balance the mismatch between the committed supply and actual demand in the real-time market.
Each utility aims at minimizing its own cost of per-unit electricity by optimizing the bidding strategy,
with uncertainty in demand and local renewable generation taken into account. The per-unit electricity
cost of a utility is a function of both the day-ahead clearing price and the real-time spot price affected
by the market-level supply-demand mismatch. We model the interactions among utilities as a non-cooperative
game and study the equilibrium strategies. We show that all utilities bidding according to (net
load) prediction is a unique pure strategy Nash Equilibrium with two salient properties. First,
it incurs no loss of efficiency; hence, the competition among utilities does not increase the social
cost. Second, it is robust and (0, N-1)-immune. Irrational fault behaviors of any subset of the utilities
only help reduce the costs of other rational utilities. We prove the results hold for correlated
prediction errors and a general class of real-time spot pricing models, which capture the relationship
between the spot price, the day-ahead clearing price, and the market-level mismatch. Simulations
based on real-world traces corroborate our theoretical results and highlight the benefit of improving
the level of competition and the resilience of the spot pricing against the market-level mismatch.
Our study offers new insights for market mechanism design. It highlights that it is possible to design
effective real-time pricing schemes satisfying the sufficient conditions derived in our paper,
such that the day-ahead market admits a unique and efficient pure strategy Nash Equilibrium and
it is robust to irrational fault behaviors.
