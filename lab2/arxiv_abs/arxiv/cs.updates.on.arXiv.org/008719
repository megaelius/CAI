In a Web plagued by disappearing resources, Web archive collections provide a valuable means of
preserving Web resources important to the study of past events ranging from elections to disease
outbreaks. These archived collections start with seed URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) hand-selected
by curators. Curators produce high quality seeds by removing non-relevant URIs and adding URIs
from credible and authoritative sources, but it is time consuming to collect these seeds. Two main
strategies adopted by curators for discovering seeds include scraping Web (e.g., Google) Search
Engine Result Pages (SERPs) and social media (e.g., Twitter) SERPs. In this work, we studied three
social media platforms in order to provide insight on the characteristics of seeds generated from
different sources. First, we developed a simple vocabulary for describing social media posts across
different platforms. Second, we introduced a novel source for generating seeds from URIs in the
threaded conversations of social media posts created by single or multiple users. Users on social
media sites routinely create and share posts about news events consisting of hand-selected URIs
of news stories, tweets, videos, etc. In this work, we call these posts micro-collections, and we
consider them as an important source for seeds because the effort taken to create micro-collections
is an indication of editorial activity, and a demonstration of domain expertise. Third, we generated
23,112 seed collections with text and hashtag queries from 449,347 social media posts from Reddit,
Twitter, and Scoop.it. We collected in total 120,444 URIs from the conventional scraped SERP posts
and micro-collections. We characterized the resultant seed collections across multiple dimensions
including the distribution of URIs, precision, ages, diversity of webpages, etc...
