The article is devoted to communication competence in modeling with other competences of Bachelor
in Electromechanics, its structure and the contribution of components in the formation of competence.
The approaches to defining competence of bachelor-electrician are determined. A system of competencies
is suggested. In order to determine the inclusion of each of the selected competencies in the formation
of competence of Bachelor in Electromechanics, experts' opinions were surveyed. The goals were
to determine the structure and content of the bachelor's in Electromechanics competence in modeling.
The research focus was to research the relationship of competence in modeling with other competencies
of Bachelor of Electromechanics, its structure and the contribution of components in the formation
of competence. The object of the research was Bachelor's in Electromechanics learning process.
The subject of the research was the theoretical base of expertise of Bachelors in Electromechanics
in modeling. The results of the research were the connection of competence in modeling with other
competencies of Bachelor in Electromechanics, its structure and the contribution of components
in the formation of competence. The structure and content of the electrician's competence in modeling
were defined. The principal conclusions and recommendations were: the system of competence in
electromechanics in modeling involves three groups of competencies: the general scientific,
common professional, and specific professional ones. The formation of competence of Bachelor
in Electromechanics in simulation cycle starts in mathematical and natural-scientific training
(the leading one is general scientific competence) and continues in the cycle of professional and
practical training (the leading ones are common professional and specific professional competencies).
