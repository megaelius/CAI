The Internet of Things comes along with new challenges for experimenting, testing, and operating
decentralized socio-technical systems at large-scale. In such systems autonomous agents interact
locally with their users and remotely with other agents, to make intelligent collective choices,
via which they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed resources. For instance,
self-management of traffic flows in Smart Cities. While such complex systems are usually deployed
and operated using centralized computing infrastructures, their socio-technical nature requires
new value-oriented design paradigms empowering trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens'
social values, such as privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens' choices.
Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the prototyping process from simulation,
to live deployment, and ultimately to a robust operation, are missing or not practical. This paper
bridges this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized socio-technical
systems running on IoT. This architecture empowers the seamless reusability of (i) application-independent
decentralized services by an IoT application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same decentralized
service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications that are simpler to prototype and
can interoperate with services during runtime to self-integrate more complex functionality.
Such self-integration provides stronger validation and improves efficiency of resource utilization:
computational resources are shared, cutting down deployment and operational costs. Pressure/crash
tests during continuous operations of several weeks, with more than 3000 agents joining/leaving,
150,000 parameter changes, and 3 million communicated messages/day, confirm the robustness and
practicality of the testbed architecture.
