The Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, which considers a graph with weights assigned
to nodes and seeks to discover the "heaviest" independent set, that is, a set of nodes with maximum
total weight so that no two nodes in the set are connected by an edge. The MWIS problem arises in many
application domains, including the resource-constrained scheduling, error-correcting coding,
complex system analysis and optimization, and communication networks. Since solving the MWIS
problem is the core function for finding the optimum solution of our novel graph-based formulation
of the resource-constrained Process Planning and Scheduling (PPS) problem, it is essential to
have "good-performance" algorithms to solve the MWIS problem. In this paper, we propose a Novel
Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm (NHHA) framework in a divide-and-conquer structure that yields optimum
feasible solutions to the MWIS problem. The NHHA framework is optimized to minimize the recurrence.
Using the NHHA framework, we also solve the All Maximal Independent Sets Listing (AMISL) problem,
which can be seen as the subproblem of the MWIS problem. Moreover, building composed MWIS algorithms
that utilizing fast approximation algorithms with the NHHA framework is an effective way to improve
the accuracy of approximation MWIS algorithms (e.g., GWMIN and GWMIN2 (Sakai et al., 2003)). Eight
algorithms for the MWIS problem, the exact MWIS algorithm, the AMISL algorithm, two approximation
algorithms from the literature, and four composed algorithms, are applied and tested for solving
the graph-based formulation of the resource-constrained PPS problem to evaluate the scalability,
accuracy, and robustness.
