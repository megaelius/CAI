Biofouling is the accumulation of organisms on surfaces immersed in water. It is of particular concern
to the international shipping industry because fouling increases the drag on vessels as they move
through the water, resulting in higher fuel costs, and presents a biosecurity risk by providing
a pathway for marine non-indigenous species (NIS) to establish in new areas. There is growing interest
within jurisdictions to strengthen biofouling risk-management regulations, but it is expensive
to conduct in-water inspections and assess the collected data to determine the biofouling state
of vessel hulls. Machine learning is well suited to tackle the latter challenge, and here we apply
so-called deep learning to automate the classification of images from in-water inspections for
the presence and severity of biofouling. We combined images collected from in-water surveys conducted
by the Australian Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, the New Zealand Ministry
for Primary Industries and the California State Lands Commission, and annotated them using the
Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform. We compared the annotations from three
biofouling experts on a 120-sample subset of these images, and found that for two tasks, identifying
images containing fouling, and identifying images containing heavy fouling, they showed 89% agreement
(95% CI: 87-92%). It was found that the MTurk labelling approach achieved similar agreement with
experts, which we defined as performing at most 5% worse than experts (p=0.004-0.020). Our deep
learning model trained with the MTurk annotations also showed reasonable performance in comparison
to expert agreement, although at a lower significance level (p=0.071-0.093). We also demonstrate
that significantly better performance than expert agreement can be achieved if a classifier with
high recall or precision was required.
