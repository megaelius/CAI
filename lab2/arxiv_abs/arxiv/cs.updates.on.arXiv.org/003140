A bipartite quantum interaction corresponds to the most general quantum interaction that can occur
between two quantum systems. In this work, we determine bounds on the capacities of bipartite interactions
for entanglement generation and secret key agreement. Our upper bound on the entanglement generation
capacity of a bipartite quantum interaction is given by a quantity that we introduce here, called
the bidirectional max-Rains information. Our upper bound on the secret-key-agreement capacity
of a bipartite quantum interaction is given by a related quantity introduced here also, called the
bidirectional max-relative entropy of entanglement. We also derive tighter upper bounds on the
capacities of bipartite interactions obeying certain symmetries. Observing that quantum reading
is a particular kind of bipartite quantum interaction, we leverage our bounds from the bidirectional
setting to deliver bounds on the capacity of a task that we introduce, called private reading of a
wiretap memory cell. Given a set of point-to-point quantum wiretap channels, the goal of private
reading is for an encoder to form codewords from these channels, in order to establish secret key
with a party who controls one input and one output of the channels, while a passive eavesdropper has
access to one output of the channels. We derive both lower and upper bounds on the private reading
capacities of a wiretap memory cell. We then extend these results to determine achievable rates
for the generation of entanglement between two distant parties who have coherent access to a controlled
point-to-point channel, which is a particular kind of bipartite interaction.
