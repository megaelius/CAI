Routing optimization is a relevant problem in many contexts. Solving directly this type of optimization
problem is often computationally unfeasible. Recent studies suggest that one can instead turn
this problem into one of solving a dynamical system of equations, which can instead be solved efficiently
using numerical methods. This results in enabling the acquisition of optimal network topologies
from a variety of routing problems. However, the actual extraction of the solution in terms of a final
network topology relies on numerical details which can prevent an accurate investigation of their
topological properties. In this context, theoretical results are fully accessible only to an expert
audience and ready-to-use implementations for non-experts are rarely available or insufficiently
documented. In particular, in this framework, final graph acquisition is a challenging problem
in-and-of-itself. Here we introduce a method to extract networks topologies from dynamical equations
related to routing optimization under various parameters' settings. Our method is made of three
steps: first, it extracts an optimal trajectory by solving a dynamical system, then it pre-extracts
a network and finally, it filters out potential redundancies. Remarkably, we propose a principled
model to address the filtering in the last step, and give a quantitative interpretation in terms
of a transport-related cost function. This principled filtering can be applied to more general
problems such as network extraction from images, thus going beyond the scenarios envisioned in
the first step. Overall, this novel algorithm allows practitioners to easily extract optimal network
topologies by combining basic tools from numerical methods, optimization and network theory.
Thus, we provide an alternative to manual graph extraction which allows a grounded extraction from
a large variety of optimal topologies.
