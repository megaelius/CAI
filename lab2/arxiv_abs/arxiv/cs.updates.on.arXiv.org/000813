The expected improvement algorithm (or efficient global optimization) aims for global continuous
optimization with a limited budget of black-box function evaluations. It is based on a statistical
model of the function learned from previous evaluations and an infill criterion - the expected improvement
- used to find a promising point for a new evaluation. The `expected improvement' infill criterion
takes into account the mean and variance of a predictive multivariate Gaussian distribution. The
expected improvement algorithm has recently been generalized to multiobjective optimization.
In order to measure the improvement of a Pareto front quantitatively the gain in dominated (hyper-)volume
is used. The computation of the expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) is a multidimensional
integration of a step-wise defined non-linear function related to the Gaussian probability density
function over an intersection of boxes. This paper provides a new algorithm for the exact computation
of the expected improvement to more than two objective functions. For the bicriteria case it has
a time complexity in $O(n^2)$ with $n$ denoting the number of points in the current best Pareto front
approximation. It improves previously known algorithms with time complexity $O(n^3 \log n)$.
For tricriteria optimization we devise an algorithm with time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Besides
discussing the new time complexity bounds the speed of the new algorithm is also tested empirically
on test data. It is shown that further improvements in speed can be achieved by reusing data structures
built up in previous iterations. The resulting numerical algorithms can be readily used in existing
implementations of hypervolume-based expected improvement algorithms.
