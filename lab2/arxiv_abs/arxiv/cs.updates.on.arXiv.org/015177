Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is an enabling technology in modern transportation systems for
providing safety and valuable information, and yet vulnerable to a number of attacks from passive
eavesdropping to active interfering. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are important devices
that can mitigate the threats by detecting malicious behaviors. Furthermore, the collaborations
among vehicles in VANETs can improve the detection accuracy by communicating their experiences
between nodes. To this end, distributed machine learning is a suitable framework for the design
of scalable and implementable collaborative detection algorithms over VANETs. One fundamental
barrier to collaborative learning is the privacy concern as nodes exchange data among them. A malicious
node can obtain sensitive information of other nodes by inferring from the observed data. In this
paper, we propose a privacy-preserving machine-learning based collaborative IDS (PML-CIDS)
for VANETs. The proposed algorithm employs the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
to a class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems and trains a classifier to detect the intrusions
in the VANETs. We use the differential privacy to capture the privacy notation of the PML-CIDS and
propose a method of dual variable perturbation to provide dynamic differential privacy. We analyze
theoretical performance and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the security and privacy
of the PML-CIDS. We also conduct numerical experiments using the NSL-KDD dataset to corroborate
the results on the detection accuracy, security-privacy tradeoffs, and design.
