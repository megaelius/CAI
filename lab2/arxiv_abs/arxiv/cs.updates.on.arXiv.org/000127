We present a general framework for constructing high rate error correcting codes that are locally
correctable (and hence locally decodable if linear) with a sublinear number of queries, based on
lifting codes with respect to functions on the coordinates. Our approach generalizes the lifting
of affine-invariant codes of Guo, Kopparty, and Sudan and its generalization automorphic lifting,
suggested by Ben-Sasson et al, which lifts algebraic geometry codes with respect to a group of automorphisms
of the code. Our notion of lifting is a natural alternative to the degree-lifting of Ben-Sasson et
al and it carries two advantages. First, it overcomes the rate barrier inherent in degree-lifting.
Second, it is extremely flexible, requiring no special properties (e.g. linearity, invariance)
of the base code, and requiring very little structure on the set of functions on the coordinates of
the code. As an application, we construct new explicit families of locally correctable codes by
lifting algebraic geometry codes. Like the multiplicity codes of Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin and
the affine-lifted codes of Guo, Kopparty, Sudan, our codes of block-length $N$ can achieve $N^\epsilon$
query complexity and $1-\alpha$ rate for any given $\epsilon, \alpha > 0$ while correcting a
constant fraction of errors, in contrast to the Reed-Muller codes and the degree-lifted AG codes
of Ben-Sasson et al which face a rate barrier of $\epsilon^{O(1/\epsilon)}$. However, like the
degree-lifted AG codes, our codes are over an alphabet significantly smaller than that obtained
by Reed-Muller codes, affine-lifted codes, and multiplicity codes.
