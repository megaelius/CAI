The writing can be used as an important biometric modality which allows to unequivocally identify
an individual. It happens because the writing of two different persons present differences that
can be explored both in terms of graphometric properties or even by addressing the manuscript as
a digital image, taking into account the use of image processing techniques that can properly capture
different visual attributes of the image (e.g. texture). In this work, perform a detailed study
in which we dissect whether or not the use of a database with only a single sample taken from some writers
may skew the results obtained in the experimental protocol. In this sense, we propose here what we
call "document filter". The "document filter" protocol is supposed to be used as a preprocessing
technique, such a way that all the data taken from fragments of the same document must be placed either
into the training or into the test set. The rationale behind it, is that the classifier must capture
the features from the writer itself, and not features regarding other particularities which could
affect the writing in a specific document (i.e. emotional state of the writer, pen used, paper type,
and etc.). By analyzing the literature, one can find several works dealing the writer identification
problem. However, the performance of the writer identification systems must be evaluated also
taking into account the occurrence of writer volunteers who contributed with a single sample during
the creation of the manuscript databases. To address the open issue investigated here, a comprehensive
set of experiments was performed on the IAM, BFL and CVL databases. They have shown that, in the most
extreme case, the recognition rate obtained using the "document filter" protocol drops from 81.80%
to 50.37%.
