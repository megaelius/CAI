Information-theoretically secure (ITS) authentication is needed in Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD). In this paper, we study security of an ITS authentication scheme proposed by Wegman &
Carter, in the case of partially known authentication key. This scheme uses a new authentication
key in each authentication attempt, to select a hash function from an Almost Strongly Universal$_2$
hash function family. The partial knowledge of the attacker is measured as the trace distance between
the authentication key distribution and the uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in
QKD. We provide direct proofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in
the information-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability as used in
the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the authentication procedure has a
failure probability $\epsilon$ and the authentication key has an $\epsilon'$ trace distance to
the uniform, then under ITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic message-tag
pair is only bounded by $\epsilon+|\mT|\epsilon'$, where $|\mT|$ is the size of the set of tags.
Furthermore, the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and the uniform increases
to $|\mT|\epsilon'$ after having seen an authentic message-tag pair. Despite this, we are able
to prove directly that the authenticated channel is indistinguishable from an (ideal) authentic
channel (the desired functionality), except with probability less than $\epsilon+\epsilon'$.
This proves that the scheme is ($\epsilon+\epsilon'$)-UC-secure, without using the composability
theorem.
