Due to the growth of video data on Internet, automatic video analysis has gained a lot of attention
from academia as well as companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google. In this paper, we examine
the robustness of video analysis algorithms in adversarial settings. Specifically, we propose
targeted attacks on two fundamental classes of video analysis algorithms, namely video classification
and shot detection. We show that an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that a human
observer would perceive the content of the original video, but the video analysis algorithm will
return the adversary's desired outputs. We then apply the attacks on the recently released Google
Cloud Video Intelligence API. The API takes a video file and returns the video labels (objects within
the video), shot changes (scene changes within the video) and shot labels (description of video
events over time). Through experiments, we show that the API generates video and shot labels by processing
only the first frame of every second of the video. Hence, an adversary can deceive the API to output
only her desired video and shot labels by periodically inserting an image into the video at the rate
of one frame per second. We also show that the pattern of shot changes returned by the API can be mostly
recovered by an algorithm that compares the histograms of consecutive frames. Based on our equivalent
model, we develop a method for slightly modifying the video frames, in order to deceive the API into
generating our desired pattern of shot changes. We perform extensive experiments with different
videos and show that our attacks are consistently successful across videos with different characteristics.
At the end, we propose introducing randomness to video analysis algorithms as a countermeasure
to our attacks.
