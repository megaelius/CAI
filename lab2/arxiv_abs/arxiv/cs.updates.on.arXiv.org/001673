Texture analysis is a well-known research topic in computer vision and image processing and has
many applications. Gradient-based texture methods have become popular in classification problems.
For the first time we extend a well-known gradient-based method, Co-occurrence Histograms of Oriented
Gradients (CoHOG) to extract texture features from 2D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Unlike
the original CoHOG method, we use the whole image instead of sub-regions for feature calculation.
Also, we use a larger neighborhood size. Gradient orientations of the image pixels are calculated
using Sobel, Gaussian Derivative (GD) and Local Frequency Descriptor Gradient (LFDG) operators.
The extracted feature vector size is very large and classification using a large number of similar
features does not provide the best results. In our proposed method, for the first time to our best
knowledge, only a minimum number of significant features are selected using area under the receiver
operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) thresholds with <= 0.01. In this paper, we apply the proposed
method to classify Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients from the controls. It is observed
that selected texture features from downsampled images are significantly different between patients
and controls. These features are used in a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier to determine
the classification accuracy. Optimal sensitivity and specificity are also calculated. Three
different cohort datasets are used in the experiments. The performance of the proposed method using
three gradient operators and two different neighborhood sizes is analyzed. Region based analysis
is performed to demonstrate that significant changes between patients and controls are limited
to the motor cortex.
