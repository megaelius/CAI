In this paper we discuss a level set approach for the identification of an unknown boundary in a computational
domain. The problem takes the form of a Bernoulli problem where only the Dirichlet datum is known
on the boundary that is to be identified, but additional information on the Neumann condition is
available on the known part of the boundary. The approach uses a classical constrained optimization
problem, where a cost functional is minimized with respect to the unknown boundary, the position
of which is defined implicitly by a level set function. To solve the optimization problem a steepest
descent algorithm using shape derivatives is applied. In each iteration the cut finite element
method is used to obtain high accuracy approximations of the pde-model constraint for a given level
set configuration without re-meshing. We consider three different shape derivatives. First the
classical one, derived using the continuous optimization problem (optimize then discretize).
Then the functional is first discretized using the CutFEM method and the shape derivative is evaluated
on the finite element functional (discretize then optimize). Finally we consider a third approach,
also using a discretized functional. In this case we do not perturb the domain, but consider a so-called
boundary value correction method, where a small correction to the boundary position may be included
in the weak boundary condition. Using this correction the shape derivative may be obtained by perturbing
a distance parameter in the discrete variational formulation. The theoretical discussion is illustrated
with a series of numerical examples showing that all three approaches produce similar result on
the proposed Bernoulli problem.
