With the increasing digital services demand, performance and power-efficiency become vital requirements
for digital circuits and systems. However, the enabling CMOS technology scaling has been facing
significant challenges of device uncertainties, such as process, voltage, and temperature variations.
To ensure system reliability, worst-case corner assumptions are usually made in each design level.
However, the over-pessimistic worst-case margin leads to unnecessary power waste and performance
loss as high as 2.2x. Since optimizations are traditionally confined to each specific level, those
safe margins can hardly be properly exploited. To tackle the challenge, it is therefore advised
in this Ph.D. thesis to perform a cross-layer optimization for digital signal processing circuits
and systems, to achieve a global balance of power consumption and output quality. To conclude, the
traditional over-pessimistic worst-case approach leads to huge power waste. In contrast, the
adaptive voltage scaling approach saves power (25% for the CORDIC application) by providing a just-needed
supply voltage. The power saving is maximized (46% for CORDIC) when a more aggressive voltage over-scaling
scheme is applied. These sparsely occurred circuit errors produced by aggressive voltage over-scaling
are mitigated by higher level error resilient designs. For functions like FFT and CORDIC, smart
error mitigation schemes were proposed to enhance reliability (soft-errors and timing-errors,
respectively). Applications like Massive MIMO systems are robust against lower level errors,
thanks to the intrinsically redundant antennas. This property makes it applicable to embrace digital
hardware that trades quality for power savings.
