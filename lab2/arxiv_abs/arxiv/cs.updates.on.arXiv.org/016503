In the current era, an increasing number of machine learning models is generated for the automation
of industrial processes. To that end, machine learning models are trained using historical data
of each single asset leading to the development of asset-based models. To elevate machine learning
models to a higher level of learning capability, domain adaptation has opened the door for extracting
relevant patterns from several assets combined together. In this research we are focusing on translating
the specific asset-based historical data (source domain) into data corresponding to one reference
asset (target domain), leading to the creation of a multi-assets global dataset required for training
domain invariant generic machine learning models. This research is conducted to apply domain adaptation
to the ironmaking industry, and particularly for the creation of a domain invariant dataset by gathering
data from different blast furnaces. The blast furnace data is characterized by multivariate time
series. Domain adaptation for multivariate time series data hasn't been covered extensively in
the literature. We propose MTS-CycleGAN, an algorithm for Multivariate Time Series data based
on CycleGAN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time CycleGAN is applied on multivariate
time series data. Our contribution is the integration in the CycleGAN architecture of a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM)-based AutoEncoder (AE) for the generator and a stacked LSTM-based discriminator,
together with dedicated extended features extraction mechanisms. MTS-CycleGAN is validated
using two artificial datasets embedding the complex temporal relations between variables reflecting
the blast furnace process. MTS-CycleGAN is successfully learning the mapping between both artificial
multivariate time series datasets, allowing an efficient translation from a source to a target
artificial blast furnace dataset.
