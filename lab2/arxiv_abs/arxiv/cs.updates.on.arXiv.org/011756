Spatial modulation (SM) has proven to be a promising multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technique
which provides high energy efficiency and reduces system complexity. In SM, only one transmitter
is active at any given time while the rest of them remain silent. The index of the active transmitter
carries information. This spatial information is in addition to the data carried by the constellation
symbols in the signal domain. Therefore, SM increases the transmission rate of the communication
system compared to single-input-single-output and space-time block coding (STBC)-MIMO. For
signal domain data encoding, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely
adopted. The key benefits in multi-carrier intensity-modulation and direct-detection (IM/DD)
systems are: i) the capability to achieve high spectral efficiency and ii) the ability to effectively
mitigate direct-current (DC) wander effects and the impact of ambient light. However, current
off-the shelf light emitting diodes (LEDs) which are used as transmit entities are primarily bandwidth
limited. Thus, there are benefits of combining SM and OFDM to enhance transmission speeds while
maintaining low complexity. In this paper, the two most common OFDM-based SM types, namely frequency
domain SM (FD-SM) and time domain SM (TD-SM), are investigated for optical wireless communications
(OWC). Moreover, proof-ofconcept experimental results are presented to showcase practical feasibility
of both techniques. The obtained results are also compared with Monte Carlo simulations. The results
show that TDSM with an optimal maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detector significantly
outperforms FD-SM. It can be inferred from the results that TD SM is a strong candidate among OFDM-based
optical SM systems for future optical IM/DD wireless communication systems.
