Goal: As the Coronavirus Pandemic of 2019/2020 unfolds, a COVID-19 'Immunity Passport' has been
mooted as a way to enable individuals to return back to work or be admitted to current off-limits locations.
While the quality of antibody testing and the likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue
to be researched, we address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving
certification, both for COVID-19 immunity and in general. Methods: We developed a prototype mobile
phone app and requisite distributed server architecture that facilitates instant verification
of tamper-proof test results. Personally identifiable information is only stored at the user's
discretion, and the app allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result
with no other personal information revealed. Behind the scenes it relies upon (a) the 2019 World
Wide Web Consortium standard called 'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized
personal data platform 'Solid', and (c) a consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our
mobile phone app and distributed server architecture enable the mixture of verifiability and privacy
in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and digital signatures, generalized to avoid
restrictive ownership of sensitive digital keys and/or data. For the test certificate Holder,
Issuer (e.g. doctor, pharmacy) and Verifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes
only minutes to use. Conclusions: The app and distributed server architecture offer a prototype
proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically, and in effect 'waiting in the
wings' for the biological issues, plus key ethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be
resolved.
