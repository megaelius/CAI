We address the following dynamic version of the school choice question: a city, named City, admits
students in two temporally-separated rounds, denoted $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$.
In round $\mathcal{R}_1$, the capacity of each school is fixed but in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, the
City is happy to allocate extra seats to specific schools per the recommendation of the mechanism;
in turn, the latter has to meet specified requirements. We study three natural settings of this model,
with the requirements getting increasingly more stringent. For Settings I and II, we give pairs
of polynomial time mechanisms $(\mathcal{M}_1, \mathcal{M}_2)$ which, besides addressing the
specific requirements, find stable matchings, are dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC)
w.r.t. reporting preference lists of students, and never break, in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, a match
created in round $\mathcal{R}_1$. In Setting III, the mechanism needs to deal with residents of
the City who try to game the system by not participating in round $\mathcal{R}_1$ and only showing
up in round $\mathcal{R}_2$, in addition to gaming by misreporting preference lists. For this setting,
we need to introduce the notion of a {\em non-oblivious mechanism:} such a mechanism needs to know
the preference lists of {\em all} students who reside in the City, including the ones who don't participate
in round $\mathcal{R}_1$. Further, we need to weaken DSIC to mechanisms in which truth-telling
is a Nash equilibrium; we call these ICNE mechanisms. After establishing, via two impossibility
results, that the strongest result we can hope to obtain for Setting III is a pair of non-oblivious,
stability-preserving, ICNE mechanisms, we present such a pair. Both mechanisms of the pair run
in polynomial time.
