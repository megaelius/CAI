The literature about history matching is vast and despite the impressive number of methods proposed
and the significant progresses reported in the last decade, conditioning reservoir models to dynamic
data is still a challenging task. Ensemble-based methods are among the most successful and efficient
techniques currently available for history matching. These methods are usually able to achieve
reasonable data matches, especially if an iterative formulation is employed. However, they sometimes
fail to preserve the geological realism of the model, which is particularly evident in reservoir
with complex facies distributions. This occurs mainly because of the Gaussian assumptions inherent
in these methods. This fact has encouraged an intense research activity to develop parameterizations
for facies history matching. Despite the large number of publications, the development of robust
parameterizations for facies remains an open problem. Deep learning techniques have been delivering
impressive results in a number of different areas and the first applications in data assimilation
in geoscience have started to appear in literature. The present paper reports the current results
of our investigations on the use of deep neural networks towards the construction of a continuous
parameterization of facies which can be used for data assimilation with ensemble methods. Specifically,
we use a convolutional variational autoencoder and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation.
We tested the parameterization in three synthetic history-matching problems with channelized
facies. We focus on this type of facies because they are among the most challenging to preserve after
the assimilation of data. The parameterization showed promising results outperforming previous
methods and generating well-defined channelized facies.
