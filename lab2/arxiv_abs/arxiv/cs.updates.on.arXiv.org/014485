The main goal of our research is to develop an effective method with a wide range of applications for
the reconstruction of random heterogeneous microstructures with compact inclusions of any shape.
The devised approach uses multi-scale extended entropic descriptors (ED) for finite-sized objects.
This technique is an innovative development of previously elaborated entropy methods for statistical
reconstruction. For the sake of simplicity, we discuss a two-dimensional case, but this method
can be generalized into three dimensions. At the first stage, the developed procedure creates a
set of black synthetic clusters that serve as surrogate inclusions. The clusters have the same individual
areas and interfaces as their target counterparts, but random shapes. Then, from a given number
of easy-to-generate synthetic cluster configurations, we choose the one with the lowest value
of the cost function defined by us using extended ED. At the second stage, we make a significant change
in the standard technique of simulated annealing (SA). Instead of swapping pixels of different
phases, we randomly move each of the selected synthetic clusters within the allowed range of step
length if finally it is not in contact with other clusters. To verify our method, we analyze a sample
selected from the literature dealing with silica randomly dispersed in a rubber matrix. The results
show that our method provides convincing realizations for this type of complex microstructures.
The advantages of the two-stage reconstruction (TSR) include the ease of obtaining synthetic microstructures,
very low computational costs and satisfactory mapping in the statistical context of inclusion
shapes. Finally, the simplicity of TSR should greatly facilitate independent applications.
