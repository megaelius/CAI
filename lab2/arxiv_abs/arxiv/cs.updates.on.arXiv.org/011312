In this paper, we propose accurate and efficient finite difference methods to discretize the two-
and three-dimensional fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ ($0 < \alpha < 2$)
in hypersingular integral form. The proposed finite difference methods provide a fractional analogue
of the central difference schemes to the fractional Laplacian, and as $\alpha \to 2^-$, they collapse
to the central difference schemes of the classical Laplace operator $-\Delta$. We prove that our
methods are consistent if $u \in C^{\lfloor\alpha\rfloor, \alpha-\lfloor\alpha\rfloor+\epsilon}({\mathbb
R}^d)$, and the local truncation error is ${\mathcal O}(h^\epsilon)$, with $\epsilon > 0$ a small
constant and $\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$ denoting the floor function. If $u \in C^{2+\lfloor\alpha\rfloor,
\alpha-\lfloor\alpha\rfloor+\epsilon}({\mathbb R}^d)$, they can achieve the second order
of accuracy for any $\alpha \in (0, 2)$. These results hold for any dimension $d \ge 1$ and thus improve
the existing error estimates for the finite difference method of the one-dimensional fractional
Laplacian. Extensive numerical experiments are provided and confirm our analytical results.
We then apply our method to solve the fractional Poisson problems and the fractional Allen-Cahn
equations. Numerical simulations suggest that to achieve the second order of accuracy, the solution
of the fractional Poisson problem should {\it at most} satisfy $u \in C^{1,1}({\mathbb R}^d)$.
One merit of our methods is that they yield a multilevel Toeplitz stiffness matrix, an appealing
property for the development of fast algorithms via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Our studies
of the two- and three-dimensional fractional Allen-Cahn equations demonstrate the efficiency
of our methods in solving the high-dimensional fractional problems.
