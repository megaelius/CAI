A model and expansion plan have been developed to optimally determine microgrid designs as they
evolve to dynamically react to changing conditions and to exploit energy storage capabilities.
In the wake of the highly electrified future ahead of us, the role of energy storage is crucial wherever
distributed generation is abundant, such as microgrid settings. Given the variety of storage options
that are recently becoming more economical, determining which type of storage technology to invest
in, along with the appropriate timing and capacity becomes a critical research question. In problems
where the investment timing is of high priority, like this one, developing analytical and systematic
frameworks for rigorously considering these issues is indispensable. From a business perspective,
these strategic frameworks will aim to optimize the process of investment planning, by leveraging
novel approaches and by capturing all the problem details that traditional approaches are unable
to. Reinforcement learning algorithms have recently proven to be successful in problems where
sequential decision-making is inherent. In the operations planning area, these algorithms are
already used but mostly in short-term problems with well-defined constraints and low levels of
uncertainty modeling. On the contrary, in this work, we expand and tailor these techniques to long-term
investment planning by utilizing model-free approaches, like the Q-learning algorithm, combined
with simulation-based models. We find that specific types of energy storage units, including the
vanadium-redox battery, can be expected to be at the core of the future microgrid applications,
and therefore, require further attention. Another key finding is that the optimal storage capacity
threshold for a system depends heavily on the price movements of the available storage units in the
market.
