The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoTs) allows heterogeneous embedded smart devices to collaboratively
provide intelligent services with or without human intervention. While leveraging the large-scale
IoT-based applications like Smart Gird and Smart Cities, IoT also incurs more concerns on privacy
and security. Among the top security challenges that IoTs face is that access authorization is critical
in resource and information protection over IoTs. Traditional access control approaches, like
Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control
(ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable, manageable and efficient mechanisms to meet requirement
of IoT systems. The extraordinary large number of nodes, heterogeneity as well as dynamicity, necessitate
more fine-grained, lightweight mechanisms for IoT devices. In this paper, a federated capability-based
access control (FedCAC) framework is proposed to enable an effective access control processes
to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. An identity-based capability
token management strategy is presented, which involves registering, propagation and revocation
of the access authorization. Through delegating centralized authorization decision-making
policy to local domain delegator, the access authorization process is locally conducted on the
service provider that integrates situational awareness (SAW) and customized contextual conditions.
Implemented and tested on both resources-constrained devices, like smart sensors and Raspberry
PI, and non-resource-constrained devices, like laptops and smart phones, our experimental results
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed FedCAC approach to offer a scalable, lightweight and
fine-grained access control solution to IoT systems connected to a system network.
