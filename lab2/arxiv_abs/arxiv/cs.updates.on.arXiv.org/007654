This work investigates the problem of efficiently learning discriminative low-dimensional representations
of multiclass large-scale image objects. We propose a generic deep learning approach by taking
advantages of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), sparse dictionary learning, and orthogonal
projections. CNN is not only powerful on feature extraction, but also robust to spatial variance
and changes. Sparse dictionary learning is well known for disentangling nonlinear underlying
discriminative factors in data. The orthogonal projection is a notable efficient tool to project
multi-class data onto low dimensional discriminative subspace. The proposed procedure can be
summarized as follows. At first, a CNN is employed to extract high-dimensional (HD) preliminary
convolutional features. Secondly, to avoid the high computational cost of direct sparse coding
on HD CNN features, we present to learn sparse representation (SR) in an orthogonal projected space
over a taskdriven sparsifying dictionary. We then exploit the discriminative projection on SR.
The whole learning process is treated as a joint optimization problem of trace quotient maximization,
which involves the CNN parameters, the orthogonal projection on CNN features, the dictionary and
the discriminative projection on sparse codes. The related cost function is well defined on product
manifold of the Stiefel manifold, the Oblique manifold, and the Grassmann manifold. It is optimized
via a geometrical stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Finally, the quality of dictionary and
projections learned by the proposed approach is further investigated in terms of image classification.
The experimental results show that the approach can achieve a strongly competitive performance
with state-of-the-art image classification methods.
