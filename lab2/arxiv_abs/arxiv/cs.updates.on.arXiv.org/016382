Background: Pull request based development, which is a norm for the social coding platforms, entails
the challenge of evaluating the contributions of, often unfamiliar, developers from across the
open source ecosystem and, conversely, submitting a contribution to a project with unfamiliar
maintainers. Previous studies suggest that the decision of accepting or rejecting a pull request
may be influenced by a diverging set of technical and social factors, and often focus on relatively
few projects, do not consider ecosystem-wide measures or the possibly non-monotonic shapes of
the relationship between the predictors and PR acceptance. Aim: Our objective is to shed light on
this important decision making process by testing which measures significantly affect the probability
of pull request acceptance on a significant fraction of a large ecosystem, rank them by their relative
importance in predicting if a pull request will be accepted, and determine the shape of the functions
that map each predictor to the pull request acceptance probability. Method: We proposed seven hypotheses
regarding which technical and social factors might affect PR acceptance and created 17 measures
based on these hypotheses. Our dataset consisted of 470,925 pull requests from 3349 popular NPM
packages and 79,128 GitHub users who created those pull requests. We tested which of the measures
affect pull request acceptance and ranked the measures found to be significant by their importance
in a predictive model. Result: None of the seven hypotheses were rejected and 15 of the 17 measures
were found to matter, including five novel ecosystem-wide measures, with the predictive model
having an AUC of 0.94. We discovered that only four predictors have a linear influence on the pull
request acceptance probability while others showed a more complicated response.
