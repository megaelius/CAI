Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful framework for data-efficiently
learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced
function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework.
In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework -- what we call the objective
mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second,
often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective
mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t.~the likelihood of the one-step ahead
prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example,
this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do
not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not
be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments,
we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions
is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation
in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed.
We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training.
Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing
this issue.
