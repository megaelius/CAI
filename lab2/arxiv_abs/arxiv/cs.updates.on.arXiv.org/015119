Precision agriculture is considered to be a fundamental approach in pursuing a low-input, high-efficiency,
and sustainable kind of agriculture when performing site-specific management practices. To achieve
this objective, a reliable and updated description of the local status of crops is required. Remote
sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a valuable tool in crop mapping,
monitoring, and diseases assessment. However, freely available satellite imagery with low or
moderate resolutions showed some limits in specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops
are grown by rows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite's output could be biased by intra-row
covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper presents a novel satellite
imagery refinement framework, based on a deep learning technique which exploits information properly
derived from high resolution images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multispectral
sensors. To train the convolutional neural network, only a single UAV-driven dataset is required,
making the proposed approach simple and cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga d'Alba (Northern
Italy) was chosen as a case study for validation purposes. Refined satellite-driven normalized
difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, acquired in four different periods during the vine growing
season, were shown to better describe crop status with respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis
and ANOVA. In addition, using a K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard vigor maps were profitably
derived from the NDVI maps, which are a valuable tool for growers.
