Micro Abstract: A recent study from GLOBOCAN disclosed that during 2018 two million women worldwide
had been diagnosed from breast cancer. This study presents a computer-aided diagnosis system based
on convolutional neural networks as an alternative diagnosis methodology for breast cancer diagnosis
with thermal images. Experimental results showed that lower false-positives and false-negatives
classification rates are obtained when data pre-processing and data augmentation techniques
are implemented in these thermal images. Background: There are many types of breast cancer screening
techniques such as, mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound and blood sample tests,
which require either, expensive devices or personal qualified. Currently, some countries still
lack access to these main screening techniques due to economic, social or cultural issues. The objective
of this study is to demonstrate that computer-aided diagnosis(CAD) systems based on convolutional
neural networks (CNN) are faster, reliable and robust than other techniques. Methods: We performed
a study of the influence of data pre-processing, data augmentation and database size versus a proposed
set of CNN models. Furthermore, we developed a CNN hyper-parameters fine-tuning optimization
algorithm using a tree parzen estimator. Results: Among the 57 patients database, our CNN models
obtained a higher accuracy (92\%) and F1-score (92\%) that outperforms several state-of-the-art
architectures such as ResNet50, SeResNet50 and Inception. Also, we demonstrated that a CNN model
that implements data-augmentation techniques reach identical performance metrics in comparison
with a CNN that uses a database up to 50\% bigger. Conclusion: This study highlights the benefits
of data augmentation and CNNs in thermal breast images. Also, it measures the influence of the database
size in the performance of CNNs.
