Competitive equilibrium is a central concept in economics with numerous applications beyond markets,
such as scheduling, fair allocation of goods, or bandwidth distribution in networks. Computation
of competitive equilibria has received a significant amount of interest in algorithmic game theory,
mainly for the prominent case of Fisher markets. Natural and decentralized processes like tatonnement
and proportional response dynamics (PRD) converge quickly towards equilibrium in large classes
of Fisher markets. Almost all of the literature assumes that the market is a static environment and
that the parameters of agents and goods do not change over time. In contrast, many large real-world
markets are subject to frequent and dynamic changes. In this paper, we provide the first provable
performance guarantees of discrete-time tatonnement and PRD in markets that are subject to perturbation
over time. We analyze the prominent class of Fisher markets with CES utilities and quantify the impact
of changes in supplies of goods, budgets of agents, and utility functions of agents on the convergence
of tatonnement to market equilibrium. Since the equilibrium becomes a dynamic object and will rarely
be reached, our analysis provides bounds expressing the distance to equilibrium that will be maintained
via tatonnement and PRD updates. Our results indicate that in many cases, tatonnement and PRD follow
the equilibrium rather closely and quickly recover conditions of approximate market clearing.
Our approach can be generalized to analyzing a general class of Lyapunov dynamical systems with
changing system parameters, which might be of independent interest.
