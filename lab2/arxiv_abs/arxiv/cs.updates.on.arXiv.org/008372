Online image hashing has received increasing research attention recently, which receives large-scale
data in a streaming manner to update the hash functions on-the-fly. Its key challenge lies in the
difficulty in balancing the learning timeliness and model accuracy. To this end, most works exploit
a supervised setting, i.e., using class labels to boost the hashing performance, which defects
in two aspects: First, large amount of training batches are required to learn up-to-date hash functions,
which however largely increase the learning complexity. Second, strong constraints, e.g., orthogonal
or similarity preserving, are used, which are however typically relaxed and lead to large accuracy
drop. To handle the above challenges, in this paper, a novel supervised online hashing scheme termed
Hadamard Matrix Guided Online Hashing (HMOH) is proposed. Our key innovation lies in the construction
and usage of Hadamard matrix, which is an orthogonal binary matrix and is built via Sylvester method.
To release the need of strong constraints, we regard each column of Hadamard matrix as the target
code for each class label, which by nature satisfies several desired properties of hashing codes.
To accelerate the online training, the LSH is first adopted to align the length of target code and
the to-be-learned binary code. And then, we treat the learning of hash functions as a set of binary
classification problems to fit the assigned target code. Finally, we propose to ensemble the learned
models in all rounds to maximally preserve the information of past streaming data. The superior
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated through extensive experiments
on three widely-used datasets comparing to various state-of-the-art methods.
