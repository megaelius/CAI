In hackathons, small teams work together over a specified period of time to complete a project of
interest. Such time-bounded hackathon-style events have become increasingly popular across
different domains in recent years. Collegiate hackathons, just one of the many variants of hackathons,
that are supported by the largest hackathon league (https://mlh.io/) alone attract over 65,000
participants among more than 200 events each year. Variously known as data dives, codefests, hack-days,
sprints, edit-a-thons, mapathons, and so on, such events vary depending on different audiences
and with divergent aims: for example, whether teams know each other beforehand, whether the event
is structured as a competition with prizes, whether the event is open or requires membership or invitations,
and whether the desired outcome is primarily a product innovation, learning a new skill, forming
a community around a cause, solving a technical problem that requires intensive focus by a group,
or just having fun. Taken together, hackathons offer new opportunities and challenges for collaboration
by affording explicit, predictable, time-bounded spaces for collaborative work and engaging
with new audiences. With the goal of discussing opportunities and challenges surrounding hackathons
of different kinds, this one-day workshop brought together researchers, experienced event organizers,
and practitioners to share and discuss their practical experiences. Empirical insights from studying
these events may help position the CHI community to better study, plan and design hackathon-style
events as socio-technical systems that support new modes of production and collaboration.
