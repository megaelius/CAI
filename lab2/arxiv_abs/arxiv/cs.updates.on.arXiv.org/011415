Biomedical data are widely accepted in developing prediction models for identifying a specific
tumor, drug discovery and classification of human cancers. However, previous studies usually
focused on different classifiers, and overlook the class imbalance problem in real-world biomedical
datasets. There are a lack of studies on evaluation of data pre-processing techniques, such as resampling
and feature selection, on imbalanced biomedical data learning. The relationship between data
pre-processing techniques and the data distributions has never been analysed in previous studies.
This article mainly focuses on reviewing and evaluating some popular and recently developed resampling
and feature selection methods for class imbalance learning. We analyse the effectiveness of each
technique from data distribution perspective. Extensive experiments have been done based on five
classifiers, four performance measures, eight learning techniques across twenty real-world
datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) resampling and feature selection techniques exhibit
better performance using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. However, resampling and Feature
Selection techniques perform poorly when using C4.5 decision tree and Linear discriminant analysis
classifiers; (2) for datasets with different distributions, techniques such as Random undersampling
and Feature Selection perform better than other data pre-processing methods with T Location-Scale
distribution when using SVM and KNN (K-nearest neighbours) classifiers. Random oversampling
outperforms other methods on Negative Binomial distribution using Random Forest classifier with
lower level of imbalance ratio; (3) Feature Selection outperforms other data pre-processing methods
in most cases, thus, Feature Selection with SVM classifier is the best choice for imbalanced biomedical
data learning.
