Recently, an ingenious protocol called Algorand has been proposed to overcome these limitations.
Algorand uses an innovative process - called cryptographic sortition - to securely and unpredictably
elect a set of voters from the network periodically. These voters are responsible for reaching consensus
through a Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol on one block per time, guaranteeing an overwhelming
probability of linearity of the blockchain. In this paper, we present a security analysis of Algorand.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first security analysis as well as the first formal study on
Algorand. We designed an attack scenario in which a group of malicious users tries to break the protocol,
or at least limiting it to a reduced partition of network users, by exploiting a possible security
flaw in the messages validation process of the BA. Since the source code or an official simulator
for Algorand was not available at the time of our study, we created a simulator (which is available
on request) to implement the protocol and assess the feasibility of our attack scenario. Our attack
requires the attacker to have a trivial capability of establishing multiple connections with targeted
nodes and costs practically nothing to the attacker. Our results show that it is possible to slow
down the message validation process on honest nodes, which eventually forces them to choose default
values on the consensus; leaving the targeted nodes behind in the chain as compared to the non-attacked
nodes. Even though our results are subject to the real implementation assumption, the core concept
of our attack remains valid.
