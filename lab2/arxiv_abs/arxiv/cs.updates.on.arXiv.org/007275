We investigate routing on networks modeled as multiple access channels, when packets are injected
continually. There is an energy cap understood as a bound on the number of stations that can be switched
on simultaneously. Each packet is injected into some station and needs to be delivered to its destination
station via the channel. A station has to be switched on in order to receive a packet when it is heard
on the channel. Each station manages when it is switched on and off by way of a programmable wakeup
mechanism, which is scheduled by a routing algorithm. Packet injection is governed by adversarial
models that determine upper bounds on injection rates and burstiness. We develop deterministic
distributed routing algorithms and assess their performance in the worst-case sense. One of the
algorithms maintains bounded queues for the maximum injection rate 1 subject only to the energy
cap 3. This energy cap is provably optimal, in that obtaining the same throughput with the energy
cap 2 is impossible. We give algorithms subject to the minimum energy cap 2 that have latency polynomial
in the total number of stations n for each fixed adversary of injection rate less than 1. An algorithm
is k-energy-oblivious if at most k stations are switched on in a round and for each station the rounds
when it will be switched on are determined in advance. We give a k-energy-oblivious algorithm that
has packet delay O(n) for adversaries of injection rates less than (k-1)/(n-1), and show that there
is no k-energy-oblivious stable algorithm against adversaries with injection rates greater than
k/n. We give a k-energy-oblivious algorithm routing directly that has latency O(n^2/k) for adversaries
of sufficiently small injection rates that are O(k^2/n^2). We show that no k-energy-oblivious
algorithm routing directly can be stable against adversaries with injection rates greater than
k(k-1)/n(n-1).
