Tomographic imaging has benefited from advances in X-ray sources, detectors and optics to enable
novel observations in science, engineering and medicine. These advances have come with a dramatic
increase of input data in the form of faster frame rates, larger fields of view or higher resolution,
so high performance solutions are currently widely used for analysis. Tomographic instruments
can vary significantly from one to another, including the hardware employed for reconstruction:
from single CPU workstations to large scale hybrid CPU/GPU supercomputers. Flexibility on the
software interfaces and reconstruction engines are also highly valued to allow for easy development
and prototyping. This paper presents a novel software framework for tomographic analysis that
tackles all aforementioned requirements. The proposed solution capitalizes on the increased
performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication and exploits multi-CPU and GPU reconstruction
over MPI. The solution is implemented in Python and relies on CuPy for fast GPU operators and CUDA
kernel integration, and on SciPy for CPU sparse matrix computation. As opposed to previous tomography
solutions that are tailor-made for specific use cases or hardware, the proposed software is designed
to provide flexible, portable and high-performance operators that can be used for continuous integration
at different production environments, but also for prototyping new experimental settings or for
algorithmic development. The experimental results demonstrate how our implementation can even
outperform state-of-the-art software packages used at advanced X-ray sources worldwide.
