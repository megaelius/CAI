Renewable energy has achieved high penetration rates in many areas, leading to curtailment, especially
if existing network infrastructure is insufficient and energy generated cannot be exported. In
this context, Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) face a significant knowledge gap about how
to implement curtailment rules that achieve desired operational objectives, but at the same time
minimise disruption and economic losses for renewable generators. In this work, we study the properties
of several curtailment rules widely used in UK renewable energy projects, and their effect on the
viability of renewable generation investment. Moreover, we propose a new curtailment rule which
guarantees fair allocation of curtailment amongst all generators with minimal disruption. Another
key knowledge gap faced by DNOs is how to incentivise private network upgrades, especially in settings
where several generators can use the same line against the payment of a transmission fee. In this
work, we provide a solution to this problem by using tools from algorithmic game theory. Specifically,
this setting can be modelled as a Stackelberg game between the private transmission line investor
and local renewable generators, who are required to pay a transmission fee to access the line. We
provide a method for computing the empirical equilibrium of this game, using a model that captures
the stochastic nature of renewable energy generation and demand. Finally, we use the practical
setting of a grid reinforcement project from the UK and a large dataset of wind speed measurements
and demand to validate our model. We show that charging a transmission fee as a proportion of the feed-in
tariff price between 15%-75% would allow both investors to implement their projects and achieve
desirable distribution of the profit.
