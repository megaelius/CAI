Cloud services have been widely employed in IT industry and scientific research. By using Cloud
services users can move computing tasks and data away from local computers to remote datacenters.
By accessing Internet-based services over lightweight and mobile devices, users deploy diversified
Cloud applications on powerful machines. The key drivers towards this paradigm for the scientific
computing field include the substantial computing capacity, on-demand provisioning and cross-platform
interoperability. To fully harness the Cloud services for scientific computing, however, we need
to design an application-specific platform to help the users efficiently migrate their applications.
In this, we propose a Cloud service platform for symbolic-numeric computation - SNC. SNC allows
the Cloud users to describe tasks as symbolic expressions through C/C++, Python, Java APIs and SNC
script. Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation through using LLVM/JVM is used to compile the user code
to the machine code. We implemented the SNC design and tested a wide range of symbolic-numeric computation
applications (including nonlinear minimization, Monte Carlo integration, finite element assembly
and multibody dynamics) on several popular cloud platforms (including the Google Compute Engine,
Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, HP Helion and VMWare vCloud). These results demonstrate
that our approach can work across multiple cloud platforms, support different languages and significantly
improve the performance of symbolic-numeric computation using cloud platforms. This offered
a way to stimulate the need for using the cloud computing for the symbolic-numeric computation in
the field of scientific research.
