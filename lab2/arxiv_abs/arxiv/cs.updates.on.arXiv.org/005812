In this paper, we consider the problem of multirotor flying robots physically interacting with
the environment under wind influence. The result are the first algorithms for simultaneous online
estimation of contact and aerodynamic wrenches acting on the robot based on real-world data, without
the need for dedicated sensors. For this purpose, we investigate two model-based techniques for
discriminating between aerodynamic and interaction forces. The first technique is based on aerodynamic
and contact torque models, and uses the external force to estimate wind speed. Contacts are then
detected based on the residual between estimated external torque and expected (modeled) aerodynamic
torque. Upon detecting contact, wind speed is assumed to change very slowly. From the estimated
interaction wrench, we are also able to determine the contact location. This is embedded into a particle
filter framework to further improve contact location estimation. The second algorithm uses the
propeller aerodynamic power and angular speed as measured by the speed controllers to obtain an
estimate of the airspeed. An aerodynamics model is then used to determine the aerodynamic wrench.
Both methods rely on accurate aerodynamics models. Therefore, we evaluate data-driven and physics
based models as well as offline system identification for flying robots. For obtaining ground truth
data we performed autonomous flights in a 3D wind tunnel. Using this data, aerodynamic model selection,
parameter identification, and discrimination between aerodynamic and contact forces could be
done. Finally, the developed methods could serve as useful estimators for interaction control
schemes with simultaneous compensation of wind disturbances.
