We address the fundamental performance issues of template protection (TP) for iris verification.
We base our work on the popular Bloom-Filter templates protection & address the key challenges like
sub-optimal performance and low unlinkability. Specifically, we focus on cases where Bloom-filter
templates results in non-ideal performance due to presence of large degradations within iris images.
Iris recognition is challenged with number of occluding factors such as presence of eye-lashes
within captured image, occlusion due to eyelids, low quality iris images due to motion blur. All
of such degrading factors result in obtaining non-reliable iris codes & thereby provide non-ideal
biometric performance. These factors directly impact the protected templates derived from iris
images when classical Bloom-filters are employed. To this end, we propose and extend our earlier
ideas of Morton-filters for obtaining better and reliable templates for iris. Morton filter based
TP for iris codes is based on leveraging the intra and inter-class distribution by exploiting low-rank
iris codes to derive the stable bits across iris images for a particular subject and also analyzing
the discriminable bits across various subjects. Such low-rank non-noisy iris codes enables realizing
the template protection in a superior way which not only can be used in constrained setting, but also
in relaxed iris imaging. We further extend the work to analyze the applicability to VIS iris images
by employing a large scale public iris image database - UBIRIS(v1 & v2), captured in a unconstrained
setting. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate the applicability of proposed approach and
vet the strengths and weakness. Yet another contribution of this work stems in assessing the security
of the proposed approach where factors of Unlinkability is studied to indicate the antagonistic
nature to relaxed iris imaging scenarios.
