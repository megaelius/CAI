Machine Learning systems rely on data for training, input and ongoing feedback and validation.
Data in the field can come from varied sources, often anonymous or unknown to the ultimate users of
the data. Whenever data is sourced and used, its consumers need assurance that the data accuracy
is as described, that the data has been obtained legitimately, and they need to understand the terms
under which the data is made available so that they can honour them. Similarly, suppliers of data
require assurances that their data is being used legitimately by authorised parties, in accordance
with their terms, and that usage is appropriately recompensed. Furthermore, both parties may want
to agree on a specific set of quality of service (QoS) metrics, which can be used to negotiate service
quality based on cost, and then receive affirmation that data is being supplied within those agreed
QoS levels. Here we present a conceptual architecture which enables data sharing agreements to
be encoded and computationally enforced, remuneration to be made when required, and a trusted audit
trail to be produced for later analysis or reproduction of the environment. Our architecture uses
blockchain-based distributed ledger technology, which can facilitate transactions in situations
where parties do not have an established trust relationship or centralised command and control
structures. We explore techniques to promote faith in the accuracy of the supplied data, and to let
data users determine trade-offs between data quality and cost. Our system is exemplified through
consideration of a case study using multiple data sources from different parties to monitor traffic
levels in urban locations.
