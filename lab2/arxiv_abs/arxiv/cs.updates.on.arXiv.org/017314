We study social networks and focus on covert (also known as hidden) networks, such as terrorist or
criminal networks. Their structures, memberships and activities are illegal. Thus, data about
covert networks is often incomplete and partially incorrect, making interpreting structures
and activities of such networks challenging. For legal reasons, real data about active covert networks
is inaccessible to researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce here a network generator
for synthetic networks that are statistically similar to a real network but void of personal information
about its members. The generator uses statistical data about a real or imagined covert organization
network. It generates randomized instances of the Stochastic Block model of the network groups
but preserves this network organizational structure. The direct use of such anonymized networks
is for training on them the research and analytical tools for finding structure and dynamics of covert
networks. Since these synthetic networks differ in their sets of edges and communities, they can
be used as a new source for network analytics. First, they provide alternative interpretations
of the data about the original network. The distribution of probabilities for these alternative
interpretations enables new network analytics. The analysts can find community structures which
are frequent, therefore stable under perturbations. They may also analyze how the stability changes
with the strength of perturbation. For covert networks, the analysts can quantify statistically
expected outcomes of interdiction. This kind of analytics applies to all complex network in which
the data are incomplete or partially incorrect.
