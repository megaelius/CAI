We consider the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) of a single message out of $K$ messages
from $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases where a cache-enabled user (retriever) of cache-size
$M$ possesses side information in the form of full messages that are partially known to the databases.
In this model, the user and the databases engage in a two-phase scheme, namely, the prefetching phase
where the user acquires side information and the retrieval phase where the user downloads desired
information. In the prefetching phase, the user receives $m_n$ full messages from the $n$th database,
under the cache memory size constraint $\sum_{n=1}^N m_n \leq M$. In the retrieval phase, the user
wishes to retrieve a message such that no individual database learns anything about the identity
of the desired message. In addition, the identities of the side information messages that the user
did not prefetch from a database must remain private against that database. Since the side information
provided by each database in the prefetching phase is known by the providing database and the side
information must be kept private against the remaining databases, we coin this model as \textit{partially
known private side information}. We characterize the capacity of the PIR with partially known private
side information to be $C=\frac{1-\frac{1}{N}}{1-(\frac{1}{N})^{K-M}}$. This result is achievable
via uniform prefetching, i.e., $m_n=\frac{M}{N}$, if $\frac{M}{N} \in \mathbb{N}$. Interestingly,
this result is the same if none of the databases knows any of the prefetched side information, i.e.,
when the side information is obtained externally, a problem posed by Kadhe et al.~and settled by
Chen-Wang-Jafar recently. Therefore, our result implies that there is no loss in using the same
databases for both prefetching and retrieval phases.
