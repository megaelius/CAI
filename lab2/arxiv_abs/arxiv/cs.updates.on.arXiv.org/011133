With the rapid development of mobile-internet technologies, on-demand ride-sourcing services
have become increasingly popular and largely reshaped the way people travel. Demand prediction
is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing
platforms. With accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms
make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations and ride-sharing
vehicle routing, etc. Compared to zone-based demand prediction that has been examined by many previous
studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated
spatial and temporal dependencies among demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge,
we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network
(ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs.
Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean
pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on
the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode
the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used
to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks
to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive
experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed
deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.
