Severe color casts, low contrast and blurriness of underwater images caused by light absorption
and scattering result in a difficult task for exploring underwater environments. Different from
most of previous underwater image enhancement methods that compute light attenuation along object-camera
path through hazy image formation model, we propose a novel jointly wavelength compensation and
dehazing network (JWCDN) that takes into account the wavelength attenuation along surface-object
path and the scattering along object-camera path simultaneously. By embedding a simplified underwater
formation model into generative adversarial network, we can jointly estimates the transmission
map, wavelength attenuation and background light via different network modules, and uses the simplified
underwater image formation model to recover degraded underwater images. Especially, a multi-scale
densely connected encoder-decoder network is proposed to leverage features from multiple layers
for estimating the transmission map. To further improve the recovered image, we use an edge preserving
network module to enhance the detail of the recovered image. Moreover, to train the proposed network,
we propose a novel underwater image synthesis method that generates underwater images with inherent
optical properties of different water types. The synthesis method can simulate the color, contrast
and blurriness appearance of real-world underwater environments simultaneously. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world underwater images demonstrate that the proposed method
yields comparable or better results on both subjective and objective assessments, compared with
several state-of-the-art methods.
