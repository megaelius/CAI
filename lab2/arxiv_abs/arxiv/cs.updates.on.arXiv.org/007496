In the past decade, the usage of mobile devices has gone far beyond simple activities like calling
and texting. Today, smartphones contain multiple embedded sensors and are able to collect useful
sensing data about the user and infer the user's context. The more frequent the sensing, the more
accurate the context. However, continuous sensing results in huge energy consumption, decreasing
the battery's lifetime. We propose a novel approach for cost-aware sensing when performing continuous
latent context detection. The suggested method dynamically determines user's sensors sampling
policy based on three factors: (1) User's last known context; (2) Predicted information loss using
KL-Divergence; and (3) Sensors' sampling costs. The objective function aims at minimizing both
sampling cost and information loss. The method is based on various machine learning techniques
including autoencoder neural networks for latent context detection, linear regression for information
loss prediction, and convex optimization for determining the optimal sampling policy. To evaluate
the suggested method, we performed a series of tests on real-world data recorded at a high-frequency
rate; the data was collected from six mobile phone sensors of twenty users over the course of a week.
Results show that by applying a dynamic sampling policy, our method naturally balances information
loss and energy consumption and outperforms the static approach.% We compared the performance
of our method with another state of the art dynamic sampling method and demonstrate its consistent
superiority in various measures. %Our methods outperformed, and were able to improve we achieved
better results in either sampling cost or information loss, and in some cases we improved both.
