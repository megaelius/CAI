This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying the convolutional neural network (CNN) to
solving the demosaicing problem. The paper presents two CNN models that learn end-to-end mappings
between the mosaic samples and the original image patches with full information. In the case the
Bayer color filter array (CFA) is used, an evaluation with ten competitive methods on popular benchmarks
confirms that the data-driven, automatically learned features by the CNN models are very effective.
Experiments show that the proposed CNN models can perform equally well in both the sRGB space and
the linear space. It is also demonstrated that the CNN model can perform joint denoising and demosaicing.
The CNN model is very flexible and can be easily adopted for demosaicing with any CFA design. We train
CNN models for demosaicing with three different CFAs and obtain better results than existing methods.
With the great flexibility to be coupled with any CFA, we present the first data-driven joint optimization
of the CFA design and the demosaicing method using CNN. Experiments show that the combination of
the automatically discovered CFA pattern and the automatically devised demosaicing method significantly
outperforms the current best demosaicing results. Visual comparisons confirm that the proposed
methods reduce more visual artifacts than existing methods. Finally, we show that the CNN model
is also effective for the more general demosaicing problem with spatially varying exposure and
color and can be used for taking images of higher dynamic ranges with a single shot. The proposed models
and the thorough experiments together demonstrate that CNN is an effective and versatile tool for
solving the demosaicing problem.
