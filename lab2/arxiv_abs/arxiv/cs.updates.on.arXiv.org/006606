Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI) is a well-known rule for fair allocation of resources
among agents with different preferences. It has many advantages, among them is the fact that a CEEI
allocation is both Pareto efficient and envy-free. However, when the resources are indivisible,
a CEEI allocation might not exist even when there are two agents and a single item. In contrast to this
discouraging non-existence result, Babaioff, Nisan and Talgam-Cohen (2017) recently suggested
a new and more encouraging approach to allocation of indivisible items: instead of insisting that
the incomes be equal, they suggest to look at the entire space of possible incomes, and check whether
there exists a competitive equilibrium for almost all income-vectors (CEFAI) --- all income-space
except a subset of measure zero. They show that a CEFAI exists when there are at most 3 items, or when
there are 4 items and two agents. They also show that when there are 5 items and two agents there might
not exist a CEFAI. They leave open the cases of 4 items with three or four agents. This paper presents
a new way to implement a CEFAI, as a subgame-perfect equilibrium of a sequential game. This new implementation
allows us both to offer much simpler solutions to the known cases (at most 3 items, and 4 items with
two agents), and to prove that a CEFAI exists even in the much more difficult case of 4 items and three
agents. Moreover, we prove that a CEFAI might not exist with 4 items and four agents. When the items
to be divided are bads (chores), CEFAI exists for two agents with at most 4 chores, but does not exist
for two agents with 5 chores or with three agents with 3 or more chores. Thus, this paper completes
the characterization of CEFAI existence for monotone preferences.
