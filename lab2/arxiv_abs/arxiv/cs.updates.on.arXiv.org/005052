Social media has become a popular means for people to consume news. Meanwhile, it also enables the
wide dissemination of fake news, i.e., news with intentionally false information, which brings
significant negative effects to the society. Thus, fake news detection is attracting increasing
attention. However, fake news detection is a non-trivial task, which requires multi-source information
such as news content, social context, and dynamic information. First, fake news is written to fool
people, which makes it difficult to detect fake news simply based on news contents. In addition to
news contents, we need to explore social contexts such as user engagements and social behaviors.
For example, a credible user's comment that "this is a fake news" is a strong signal for detecting
fake news. Second, dynamic information such as how fake news and true news propagate and how users'
opinions toward news pieces are very important for extracting useful patterns for (early) fake
news detection and intervention. Thus, comprehensive datasets which contain news content, social
context, and dynamic information could facilitate fake news propagation, detection, and mitigation;
while to the best of our knowledge, existing datasets only contains one or two aspects. Therefore,
in this paper, to facilitate fake news related researches, we provide a fake news data repository
FakeNewsNet, which contains two comprehensive datasets that includes news content, social context,
and dynamic information. We present a comprehensive description of datasets collection, demonstrate
an exploratory analysis of this data repository from different perspectives, and discuss the benefits
of FakeNewsNet for potential applications on fake news study on social media.
