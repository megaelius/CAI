We consider the Relative-Majority Problem (also known as Plurality), in which, given a multi-agent
system where each agent is initially provided an input value out of a set of $k$ possible ones, each
agent is required to eventually compute the input value with the highest frequency in the initial
configuration. We consider the problem in the general Population Protocols model in which, given
an underlying undirected connected graph whose nodes represent the agents, edges are selected
by a globally fair scheduler. The state complexity that is required for solving the Plurality Problem
(i.e., the minimum number of memory states that each agent needs to have in order to solve the problem),
has been a long-standing open problem. The best protocol so far for the general multi-valued case
requires polynomial memory: Salehkaleybar et al. (2015) devised a protocol that solves the problem
by employing $O(k 2^k)$ states per agent, and they conjectured their upper bound to be optimal. On
the other hand, under the strong assumption that agents initially agree on a total ordering of the
initial input values, Gasieniec et al. (2017), provided an elegant logarithmic-memory plurality
protocol. In this work, we refute Salehkaleybar et al.'s conjecture, by providing a plurality protocol
which employs $O(k^{11})$ states per agent. Central to our result is an ordering protocol which
allows to leverage on the plurality protocol by Gasieniec et al., of independent interest. We also
provide a $\Omega(k^2)$-state lower bound on the necessary memory to solve the problem, proving
that the Plurality Problem cannot be solved within the mere memory necessary to encode the output.
