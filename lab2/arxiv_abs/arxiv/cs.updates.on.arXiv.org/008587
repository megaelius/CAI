The assumptions of necessary rationality and necessary knowledge of strategies, also known as
perfect prediction, lead to at most one surviving outcome, immune to the knowledge that the players
have of them. Solutions concepts implementing this approach have been defined on both dynamic games
with perfect information and no ties, the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium, and strategic games
with no ties, the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium. In this paper, we generalize the Perfectly
Transparent Equilibrium to games in extensive form with imperfect information and no ties. Both
the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium and the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium for strategic games
become special cases of this generalized equilibrium concept. The generalized equilibrium, if
there are no ties in the payoffs, is at most unique, and is Pareto-optimal. We also contribute a special-relativistic
interpretation of a subclass of the games in extensive form with imperfect information as a directed
acyclic graph of decisions made by any number of agents, each decision being located at a specific
position in Minkowski spacetime, and the information sets and game structure being derived from
the causal structure. Strategic games correspond to a setup with only spacelike-separated decisions,
and dynamic games to one with only timelike-separated decisions. The generalized Perfectly Transparent
Equilibrium thus characterizes the outcome and payoffs reached in a general setup where decisions
can be located in any generic positions in Minkowski spacetime, under necessary rationality and
necessary knowledge of strategies. We also argue that this provides a directly usable mathematical
framework for the design of extension theories of quantum physics with a weakened free choice assumption.
