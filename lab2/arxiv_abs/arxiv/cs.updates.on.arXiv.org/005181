We address item relocation problems in graphs in this paper. We assume items placed in vertices of
an undirected graph with at most one item per vertex. Items can be moved across edges while various
constraints depending on the type of relocation problem must be satisfied. We introduce a general
problem formulation that encompasses known types of item relocation problems such as multi-agent
path finding (MAPF) and token swapping (TSWAP). In this formulation we express two new types of relocation
problems derived from token swapping that we call token rotation (TROT) and token permutation (TPERM).
Our solving approach for item relocation combines satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) with conflict-based
search (CBS). We interpret CBS in the SMT framework where we start with the basic model and refine
the model with a collision resolution constraint whenever a collision between items occurs in the
current solution. The key difference between the standard CBS and our SMT-based modification of
CBS (SMT-CBS) is that the standard CBS branches the search to resolve the collision while in SMT-CBS
we iteratively add a single disjunctive collision resolution constraint. Experimental evaluation
on several benchmarks shows that the SMT-CBS algorithm significantly outperforms the standard
CBS. We also compared SMT-CBS with a modification of the SAT-based MDD-SAT solver that uses an eager
modeling of item relocation in which all potential collisions are eliminated by constrains in advance.
Experiments show that lazy approach in SMT-CBS produce fewer constraint than MDD-SAT and also achieves
faster solving run-times.
