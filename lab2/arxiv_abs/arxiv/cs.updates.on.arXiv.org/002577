Distributed network optimization algorithms, such as minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and
shortest path, are an active research area in distributed computing. This paper presents a fast
distributed algorithm for such problems in the CONGEST model, on networks that exclude a fixed minor.
On general graphs, many optimization problems, including the ones mentioned above, require $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt
n)$ rounds of communication in the CONGEST model, even if the network graph has a much smaller diameter.
Naturally, the next step in algorithm design is to design efficient algorithms which bypass this
lower bound on a restricted class of graphs. Currently, the only known method of doing so uses the
low-congestion shortcut framework of Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA'16]. Building off of their work,
this paper proves that excluded minor graphs admit high-quality shortcuts, leading to an $\tilde
O(D^2)$ round algorithm for the aforementioned problems, where $D$ is the diameter of the network
graph. To work with excluded minor graph families, we utilize the Graph Structure Theorem of Robertson
and Seymour. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Graph Structure Theorem has been
used for an algorithmic result in the distributed setting. Even though the proof is involved, merely
showing the existence of good shortcuts is sufficient to obtain simple, efficient distributed
algorithms. In particular, the shortcut framework can efficiently construct near-optimal shortcuts
and then use them to solve the optimization problems. This, combined with the very general family
of excluded minor graphs, which includes most other important graph classes, makes this result
of significant interest.
