Finding, identifying and segmenting suspicious cancer metastasized lymph nodes from 3D multi-modality
imaging is a clinical task of paramount importance. In radiotherapy, they are referred to as Lymph
Node Gross Tumor Volume (GTVLN). Determining and delineating the spread of GTVLN is essential in
defining the corresponding resection and irradiating regions for the downstream workflows of
surgical resection and radiotherapy of various cancers. In this work, we propose an effective distance-based
gating approach to simulate and simplify the high-level reasoning protocols conducted by radiation
oncologists, in a divide-and-conquer manner. GTVLN is divided into two subgroups of tumor-proximal
and tumor-distal, respectively, by means of binary or soft distance gating. This is motivated by
the observation that each category can have distinct though overlapping distributions of appearance,
size and other LN characteristics. A novel multi-branch detection-by-segmentation network is
trained with each branch specializing on learning one GTVLN category features, and outputs from
multi-branch are fused in inference. The proposed method is evaluated on an in-house dataset of
$141$ esophageal cancer patients with both PET and CT imaging modalities. Our results validate
significant improvements on the mean recall from $72.5\%$ to $78.2\%$, as compared to previous
state-of-the-art work. The highest achieved GTVLN recall of $82.5\%$ at $20\%$ precision is clinically
relevant and valuable since human observers tend to have low sensitivity (around $80\%$ for the
most experienced radiation oncologists, as reported by literature).
