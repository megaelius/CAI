In symmetric cryptanalysis, the model of superposition queries has led to surprising results,
with many constructions being broken in polynomial time thanks to Simon's period-finding algorithm.
But the practical implications of these attacks remain blurry. In contrast, the results obtained
so far for a quantum adversary making classical queries only are less impressive. In this paper,
we introduce a new quantum algorithm which uses Simon's subroutines in a novel way. We manage to leverage
the algebraic structure of cryptosystems in the context of a quantum attacker limited to classical
queries and offline quantum computations. We obtain improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs
with respect to the current literature, while using only as much hardware requirements (quantum
and classical) as a standard exhaustive search with Grover's algorithm. In particular, we are able
to break the Even-Mansour construction in quantum time $\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$
classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits only. In addition, we improve some previous superposition
attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the same time complexity.
Our approach can be seen in two complementary ways: \emph{reusing} superposition queries during
the iteration of a search using Grover's algorithm, or alternatively, removing the memory requirement
in some quantum attacks based on a collision search, thanks to their algebraic structure. We provide
a list of cryptographic applications, including the Even-Mansour construction, the FX construction,
some Sponge authenticated modes of encryption, and many more.
