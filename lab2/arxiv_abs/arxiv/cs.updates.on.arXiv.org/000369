Given genetic variations and various phenotypical traits, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) features, we consider two important and related tasks in biomedical research: i)to select
genetic and phenotypical markers for disease diagnosis and ii) to identify associations between
genetic and phenotypical data. These two tasks are tightly coupled because underlying associations
between genetic variations and phenotypical features contain the biological basis for a disease.
While a variety of sparse models have been applied for disease diagnosis and canonical correlation
analysis and its extensions have bee widely used in association studies (e.g., eQTL analysis),
these two tasks have been treated separately. To unify these two tasks, we present a new sparse Bayesian
approach for joint association study and disease diagnosis. In this approach, common latent features
are extracted from different data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict
multiple disease severity levels based on Gaussian process ordinal regression; in return, the
disease status is used to guide the discovery of relationships between the data sources. The sparse
projection matrices not only reveal interactions between data sources but also select groups of
biomarkers related to the disease. To learn the model from data, we develop an efficient variational
expectation maximization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves
higher accuracy in both predicting ordinal labels and discovering associations between data sources
than alternative methods. We apply our approach to an imaging genetics dataset for the study of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD). Our method identifies biologically meaningful relationships between genetic variations,
MRI features, and AD status, and achieves significantly higher accuracy for predicting ordinal
AD stages than the competing methods.
