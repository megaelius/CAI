Background: Tools used to appraise the credibility of health information are time-consuming to
apply and require context-specific expertise, limiting their use for quickly identifying and
mitigating the spread of misinformation as it emerges. Our aim was to estimate the proportion of
vaccination-related posts on Twitter are likely to be misinformation, and how unevenly exposure
to misinformation was distributed among Twitter users. Methods: Sampling from 144,878 vaccination-related
web pages shared on Twitter between January 2017 and March 2018, we used a seven-point checklist
adapted from two validated tools to appraise the credibility of a small subset of 474. These were
used to train several classifiers (random forest, support vector machines, and a recurrent neural
network with transfer learning), using the text from a web page to predict whether the information
satisfies each of the seven criteria. Results: Applying the best performing classifier to the 144,878
web pages, we found that 14.4\% of relevant posts to text-based communications were linked to webpages
of low credibility and made up 9.2\% of all potential vaccination-related exposures. However,
the 100 most popular links to misinformation were potentially seen by between 2 million and 80 million
Twitter users, and for a substantial sub-population of Twitter users engaging with vaccination-related
information, links to misinformation appear to dominate the vaccination-related information
to which they were exposed. Conclusions: We proposed a new method for automatically appraising
the credibility of webpages based on a combination of validated checklist tools. The results suggest
that an automatic credibility appraisal tool can be used to find populations at higher risk of exposure
to misinformation or applied proactively to add friction to the sharing of low credibility vaccination
information.
