Data imbalance is a major problem that affects several machine learning algorithms. Such problems
are troublesome because most of the learning algorithms attempts to optimize a loss function based
on error measures that do not take into account the data imbalance. Accordingly, the learning algorithm
simply generates a trivial model that is biased toward predicting the most frequent class in the
training data. Data augmentation techniques have been used to mitigate the data imbalance problem.
However, in the case of histopathologic images (HIs), low-level as well as high-level data augmentation
techniques still present performance issues when applied in the presence of inter-patient variability;
whence the model tends to learn color representations, which are in fact related to the stain process.
In this paper, we propose an approach capable of not only augmenting HIs database but also distributing
the inter-patient variability by means of image blending using Gaussian-Laplacian pyramid. The
proposed approach consists in finding the Gaussian pyramids of two images of different patients
and finding the Laplacian pyramids thereof. Afterwards, the left half of one image and the right
half of another are joined in each level of Laplacian pyramid, and from the joint pyramids, the original
image is reconstructed. This composition, resulting from the blending process, combines stain
variation of two patients, avoiding that color misleads the learning process. Experimental results
on the BreakHis dataset have shown promising gains vis-\`a-vis the majority of traditional techniques
presented in the literature.
