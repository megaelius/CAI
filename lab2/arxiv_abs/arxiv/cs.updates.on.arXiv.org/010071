Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in machine learning on graphs and networks with applications
ranging from vehicular network design to IoT traffic management to social network recommendations.
Supervised machine learning tasks in networks such as node classification and link prediction
require us to perform feature engineering that is known and agreed to be the key to success in applied
machine learning. Research efforts dedicated to representation learning, especially representation
learning using deep learning, has shown us ways to automatically learn relevant features from vast
amounts of potentially noisy, raw data. However, most of the methods are not adequate to handle heterogeneous
information networks which pretty much represents most real-world data today. The methods cannot
preserve the structure and semantic of multiple types of nodes and links well enough, capture higher-order
heterogeneous connectivity patterns, and ensure coverage of nodes for which representations
are generated. We propose a novel efficient algorithm, motif2vec that learns node representations
or embeddings for heterogeneous networks. Specifically, we leverage higher-order, recurring,
and statistically significant network connectivity patterns in the form of motifs to transform
the original graph to motif graph(s), conduct biased random walk to efficiently explore higher
order neighborhoods, and then employ heterogeneous skip-gram model to generate the embeddings.
Unlike previous efforts that uses different graph meta-structures to guide the random walk, we
use graph motifs to transform the original network and preserve the heterogeneity. We evaluate
the proposed algorithm on multiple real-world networks from diverse domains and against existing
state-of-the-art methods on multi-class node classification and link prediction tasks, and demonstrate
its consistent superiority over prior work.
