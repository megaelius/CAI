Block scheduling is difficult to implement in P2P network since there is no central coordinator.
This problem can be solved by employing network coding technique which allows intermediate nodes
to perform the coding operation instead of store and forward the received data. There is a general
assumption in this area of research so far that a target download rate is always attainable at every
peer as long as coding operation is performed at all the nodes in the network. An interesting study
is made that a maximum download rate can be attained by performing the coding operation at relatively
small portion of the network. The problem of finding the minimal set of node to perform the coding
operation and links to carry the coded data is called as a network code minimization problem (NCMP).
It is proved to be NP hard problem. It can be solved using genetic algorithm (GA) because GA can be used
to solve the diverse NP hard problem. A new NCMP model which considers both minimize the resources
needed to perform coding operation and dynamic change in network topology due to disconnection
is proposed. Based on this new NCMP model, an effective and novel GA is proposed by implementing problem
specific GA operators into the evolutionary process. There is an attempt to implement the different
compositions and several options of GA elements which worked well in many other problems and pick
the one that works best for this resource minimization problem. Our simulation results prove that
the proposed system outperforms the random selection and coding at all possible node mechanisms
in terms of both download time and system throughput.
