As computing systems become increasingly advanced and as users increasingly engage themselves
in technology, security has never been a greater concern. In malware detection, static analysis,
the method of analyzing potentially malicious files, has been the prominent approach. This approach,
however, quickly falls short as malicious programs become more advanced and adopt the capabilities
of obfuscating its binaries to execute the same malicious functions, making static analysis extremely
difficult for newer variants. The approach assessed in this paper is a novel dynamic malware analysis
method, which may generalize better than static analysis to newer variants. Inspired by recent
successes in Natural Language Processing (NLP), widely used document classification techniques
were assessed in detecting malware by doing such analysis on system calls, which contain useful
information about the operation of a program as requests that the program makes of the kernel. Features
considered are extracted from system call traces of benign and malicious programs, and the task
to classify these traces is treated as a binary document classification task of system call traces.
The system call traces were processed to remove the parameters to only leave the system call function
names. The features were grouped into various n-grams and weighted with Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency. This paper shows that Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) optimized by Stochastic
Gradient Descent and the traditional Coordinate Descent on the Wolfe Dual form of the SVM are effective
in this approach, achieving a highest of 96% accuracy with 95% recall score. Additional contributions
include the identification of significant system call sequences that could be avenues for further
research.
