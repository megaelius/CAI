Providing an accurate and efficient assessment of operative difficulty is important for designing
robot-assisted teleoperation interfaces that are easy and natural for human operators to use.
In this paper, we aim to develop a data-driven approach to numerically characterize the operative
difficulty demand of complex teleoperation. In effort to provide an entirely task-independent
assessment, we consider using only data collected from the human user including: (1) physiological
response, and (2) movement kinematics. By leveraging an unsupervised domain adaptation technique,
our approach learns the user information that defines task difficulty in a well-known source, namely,
a Fitt's target reaching task, and generalizes that knowledge to a more complex human motor control
scenario, namely, the teleoperation of a robotic system. Our approach consists of two main parts:
(1) The first part accounts for the inherent variances of user physiological and kinematic response
between these cross-domain motor control scenarios that are vastly different. (2) A stacked two-layer
learner is designed to improve the overall modeling performance, yielding a 96.6% accuracy in predicting
the known difficulty of a Fitts' reaching task when using movement kinematic features. We then validate
the effectiveness of our model by investigating teleoperated robotic needle steering as a case
study. Compared with a standard NASA TLX user survey, our results indicate significant differences
in the difficulty demand for various choices of needle steering control algorithms, p<0.05, as
well as the difficulty of steering the needle to different targets, p<0.05. The results highlight
the potential of our approach to be used as a design tool to create more intuitive and natural teleoperation
interfaces in robot-assisted systems.
