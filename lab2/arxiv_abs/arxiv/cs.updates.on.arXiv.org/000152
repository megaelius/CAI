Methodological contributions: This paper introduces a family of kernels for analyzing (anatomical)
trees endowed with vector valued measurements made along the tree. While state-of-the-art graph
and tree kernels use combinatorial tree/graph structure with discrete node and edge labels, the
kernels presented in this paper can include geometric information such as branch shape, branch
radius or other vector valued properties. In addition to being flexible in their ability to model
different types of attributes, the presented kernels are computationally efficient and some of
them can easily be computed for large datasets (N of the order 10.000) of trees with 30-600 branches.
Combining the kernels with standard machine learning tools enables us to analyze the relation between
disease and anatomical tree structure and geometry. Experimental results: The kernels are used
to compare airway trees segmented from low-dose CT, endowed with branch shape descriptors and airway
wall area percentage measurements made along the tree. Using kernelized hypothesis testing we
show that the geometric airway trees are significantly differently distributed in patients with
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) than in healthy individuals. The geometric tree
kernels also give a significant increase in the classification accuracy of COPD from geometric
tree structure endowed with airway wall thickness measurements in comparison with state-of-the-art
methods, giving further insight into the relationship between airway wall thickness and COPD.
