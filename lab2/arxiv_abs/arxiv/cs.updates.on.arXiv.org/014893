Today many mobile users in various zones are invited to sense and send back real-time useful information
(e.g., traffic observation and sensor data) to keep the freshness of the content updates in such
zones. However, due to the sampling cost in sensing and transmission, a user may not have the incentive
to contribute the real-time information to help reduce the age of information (AoI). We propose
dynamic pricing for each zone to offer age-dependent monetary returns and encourage users to sample
information at different rates over time. This dynamic pricing design problem needs to well balance
the monetary payments as rewards to users and the AoI evolution over time, and is challenging to solve
especially under the incomplete information about users' arrivals and their private sampling
costs. After formulating the problem as a nonlinear constrained dynamic program, to avoid the curse
of dimensionality, we first propose to approximate the dynamic AoI reduction as a time-average
term and successfully solve the approximate dynamic pricing in closed-form. Further, by providing
the steady-state analysis for an infinite time horizon, we show that the pricing scheme (though
in closed-form) can be further simplified to an $\varepsilon$-optimal version without recursive
computing over time. Finally, we extend the AoI control from a single zone to many zones with heterogeneous
user arrival rates and initial ages, where each zone cares not only its own AoI dynamics but also the
average AoI of all the zones in a mean field game system to provide a holistic service. Accordingly,
we propose decentralized mean field pricing for each zone to self-operate by using a mean field term
to estimate the average age dynamics of all the zones, which does not even require many zones to exchange
their local data with each other.
