Augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality (MR) platforms require spatial understanding to detect
objects or surfaces, often including their structural (i.e. spatial geometry) and photometric
(e.g. color, and texture) attributes, to allow applications to place virtual or synthetic objects
seemingly "anchored" on to real world objects; in some cases, even allowing interactions between
the physical and virtual objects. These functionalities require AR/MR platforms to capture the
3D spatial information with high resolution and frequency; however, these pose unprecedented
risks to user privacy. Aside from objects being detected, spatial information also reveals the
location of the user with high specificity, e.g. in which part of the house the user is. In this work,
we propose to leverage spatial generalizations coupled with conservative releasing to provide
spatial privacy while maintaining data utility. We designed an adversary that builds up on existing
place and shape recognition methods over 3D data as attackers to which the proposed spatial privacy
approach can be evaluated against. Then, we simulate user movement within spaces which reveals
more of their space as they move around utilizing 3D point clouds collected from Microsoft HoloLens.
Results show that revealing no more than 11 generalized planes--accumulated from successively
revealed spaces with large enough radius, i.e. $r\leq1.0m$--can make an adversary fail in identifying
the spatial location of the user for at least half of the time. Furthermore, if the accumulated spaces
are of smaller radius, i.e. each successively revealed space is $r\leq 0.5m$, we can release up to
29 generalized planes while enjoying both better data utility and privacy.
