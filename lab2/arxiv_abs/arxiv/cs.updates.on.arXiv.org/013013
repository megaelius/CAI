Sexual harassment in academia is often a hidden problem because victims are usually reluctant to
report their experiences. Recently, a web survey was developed to provide an opportunity to share
thousands of sexual harassment experiences in academia. Using an efficient approach, this study
collected and investigated more than 2,000 sexual harassment experiences to better understand
these unwanted advances in higher education. This paper utilized text mining to disclose hidden
topics and explore their weight across three variables: harasser gender, institution type, and
victim's field of study. We mapped the topics on five themes drawn from the sexual harassment literature
and found that more than 50% of the topics were assigned to the unwanted sexual attention theme. Fourteen
percent of the topics were in the gender harassment theme, in which insulting, sexist, or degrading
comments or behavior was directed towards women. Five percent of the topics involved sexual coercion
(a benefit is offered in exchange for sexual favors), 5% involved sex discrimination, and 7% of the
topics discussed retaliation against the victim for reporting the harassment, or for simply not
complying with the harasser. Findings highlight the power differential between faculty and students,
and the toll on students when professors abuse their power. While some topics did differ based on
type of institution, there were no differences between the topics based on gender of harasser or
field of study. This research can be beneficial to researchers in further investigation of this
paper's dataset, and to policymakers in improving existing policies to create a safe and supportive
environment in academia.
