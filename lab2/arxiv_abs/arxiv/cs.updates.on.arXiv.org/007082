We study the computational complexity of solving mean payoff games. This class of games can be seen
as an extension of parity games, and they have similar complexity status: in both cases solving them
is in $\textbf{NP} \cap \textbf{coNP}$ and not known to be in $\textbf{P}$. In a breakthrough result
Calude, Jain, Khoussainov, Li, and Stephan constructed in 2017 a quasipolynomial time algorithm
for solving parity games, which was quickly followed by two other algorithms with the same complexity.
Our objective is to investigate how these techniques can be extended to the study of mean payoff games.
The starting point is the notion of separating automata, which has been used to present all three
quasipolynomial time algorithms for parity games and gives the best complexity to date. The notion
naturally extends to mean payoff games and yields a class of algorithms for solving mean payoff games.
The contribution of this paper is to prove tight bounds on the complexity of algorithms in this class.
We construct two new algorithms for solving mean payoff games. Our first algorithm depends on the
largest weight $N$ (in absolute value) appearing in the graph and runs in sublinear time in $N$, improving
over the previously known linear dependence in $N$. Our second algorithm runs in polynomial time
for a fixed number $k$ of weights. We complement our upper bounds by providing in both cases almost
matching lower bounds, showing the limitations of the separating automata approach. We show that
we cannot hope to improve on the dependence in $N$ nor break the linear dependence in the exponent
in the number $k$ of weights. In particular, this shows that separating automata do not yield a quasipolynomial
algorithm for solving mean payoff games.
