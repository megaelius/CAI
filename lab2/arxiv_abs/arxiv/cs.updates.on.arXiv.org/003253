Our societies are increasingly dependent on services supplied by computers & their software. New
technology only exacerbates this dependence by increasing the number, performance, and degree
of autonomy and inter-connectivity of software-empowered computers and cyber-physical "things",
which translates into unprecedented scenarios of interdependence. As a consequence, guaranteeing
the persistence-of-identity of individual & collective software systems and software-backed
organisations becomes an important prerequisite toward sustaining the safety, security, & quality
of the computer services supporting human societies. Resilience is the term used to refer to the
ability of a system to retain its functional and non-functional identity. In this article we conjecture
that a better understanding of resilience may be reached by decomposing it into ancillary constituent
properties, the same way as a better insight in system dependability was obtained by breaking it
down into sub-properties. 3 of the main sub-properties of resilience proposed here refer respectively
to the ability to perceive environmental changes; understand the implications introduced by those
changes; and plan & enact adjustments intended to improve the system-environment fit. A fourth
property characterises the way the above abilities manifest themselves in computer systems. The
4 properties are then analyzed in 3 families of case studies, each consisting of 3 software systems
that embed different resilience methods. Our major conclusion is that reasoning in terms of resilience
sub-properties may help revealing the characteristics and limitations of classic methods and
tools meant to achieve system and organisational resilience. We conclude by suggesting that our
method may prelude to meta-resilient systems -- systems, that is, able to adjust optimally their
own resilience with respect to changing environmental conditions.
