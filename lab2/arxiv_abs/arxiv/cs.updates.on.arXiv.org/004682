Main memory (DRAM) consumes as much as half of the total system power in a computer today, resulting
in a growing need to develop new DRAM architectures and systems that consume less power. Researchers
have long relied on DRAM power models that are based off of standardized current measurements provided
by vendors, called IDD values. Unfortunately, we find that these models are highly inaccurate,
and do not reflect the actual power consumed by real DRAM devices. We perform the first comprehensive
experimental characterization of the power consumed by modern real-world DRAM modules. Our extensive
characterization of 50 DDR3L DRAM modules from three major vendors yields four key new observations
about DRAM power consumption: (1) across all IDD values that we measure, the current consumed by
real DRAM modules varies significantly from the current specified by the vendors; (2) DRAM power
consumption strongly depends on the data value that is read or written; (3) there is significant
structural variation, where the same banks and rows across multiple DRAM modules from the same model
consume more power than other banks or rows; and (4) over successive process technology generations,
DRAM power consumption has not decreased by as much as vendor specifications have indicated. Based
on our detailed analysis and characterization data, we develop the Variation-Aware model of Memory
Power Informed by Real Experiments (VAMPIRE). We show that VAMPIRE has a mean absolute percentage
error of only 6.8% compared to actual measured DRAM power. VAMPIRE enables a wide range of studies
that were not possible using prior DRAM power models. As an example, we use VAMPIRE to evaluate a new
power-aware data encoding mechanism, which can reduce DRAM energy consumption by an average of
12.2%. We plan to open-source both VAMPIRE and our extensive raw data collected during our experimental
characterization.
