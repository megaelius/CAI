Recently, single gray/RGB image super-resolution reconstruction task has been extensively studied
and made significant progress by leveraging the advanced machine learning techniques based on
deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, there has been limited technical development
focusing on single hyperspectral image super-resolution due to the high-dimensional and complex
spectral patterns in hyperspectral image. In this paper, we make a step forward by investigating
how to adapt state-of-the-art residual learning based single gray/RGB image super-resolution
approaches for computationally efficient single hyperspectral image super-resolution, referred
as SSPSR. Specifically, we introduce a spatial-spectral prior network (SSPN) to fully exploit
the spatial information and the correlation between the spectra of the hyperspectral data. Considering
that the hyperspectral training samples are scarce and the spectral dimension of hyperspectral
image data is very high, it is nontrivial to train a stable and effective deep network. Therefore,
a group convolution (with shared network parameters) and progressive upsampling framework is
proposed. This will not only alleviate the difficulty in feature extraction due to high-dimension
of the hyperspectral data, but also make the training process more stable. To exploit the spatial
and spectral prior, we design a spatial-spectral block (SSB), which consists of a spatial residual
module and a spectral attention residual module. Experimental results on some hyperspectral images
demonstrate that the proposed SSPSR method enhances the details of the recovered high-resolution
hyperspectral images, and outperforms state-of-the-arts. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/junjun-jiang/SSPSR
