The three-in-a-tree problem asks for an induced tree of the input graph containing three mandatory
vertices. In 2006, Chudnovsky and Seymour [Combinatorica, 2010] presented the first polynomial
time algorithm for this problem, which has become a critical subroutine in many algorithms for detecting
induced subgraphs, such as beetles, pyramids, thetas, and even and odd-holes. In 2007, Derhy and
Picouleau [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 2009] considered the natural generalization to $k$
mandatory vertices, proving that, when $k$ is part of the input, the problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete,
and ask what is the complexity of four-in-a-tree. Motivated by this question and the relevance of
the original problem, we study the parameterized complexity of $k$-in-a-tree. We begin by showing
that the problem is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when jointly parameterized by the size of the solution
and minimum clique cover and, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, does not admit an $n^{o(k)}$
time algorithm. Afterwards, we use Courcelle's Theorem to prove fixed-parameter tractability
under cliquewidth, which prompts our investigation into which parameterizations admit single
exponential algorithms; we show that such algorithms exist for the unrelated parameterizations
treewidth, distance to cluster, and distance to co-cluster. In terms of kernelization, we present
a linear kernel under feedback edge set, and show that no polynomial kernel exists under vertex cover
nor distance to clique unless $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$. Along with
other remarks and previous work, our tractability and kernelization results cover many of the most
commonly employed parameters in the graph parameter hierarchy.
