Many areas of research are characterised by the deluge of large-scale highly-dimensional time-series
data. However, using the data available for prediction and decision making is hampered by the current
lag in our ability to uncover and quantify true interactions that explain the outcomes.We are interested
in areas such as intensive care medicine, which are characterised by i) continuous monitoring of
multivariate variables and non-uniform sampling of data streams, ii) the outcomes are generally
governed by interactions between a small set of rare events, iii) these interactions are not necessarily
definable by specific values (or value ranges) of a given group of variables, but rather, by the deviations
of these values from the normal state recorded over time, iv) the need to explain the predictions
made by the model. Here, while numerous data mining models have been formulated for outcome prediction,
they are unable to explain their predictions. We present a model for uncovering interactions with
the highest likelihood of generating the outcomes seen from highly-dimensional time series data.
Interactions among variables are represented by a relational graph structure, which relies on
qualitative abstractions to overcome non-uniform sampling and to capture the semantics of the
interactions corresponding to the changes and deviations from normality of variables of interest
over time. Using the assumption that similar templates of small interactions are responsible for
the outcomes (as prevalent in the medical domains), we reformulate the discovery task to retrieve
the most-likely templates from the data.
