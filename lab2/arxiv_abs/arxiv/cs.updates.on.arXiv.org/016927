In machine learning (ML), ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking are widely-established
approaches that regularly achieve top-notch predictive performance. Stacking (also called "stacked
generalization") is an ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at
least one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of those models.
Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the predictive performance of ML,
generating a stack of models from scratch can be a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge
stems from the enormous space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and
features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from, and instantiations
of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models) that perform differently according
to various metrics. In this work, we present a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble
learning with the use of visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization.
Our system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics, managing
data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data set, choosing a set of top-performant
and diverse algorithms, and measuring the predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed
tool helps users to decide between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting
stack by removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and effectiveness
of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world healthcare data set and a collection
of data related to sentiment/stance detection in texts. Finally, the tool has been evaluated through
interviews with three ML experts.
