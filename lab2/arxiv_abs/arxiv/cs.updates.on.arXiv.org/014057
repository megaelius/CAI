A discrete-time end-to-end fiber-optical channel model is derived based on the first-order perturbation
approach. The model relates the discrete-time input symbol sequences of co-propagating wavelength
channels to the received symbol sequence after matched filtering and T-spaced sampling. To this
end, the interference from both self- and cross-channel nonlinear interactions of the continuous-time
optical signal is represented by a single discrete-time perturbative term. Two equivalent discrete-time
models can be formulated---one in the time-domain, the other in the 1/T-periodic continuous-frequency
domain. The time-domain formulation coincides with the well-known pulse-collision picture.
The novel frequency-domain picture incorporates the sampling operation via an aliased and periodic
kernel description. This gives rise to an alternative perspective on the end-to-end input/output
relation between the spectrum of the discrete-time transmit symbol sequence and the spectrum of
the receive symbol sequence. Both views can be extended from a regular, i.e., solely additive model,
to a combined regular-logarithmic model to take the multiplicative nature of certain distortions
into consideration. An alternative formulation of the Gaussian Noise model is provided to take
the aliasing of frequency components correctly into account. A novel algorithmic implementation
of the discrete and periodic frequency-domain model is presented. The derived end-to-end model
requires only a single computational step and shows good agreement in the mean-squared error sense
compared to the oversampled and inherently sequential split-step Fourier method.
