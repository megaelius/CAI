We consider parametrized versions of metrical task systems and metrical service systems, two fundamental
models of online computing, where the constrained parameter is the number of possible distinct
requests $m$. Such parametrization occurs naturally in a wide range of applications. Striking
examples are certain power management problems, which are modeled as metrical task systems with
$m=2$. We characterize the competitive ratio in terms of the parameter $m$ for both deterministic
and randomized algorithms on hierarchically separated trees. Our findings uncover a rich and unexpected
picture that differs substantially from what is known or conjectured about the unparametrized
versions of these problems. For metrical task systems, we show that deterministic algorithms do
not exhibit any asymptotic gain beyond one-level trees (namely, uniform metric spaces), whereas
randomized algorithms do not exhibit any asymptotic gain even for one-level trees. In contrast,
the special case of metrical service systems (subset chasing) behaves very differently. Both deterministic
and randomized algorithms exhibit gain, for $m$ sufficiently small compared to $n$, for any number
of levels. Most significantly, they exhibit a large gain for uniform metric spaces and a smaller
gain for two-level trees. Moreover, it turns out that in these cases (as well as in the case of metrical
task systems for uniform metric spaces with $m$ being an absolute constant), deterministic algorithms
are essentially as powerful as randomized algorithms. This is surprising and runs counter to the
ubiquitous intuition/conjecture that, for most problems that can be modeled as metrical task systems,
the randomized competitive ratio is polylogarithmic in the deterministic competitive ratio.
