We present a method for registration and visualization of corresponding supine and prone virtual
colonoscopy scans based on eigenfunction analysis and fold modeling. In virtual colonoscopy,
CT scans are acquired with the patient in two positions, and their registration is desirable so that
physicians can corroborate findings between scans. Our algorithm performs this registration
efficiently through the use of Fiedler vector representation (the second eigenfunction of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator). This representation is employed to first perform global registration
of the two colon positions. The registration is then locally refined using the haustral folds, which
are automatically segmented using the 3D level sets of the Fiedler vector. The use of Fiedler vectors
and the segmented folds presents a precise way of visualizing corresponding regions across datasets
and visual modalities. We present multiple methods of visualizing the results, including 2D flattened
rendering and the corresponding 3D endoluminal views. The precise fold modeling is used to automatically
find a suitable cut for the 2D flattening, which provides a less distorted visualization. Our approach
is robust, and we demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy by showing matched views on both the 2D
flattened colons and in the 3D endoluminal view. We analytically evaluate the results by measuring
the distance between features on the registered colons, and we also assess our fold segmentation
against 20 manually labeled datasets. We have compared our results analytically to previous methods,
and have found our method to achieve superior results. We also prove the hot spots conjecture for
modeling cylindrical topology using Fiedler vector representation, which allows our approach
to be used for general cylindrical geometry modeling and feature extraction.
