This paper analyzes the unified performance of energy detection (ED) of spectrum sensing (SS) over
generalized fading channels in cognitive radio (CR) networks. The detective performance of SS
schemes will be obviously affected by fading channel between communication nodes, and ED has the
advantages of fast implementation, no requirement of priori received information and low complexity,
so it is meaningful to investigate ED that is performed over fading channels such as Nakagami-m channel
and Rice channel, or generalized fading channels such as \k{appa}-{\mu} fading distribution and
{\eta}-{\mu} fading distribution. The {\alpha}-\k{appa}-{\mu} fading distribution is a generalized
fading model that represents the nonlinear and small-scale variation of fading channels. The probability
density function (p.d.f.) of instantaneous signal-to-ratio (SNR) of {\alpha}-\k{appa}-{\mu}
distribution is derived from the envelope p.d.f. to evaluate energy efficiency for sensing systems.
Next, the probability of detection model with Marcum-Q function has been derived and the close-form
detective expressions with moment generating function (MGF) method are deduced to achieve sensing
communications over generalized fading channels. Furthermore, novel and exact closed-form analytic
expressions for average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve also have been
deduced to analyze the performance characteristics of ED over {\alpha}-\k{appa}-{\mu} fading
channels. Besides, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) with diversity reception has been applied
to improve the detection accuracy and mitigate the shadowed fading features with OR-rule. At last,
the results show that the detection capacity can be evidently affected by {\alpha}-\k{appa}-{\mu}
fading conditions, but appropriate channel parameters will improve sensing performance.
