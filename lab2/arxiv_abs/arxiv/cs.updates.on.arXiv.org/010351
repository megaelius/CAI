Today's popular TV series tend to develop continuous, complex plots spanning several seasons,
but are often viewed in controlled and discontinuous conditions. Consequently, most viewers need
to be re-immersed in the story before watching a new season. Although discussions with friends and
family can help, we observe that most viewers make extensive use of summaries to re-engage with the
plot. Automatic generation of video summaries of TV series' complex stories requires, first, modeling
the dynamics of the plot and, second, extracting relevant sequences. In this paper, we tackle plot
modeling by considering the social network of interactions between the characters involved in
the narrative: substantial, durable changes in a major character's social environment suggest
a new development relevant for the summary. Once identified, these major stages in each character's
storyline can be used as a basis for completing the summary with related sequences. Our algorithm
combines such social network analysis with filmmaking grammar to automatically generate character-oriented
video summaries of TV series from partially annotated data. We carry out evaluation with a user study
in a real-world scenario: a large sample of viewers were asked to rank video summaries centered on
five characters of the popular TV series Game of Thrones, a few weeks before the new, sixth season
was released. Our results reveal the ability of character-oriented summaries to re-engage viewers
in television series and confirm the contributions of modeling the plot content and exploiting
stylistic patterns to identify salient sequences.
