Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated near-expert medical image analysis. Supervised
learning is the mainstay of current approaches, though its success requires the use of large, fully
labeled datasets. However, in real-world medical practice, previously unseen disease phenotypes
are encountered that have not been defined a priori in finite-size datasets. Unsupervised learning,
a hypothesis-free learning framework, may play a complementary role to supervised learning. Here,
we demonstrate a novel framework for voxel-wise abnormality detection in brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), which exploits an image reconstruction network based on an introspective variational
autoencoder trained with a structural similarity constraint. The proposed network learns a latent
representation for "normal" anatomical variation using a series of images that do not include annotated
abnormalities. After training, the network can map unseen query images to positions in the latent
space, and latent variables sampled from those positions can be mapped back to the image space to
yield normal-looking replicas of the input images. Finally, the network considers abnormality
scores, which are designed to reflect differences at several image feature levels, in order to locate
image regions that may contain abnormalities. The proposed method is evaluated on a comprehensively
annotated dataset spanning clinically significant structural abnormalities of the brain parenchyma
in a population having undergone radiotherapy for brain metastasis, demonstrating that it is particularly
effective for contrast-enhanced lesions, i.e., metastatic brain tumors and extracranial metastatic
tumors.
