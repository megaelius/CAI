When selecting ideas or trying to find inspiration, designers often must sift through hundreds
or thousands of ideas. This paper provides an algorithm to rank design ideas such that the ranked
list simultaneously maximizes the quality and diversity of recommended designs. To do so, we first
define and compare two diversity measures using Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) and additive
sub-modular functions. We show that DPPs are more suitable for items expressed as text and that a
greedy algorithm diversifies rankings with both theoretical guarantees and empirical performance
on what is otherwise an NP-Hard problem. To produce such rankings, this paper contributes a novel
way to extend quality and diversity metrics from sets to permutations of ranked lists. These rank
metrics open up the use of multi-objective optimization to describe trade-offs between diversity
and quality in ranked lists. We use such trade-off fronts to help designers select rankings using
indifference curves. However, we also show that rankings on trade-off front share a number of top-ranked
items; this means reviewing items (for a given depth like the top 10) from across the entire diversity-to-quality
front incurs only a marginal increase in the number of designs considered. While the proposed techniques
are general purpose enough to be used across domains, we demonstrate concrete performance on selecting
items in an online design community (OpenIDEO), where our approach reduces the time required to
review diverse, high-quality ideas from around 25 hours to 90 minutes. This makes evaluation of
crowd-generated ideas tractable for a single designer. Our code is publicly accessible for further
research.
