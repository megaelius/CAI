Video streaming today accounts for up to 55\% of mobile traffic. In this paper, we explore streaming
videos encoded using Scalable Video Coding scheme (SVC) over highly variable bandwidth conditions
such as cellular networks. SVC's unique encoding scheme allows the quality of a video chunk to change
incrementally, making it more flexible and adaptive to challenging network conditions compared
to other encoding schemes. Our contribution is threefold. First, we formulate the quality decisions
of video chunks constrained by the available bandwidth, the playback buffer, and the chunk deadlines
as an optimization problem. The objective is to optimize a novel QoE metric that models a combination
of the three objectives of minimizing the stall/skip duration of the video, maximizing the playback
quality of every chunk, and minimizing the number of quality switches. Second, we develop Layered
Bin Packing (LBP) Adaptation Algorithm, a novel algorithm that solves the proposed optimization
problem. Moreover, we show that LBP achieves the optimal solution of the proposed optimization
problem with linear complexity in the number of video chunks. Third, we propose an online algorithm
(online LBP) where several challenges are addressed including handling bandwidth prediction
errors, and short prediction duration. Extensive simulations with real bandwidth traces of public
datasets reveal the robustness of our scheme and demonstrate its significant performance improvement
as compared to the state-of-the-art SVC streaming algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also implemented
on a TCP/IP emulation test bed with real LTE bandwidth traces, and the emulation confirms the simulation
results and validates that the algorithm can be implemented and deployed on today's mobile devices.
