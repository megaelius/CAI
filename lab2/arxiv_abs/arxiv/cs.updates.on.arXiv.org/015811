Software engineering is a socio-technical endeavor, and while many of our contributions focus
on technical aspects, human stakeholders such as software developers are directly affected by
and can benefit from our research and tool innovations. In this paper, we question how much of our
research addresses human and social issues, and explore how much we study human and social aspects
in our research designs. To answer these questions, we developed a socio-technical research framework
to capture the main beneficiary of a research study (the who), the main type of research contribution
produced (the what), and the research strategies used in the study (how we methodologically approach
delivering relevant results given the who and what of our studies). We used this Who-What-How framework
to analyze 151 papers from two well-cited publishing venues---the main technical track at the International
Conference on Software Engineering, and the Empirical Software Engineering Journal by Springer---to
assess how much this published research explicitly considers human aspects. We find that although
a majority of these papers claim the contained research should benefit human stakeholders, most
focus on technical contributions without engaging humans in their studies. Although our analysis
is scoped to two venues, our results suggest a need for more diversification and triangulation of
research strategies. In particular, there is a need for strategies that aim at a deeper understanding
of human and social aspects of software development practice to balance the design and evaluation
of technical innovations. We recommend that the framework should be used in the design of future
studies in order to nudge software engineering research towards explicitly including human and
social concerns in their designs, and to improve the relevance of our research for human stakeholders.
