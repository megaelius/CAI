We introduce the \emph{pipeline intervention} problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic
graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph
is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually
leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some node
in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution, and then stochastically
progress through the graph according to the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final
layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The pipeline
intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing
people's stochastic transitions through the graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider
two objectives: social welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that
seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least} expected value.
We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether
we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient
approximation algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly characterize
the "price of fairness" in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare
and the highest social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that
for polynomial width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor
is NP hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in
our positive results is essential.
