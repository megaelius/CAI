Inspired by the recent advances of image super-resolution using convolutional neural network
(CNN), we propose a CNN-based block up-sampling scheme for intra frame coding. A block can be down-sampled
before being compressed by normal intra coding, and then up-sampled to its original resolution.
Different from previous studies on down/up-sampling-based coding, the up-sampling methods in
our scheme have been designed by training CNN instead of hand-crafted. We explore a new CNN structure
for up-sampling, which features deconvolution of feature maps, multi-scale fusion, and residue
learning, making the network both compact and efficient. We also design different networks for
the up-sampling of luma and chroma components, respectively, where the chroma up-sampling CNN
utilizes the luma information to boost its performance. In addition, we design a two-stage up-sampling
process, the first stage being within the block-by-block coding loop, and the second stage being
performed on the entire frame, so as to refine block boundaries. We also empirically study how to
set the coding parameters of down-sampled blocks for pursuing the frame-level rate-distortion
optimization. Our proposed scheme is implemented into the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC)
reference software, and a comprehensive set of experiments have been performed to evaluate our
methods. Experimental results show that our scheme achieves significant bits saving compared
with HEVC anchor especially at low bit rates, leading to on average 5.5% BD-rate reduction on common
test sequences and on average 9.0% BD-rate reduction on ultra high definition (UHD) test sequences.
