Identifying the relationship between two text objects is a core research problem underlying many
natural language processing tasks. A wide range of deep learning schemes have been proposed for
text matching, mainly focusing on sentence matching, question answering or query document matching.
We point out that existing approaches do not perform well at matching long documents, which is critical,
for example, to AI-based news article understanding and event or story formation. The reason is
that these methods either omit or fail to fully utilize complicated semantic structures in long
documents. In this paper, we propose a graph approach to text matching, especially targeting long
document matching, such as identifying whether two news articles report the same event in the real
world, possibly with different narratives. We propose the Concept Interaction Graph to yield a
graph representation for a document, with vertices representing different concepts, each being
one or a group of coherent keywords in the document, and with edges representing the interactions
between different concepts, connected by sentences in the document. Based on the graph representation
of document pairs, we further propose a Siamese Encoded Graph Convolutional Network that learns
vertex representations through a Siamese neural network and aggregates the vertex features though
Graph Convolutional Networks to generate the matching result. Extensive evaluation of the proposed
approach based on two labeled news article datasets created at Tencent for its intelligent news
products show that the proposed graph approach to long document matching significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art methods.
