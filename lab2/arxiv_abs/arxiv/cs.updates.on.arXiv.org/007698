Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the problem of deploying various network service instances
over geographically distributed data centers and providing inter-connectivity among them. The
goal is to enable the network traffic to flow smoothly through the underlying network, resulting
in an optimal quality of experience to the end-users. Proper chaining of network functions leads
to optimal utilization of distributed resources. This has been a de-facto model in the telecom industry
with network functions deployed over underlying hardware. Though this model has served the telecom
industry well so far, it has been adapted mostly to suit the static behavior of network services and
service demands due to the deployment of the services directly over physical resources. This results
in network ossification with larger delays to the end-users, especially with the data-centric
model in which the computational resources are moving closer to end users. A novel networking paradigm,
Network Function Virtualization (NFV), meets the user demands dynamically and reduces operational
expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx), by implementing network functions in the software
layer known as virtual network functions (VNFs). VNFs are then interconnected to form a complete
end-to-end service, also known as service function chains (SFCs). In this work, we study the problem
of deploying service function chains over network function virtualized architecture. Specifically,
we study virtual network function placement problem for the optimal SFC formation across geographically
distributed clouds. We set up the problem of minimizing inter-cloud traffic and response time in
a multi-cloud scenario as an ILP optimization problem, along with important constraints such as
total deployment costs and service level agreements (SLAs). We consider link delays and computational
delays in our model.
