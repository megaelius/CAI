The targeted advertising is based on preference profiles inferred via relationships among individuals,
their monitored responses to previous advertising and temporal activity over the Internet, which
has raised critical privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a novel proposal for a Blockchain-based
advertising platform that provides: a system for privacy preserving user profiling, privately
requesting ads from the advertising system, the billing mechanisms for presented and clicked ads,
the advertising system that uploads ads to the cloud according to profiling interests, various
types of transactions to enable advertising operations in Blockchain-based network, and the method
that allows a cloud system to privately compute the access policies for various resources (such
as ads, mobile user profiles). Our main goal is to design a decentralized framework for targeted
ads, which enables private delivery of ads to users whose behavioral profiles accurately match
the presented ads, defined by the ad system. We implement a POC of our proposed framework i.e. a Bespoke
Miner and experimentally evaluate various components of Blockchain-based in-app advertising
system, implementing various critical components; such as, evaluating user profiles, implementing
access policies, encryption and decryption of users' profiles. We observe that the processing
delay for traversing policies of various tree sizes, the encryption/decryption time of user profiling
with various key-sizes and user profiles of various interests evaluates to an acceptable amount
of processing time as that of the currently implemented ad systems.
