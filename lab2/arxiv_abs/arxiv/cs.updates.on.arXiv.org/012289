For the purpose of effective suppression of the cycle-skipping phenomenon in full waveform inversion
(FWI), we developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) approach to predict the absent low-frequency components
by exploiting the implicit relation connecting the low-frequency and high-frequency data through
the subsurface geological and geophysical properties. In order to solve this challenging nonlinear
regression problem, two novel strategies were proposed to design the DNN architecture and the learning
workflow: 1) Dual Data Feed; 2) Progressive Transfer Learning. With the Dual Data Feed structure,
both the high-frequency data and the corresponding Beat Tone data are fed into the DNN to relieve
the burden of feature extraction, thus reducing the network complexity and the training cost. The
second strategy, Progressive Transfer Learning, enables us to unbiasedly train the DNN using a
single training dataset. Unlike most established deep learning approaches where the training
datasets are fixed, within the framework of the Progressive Transfer Learning, the training dataset
evolves in an iterative manner while gradually absorbing the subsurface information retrieved
by the physics-based inversion module, progressively enhancing the prediction accuracy of the
DNN and propelling the FWI process out of the local minima. The Progressive Transfer Learning, alternatingly
updating the training velocity model and the DNN parameters in a complementary fashion toward convergence,
saves us from being overwhelmed by the otherwise tremendous amount of training data, and avoids
the underfitting and biased sampling issues. The numerical experiments validated that, without
any a priori geological information, the low-frequency data predicted by the Progressive Transfer
Learning are sufficiently accurate for an FWI engine to produce reliable subsurface velocity models
free of cycle-skipping-induced artifacts.
