New York City faces the challenge of an ever-increasing homeless population with almost 60,000
people currently living in city shelters. In 2015, approximately 25% of families stayed longer
than 9 months in a shelter, and 17% of families with children that exited a homeless shelter returned
to the shelter system within 30 days of leaving. This suggests that "long-term" shelter residents
and those that re-enter shelters contribute significantly to the rise of the homeless population
living in city shelters and indicate systemic challenges to finding adequate permanent housing.
Women in Need (Win) is a non-profit agency that provides shelter to almost 10,000 homeless women
and children (10% of all homeless families of NYC), and is the largest homeless shelter provider
in the City. This paper focuses on our preliminary work with Win to understand the factors that affect
the rate of readmission of homeless families at Win shelters, and to predict the likelihood of re-entry
into the shelter system on exit. These insights will enable improved service delivery and operational
efficiencies at these shelters. This paper describes our recent efforts to integrate Win datasets
with city records to create a unified, comprehensive database of the homeless population being
served by Win shelters. A preliminary classification model is developed to predict the odds of readmission
and length of shelter stay based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the homeless
population served by Win. This work is intended to form the basis for establishing a network of "smart
shelters" through the use of data science and data technologies.
