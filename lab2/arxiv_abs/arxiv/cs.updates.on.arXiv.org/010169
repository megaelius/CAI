Homepage is the first touch point in the customer's journey and is one of the prominent channels of
revenue for many e-commerce companies. A user's attention is mostly captured by homepage banner
images (also called Ads/Creatives). The set of banners shown and their design, influence the customer's
interest and plays a key role in optimizing the click through rates of the banners. Presently, massive
and repetitive effort is put in, to manually create aesthetically pleasing banner images. Due to
the large amount of time and effort involved in this process, only a small set of banners are made live
at any point. This reduces the number of banners created as well as the degree of personalization
that can be achieved. This paper thus presents a method to generate creatives automatically on a
large scale in a short duration. The availability of diverse banners generated helps in improving
personalization as they can cater to the taste of larger audience. The focus of our paper is on generating
wide variety of homepage banners that can be made as an input for user level personalization engine.
Following are the main contributions of this paper: 1) We introduce and explain the need for large
scale banner generation for e-commerce 2) We present on how we utilize existing deep learning based
detectors which can automatically annotate the required objects/tags from the image. 3) We also
propose a Genetic Algorithm based method to generate an optimal banner layout for the given image
content, input components and other design constraints. 4) Further, to aid the process of picking
the right set of banners, we designed a ranking method and evaluated multiple models. All our experiments
have been performed on data from Myntra (this http URL), one of the top fashion e-commerce players
in India.
