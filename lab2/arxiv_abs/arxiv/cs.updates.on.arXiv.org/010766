Among the most important prerequisites for creating and evaluating 6D object pose detectors are
datasets with labeled 6D poses. With the advent of deep learning, demand for such datasets is growing
continuously. Despite the fact that some of exist, they are scarce and typically have restricted
setups, such as a single object per sequence, or they focus on specific object types, such as textureless
industrial parts. Besides, two significant components are often ignored: training using only
available 3D models instead of real data and scalability, i.e. training one method to detect all
objects rather than training one detector per object. Other challenges, such as occlusions, changing
light conditions and changes in object appearance, as well precisely defined benchmarks are either
not present or are scattered among different datasets. In this paper we present a dataset for 6D pose
estimation that covers the above-mentioned challenges, mainly targeting training from 3D models
(both textured and textureless), scalability, occlusions, and changes in light conditions and
object appearance. The dataset features 33 objects (17 toy, 8 household and 8 industry-relevant
objects) over 13 scenes of various difficulty. We also present a set of benchmarks to test various
desired detector properties, particularly focusing on scalability with respect to the number
of objects and resistance to changing light conditions, occlusions and clutter. We also set a baseline
for the presented benchmarks using a state-of-the-art DPOD detector. Considering the difficulty
of making such datasets, we plan to release the code allowing other researchers to extend this dataset
or make their own datasets in the future.
