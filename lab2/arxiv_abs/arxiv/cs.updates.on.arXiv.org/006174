The basic goal of computer engineering is the analysis of data. Such data are often large data sets
distributed according to various distribution models. In this manuscript we focus on the analysis
of non-Gaussian distributed data. In the case of univariate data analysis we discuss stochastic
processes with auto-correlated increments and univariate distributions derived from specific
stochastic processes, i.e. Levy and Tsallis distributions. Deep investigation of multivariate
non-Gaussian distributions requires the copula approach. A copula is an component of multivariate
distribution that models the mutual interdependence between marginals. There are many copula
families characterised by various measures of the dependence between marginals. Importantly,
one of those are `tail' dependencies that model the simultaneous appearance of extreme values in
many marginals. Those extreme events may reflect a crisis given financial data, outliers in machine
learning, or a traffic congestion. Next we discuss higher order multivariate cumulants that are
non-zero if multivariate distribution is non-Gaussian. However, the relation between cumulants
and copulas is not straight forward and rather complicated. We discuss the application of those
cumulants to extract information about non-Gaussian multivariate distributions, such that information
about non-Gaussian copulas. The use of higher order multivariate cumulants in computer science
is inspired by financial data analysis, especially by the safe investment portfolio evaluation.
There are many other applications of higher order multivariate cumulants in data engineering,
especially in: signal processing, non-linear system identification, blind sources separation,
and direction finding algorithms of multi-source signals.
