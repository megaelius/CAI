Aggression in online social networks has been studied up to now, mostly with several machine learning
methods which detect such behavior in a static context. However, the way aggression diffuses in
the network has received little attention as it embeds modeling challenges. In fact, modeling how
aggression propagates from one user to another, is an important research topic since it can enable
effective aggression monitoring, especially in media platforms which up to now apply simplistic
user blocking techniques. In this paper, we focus on how to model aggression propagation on Twitter,
since it is a popular microblogging platform at which aggression had several onsets. We propose
various methods building on two well-known diffusion models, Independent Cascade (IC) and Linear
Threshold (LT), to study the aggression evolution in the social network. We experimentally investigate
how well each method can model aggression propagation using real Twitter data, while varying parameters,
such as users selection for model seeding, weigh users' edges, users' activation timing, etc. Based
on the proposed approach, the best performing strategies are the ones to select seed users with a
degree-based approach, weigh user edges based on overlaps of their social circles, and activate
users while considering their aggression levels. We further employ the best performing models
to predict which ordinary real users could become aggressive (and vice versa) in the future, and
achieve up to AUC=0.89 in this prediction task. Finally, we investigate methods for minimizing
aggression, by launching competitive cascades to "inform" and "heal" aggressors. We show that
IC and LT models can be used in aggression minimization, thus providing less intrusive alternatives
to the blocking techniques currently employed by popular online social network platforms.
