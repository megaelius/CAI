In the encrypted network traffic intrusion detection, deep learning based schemes have attracted
lots of attention. However, in real-world scenarios, data is often insufficient (few-shot), which
leads to various deviations between the models prediction and the ground truth. Consequently,
downstream tasks such as unknown attack detection based on few-shot will be limited by insufficient
data. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown attack detection method based on Intra Categories
Generation in Embedding Space, namely SFE-GACN, which might be the solution of few-shot problem.
Concretely, we first proposed Session Feature Embedding (SFE) to summarize the context of sessions
(session is the basic granularity of network traffic), bring the insufficient data to the pre-trained
embedding space. In this way, we achieve the goal of preliminary information extension in the few-shot
case. Second, we further propose the Generative Adversarial Cooperative Network (GACN), which
improves the conventional Generative Adversarial Network by supervising the generated sample
to avoid falling into similar categories, and thus enables samples to generate intra categories.
Our proposed SFE-GACN can accurately generate session samples in the case of few-shot, and ensure
the difference between categories during data augmentation. The detection results show that,
compared to the state-of-the-art method, the average TPR is 8.38% higher, and the average FPR is
12.77% lower. In addition, we evaluated the graphics generation capabilities of GACN on the graphics
dataset, the result shows our proposed GACN can be popularized for generating easy-confused multi-categories
graphics.
