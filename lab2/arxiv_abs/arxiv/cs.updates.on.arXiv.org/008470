In this paper, we propose a compositional approach for verifying autonomous track-based traffic
control systems at runtime. This approach traces a sequence of changes propagated through the system
and verifies the system concerning the changed/adapted components. The system is modeled by multiple
interactive coordinated actor models, where each coordinated actor model corresponds to a component
of the system. Each component interacts with several components, called its environment components.
We define the operational semantics of a coordinated actor model and the multiple interactive coordinated
actor models based on Timed Input Output Transition System (TIOTS). We call two (or more) TIOTSs
composable if they do not reach an error state in their parallel composition. By detecting a change
in a component, the component is adapted. If TIOTSs of the adapted component and its environment
components are composable, the change does not propagate to the environment components and correctness
constraints of the system are preserved. Otherwise, the change is propagated. In this case, all
components affected by the change are adapted and are composed to form a composite component. It
is then checked whether TIOTSs of the composite component and its environment components are composable.
This procedure continues until the change does not propagate. To reduce the state space, for checking
the composability we use a reduced version of the TIOTSs of the environment components. We implement
our approach in the Ptolemy II framework. The results of our experiments indicate that the proposed
approach improves the model checking time and the memory consumption.
