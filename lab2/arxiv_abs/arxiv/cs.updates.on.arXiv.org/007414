Object-oriented software has some features such as encapsulation, inheritance, cohesion, coupling
and polymorphism. These features significantly affect the testing, maintenance and repair activities
of object-oriented softwares. The successfully conclusion of these activities, depends on correct
detect and correct interpretation of metrics will be evaluated. Also safely and rapidly evaluation
of this metrics, is possible but by developing and using the software testing tools. Nowadays, many
software testing tools that there are for object-oriented metrics. However, there are some limitations
on the capabilities of this tools. Many of the this tools produces only metric findings, does not
take any action in the point what this findings mean and how it affects the quality of the software.
Therefore, diversifying and increasing capabilities of these tools is required. Based on the limitations
of software testing tools mentioned in this study, is intended to provide the automation by expert
system approach to object-oriented testing process. For this purpose, an expert module that review
and interpret the metric findings, that providing information about the internal quality attributes
of a project (.jar extension) developed according to object-oriented programming methodology
have been developed. Metric suite that developed by Chidamber and Kemerer (C&K) have been used in
this modul. This module, metric findings obtained by software testing tool named Metrics, has the
evaluation feature by methods automatic, manuel and cross-version comparison and the interpreting
the relationship between internal quality specifications. It has been expected that the betreffend
module to be a support element to white-box tests been valid in software testing activities.
