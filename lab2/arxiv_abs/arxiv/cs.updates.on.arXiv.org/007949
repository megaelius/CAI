In recent years, using drone, also known as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in close-distance visual
inspection has became an active area in many disciplines. However, many challenges still remain
before we can achieve autonomous inspection, especially when inspecting complex structures.
The complex civil structures, such as bridges, dams and wind turbines, are large-scale and geometrical
complicated. It requires sophisticated path planning algorithms to achieve close-distance inspection
and, at the same time, avoid collisions. In practice, directly deploying the path planning result
on such structures is error prone, costly, and full of hazards. In this paper, rely on micro quadrotor
UAV, the authors present an affordable experimental platform for testing drone-based path planning
result. The platform allows the users to conduct many path planning experiments at any time without
worrying expensive and time consuming outdoor test flying. This platform is developed based on
the bundle of Crazyflie, which includes Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor, Crazyradio and loco positioning
system (LPS). Equipped with an onboard micro FPV camera, the visual data can be lively streamed to
the host computer during flight. The functions of manual configuration and waypoints control are
explicitly designed in this platform to increase its flexibility and performance on path following
and debugging. To evaluate the practicability of the proposed test platform, two existing drone-based
path planning algorithms are tested. The results show that even though certain level of error existed,
the quality of visual data and accuracy of path following are high enough for simulating most practical
inspection applications.
