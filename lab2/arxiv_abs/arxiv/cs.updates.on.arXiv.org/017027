We study the problem of distributed hypothesis testing over a network of mobile agents. Each agent
follows a planned trajectory and makes noisy local observations whose distribution is conditioned
on the unknown true hypothesis (out of a finite set of candidate hypotheses) and the agent's current
location. Due to the limited communication and sensing ranges, the mobile agent team induces a communication
graph with a time-varying topology and needs to collaboratively detect the true hypothesis. In
particular, we consider a scenario where there exists an unknown subset of compromised agents that
may deliberately share altered information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed
algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs, namely local and actual beliefs.
In both algorithms, at every time step, each agent shares its actual belief with other agents within
its communication range, makes a local observation, and updates its local belief as a function of
its local observation and local belief. Then both algorithms can use the shared information to update
actual beliefs under certain conditions. One requires receiving a certain number of shared beliefs
at each time instant; the other accumulates shared beliefs over time and updates after the number
of shared beliefs exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agent's
current local belief and actual beliefs to update the new actual belief. We prove under mild assumptions
that the actual belief for every non-compromised agent converges almost surely to the true hypothesis.
We guarantee this convergence without requiring that the underlying time-varying network topology
is connected. We illustrate and compare the proposed algorithms with a simulation of a team of unmanned
aerial vehicles aiming to classify adversarial agents among themselves.
