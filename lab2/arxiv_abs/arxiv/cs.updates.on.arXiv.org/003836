We present WISER, a new semantic search engine for expert finding in academia. Our system is unsupervised
and it jointly combines classical language modeling techniques, based on text evidences, with
the Wikipedia Knowledge Graph, via entity linking. WISER indexes each academic author through
a novel profiling technique which models her expertise with a small, labeled and weighted graph
drawn from Wikipedia. Nodes in this graph are the Wikipedia entities mentioned in the author's publications,
whereas the weighted edges express the semantic relatedness among these entities computed via
textual and graph-based relatedness functions. Every node is also labeled with a relevance score
which models the pertinence of the corresponding entity to author's expertise, and is computed
by means of a proper random-walk calculation over that graph; and with a latent vector representation
which is learned via entity and other kinds of structural embeddings derived from Wikipedia. At
query time, experts are retrieved by combining classic document-centric approaches, which exploit
the occurrences of query terms in the author's documents, with a novel set of profile-centric scoring
strategies, which compute the semantic relatedness between the author's expertise and the query
topic via the above graph-based profiles. The effectiveness of our system is established over a
large-scale experimental test on a standard dataset for this task. We show that WISER achieves better
performance than all the other competitors, thus proving the effectiveness of modelling author's
profile via our "semantic" graph of entities. Finally, we comment on the use of WISER for indexing
and profiling the whole research community within the University of Pisa, and its application to
technology transfer in our University.
