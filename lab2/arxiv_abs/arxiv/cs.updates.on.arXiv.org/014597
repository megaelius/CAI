A generative adversarial network (GAN) based fully automatic electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia
classification system with high performance is presented in this paper. We have designed a discriminator
(D) to take ECG coupling matrix as input, and then predict the input validity (real or generated)
as well as arrhythmia classes. The generator (G) in our GAN is designed to generate various coupling
matrix inputs conditioned on different arrhythmia classes for data augmentation. Upon completion
of training for our GAN, we extracted the trained D as an arrhythmia classifier in a transfer learning
manner. After fine-tuning D by including patient-specific normal beats estimated using an unsupervised
algorithm, and generated abnormal beats by G that are usually rare to obtain, our fully automatic
system showed superior overall classification performance for both supraventricular ectopic
beats (SVEB or S beats) and ventricular ectopic beats (VEB or V beats) on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.
It surpassed several state-of-art automatic classifiers and can perform on similar levels as some
expert-assisted methods. In particular, the F1 score of SVEB has been improved by up to 12% over the
top-performing automatic systems. Moreover, high sensitivity for both SVEB (85%) and VEB (93%)
detection has been achieved, which is of great value for practical diagnosis. We, therefore, suggest
our ACE-GAN (Generative Adversarial Network with Auxiliary Classifier for Electrocardiogram)
based automatic system can be a promising and reliable tool for high throughput clinical screening
practice, without any need of manual intervene or expert assisted labeling.
