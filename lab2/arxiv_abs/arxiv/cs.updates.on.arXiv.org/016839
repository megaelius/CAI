There has been a growing interest within CSCW community in understanding the characteristics of
misinformation propagated through computational media, and the devising techniques to address
the associated challenges. However, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in
the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the Global
South. This paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context
of Bangladesh, a country in the Global South. The spread of misinformation on Facebook in Bangladesh,
a country with a population over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings.
By interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed
the current state of verifying misinformation in Bangladesh. Our findings show that most people
in the `news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that
they see online. However, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online information
is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity given the amount of information being
published online everyday. We further find that the voluntary fact-checkers in Bangladesh are
not equipped with sufficient infrastructural support to fill in this gap. We show how our findings
are connected to some of the core concerns of CSCW community around social media, collaboration,
infrastructural politics, and information inequality. From our analysis, we also suggest several
pathways to increase the impact of fact-checking efforts through collaboration, technology design,
and infrastructure development.
