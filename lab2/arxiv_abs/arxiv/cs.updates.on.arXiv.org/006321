Extreme-scale scientific applications can be more vulnerable to soft errors (transient faults)
as high-performance computing systems increase in scale. The common practice to evaluate the resilience
to faults of an application is random fault injection, a method that can be highly time consuming.
While resilience prediction modeling has been recently proposed to predict application resilience
in a faster way than fault injection, it can only predict a single class of fault manifestation (SDC)
and there is no evidence demonstrating that it can work on previously unseen programs, which greatly
limits its re-usability. We present PARIS, a resilience prediction method that addresses the problems
of existing prediction methods using machine learning. Using carefully-selected features and
a machine learning model, our method is able to make resilience predictions of three classes of fault
manifestations (success, SDC, and interruption) as opposed to one class like in current resilience
prediction modeling. The generality of our approach allows us to make prediction on new applications,
i.e., previously unseen applications, providing large applicability to our model. Our evaluation
on 125 programs shows that PARIS provides high prediction accuracy, 82% and 77% on average for predicting
the rate of success and interruption, respectively, while the state-of-the-art resilience prediction
model cannot predict them. When predicting the rate of SDC, PARIS provides much better accuracy
than the state-of-the-art (38% vs. -273%). PARIS is much faster (up to 450x speedup) than the traditional
method (random fault injection).
