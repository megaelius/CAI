Reconstruction and monitoring of displacement and strain fields is an important problem in engineering.
We analyze the remote and non-obtrusive methods of strain measurement based on photogrammetry
and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). The method is based on covering the photographed surface with
a pattern of speckles and comparing the images taken before and after the deformation. In this study,
a comprehensive literature review and comparative analysis of photogrammetric solutions is presented.
The analysis is based on a specially developed Digital Image Synthesizer To Reconstruct Strain
in Solids (DISTRESS) Simulator to generate synthetic images of displacement and stress fields
in order to investigate the intrinsic accuracy of the existing variants of DIC. We investigated
the Basic DIC and a commercial software VIC 2D, both based on displacement field reconstruction
with post processing strain determination based on numerical differentiation. We also investigated
what we call the Extended DIC where the strain field is determined independently of the displacement
field. While the Basic DIC and VIC 2D are faster, the Extended DIC delivers the best accuracy of strain
reconstruction. The speckle pattern is found to be playing a critical role in achieving high accuracy
for DIC. Increase in subset size for DIC does not significantly improves the accuracy, while the
smallest subset size depends on the speckle pattern and speckle size. Increase in the overall image
size provides more details but does not play significant role in improving the accuracy, while significantly
increasing the computation cost.
