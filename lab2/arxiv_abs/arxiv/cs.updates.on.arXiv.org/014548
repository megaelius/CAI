This chapter focuses on the performance enhancement brought by the addition of caching capabilities
to full-duplex (FD) radios in the context of ultra-dense networks (UDNs). More specifically, we
aim at showing that the interference footprint of such networks, i.e., the major bottleneck to overcome
to observe the theoretical FD throughput doubling at the network level, can be significantly reduced
thanks to edge caching. Fundamental results show that most of the gain, as compared to their half-duplex
(HD) counterparts, can be achieved by such networks only if costly modifications to their infrastructure
are performed and/or if high-rate signaling is exchanged between user equipments (UEs) over suitable
control links. Therefore, we aim at proposing a viable and cost-effective alternative to these
solutions based on pre-fetching locally popular contents at the network edge. We start by considering
an interference-rich scenario such as an ultra-dense FD small-cell network, in which several non-cooperative
FD base stations (BSs) serve their associated UEs while communicating with a wireless backhaul
node (BN) to retrieve the content to deliver. We then describe a geographical caching policy aiming
at capturing local files popularity and compute the corresponding cache-hit probability. Thereupon,
we calculate the probability of successful transmission of a file requested by a UE, either directly
by its serving small-cell base station (SBS) or by the corresponding BN: this quantity is then used
to lower-bound the throughput of the considered network. Our approach leverages tools from stochastic
geometry in order to guarantee both analytical tractability of the problem and generality of the
results. Our numerical simulations show that shifting from cache-free to cache-aided FD small-cell
networks yields a remarkable performance improvement.
