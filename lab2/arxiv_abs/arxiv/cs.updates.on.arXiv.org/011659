Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown good performance in polarimetric synthetic aperture
radar (PolSAR) image classification due to the automation of feature engineering. Excellent hand-crafted
architectures of CNNs incorporated the wisdom of human experts, which is an important reason for
CNN's success. However, the design of the architectures is a difficult problem, which needs a lot
of professional knowledge as well as computational resources. Moreover, the architecture designed
by hand might be suboptimal, because it is only one of thousands of unobserved but objective existed
paths. Considering that the success of deep learning is largely due to its automation of the feature
engineering process, how to design automatic architecture searching methods to replace the hand-crafted
ones is an interesting topic. In this paper, we explore the application of neural architecture search
(NAS) in PolSAR area for the first time. Different from the utilization of existing NAS methods,
we propose a differentiable architecture search (DAS) method which is customized for PolSAR classification.
The proposed DAS is equipped with a PolSAR tailored search space and an improved one-shot search
strategy. By DAS, the weights parameters and architecture parameters (corresponds to the hyperparameters
but not the topologies) can be optimized by stochastic gradient descent method during the training.
The optimized architecture parameters should be transformed into corresponding CNN architecture
and re-train to achieve high-precision PolSAR classification. In addition, complex-valued DAS
is developed to take into account the characteristics of PolSAR images so as to further improve the
performance. Experiments on three PolSAR benchmark datasets show that the CNNs obtained by searching
have better classification performance than the hand-crafted ones.
