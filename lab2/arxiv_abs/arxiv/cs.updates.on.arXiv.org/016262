Partially ordered automata are automata where the transition relation induces a partial order
on states. The expressive power of partially ordered automata is closely related to the expressivity
of fragments of first-order logic on finite words or, equivalently, to the language classes of the
levels of the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Several fragments (levels) have been intensively
investigated under various names. For instance, the fragment of first-order formulae with a single
existential block of quantifiers in prenex normal form is known as piecewise testable languages
or $J$-trivial languages. These languages are characterized by confluent partially ordered DFAs
or by complete, confluent, and self-loop-deterministic partially ordered NFAs (ptNFAs for short).
In this paper, we study the complexity of basic questions for several types of partially ordered
automata on finite words; namely, the questions of inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise
testability. The lower-bound complexity boils down to the complexity of universality. The universality
problem asks whether a system recognizes all words over its alphabet. For ptNFAs, the complexity
of universality decreases if the alphabet is fixed, but it is open if the alphabet may grow with the
number of states. We show that deciding universality for general ptNFAs is as hard as for general
NFAs. Our proof is a novel and nontrivial extension of our recent construction for self-loop-deterministic
partially ordered NFAs, a model strictly more expressive than ptNFAs. We provide a comprehensive
picture of the complexities of the problems of inclusion, equivalence, and ($k$-)piecewise testability
for the considered types of automata.
