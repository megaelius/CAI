Item-based Collaborative Filtering(short for ICF) has been widely adopted in recommender systems
in industry, owing to its strength in user interest modeling and ease in online personalization.
By constructing a user's profile with the items that the user has consumed, ICF recommends items
that are similar to the user's profile. With the prevalence of machine learning in recent years,
significant processes have been made for ICF by learning item similarity (or representation) from
data. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing works have only considered linear and shallow relationship
between items, which are insufficient to capture the complicated decision-making process of users.
In this work, we propose a more expressive ICF solution by accounting for the nonlinear and higher-order
relationship among items. Going beyond modeling only the second-order interaction (e.g. similarity)
between two items, we additionally consider the interaction among all interacted item pairs by
using nonlinear neural networks. Through this way, we can effectively model the higher-order relationship
among items, capturing more complicated effects in user decision-making. For example, it can differentiate
which historical itemsets in a user's profile are more important in affecting the user to make a purchase
decision on an item. We treat this solution as a deep variant of ICF, thus term it as DeepICF. To justify
our proposal, we perform empirical studies on two public datasets from MovieLens and Pinterest.
Extensive experiments verify the highly positive effect of higher-order item interaction modeling
with nonlinear neural networks. Moreover, we demonstrate that by more fine-grained second-order
interaction modeling with attention network, the performance of our DeepICF method can be further
improved.
