A comprehensive framework for detection and characterization of overlapping intrinsic symmetry
over 3D shapes is proposed. To identify prominent symmetric regions which overlap in space and vary
in form, the proposed framework is decoupled into a Correspondence Space Voting procedure followed
by a Transformation Space Mapping procedure. In the correspondence space voting procedure, significant
symmetries are first detected by identifying surface point pairs on the input shape that exhibit
local similarity in terms of their intrinsic geometry while simultaneously maintaining an intrinsic
distance structure at a global level. Since different point pairs can share a common point, the detected
symmetric shape regions can potentially overlap. To this end, a global intrinsic distance-based
voting technique is employed to ensure the inclusion of only those point pairs that exhibit significant
symmetry. In the transformation space mapping procedure, the Functional Map framework is employed
to generate the final map of symmetries between point pairs. The transformation space mapping procedure
ensures the retrieval of the underlying dense correspondence map throughout the 3D shape that follows
a particular symmetry. Additionally, the formulation of a novel cost matrix enables the inner product
to succesfully indicate the complexity of the underlying symmetry transformation. The proposed
transformation space mapping procedure is shown to result in the formulation of a semi-metric symmetry
space where each point in the space represents a specific symmetry transformation and the distance
between points represents the complexity between the corresponding transformations. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework can successfully process complex 3D shapes that possess
rich symmetries.
