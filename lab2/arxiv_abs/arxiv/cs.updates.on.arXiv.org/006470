We show that the uniform Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) parameterized by the size of the
solution is in W[1] (the problem is W[1]-hard and it is easy to place it in W[3]). We study the problem
on the Boolean domain, that is {0, 1}. The size of a solution is the number of variables that are mapped
to 1. Named by Kolaitis and Vardi (2000), uniform CSP means that the input contains the domain and
the list of tuples of each relation in the instance. Uniform CSP is polynomial time equivalent to
homomorphism problem and also to evaluation of conjunctive queries on relational databases. It
also has applications in artificial intelligence. We do not restrict the problem to any (finite
or infinite) family of relations. Uniform CSP restricted to some finite family of Boolean relations
(thus with a bound on the arity of relations) can easily be placed in W[1]. Marx (2005) proved that
any such problem is either W[1]-complete or fixed parameter tractable. Together with Bulatov (2014)
they extended this result to any finite domain. Our proof gives a nondeterministic RAM program with
special properties deciding the problem. First defined by Chen et al. (2005), such programs characterize
W[1]. Our work builds upon the work of Cesati (2002), which, answering a longstanding open question,
shows that parameterized Exact Weighted CNF is in W[1]. This problem is equivalent to uniform CSP
restricted to a specific (infinite) family of Boolean relations, where a tuple is in a relation,
if and only if the tuple has exactly one 1. Thus, our result generalizes that of Cesati in at least two
ways: The size of the tuples in the relation are not bounded, and the relations do not need to be symmetric.
