Condition-based and predictive maintenance enable early detection of critical system conditions
and thereby enable decision makers to forestall faults and mitigate them. However, decision makers
also need to take the operational and production needs into consideration for optimal decision-making
when scheduling maintenance activities. Particularly in network systems, such as power grids,
decisions on the maintenance of single assets can affect the entire network and are, therefore,
more complex. This paper proposes a two-level multi-agent decision support systems for the generation
maintenance decision (GMS) of power grids in an electricity markets. The aim of the GMS is to minimize
the generation cost while maximizing the system reliability. The proposed framework integrates
a central coordination system, i.e. the transmission system operator (TSO), and distributed agents
representing power generation units that act to maximize their profit and decide about the optimal
maintenance time slots while ensuring the fulfilment of the energy demand. The objective function
of agents (power generation companies) is based on the reward and the penalty that they obtain from
the interplay between power production and loss of production due to failure, respectively. The
optimal strategy of agents is then derived using a distributed algorithm, where agents choose their
optimal maintenance decision and send their decisions to the central coordinating system. The
TSO decides whether to accept the agents' decisions by considering the market reliability aspects
and power supply constraints. To solve this coordination problem, we propose a negotiation algorithm
using an incentive signal to coordinate the agents' and central system's decisions such that all
the agents' decisions can be accepted by the central system. We demonstrate the efficiency of our
proposed algorithm using a IEEE 39 bus system.
