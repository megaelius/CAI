Existing block-diagonal representation researches mainly focuses on casting block-diagonal
regularization on training data, while only little attention is dedicated to concurrently learning
both block-diagonal representations of training and test data. In this paper, we propose a discriminative
block-diagonal low-rank representation (BDLRR) method for recognition. In particular, the elaborate
BDLRR is formulated as a joint optimization problem of shrinking the unfavorable representation
from off-block-diagonal elements and strengthening the compact block-diagonal representation
under the semi-supervised framework of low-rank representation. To this end, we first impose penalty
constraints on the negative representation to eliminate the correlation between different classes
such that the incoherence criterion of the extra-class representation is boosted. Moreover, a
constructed subspace model is developed to enhance the self-expressive power of training samples
and further build the representation bridge between the training and test samples, such that the
coherence of the learned intra-class representation is consistently heightened. Finally, the
resulting optimization problem is solved elegantly by employing an alternative optimization
strategy, and a simple recognition algorithm on the learned representation is utilized for final
prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superb
recognition results on four face image datasets, three character datasets, and the fifteen scene
multi-categories dataset. It not only shows superior potential on image recognition but also outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.
