Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a sudden decline in kidney function, is associated with increased mortality,
morbidity, length of stay, and hospital cost. Since AKI is sometimes preventable, there is great
interest in prediction. Most existing studies consider all patients and therefore restrict to
features available in the first hours of hospitalization. Here, the focus is instead on rehospitalized
patients, a cohort in which rich longitudinal features from prior hospitalizations can be analyzed.
Our objective is to provide a risk score directly at hospital re-entry. Gradient boosting, penalized
logistic regression (with and without stability selection), and a recurrent neural network are
trained on two years of adult inpatient EHR data (3,387 attributes for 34,505 patients who generated
90,013 training samples with 5,618 cases and 84,395 controls). Predictions are internally evaluated
with 50 iterations of 5-fold grouped cross-validation with special emphasis on calibration, an
analysis of which is performed at the patient as well as hospitalization level. Error is assessed
with respect to diagnosis, ethnicity, age, gender, AKI identification method, and hospital utilization.
In an additional experiment, the regularization penalty is severely increased to induce parsimony
and interpretability. Predictors identified for rehospitalized patients are also reported with
a special analysis of medications that might be modifiable risk factors. Insights from this study
might be used to construct a predictive tool for AKI in rehospitalized patients. An accurate estimate
of AKI risk at hospital entry might serve as a prior for an admitting provider or another predictive
algorithm.
