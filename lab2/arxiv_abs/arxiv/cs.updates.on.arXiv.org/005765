Human heartbeat can be measured using several different ways appropriately based on the patient
condition which includes contact base such as measured by using instruments and non-contact base
such as computer vision assisted techniques. Non-contact based approached are getting popular
due to those techniques are capable of mitigating some of the limitations of contact-based techniques
especially in clinical section. However, existing vision guided approaches are not able to prove
high accurate result due to various reason such as the property of camera, illumination changes,
skin tones in face image, etc. We propose a technique that uses video as an input and returns pulse
rate in output. Initially, key point detection is carried out on two facial subregions: forehead
and nose-mouth. After removing unstable features, the temporal filtering is applied to isolate
frequencies of interest. Then four component analysis methods are employed in order to distinguish
the cardiovascular pulse signal from extraneous noise caused by respiration, vestibular activity
and other changes in facial expression. Afterwards, proposed peak detection technique is applied
for each component which extracted from one of the four different component selection algorithms.
This will enable to locate the positions of peaks in each component. Proposed automatic components
selection technique is employed in order to select an optimal component which will be used to calculate
the heartbeat. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of four component analysis methods (PCA,
FastICA, JADE, SHIBBS), processing face video datasets of fifteen volunteers with verification
by an ECG/EKG Workstation as a ground truth.
