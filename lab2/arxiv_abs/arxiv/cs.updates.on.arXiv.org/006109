The Sum of Squares (SoS) hierarchy gives an automatized technique to create a family of increasingly
tight convex relaxations for binary programs. There are several problems for which a constant number
of rounds of the hierarchy give integrality gaps matching the best known approximation algorithm.
In many other, however, ad-hoc techniques give significantly better approximation ratios. Notably,
the lower bounds instances, in many cases, are invariant under the action of a large permutation
group. The main purpose of this paper is to study how the presence of symmetries on a formulation degrades
the performance of the relaxation obtained by the SoS hierarchy. We do so for the special case of the
minimum makespan problem on identical machines. Our first result is to show that a linear number
of rounds of SoS applied over the \emph{configuration linear program} yields an integrality gap
of at least $1.0009$. This improves on the recent work by Kurpisz et al. [Math. Program. '18] that
shows an analogous result for the weaker LS$_+$ and SA hierarchies. Then, we consider the weaker
\emph{assignment linear program} and add a well chosen set of symmetry breaking inequalities that
removes a subset of the machine permutation symmetries. We show that applying the SoS hierarchy
for $O_\varepsilon(1)$ rounds to this linear program reduces the integrality gap to $(1+\varepsilon)$.
This is the first PTAS for this problem based purely on a convex optimization techniques. Our results
suggest that for this classical problem the symmetries of the natural assignment linear program
were the main barrier preventing the SoS hierarchy to give relaxations with integrality gap $(1+\varepsilon)$
after a constant number of rounds. We leave as an open question whether this phenomenon occurs for
different problems where the SoS hierarchy yields weak relaxations.
