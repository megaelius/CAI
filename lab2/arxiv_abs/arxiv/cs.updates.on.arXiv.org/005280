Low transaction throughput and poor scalability are significant issues in public blockchain consensus
protocols such as Bitcoins. Recent research efforts in this direction have proposed shard-based
consensus protocols where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or
shards), which then process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel processing
of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees significantly improves the overall
scalability and transaction throughout of the system. However, one significant research gap is
a lack of understanding of the strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such
shard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for designing appropriate
incentives that will foster cooperation within committees and prevent free-riding. In this paper,
we address this research gap by analyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model,
where each processor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in the protocol.
We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game model of the sharding protocol. We
show that depending on the reward sharing approach employed, processors can potentially increase
their payoff by unilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social dilemma.
In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel incentive-compatible reward sharing
mechanism to promote cooperation among processors. Our numerical results show that achieving
a majority of cooperating processors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network)
is easier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism than with
other reward sharing mechanisms.
