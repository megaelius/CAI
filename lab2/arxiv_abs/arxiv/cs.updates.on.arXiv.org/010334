A delegation scheme allows a computationally weak client to use a server's resources to help it evaluate
a complex circuit without leaking any information about the input (other than its length) to the
server. In this paper, we consider delegation schemes for quantum circuits, where we try to minimize
the quantum operations needed by the client. We construct a new scheme for delegating a large circuit
family, which we call "C+P circuits". "C+P" circuits are the circuits composed of Toffoli gates
and diagonal gates. Our scheme is non-interactive, requires very little quantum computation from
the client (proportional to input length but independent of the circuit size), and can be proved
secure in the quantum random oracle model, without relying on additional assumptions, such as the
existence of fully homomorphic encryption. In practice the random oracle can be replaced by an appropriate
hash function or block cipher, for example, SHA-3, AES. This protocol allows a client to delegate
the most expensive part of some quantum algorithms, for example, Shor's algorithm. The previous
protocols that are powerful enough to delegate Shor's algorithm require either many rounds of interactions
or the existence of FHE. The protocol requires asymptotically fewer quantum gates on the client
side compared to running Shor's algorithm locally. To hide the inputs, our scheme uses an encoding
that maps one input qubit to multiple qubits. We then provide a novel generalization of classical
garbled circuits ("reversible garbled circuits") to allow the computation of Toffoli circuits
on this encoding. We also give a technique that can support the computation of phase gates on this
encoding. To prove the security of this protocol, we study key dependent message(KDM) security
in the quantum random oracle model. KDM security was not previously studied in quantum settings.
