Reliability and fault tolerance are critical attributes of embedded cyber-physical systems that
require a high safety-integrity level. For such systems, the use of formal functional safety specifications
has been strongly advocated in most industrial safety standards, but reliability and fault tolerance
have traditionally been treated as platform issues. We believe that addressing reliability and
fault tolerance at the functional safety level widens the scope for resource optimization, targeting
those functionalities that are safety-critical, rather than the entire platform. Moreover, for
software based control functionalities, temporal redundancies have become just as important
as replication of physical resources, and such redundancies can be modeled at the functional specification
level. The ability to formally model functional reliability at a specification level enables early
estimation of physical resources and computation bandwidth requirements. In this paper we propose,
for the first time, a resource estimation methodology from a formal functional safety specification
augmented by reliability annotations. The proposed reliability specification is overlaid on
the safety-critical functional specification and our methodology extracts a constraint satisfaction
problem for determining the optimal set of resources for meeting the reliability target for the
safety-critical behaviors. We use SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) / ILP (Integer Linear
Programming) solvers at the back end to solve the optimization problem, and demonstrate the feasibility
of our methodology on a Satellite Launch Vehicle Navigation, Guidance and Control (NGC) System.
