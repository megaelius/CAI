We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer,
and overcome two fundamental challenges of decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e., data leakage
and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between
the blockchain transparency and the data confidentiality to guarantee the basic utilities/fairness
requirements of data crowdsourcing, thus ensuring: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data
deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each
worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above
properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to
the open blockchain. Second, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information
about workers and requesters through their participation history. Simply enabling anonymity
is seemingly attempting but will allow malicious workers to submit multiple times to reap rewards.
ZebraLancer also overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without
sacrificing accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice
to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks.
To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e., the common-prefix-linkable
anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent
interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in
a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol atop the existing
real-world blockchain.
