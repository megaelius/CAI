Fixed and mobile telecom operators, enterprise network operators and cloud providers strive to
face the challenging demands coming from the evolution of IP networks (e.g. huge bandwidth requirements,
integration of billions of devices and millions of services in the cloud). Proposed in the early
2010s, Segment Routing (SR) architecture helps face these challenging demands, and it is currently
being adopted and deployed. SR architecture is based on the concept of source routing and has interesting
scalability properties, as it dramatically reduces the amount of state information to be configured
in the core nodes to support complex services. SR architecture was first implemented with the MPLS
dataplane and then, quite recently, with the IPv6 dataplane (SRv6). IPv6 SR architecture (SRv6)
has been extended from the simple steering of packets across nodes to a general network programming
approach, making it very suitable for use cases such as Service Function Chaining and Network Function
Virtualization. In this paper we present a tutorial and a comprehensive survey on SR technology,
analyzing standardization efforts, patents, research activities and implementation results.
We start with an introduction on the motivations for Segment Routing and an overview of its evolution
and standardization. Then, we provide a tutorial on Segment Routing technology, with a focus on
the novel SRv6 solution. We discuss the standardization efforts and the patents providing details
on the most important documents and mentioning other ongoing activities. We then thoroughly analyze
research activities according to a taxonomy. We have identified 8 main categories during our analysis
of the current state of play: Monitoring, Traffic Engineering, Failure Recovery, Centrally Controlled
Architectures, Path Encoding, Network Programming, Performance Evaluation and Miscellaneous...
