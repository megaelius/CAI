In recent years, there has been increased research interest in detecting anomalies in temporal
streaming data. A variety of algorithms have been developed in the data mining community, which
can be divided into two categories (i.e., general and ad hoc). In most cases, general approaches
assume the one-size-fits-all solution model where a single anomaly detector can detect all anomalies
in any domain. To date, there exists no single general method that has been shown to outperform the
others across different anomaly types, use cases and datasets. In this paper, we propose SAFARI,
a general framework formulated by abstracting and unifying the fundamental tasks in streaming
anomaly detection, which provides a flexible and extensible anomaly detection procedure to overcome
the limitations of one-size-fits-all solutions. SAFARI helps to facilitate more elaborate algorithm
comparisons by allowing us to isolate the effects of shared and unique characteristics of different
algorithms on detection performance. Using SAFARI, we have implemented various anomaly detectors
and identified a research gap that motivates us to propose a novel learning strategy in this work.
We conducted an extensive evaluation study of 20 detectors that are composed using SAFARI and compared
their performances using real-world benchmark datasets with different properties. The results
indicate that there is no single superior detector that works well for every case, proving our hypothesis
that "there is no free lunch" in the streaming anomaly detection world. Finally, we discuss the benefits
and drawbacks of each method in-depth and draw a set of conclusions to guide future users of SAFARI.
