Although many algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem are well-understood theoretically,
empirical confirmation of their effectiveness is generally scarce. This paper presents a thorough
empirical study of the most popular multi-armed bandit algorithms. Three important observations
can be made from our results. Firstly, simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy and Boltzmann exploration
outperform theoretically sound algorithms on most settings by a significant margin. Secondly,
the performance of most algorithms varies dramatically with the parameters of the bandit problem.
Our study identifies for each algorithm the settings where it performs well, and the settings where
it performs poorly. Thirdly, the algorithms' performance relative each to other is affected only
by the number of bandit arms and the variance of the rewards. This finding may guide the design of subsequent
empirical evaluations. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention to an important area
of application of bandit algorithms: clinical trials. Although the design of clinical trials has
been one of the principal practical problems motivating research on multi-armed bandits, bandit
algorithms have never been evaluated as potential treatment allocation strategies. Using data
from a real study, we simulate the outcome that a 2001-2002 clinical trial would have had if bandit
algorithms had been used to allocate patients to treatments. We find that an adaptive trial would
have successfully treated at least 50% more patients, while significantly reducing the number
of adverse effects and increasing patient retention. At the end of the trial, the best treatment
could have still been identified with a high level of statistical confidence. Our findings demonstrate
that bandit algorithms are attractive alternatives to current adaptive treatment allocation
strategies.
