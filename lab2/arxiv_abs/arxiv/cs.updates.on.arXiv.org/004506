Landauer's Principle that information loss from a computation implies entropy increase can be
rigorously proved from mathematical physics. However, carefully examining its detailed formulation
reveals that the traditional identification of logically reversible computational operations
with bijective transformations of the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level
characterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can be carried out
physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. To find the correct logical conditions
for physical reversibility, we must account for initial-state probabilities when applying the
Principle. The minimal logical-level requirement for the physical reversibility of deterministic
computational operations is that the subset of initial states that exhibit nonzero probability
in a given statistical operating context must be transformed one-to-one into final states. Thus,
any computational operation is conditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive
precondition on its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any deterministic
operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0 when the probability of meeting
any preselected one of its suitable preconditions approaches 1. This realization facilitates
simpler designs for asymptotically thermodynamically reversible computational hardware, compared
to designs that are restricted to using only fully-bijective operations such as Toffoli type operations.
Thus, this more general framework for reversible computing provides a more effective theoretical
foundation to use for the design of practical reversible computers than does the more restrictive
traditional model of reversible logic. In this paper, we formally develop the theoretical foundations
of the generalized model, and briefly survey some of its applications.
