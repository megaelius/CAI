We develop a novel method for measuring the similarity between complete weighted graphs, which
are probed by means of discrete-time quantum walks. Directly probing complete graphs using discrete-time
quantum walks is intractable due to the cost of simulating the quantum walk. We overcome this problem
by extracting a commute-time minimum spanning tree from the complete weighted graph. The spanning
tree is probed by a discrete time quantum walk which is initialised using a weighted version of the
Perron-Frobenius operator. This naturally encapsulates the edge weight information for the spanning
tree extracted from the original graph. For each pair of complete weighted graphs to be compared,
we simulate a discrete-time quantum walk on each of the corresponding commute time minimum spanning
trees, and then compute the associated density matrices for the quantum walks. The probability
of the walk visiting each edge of the spanning tree is given by the diagonal elements of the density
matrices. The similarity between each pair of graphs is then computed using either a) the inner product
or b) the negative exponential of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the probability distributions.
We show that in both cases the resulting similarity measure is positive definite and therefore corresponds
to a kernel on the graphs. We perform a series of experiments on publicly available graph datasets
from a variety of different domains, together with time-varying financial networks extracted
from data for the New York Stock Exchange. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed similarity measures.
