Chemical multisensor devices need calibration algorithms to estimate gas concentrations. Their
possible adoption as indicative air quality measurements devices poses new challenges due to the
need to operate in continuous monitoring modes in uncontrolled environments. Several issues,
including slow dynamics, continue to affect their real world performances. At the same time, the
need for estimating pollutant concentrations on board the devices, espe- cially for wearables
and IoT deployments, is becoming highly desirable. In this framework, several calibration approaches
have been proposed and tested on a variety of proprietary devices and datasets; still, no thorough
comparison is available to researchers. This work attempts a benchmarking of the most promising
calibration algorithms according to recent literature with a focus on machine learning approaches.
We test the techniques against absolute and dynamic performances, generalization capabilities
and computational/storage needs using three different datasets sharing continuous monitoring
operation methodology. Our results can guide researchers and engineers in the choice of optimal
strategy. They show that non-linear multivariate techniques yield reproducible results, outperforming
lin- ear approaches. Specifically, the Support Vector Regression method consistently shows good
performances in all the considered scenarios. We highlight the enhanced suitability of shallow
neural networks in a trade-off between performance and computational/storage needs. We confirm,
on a much wider basis, the advantages of dynamic approaches with respect to static ones that only
rely on instantaneous sensor array response. The latter have been shown to be best choice whenever
prompt and precise response is needed.
