The methodological foundations of the construction of information technology, formalized models
and tools for the implementation of the research-related design of smart systems based on the use
of the concepts of transdisciplinarity and ontological management are considered. Designed to
build systems of work with knowledge, scientific and technical creativity, including the development
of objects of new technology. Designed to build systems of work with knowledge, scientific and technical
creativity, including the development of objects of new technology. Results. The information
technology of research-related design of smart systems is developed. An example of the creation
and patenting of a linguistic processor for processing large amounts of text data with the purpose
of subsequent extraction of knowledge is considered. Conclusion. The methodological foundations
of the development of scientific research design systems include models, technology, and tools
for cognitive processes of information processing, including the design of the new engineering
objects, the automated development of ontological knowledge bases of the knowledge domain. The
last ones are the basic components of intelligent technologies and systems for comprehensive scientific
research of the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature. The process of system integration
of ontologies makes it possible to investigate the interaction of object knowledge, as an object
at the intersection of disciplines, as well as in clusters of convergence, which opens opportunities
for new knowledge and for the development of scientific theories. Keywords: research design, smart
system, ontological management, ontology.
