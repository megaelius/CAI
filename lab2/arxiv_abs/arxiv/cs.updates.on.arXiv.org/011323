Integro-difference equation (IDE) models describe the conditional dependence between the spatial
process at a future time point and the process at the present time point through an integral operator.
Nonlinearity or temporal dependence in the dynamics is often captured by allowing the operator
parameters to vary temporally, or by re-fitting a model with a temporally-invariant linear operator
at each time point in a sliding window. Both procedures tend to be excellent for prediction purposes
over small time horizons, but are generally time-consuming and, crucially, do not provide a global
prior model for the temporally-varying dynamics that is realistic. Here, we tackle these two issues
by using a deep convolution neural network (CNN) in a hierarchical statistical IDE framework, where
the CNN is designed to extract process dynamics from the process' most recent behaviour. Once the
CNN is fitted, probabilistic forecasting can be done extremely quickly online using an ensemble
Kalman filter with no requirement for repeated parameter estimation. We conduct an experiment
where we train the model using 13 years of daily sea-surface temperature data in the North Atlantic
Ocean. Forecasts are seen to be accurate and calibrated. A key advantage of our approach is that the
CNN provides a global prior model for the dynamics that is realistic, interpretable, and computationally
efficient. We show the versatility of the approach by successfully producing 10-minute nowcasts
of weather radar reflectivities in Sydney using the same model that was trained on daily sea-surface
temperature data in the North Atlantic Ocean.
