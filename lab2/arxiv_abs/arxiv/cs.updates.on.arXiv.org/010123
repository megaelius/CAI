The s-box plays the vital role of creating confusion between the ciphertext and secret key in any
cryptosystem, and is the only nonlinear component in many block ciphers. Dynamic s-boxes, as compared
to static, improve entropy of the system, hence leading to better resistance against linear and
differential attacks. It was shown in [1] that while incorporating dynamic s-boxes in cryptosystems
is sufficiently secure, they do not keep non-linearity invariant. This work provides an algorithmic
scheme to generate key-dependent dynamic $n\times n$ clone s-boxes having the same algebraic properties
namely bijection, nonlinearity, the strict avalanche criterion (SAC), the output bits independence
criterion (BIC) as of the initial seed s-box. The method is based on group action of symmetric group
$S_n$ and a subgroup $S_{2^n}$ respectively on columns and rows of Boolean functions ($GF(2^n)\to
GF(2)$) of s-box. Invariance of the bijection, nonlinearity, SAC, and BIC for the generated clone
copies is proved. As illustration, examples are provided for $n=8$ and $n=4$ along with comparison
of the algebraic properties of the clone and initial seed s-box. The proposed method is an extension
of [2,3,4,5] which involved group action of $S_8$ only on columns of Boolean functions ($GF(2^8)\to
GF(2)$ ) of s-box. For $n=4$, we have used an initial $4\times 4$ s-box constructed by Carlisle Adams
and Stafford Tavares [6] to generated $(4!)^2$ clone copies. For $n=8$, it can be seen [2,3,4,5]
that the number of clone copies that can be constructed by permuting the columns is $8!$. For each
column permutation, the proposed method enables to generate $8!$ clone copies by permuting the
rows.
