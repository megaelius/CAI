We introduce the \emph{idemetric} property, which formalises the idea that most nodes in a graph
have similar distances between them, and which turns out to be quite standard amongst small-world
network models. Modulo reasonable sparsity assumptions, we are then able to show that a strong form
of idemetricity is actually equivalent to a very weak expander condition (PUMP). This provides
a direct way of providing short proofs that small-world network models such as the Watts-Strogatz
model are strongly idemetric (for a wide range of parameters), and also provides further evidence
that being idemetric is a common property. We then consider how satisfaction of the idemetric property
is relevant to algorithm design. For idemetric graphs we observe, for example, that a single breadth-first
search provides a solution to the all-pairs shortest paths problem, so long as one is prepared to
accept paths which are of stretch close to 2 with high probability. Since we are able to show that Kleinberg's
model is idemetric, these results contrast nicely with the well known negative results of Kleinberg
concerning efficient decentralised algorithms for finding short paths: for precisely the same
model as Kleinberg's negative results hold, we are able to show that very efficient (and decentralised)
algorithms exist if one allows for reasonable preprocessing. For deterministic distributed routing
algorithms we are also able to obtain results proving that less routing information is required
for idemetric graphs than the worst case in order to achieve stretch less than 3 with high probability:
while $\Omega(n^2)$ routing information is required in the worst case for stretch strictly less
than 3 on almost all pairs, for idemetric graphs the total routing information required is $O(nlog(n))$.
