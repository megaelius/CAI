Automatic speaker verification (ASV) is one of the most natural and convenient means of biometric
person recognition. Unfortunately, just like all other biometric systems, ASV is vulnerable to
spoofing, also referred to as "presentation attacks." These vulnerabilities are generally unacceptable
and call for spoofing countermeasures or "presentation attack detection" systems. In addition
to impersonation, ASV systems are vulnerable to replay, speech synthesis, and voice conversion
attacks. The ASVspoof 2019 edition is the first to consider all three spoofing attack types within
a single challenge. While they originate from the same source database and same underlying protocol,
they are explored in two specific use case scenarios. Spoofing attacks within a logical access (LA)
scenario are generated with the latest speech synthesis and voice conversion technologies, including
state-of-the-art neural acoustic and waveform model techniques. Replay spoofing attacks within
a physical access (PA) scenario are generated through carefully controlled simulations that support
much more revealing analysis than possible previously. Also new to the 2019 edition is the use of
the tandem detection cost function metric, which reflects the impact of spoofing and countermeasures
on the reliability of a fixed ASV system. This paper describes the database design, protocol, spoofing
attack implementations, and baseline ASV and countermeasure results. It also describes a human
assessment on spoofed data in logical access. It was demonstrated that the spoofing data in the ASVspoof
2019 database have varied degrees of perceived quality and similarity to the target speakers, including
spoofed data that cannot be differentiated from bona-fide utterances even by human subjects.
