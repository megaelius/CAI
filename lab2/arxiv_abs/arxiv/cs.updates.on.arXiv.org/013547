Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of wireless propagation environment
has recently emerged as a promising cost-effective technology for boosting the spectrum and energy
efficiency in future wireless communication systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on the
ideal phase shift model assuming the full signal reflection by each of the elements regardless of
its phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in
this paper the practical phase shift model that captures the phase-dependent amplitude variation
in the element-wise reflection coefficient. Based on the proposed model and considering an IRS-aided
multiuser system with an IRS deployed to assist in the downlink communications from a multi-antenna
access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize
the total transmit power at the AP by jointly designing the AP transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect
beamforming, subject to the users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
constraints. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find suboptimal solutions to this problem efficiently
by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) or penalty-based optimization technique. Moreover,
we analyze the asymptotic performance loss of the IRS-aided system that employs practical phase
shifters but assumes the ideal phase shift model for beamforming optimization, as the number of
IRS elements goes to infinity. Simulation results unveil substantial performance gains achieved
by the proposed beamforming optimization based on the practical phase shift model as compared to
the conventional ideal model.
