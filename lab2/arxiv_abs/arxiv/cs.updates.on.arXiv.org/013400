While there have been significant advances in de-tecting emotions in text, in the field of utter-ance-level
emotion recognition (ULER), there are still many problems to be solved. In this paper, we address
some challenges in ULER in dialog sys-tems. (1) The same utterance can deliver different emotions
when it is in different contexts or from different speakers. (2) Long-range contextual in-formation
is hard to effectively capture. (3) Unlike the traditional text classification problem, this task
is supported by a limited number of datasets, among which most contain inadequate conversa-tions
or speech. To address these problems, we propose a hierarchical transformer framework (apart from
the description of other studies, the "transformer" in this paper usually refers to the encoder
part of the transformer) with a lower-level transformer to model the word-level input and an upper-level
transformer to capture the context of utterance-level embeddings. We use a pretrained language
model bidirectional encoder representa-tions from transformers (BERT) as the lower-level transformer,
which is equivalent to introducing external data into the model and solve the problem of data shortage
to some extent. In addition, we add speaker embeddings to the model for the first time, which enables
our model to capture the in-teraction between speakers. Experiments on three dialog emotion datasets,
Friends, EmotionPush, and EmoryNLP, demonstrate that our proposed hierarchical transformer
network models achieve 1.98%, 2.83%, and 3.94% improvement, respec-tively, over the state-of-the-art
methods on each dataset in terms of macro-F1.
