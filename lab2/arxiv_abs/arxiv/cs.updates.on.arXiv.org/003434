To facilitate monitoring and management, modern Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are often
equipped with wireless capabilities, which raise the risk of malicious access to IMDs. Although
schemes are proposed to secure the IMD access, some issues are still open. First, pre-sharing a long-term
key between a patient's IMD and a doctor's programmer is vulnerable since once the doctor's programmer
is compromised, all of her patients suffer; establishing a temporary key by leveraging proximity
gets rid of pre-shared keys, but as the approach lacks real authentication, it can be exploited by
nearby adversaries or through man-in-the-middle attacks. Second, while prolonging the lifetime
of IMDs is one of the most important design goals, few schemes explore to lower the communication
and computation overhead all at once. Finally, how to safely record the commands issued by doctors
for the purpose of forensics, which can be the last measure to protect the patients' rights, is commonly
omitted in the existing literature. Motivated by these important yet open problems, we propose
an innovative scheme e-SAFE, which significantly improves security and safety, reduces the communication
overhead and enables IMD-access forensics. We present a novel lightweight compressive sensing
based encryption algorithm to encrypt and compress the IMD data simultaneously, reducing the data
transmission overhead by over 50% while ensuring high data confidentiality and usability. Furthermore,
we provide a suite of protocols regarding device pairing, dual-factor authentication, and accountability-enabled
access. The security analysis and performance evaluation show the validity and efficiency of the
proposed scheme.
