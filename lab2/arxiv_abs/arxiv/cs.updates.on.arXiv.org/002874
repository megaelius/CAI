Tabulation audits for an election provide statistical evidence that a reported contest outcome
is "correct" (meaning that the tabulation of votes was properly performed), or else the tabulation
audit determines the correct outcome. Stark proposed risk-limiting tabulation audits for this
purpose; such audits are effective and are beginning to be used in practice. We expand the study of
election audits based on Bayesian methods, first introduced by Rivest and Shen in 2012. (The risk-limiting
audits proposed by Stark are "frequentist" rather than Bayesian in character.) We first provide
a simplified presentation of Bayesian tabulation audits. A Bayesian tabulation audit begins by
drawing a random sample of the votes in that contest, and tallying those votes. It then considers
what effect statistical variations of this tally have on the contest outcome. If such variations
almost always yield the previously-reported outcome, the audit terminates, accepting the reported
outcome. Otherwise the audit is repeated with an enlarged sample. Bayesian audits are attractive
because they work with any method for determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting). We
then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle more complex situations, such as auditing
contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions}, or are otherwise "stratified." We highlight
the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests where some of the jurisdictions have an electronic
cast vote record (CVR) for each cast paper vote, while the others do not. Complex situations such
as this may arise naturally when some counties in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while others
have not. Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations in a straightforward manner. We also
discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using Bayesian audits in practice.
