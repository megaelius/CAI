As is well known, the smallest possible ratio between the spectral norm and the Frobenius norm of
an $m \times n$ matrix with $m \le n$ is $1/\sqrt{m}$ and is (up to scalar scaling) attained only by
matrices having pairwise orthonormal rows. In the present paper, the smallest possible ratio between
spectral and Frobenius norms of $n_1 \times \dots \times n_d$ tensors of order $d$, also called the
best rank-one approximation ratio in the literature, is investigated. The exact value is not known
for most configurations of $n_1 \le \dots \le n_d$. Using a natural definition of orthogonal tensors
over the real field (resp. unitary tensors over the complex field), it is shown that the obvious lower
bound $1/\sqrt{n_1 \cdots n_{d-1}}$ is attained if and only if a tensor is orthogonal (resp. unitary)
up to scaling. Whether or not orthogonal or unitary tensors exist depends on the dimensions $n_1,\dots,n_d$
and the field. A connection between the (non)existence of real orthogonal tensors of order three
and the classical Hurwitz problem on composition algebras can be established: existence of orthogonal
tensors of size $\ell \times m \times n$ is equivalent to the admissibility of the triple $[\ell,m,n]$
to Hurwitz problem. Some implications for higher-order tensors are then given. For instance, real
orthogonal $n \times \dots \times n$ tensors of order $d \ge 3$ do exist, but only when $n = 1,2,4,8$.
In the complex case, the situation is more drastic: unitary tensors of size $\ell \times m \times
n$ with $\ell \le m \le n$ exist only when $\ell m \le n$. Finally, some numerical illustrations for
spectral norm computation are presented.
