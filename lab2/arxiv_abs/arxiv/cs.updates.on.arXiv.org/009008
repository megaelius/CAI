In this work we address limitations in state-of-the-art ultrasound robots by designing and integrating
the first soft robotic system for ultrasound imaging. It makes use of the inherent qualities of soft
robotics technologies to establish a safe, adaptable interaction between ultrasound probe and
patient. We acquire clinical data to establish the movement ranges and force levels required in
prenatal foetal ultrasound imaging and design our system accordingly. The end-effector's stiffness
characteristics allow for it to reach the desired workspace while maintaining a stable contact
between ultrasound probe and patient under the determined loads. The system exhibits a high degree
of safety due to its inherent compliance in the transversal direction. We verify the mechanical
characteristics of the end-effector, derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate
the robot's controllability with and without external loading. The imaging capabilities of the
robot are shown in a tele-operated setting on a foetal phantom. The design exhibits the desired stiffness
characteristics with a high stiffness along the ultrasound transducer and a high compliance in
lateral direction. Twist is constrained using a braided mesh reinforcement. The model can accurately
predict the end-effector pose with a mean error of about 6% in position 7% in orientation. The derived
controller is, with an average position error of 0.39mm able to track a target pose efficiently without
and with externally applied loads. Finally, the images acquired with the system are of equally good
quality compared to a manual sonographer scan.
