In this paper, we first present a centralized traffic control model based on the emerging dynamic
path flows. This new model in essence views the whole target network as one integral piece in which
traffic propagates based on traffic flow dynamics, vehicle paths, and traffic control. In light
of this centralized traffic control concept, most requirements for the existing traffic control
coordination will be dropped in the optimal traffic control operations, such as the common cycle
length or offsets. Instead, the optimal traffic control strategy across intersections will be
highly adaptive over time to minimize the total travel time and it can also prevent any short-term
traffic congestions according to the space-time characteristics of vehicle path flows. A mixed
integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is then presented to model the propagations of path
flows given a centralized traffic control strategy. Secondly, a new approximated Lagrangian decomposition
framework is presented. Solving the proposed MILP model with the traditional Lagrangian decomposition
approach faces the leveraging challenge between the problem tractability after decomposition
and computing complexity. To address this issue, we propose an approximate Lagrangian decomposition
framework in which the target problem is reformulated into an approximated problem by constructing
its complicating attributes into the objective function instead of in constraints to reduce the
computing complexity. The computing efficiency loss of the objective function can be mitigated
via multiple advanced computing techniques. With the proposed approximated approach, the upper
bound and tight lower bound can be obtained via two customized dynamic network loading models. In
the end, one demonstrative and one real-world example are illustrated to show the validness, robustness,
and scalability of the new approach.
