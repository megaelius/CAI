We study the interaction between a fleet of electric, self-driving vehicles servicing on-demand
transportation requests (referred to as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand, or AMoD, system) and
the electric power network. We propose a joint linear model that captures the coupling between the
two systems stemming from the vehicles' charging requirements. The model subsumes existing network
flow models for AMoD systems and linear models for the power network, and it captures time-varying
customer demand and power generation costs, road congestion, and power transmission and distribution
constraints. We then leverage the linear model to jointly optimize the operation of both systems.
We propose an algorithmic procedure to losslessly reduce the problem size by bundling customer
requests, allowing it to be efficiently solved by state-of-the-art linear programming solvers.
Finally, we study the implementation of a hypothetical electric-powered AMoD system in Dallas-Fort
Worth, and its impact on the Texas power network. We show that coordination between the AMoD system
and the power network can reduce the price of electricity paid by the AMoD system operator by 8.8%
compared to an uncoordinated scenario. Despite the increased power demand, exploiting the electric
vehicles as mobile storage units in coordination with the power network operator also reduces the
unit price of electricity by 1.2% for all power network customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area compared
to the case where no electric vehicles are present. Collectively, the results of this paper provide
a first-of-a-kind characterization of the interaction between electric-powered AMoD systems
and the electric power network, and shed additional light on the economic and societal value of AMoD.
