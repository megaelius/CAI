This document is one of the deliverable reports created for the ESCAPE project. ESCAPE stands for
Energy-efficient Scalable Algorithms for Weather Prediction at Exascale. The project develops
world-class, extreme-scale computing capabilities for European operational numerical weather
prediction and future climate models. This is done by identifying Weather & Climate dwarfs which
are key patterns in terms of computation and communication (in the spirit of the Berkeley dwarfs).
These dwarfs are then optimised for different hardware architectures (single and multi-node)
and alternative algorithms are explored. Performance portability is addressed through the use
of domain specific languages. In this deliverable we focus on the RMI-EPS ensemble prediction suite.
We first provide a detailed report on the workflow of the suite in which 5 main categories of jobs are
defined; pre-processing, lateral boundary conditions (LBCs), data assimilation, forecast and
post-processing. Combined Energy and wall-clock time measurements of the entire RMI-EPS suite
were performed. They indicate that the wall-clock times are relatively spread between the various
defined job categories, with the forecast accounting for the largest fraction at about 35%. As far
as energy consumption is concerned, the forecast part dwarfs everything else and is responsible
for up to 99% of the total energy consumption. This means that energy optimizations for the forecast
part will translate almost proportionally into optimizations of the whole suite, while the maximum
theoretical speed-up due to forecast optimizations cannot exceed a factor of about 3/2. Therefore,
in terms of energy consumption, optimizations should first focus on the forecast part. For wall-clock
time performance gains, however, optimizations (and possibly additional dwarfs) can be considered
for the categories outside of the forecast part.
