Effective patient queue management to minimize patient wait delays and patient overcrowding is
one of the major challenges faced by hospitals. Unnecessary and annoying waits for long periods
result in substantial human resource and time wastage and increase the frustration endured by patients.
For each patient in the queue, the total treatment time of all patients before him is the time that
he must wait. It would be convenient and preferable if the patients could receive the most efficient
treatment plan and know the predicted waiting time through a mobile application that updates in
real-time. Therefore, we propose a Patient Treatment Time Prediction (PTTP) algorithm to predict
the waiting time for each treatment task for a patient. We use realistic patient data from various
hospitals to obtain a patient treatment time model for each task. Based on this large-scale, realistic
dataset, the treatment time for each patient in the current queue of each task is predicted. Based
on the predicted waiting time, a Hospital Queuing-Recommendation (HQR) system is developed. HQR
calculates and predicts an efficient and convenient treatment plan recommended for the patient.
Because of the large-scale, realistic dataset and the requirement for real-time response, the
PTTP algorithm and HQR system mandate efficiency and low-latency response. We use an Apache Spark-based
cloud implementation at the National Supercomputing Center in Changsha (NSCC) to achieve the aforementioned
goals. Extensive experimentation and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability
of our proposed model to recommend an effective treatment plan for patients to minimize their wait
times in hospitals.
