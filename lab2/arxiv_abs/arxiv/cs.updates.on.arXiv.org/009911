Continuous control and planning remains a major challenge in robotics and machine learning. Neuroscience
offers the possibility of learning from animal brains that implement highly successful controllers,
but it is unclear how to relate an animal's behavior to control principles. Animals may not always
act optimally from the perspective of an external observer, but may still act rationally: we hypothesize
that animals choose actions with highest expected future subjective value according to their own
internal model of the world. Their actions thus result from solving a different optimal control
problem from those on which they are evaluated in neuroscience experiments. With this assumption,
we propose a novel framework of model-based inverse rational control that learns the agent's internal
model that best explains their actions in a task described as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP). In this approach we first learn optimal policies generalized over the entire model
space of dynamics and subjective rewards, using an extended Kalman filter to represent the belief
space, a neural network in the actor-critic framework to optimize the policy, and a simplified basis
for the parameter space. We then compute the model that maximizes the likelihood of the experimentally
observable data comprising the agent's sensory observations and chosen actions. Our proposed
method is able to recover the true model of simulated agents within theoretical error bounds given
by limited data. We illustrate this method by applying it to a complex naturalistic task currently
used in neuroscience experiments. This approach provides a foundation for interpreting the behavioral
and neural dynamics of highly adapted controllers in animal brains.
