Background: The detection of perineural invasion (PNI) by carcinoma in prostate biopsies has been
shown to be associated with poor prognosis. The assessment and quantification of PNI is; however,
labor intensive. In the study we aimed to develop an algorithm based on deep neural networks to aid
pathologists in this task. Methods: We collected, digitized and pixel-wise annotated the PNI findings
in each of the approximately 80,000 biopsy cores from the 7,406 men who underwent biopsy in the prospective
and diagnostic STHLM3 trial between 2012 and 2014. In total, 485 biopsy cores showed PNI. We also
digitized more than 10% (n=8,318) of the PNI negative biopsy cores. Digitized biopsies from a random
selection of 80% of the men were used to build deep neural networks, and the remaining 20% were used
to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Results: For the detection of PNI in prostate biopsy
cores the network had an estimated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.98
(95% CI 0.97-0.99) based on 106 PNI positive cores and 1,652 PNI negative cores in the independent
test set. For the pre-specified operating point this translates to sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity
of 0.97. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 0.67 and 0.99, respectively.
For localizing the regions of PNI within a slide we estimated an average intersection over union
of 0.50 (CI: 0.46-0.55). Conclusion: We have developed an algorithm based on deep neural networks
for detecting PNI in prostate biopsies with apparently acceptable diagnostic properties. These
algorithms have the potential to aid pathologists in the day-to-day work by drastically reducing
the number of biopsy cores that need to be assessed for PNI and by highlighting regions of diagnostic
interest.
