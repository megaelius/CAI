Graph embedding is the task of representing nodes of a graph in a low-dimensional space and its applications
for graph tasks have gained significant traction in academia and industry. The primary difference
among the many recently proposed graph embedding methods is the way they preserve the inherent properties
of the graphs. However, in practice, comparing these methods is very challenging. The majority
of methods report performance boosts on few selected real graphs. Therefore, it is difficult to
generalize these performance improvements to other types of graphs. Given a graph, it is currently
impossible to quantify the advantages of one approach over another. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework to compare graph embedding methods. Our goal is threefold: (i) provide a unifying
framework for comparing the performance of various graph embedding methods, (ii) establish a benchmark
with real-world graphs that exhibit different structural properties, and (iii) provide users
with a tool to identify the best graph embedding method for their data. This paper evaluates 4 of the
most influential graph embedding methods and 4 traditional link prediction methods against a corpus
of 100 real-world networks with varying properties. We organize the 100 networks in terms of their
properties to get a better understanding of the embedding performance of these popular methods.
We use the comparisons on our 100 benchmark graphs to define GFS-score, that can be applied to any
embedding method to quantify its performance. We rank the state-of-the-art embedding approaches
using the GFS-score and show that it can be used to understand and evaluate novel embedding approaches.
We envision that the proposed framework (https://www.github.com/palash1992/GEM-Benchmark)
will serve the community as a benchmarking platform to test and compare the performance of future
graph embedding techniques.
