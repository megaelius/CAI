Interconnectivity of production machines is a key feature of the Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT). This feature allows for many advantages in producing. Configuration and maintenance gets
easier, as access to the given production unit is not necessarily coupled to physical presence.
Customized production of goods is easily possible, reducing production times and increasing throughput.
There are, however, also dangers to the increasing talkativeness of industrial production machines.
The more open a system is, the more points of entry for an attacker exist. Furthermore, the amount
of data a production site also increases rapidly due to the integrated intelligence and interconnectivity.
To keep track of this data in order to detect attacks and errors in the production site, it is necessary
to smartly aggregate and evaluate the data. In this paper, we present a new approach for collecting,
aggregating and analysing data from different sources and on three different levels of abstraction.
Our model is event-centric, considering every occurrence of information inside the system as an
event. In the lowest level of abstraction, singular packets are collected, correlated with log-entries
and analysed. On the highest level of abstraction, networks are pictured as a connectivity graph,
enriched with information about host-based activities. Furthermore, we describe our work in progress
of evaluating our aggregation model on two different system settings. In the first scenario, we
verify the usability of our model in a remote maintenance application. In the second scenario, we
evaluate our model in the context of network sniffing and correlation with log-files. First results
show that our model is a promising solution to cope with increasing amounts of data and to correlate
information from different types of sources.
