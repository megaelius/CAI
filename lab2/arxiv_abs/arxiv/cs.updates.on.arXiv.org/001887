With the advance of technology, Criminal Justice agencies are being confronted with an increased
need to investigate crimes perpetuated partially or entirely over the Internet. These types of
crime are known as cybercrimes. In order to conceal illegal online activity, criminals often use
private browsing features or browsers designed to provide total browsing privacy. The use of private
browsing is a common challenge faced in for example child exploitation investigations, which usually
originate on the Internet. Although private browsing features are not designed specifically for
criminal activity, they have become a valuable tool for criminals looking to conceal their online
activity. As such, Technological Crime units often focus their forensic analysis on thoroughly
examining the web history on a computer. Private browsing features and browsers often require a
more in-depth, post mortem analysis. This often requires the use of multiple tools, as well as different
forensic approaches to uncover incriminating evidence. This evidence may be required in a court
of law, where analysts are often challenged both on their findings and on the tools and approaches
used to recover evidence. However, there are very few research on evaluating of private browsing
in terms of privacy preserving as well as forensic acquisition and analysis of privacy preserving
internet browsers. Therefore in this chapter, we firstly review the private mode of popular internet
browsers. Next, we describe the forensic acquisition and analysis of Browzar, a privacy preserving
internet browser and compare it with other popular internet browsers
