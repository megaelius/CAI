Two-player games on graphs provide the mathematical foundation for the study of reactive systems.
In the quantitative framework, an objective assigns a value to every play, and the goal of player
1 is to minimize the value of the objective. In this framework, there are two relevant synthesis problems
to consider: the quantitative analysis problem is to compute the minimal (or infimum) value that
player 1 can assure, and the boolean analysis problem asks whether player 1 can assure that the value
of the objective is at most $\nu$ (for a given threshold $\nu$). Mean-payoff expression games are
played on a multidimensional weighted graph. An atomic mean-payoff expression objective is the
mean-payoff value (the long-run average weight) of a certain dimension, and the class of mean-payoff
expressions is the closure of atomic mean-payoff expressions under the algebraic operations of
$\MAX,\MIN$, numerical complement and $\SUM$. In this work, we study for the first time the strategy
synthesis problems for games with robust quantitative objectives, namely, games with mean-payoff
expression objectives. While in general, optimal strategies for these games require infinite-memory,
in synthesis we are typically interested in the construction of a finite-state system. Hence, we
consider games in which player 1 is restricted to finite-memory strategies, and our main contribution
is as follows. We prove that for mean-payoff expressions, the quantitative analysis problem is
computable, and the boolean analysis problem is inter-reducible with Hilbert's tenth problem
over rationals --- a fundamental long-standing open problem in computer science and mathematics.
