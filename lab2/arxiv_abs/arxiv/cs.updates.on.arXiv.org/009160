This paper addresses an open problem in traffic modeling: the second-order macroscopic node problem.
A second-order macroscopic traffic model, in contrast to a first-order model, allows for variation
of driving behavior across subpopulations of vehicles in the flow. The second-order models are
thus more descriptive (e.g., they have been used to model variable mixtures of behaviorally-different
traffic, like car/truck traffic, autonomous/human-driven traffic, etc.), but are much more complex.
The second-order node problem is a particularly complex problem, as it requires the resolution
of discontinuities in traffic density and mixture characteristics, and solving of throughflows
for arbitrary numbers of input and output roads to a node (in other words, this is an arbitrary-dimensional
Riemann problem with two conserved quantities). In this paper, we extend the well-known "Generic
Class of Node Model" constraints to the second order and present a simple solution algorithm to the
second-order node problem. Our solution makes use of a recently-introduced dynamic system characterization
of the first-order node model problem, which gives insight and intuition as to the continuous-time
dynamics implicit in node models. We further argue that the common "supply and demand" construction
of node models that decouples them from link models is not suitable to the second-order node problem.
Our second-order node model and solution method have immediate applications in allowing modeling
of behaviorally-complex traffic flows of contemporary interest (like partially-autonomous-vehicle
flows) in arbitrary road networks.
