Purpose: Manual feedback in basic RMIS training can consume a significant amount of time from expert
surgeons' schedule and is prone to subjectivity. While VR-based training tasks can generate automated
score reports, there is no mechanism of generating automated feedback for surgeons performing
basic surgical tasks in RMIS training. In this paper, we explore the usage of different holistic
features for automated skill assessment using only robot kinematic data and propose a weighted
feature fusion technique for improving score prediction performance. Methods: We perform our
experiments on the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset and evaluate four different types of holistic
features from robot kinematic data - Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Fourier Transform
(DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Approximate Entropy (ApEn). The features are then used
for skill classification and exact skill score prediction. Along with using these features individually,
we also evaluate the performance using our proposed weighted combination technique. Results:
Our results demonstrate that these holistic features outperform all previous HMM based state-of-the-art
methods for skill classification on the JIGSAWS dataset. Also, our proposed feature fusion strategy
significantly improves performance for skill score predictions achieving up to 0.61 average spearman
correlation coefficient. Conclusions: Holistic features capturing global information from
robot kinematic data can successfully be used for evaluating surgeon skill in basic surgical tasks
on the da Vinci robot. Using the framework presented can potentially allow for real time score feedback
in RMIS training.
