Computer assisted technologies based on algorithmic software segmentation are an increasing
topic of interest in complex surgical cases. However - due to functional instability, time consuming
software processes, personnel resources or licensed-based financial costs many segmentation
processes are often outsourced from clinical centers to third parties and the industry. Therefore,
the aim of this trial was to assess the practical feasibility of an easy available, functional stable
and licensed-free segmentation approach to be used in the clinical practice. In this retrospective,
randomized, controlled trail the accuracy and accordance of the open-source based segmentation
algorithm GrowCut (GC) was assessed through the comparison to the manually generated ground truth
of the same anatomy using 10 CT lower jaw data-sets from the clinical routine. Assessment parameters
were the segmentation time, the volume, the voxel number, the Dice Score (DSC) and the Hausdorff
distance (HD). Overall segmentation times were about one minute. Mean DSC values of over 85% and
HD below 33.5 voxel could be achieved. Statistical differences between the assessment parameters
were not significant (p<0.05) and correlation coefficients were close to the value one (r > 0.94).
Complete functional stable and time saving segmentations with high accuracy and high positive
correlation could be performed by the presented interactive open-source based approach. In the
cranio-maxillofacial complex the used method could represent an algorithmic alternative for
image-based segmentation in the clinical practice for e.g. surgical treatment planning or visualization
of postoperative results and offers several advantages. Systematic comparisons to other segmentation
approaches or with a greater data amount are areas of future works.
