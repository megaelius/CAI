Owing to the large volume of sensed data from the enormous number of IoT devices in operation today,
centralized machine learning algorithms operating on such data incur an unbearable training time,
and thus cannot satisfy the requirements of delay-sensitive inference applications. By provisioning
computing resources at the network edge, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has become a promising technology
capable of collaborating with distributed IoT devices to facilitate federated learning, and thus
realize real-time training. However, considering the large volume of sensed data and the limited
resources of both edge servers and IoT devices, it is challenging to ensure the training efficiency
and accuracy of delay-sensitive training tasks. Thus, in this paper, we design a novel edge computing-assisted
federated learning framework, in which the communication constraints between IoT devices and
edge servers and the effect of various IoT devices on the training accuracy are taken into account.
On one hand, we employ machine learning methods to dynamically configure the communication resources
in real-time to accelerate the interactions between IoT devices and edge servers, thus improving
the training efficiency of federated learning. On the other hand, as various IoT devices have different
training datasets which have varying influence on the accuracy of the global model derived at the
edge server, an IoT device selection scheme is designed to improve the training accuracy under the
resource constraints at edge servers. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate
the performance of the introduced edge computing-assisted federated learning framework.
