The widespread use of GPS-enabled smartphones along with the popularity of micro-blogging and
social networking applications, e.g., Twitter and Facebook, has resulted in the generation of
huge streams of geo-tagged textual data. Many applications require real-time processing of these
streams. For example, location-based e-coupon and ad-targeting systems enable advertisers to
register millions of ads to millions of users. The number of users is typically very high and they
are continuously moving, and the ads change frequently as well. Hence sending the right ad to the
matching users is very challenging. Existing streaming systems are either centralized or are not
spatial-keyword aware, and cannot efficiently support the processing of rapidly arriving spatial-keyword
data streams. This paper presents Tornado, a distributed spatial-keyword stream processing system.
Tornado features routing units to fairly distribute the workload, and furthermore, co-locate
the data objects and the corresponding queries at the same processing units. The routing units use
the Augmented-Grid, a novel structure that is equipped with an efficient search algorithm for distributing
the data objects and queries. Tornado uses evaluators to process the data objects against the queries.
The routing units minimize the redundant communication by not sending data updates for processing
when these updates do not match any query. By applying dynamically evaluated cost formulae that
continuously represent the processing overhead at each evaluator, Tornado is adaptive to changes
in the workload. Extensive experimental evaluation using spatio-textual range queries over real
Twitter data indicates that Tornado outperforms the non-spatio-textually aware approaches by
up to two orders of magnitude in terms of the overall system throughput.
