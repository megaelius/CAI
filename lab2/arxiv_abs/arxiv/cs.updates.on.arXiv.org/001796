LaSalle invariance principle was originally proposed in the 1950's and has become a fundamental
mathematical tool in the area of dynamical systems and control. In both theoretical research and
engineering practice, discrete-time dynamical systems have been at least as extensively studied
as continuous-time systems. For example, model predictive control is typically studied in discrete-time
via Lyapunov methods. However, there is a peculiar absence in the standard literature of standard
treatments of Lyapunov functions and LaSalle invariance principle for discrete-time nonlinear
systems. Most of the textbooks on nonlinear dynamical systems focus only on continuous-time systems.
In Chapter 1 of the book by LaSalle [11], the author establishes the LaSalle invariance principle
for difference equation systems. However, all the useful lemmas in [11] are given in the form of exercises
with no proof provided. In this document, we provide the proofs of all the lemmas proposed in [11]
that are needed to derive the main theorem on the LaSalle invariance principle for discrete-time
dynamical systems. We organize all the materials in a self-contained manner. We first introduce
some basic concepts and definitions in Section 1, such as dynamical systems, invariant sets, and
limit sets. In Section 2 we present and prove some useful lemmas on the properties of invariant sets
and limit sets. Finally, we establish the original LaSalle invariance principle for discrete-time
dynamical systems and a simple extension in Section~3. In Section 4, we provide some references
on extensions of LaSalle invariance principles for further reading. This document is intended
for educational and tutorial purposes and contains lemmas that might be useful as a reference for
researchers.
