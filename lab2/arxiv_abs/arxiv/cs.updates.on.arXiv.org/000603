Wireless energy transfer (WET) has attracted significant attention recently for providing energy
supplies wirelessly to electrical devices without the need of wires or cables. Among different
types of WET techniques, the radio frequency (RF) signal enabled far-field WET is most practically
appealing to power energy constrained wireless networks in a broadcast manner. To overcome the
significant path loss over wireless channels, multi-antenna or multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) techniques have been proposed to enhance the transmission efficiency and distance for RF-based
WET. However, in order to reap the large energy beamforming gain in MIMO WET, acquiring the channel
state information (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET) is an essential task. This task is particularly
challenging for WET systems, since existing channel training and feedback methods used for communication
receivers may not be implementable at the energy receiver (ER) due to its hardware limitation. To
tackle this problem, in this paper we consider a multiuser MIMO system for WET, where a multiple-antenna
ET broadcasts wireless energy to a group of multiple-antenna ERs concurrently via transmit energy
beamforming. By taking into account the practical energy harvesting circuits at the ER, we propose
a new channel learning method that requires only one feedback bit from each ER to the ET per feedback
interval. The feedback bit indicates the increase or decrease of the harvested energy by each ER
between the present and previous intervals, which can be measured without changing the existing
hardware at the ER. Based on such feedback information, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in different
training intervals and at the same time obtains improved estimates of the MIMO channels to ERs by
applying a new approach termed analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM).
