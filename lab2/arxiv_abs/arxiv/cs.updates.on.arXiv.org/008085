While the prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is increasing, research towards the definition
of a common etiology is still ongoing. In this regard, modern machine learning and network science
pave the way for a better understanding of the pathology and the development of diagnosis aid systems.
At the same time, the culture of data sharing heads favorably in that direction, with the availability
of large datasets such as the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) one. The present work addresses
the classification of neurotypical and ASD subjects by combining knowledge about both the anatomy
and the functional activity of the brain. In particular, we model the brain structure as a graph,
and the time-varying resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) signals as values that live on the
nodes of that graph. We then borrow tools from the emerging field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP)
to build features related to the frequency content of these signals. In order to make these features
highly discriminative, we apply an extension of the Fukunaga-Koontz transform. Finally, we use
these new markers to train a decision tree, an interpretable classification scheme, which results
in a final diagnosis aid model. Interestingly, the resulting decision tree outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on the ABIDE dataset. Moreover, the analysis of the predictive markers reveals the influence
of the frontal and temporal lobes in the diagnosis of the disorder, which is in line with previous
findings in the literature of neuroscience. Our results indicate that exploiting jointly structural
and functional information of the brain can reveal important information about the complexity
of the neuropathology.
