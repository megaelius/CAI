Existing method generates class activation map (CAM) by a set of fixed classes (i.e., using all the
classes), while the discriminative cues between class pairs are not considered. Note that activation
maps by considering different class pair are complementary, and therefore can provide more discriminative
cues to overcome the shortcoming of the existing CAM generation that the highlighted regions are
usually local part regions rather than global object regions due to the lack of object cues. In this
paper, we generate CAM by using a few of representative classes, with aim of extracting more discriminative
cues by considering each class pair to obtain CAM more globally. The advantages are twofold. Firstly,
the representative classes are able to obtain activation regions that are complementary to each
other, and therefore leads to generating activation map more accurately. Secondly, we only need
to consider a small number of representative classes, making the CAM generation suitable for small
networks. We propose a clustering based method to select the representative classes. Multiple
binary classification models rather than a multiple class classification model are used to generate
the CAM. Moreover, we propose a multi-layer fusion based CAM generation method to simultaneously
combine high-level semantic features and low-level detail features. We validate the proposed
method on the PASCAL VOC and COCO database in terms of segmentation groundtruth. Various networks
such as classical network (Resnet-50, Resent-101 and Resnet-152) and small network (VGG-19, Resnet-18
and Mobilenet) are considered. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the
CAM generation obviously.
