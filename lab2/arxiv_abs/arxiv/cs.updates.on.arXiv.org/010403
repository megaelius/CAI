Over the last few years, the arena of mobile application development has expanded considerably
beyond the balance of the world\'s software markets. With the growing number of mobile software
companies, and the mounting sophistication of smartphones\' technology, developers have been
building several categories of applications on dissimilar platforms. However, developers confront
several challenges through the implementation of mobile application projects. In particular,
there is a lack of consolidated systems that are competent to provide developers with personalised
services promptly and efficiently. Hence, it is essential to develop tailored systems which can
recommend appropriate tools, IDEs, platforms, software components and other correlated artifacts
to mobile application developers. This paper proposes a new recommender system framework comprising
a fortified set of techniques that are designed to provide mobile app developers with a distinctive
platform to browse and search for the personalised artifacts. The proposed system make use of ontology
and semantic web technology as well as machine learning techniques. In particular, the new RS framework
comprises the following components; (i) domain knowledge inference module: including various
semantic web technologies and lightweight ontologies; (ii) profiling and preferencing: a new
proposed time-aware multidimensional user modelling; (iii) query expansion: to improve and enhance
the retrieved results by semantically augmenting users\' query; and (iv) recommendation and information
filtration: to make use of the aforementioned components to provide personalised services to the
designated users and to answer a user\'s query with the minimum mismatches.
