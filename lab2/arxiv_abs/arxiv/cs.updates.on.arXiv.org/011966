The concrete efficiency of secure computation has been the focus of many recent works. In this work,
we present concretely-efficient protocols for secure $3$-party computation (3PC) over a ring
of integers modulo $2^{\ell}$ tolerating one corruption, both with semi-honest and malicious
security. Owing to the fact that computation over ring emulates computation over the real-world
system architectures, secure computation over ring has gained momentum of late. Cast in the offline-online
paradigm, our constructions present the most efficient online phase in concrete terms. In the semi-honest
setting, our protocol requires communication of $2$ ring elements per multiplication gate during
the {\it online} phase, attaining a per-party cost of {\em less than one element}. This is achieved
for the first time in the regime of 3PC. In the {\it malicious} setting, our protocol requires communication
of $4$ elements per multiplication gate during the online phase, beating the state-of-the-art
protocol by $5$ elements. Realized with both the security notions of selective abort and fairness,
the malicious protocol with fairness involves slightly more communication than its counterpart
with abort security for the output gates {\em alone}. We apply our techniques from $3$PC in the regime
of secure server-aided machine-learning (ML) inference for a range of prediction functions--
linear regression, linear SVM regression, logistic regression, and linear SVM classification.
Our setting considers a model-owner with trained model parameters and a client with a query, with
the latter willing to learn the prediction of her query based on the model parameters of the former.
The inputs and computation are outsourced to a set of three non-colluding servers. Our constructions
catering to both semi-honest and the malicious world, invariably perform better than the existing
constructions.
