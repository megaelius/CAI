We describe how to generate a heterosexual network with a prescribed joint-degree distribution
that is embedded in a prescribed large-scale social contact network. The structure of a sexual network
plays an important role in how sexually transmitted infections (STIs) spread. Generating an ensemble
of networks that mimics the real-world is crucial to evaluating robust mitigation strategies for
controling STIs. Most of the current algorithms to generate sexual networks only use sexual activity
data, such as the number of partners per month, to generate the sexual network. Real-world sexual
networks also depend on biased mixing based on age, location, and social and work activities. We
describe an approach to use a broad range of social activity data to generate possible heterosexual
networks. We start with a large-scale simulation of thousands of people in a city as they go through
their daily activities, including work, school, shopping, and activities at home. We extract a
social network from these activities where the nodes are the people and the edges indicate a social
interaction, such as working in the same location. This social network captures the correlations
between people of different ages, living in different locations, their economic status, and other
demographic factors. We use the social contact network to define a bipartite heterosexual network
that is embedded within an extended social network. The resulting sexual network captures the biased
mixing inherent in the social network, and models based on this pairing of networks can be used to
investigate novel intervention strategies based on the social contacts of infected people. We
illustrate the approach in a model for the spread of Chlamydia in the heterosexual network representing
the young sexually active community in New Orleans.
