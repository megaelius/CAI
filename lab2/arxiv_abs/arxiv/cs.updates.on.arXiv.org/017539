The Corona Virus (COVID-19) is an internationalpandemic that has quickly propagated throughout
the world. The application of deep learning for image classification of chest X-ray images of Covid-19
patients, could become a novel pre-diagnostic detection methodology. However, deep learning
architectures require large labelled datasets. This is often a limitation when the subject of research
is relatively new as in the case of the virus outbreak, where dealing with small labelled datasets
is a challenge. Moreover, in the context of a new highly infectious disease, the datasets are also
highly imbalanced,with few observations from positive cases of the new disease. In this work we
evaluate the performance of the semi-supervised deep learning architecture known as MixMatch
using a very limited number of labelled observations and highly imbalanced labelled dataset. We
propose a simple approach for correcting data imbalance, re-weight each observationin the loss
function, giving a higher weight to the observationscorresponding to the under-represented class.
For unlabelled observations, we propose the usage of the pseudo and augmentedlabels calculated
by MixMatch to choose the appropriate weight. The MixMatch method combined with the proposed pseudo-label
based balance correction improved classification accuracy by up to 10%, with respect to the non
balanced MixMatch algorithm, with statistical significance. We tested our proposed approach
with several available datasets using 10, 15 and 20 labelledobservations. Additionally, a new
dataset is included among thetested datasets, composed of chest X-ray images of Costa Rican adult
patients
