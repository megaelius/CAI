Recent studies into streaming media delivery suggest that performance gains from cache hierarchies
such as Information-Centric Networks (ICNs) may be negated by Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DAS),
the de facto method for retrieving multimedia content. The bitrate adaptation mechanisms that
drive video streaming clash with caching hierarchies in ways that affect users' Quality of Experience
(QoE). Cache performance also diminishes as consumers dynamically select content encoded at different
bitrates. In this paper we use the evidence to draw a novel insight: in a cache hierarchy for adaptive
streaming content, bitrates should be prioritized over or alongside popularity and hit rates.
We build on this insight to propose RippleCache as a family of cache placement schemes that safeguard
high-bitrate content at the edge and push low-bitrate content into the network core. Doing so reduces
contention of cache resources, as well as congestion in the network. To validate RippleCache claims
we construct two separate implementations. We design RippleClassic as a benchmark solution that
optimizes content placement by maximizing a measure for cache hierarchies shown to have high correlation
with QoE. In addition, our lighter-weight RippleFinder is then re-designed with distributed execution
for application in large-scale systems. RippleCache performance gains are reinforced by evaluations
in NS-3 against state-of-the-art baseline approaches, using standard measures of QoE as defined
by the DASH Industry Forum. Measurements show that RippleClassic and RippleFinder deliver content
that suffers less oscillation and rebuffering, as well as the highest levels of video quality, indicating
overall improvements to QoE.
