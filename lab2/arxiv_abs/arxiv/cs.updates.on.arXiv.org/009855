Designers need to consider not only perceptual effectiveness but also visual styles when creating
an infographic. This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not
to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first
step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute
an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap
image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction
stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information
from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and
orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels
of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three
techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible
template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness
of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline
dataset (393 images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of our
approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically extracted templates
and timelines automatically generated based on these templates to qualitatively demonstrate
the performance. The results confirm that our approach can effectively extract extensible templates
from real-world timeline infographics.
