Consider a region that requires to be protected from unauthorized penetrations. The border of the
region, modeled as a unit line segment, consists of high priority segments that require the highest
level of protection separated by low priority segments that require to be visited infinitely often.
We study the problem of patrolling the border with a set of $k$ robots. The goal is to obtain a strategy
that minimizes the maximum idle time (the time that a point is left unattended) of the high priority
points while visiting the low priority points infinitely often. We use the concept of single lid
cover (segments of fixed length) where each high priority point is covered with at least one lid,
and then we extend it to strong double-lid cover where each high priority point is covered with at
least two lids, and the unit line segment is fully covered. Let $\lambda_{k-1}$ be the minimum lid
length that accepts a single $\lambda_{k-1}$-lid cover with $k-1$ lids and $\Lambda_{2k}$ be the
minimum lid length that accepts a strong double $\Lambda_{2k}$-lid cover with $2k$ lids. We show
that $2\min(\Lambda_{2k}, \lambda_{k-1})$ is the lower bound of the idle time when the max speed
of the robots is one. To compute $\Lambda_{2k}$ and $\lambda_{k-1}$, we present an algorithm with
time complexity $O(\max(k, n)\log{n})$ where $n$ is the number of high priority sections. For the
upper bound, first we present a strategy with idle time $\lambda_{k-1}$ where one robot covers the
unit line, and the remaining robots cover the lids of a single $\lambda_{k-1}$-lid cover with $k-1$
lids. Then, we present a simple strategy with idle time $3\Lambda_{2k}$ that splits the unit line
into not-disjoint $k$ segments of equal length that robots synchronously cover. Then, we present
a complex strategy that split the unit line into $k$ non-disjoint segments that robots asynchronously
cover.
