Creating a secure environment for communications is becoming a significantly challenging task
in 5G Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) given the stringent latency and high capacity requirements
of 5G networks. This is particularly factual knowing that the infrastructure tends to be highly
diversified especially with the continuous deployment of small cells. In fact, frequent handovers
in these cells introduce unnecessarily recurring authentications leading to increased latency.
In this paper, we propose a software-defined wireless network (SDWN)-enabled fast cross-authentication
scheme which combines non-cryptographic and cryptographic algorithms to address the challenges
of latency and weak security. Initially, the received radio signal strength vectors at the mobile
terminal (MT) is used as a fingerprinting source to generate an unpredictable secret key. Subsequently,
a cryptographic mechanism based upon the authentication and key agreement protocol by employing
the generated secret key is performed in order to improve the confidentiality and integrity of the
authentication handover. Further, we propose a radio trusted zone database aiming to enhance the
frequent authentication of radio devices which are present in the network. In order to reduce recurring
authentications, a given covered area is divided into trusted zones where each zone contains more
than one small cell, thus permitting the MT to initiate a single authentication request per zone,
even if it keeps roaming between different cells. The proposed scheme is analyzed under different
attack scenarios and its complexity is compared with cryptographic and non-cryptographic approaches
to demonstrate its security resilience and computational efficiency.
