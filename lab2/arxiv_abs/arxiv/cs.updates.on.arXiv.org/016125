Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have been broadly used for building Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). The continuing increase in new unknown cyberattacks requires corresponding improvements
to the performance of IDS solutions at identifying new zero-day attacks. Therefore, the need for
robust IDS capable of flagging zero-day attacks is emerging. Current outlier-based zero-day detection
research suffers from high false-negative rates, thus limiting their use and performance. In this
paper, an autoencoder implementation to detect zero-day attacks is proposed. The aim is to build
an IDS model with high detection rate while keeping false-negative rate at a minimal. Two mainstream
IDS datasets are used for evaluation; CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD. To demonstrate the efficiency of
our model, we compare its results against a state of the art One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM).
The manuscript highlights the efficiency of One-Class SVM when zero-day attacks are distinctive
from normal behaviour. However, the proposed model benefits greatly from the encoding-decoding
capabilities of autoencoders. The results show that autoencoders are well-suited at detecting
zero-day attacks, thus, mitigating their effect. The results reached a zero-day detection accuracy
of [89% - 99%] for the NSL-KDD dataset and [75% - 98%] for the CICIDS2017 dataset. The results demonstrate
that the autoencoder performs better when faced with complex zero-day attacks. Finally, the trade-off
between false-positive rate and detection accuracy is also highlighted. The source code for building
and evaluating the proposed models will be made available through an open-source GitHub repository.
