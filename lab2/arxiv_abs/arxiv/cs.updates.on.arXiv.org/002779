We provide evidence that computing the maximum flow value between every pair of nodes in a directed
graph on $n$ nodes, $m$ edges,and capacities in the range $[1..n]$, which we call the All-Pairs Max-Flow
problem, cannot be solved in time that is significantly faster (i.e., by a polynomial factor) than
$O(n^3)$ even for sparse graphs. Since a single maximum $st$-flow can be solved in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$
[Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014], we conclude that the all-pairs version might require time equivalent
to $\tilde\Omega(n^{3/2})$ computations of maximum $st$-flow,which strongly separates the
directed case from the undirected one. Moreover, if maximum $st$-flow can be solved in time $\tilde{O}(m)$,then
the runtime of $\tilde\Omega(n^2)$ computations is needed. The latter settles a conjecture of
Lacki, Nussbaum, Sankowski, and Wulf-Nilsen [FOCS 2012] negatively. Specifically, we show that
in sparse graphs $G=(V,E,w)$, if one can compute the maximum $st$-flow from every $s$ in an input
set of sources $S\subseteq V$ to every $t$ in an input set of sinks $T\subseteq V$ in time $O((|S| |T|
m)^{1-\epsilon})$,for some $|S|$, $|T|$, and a constant $\epsilon>0$,then MAX-CNF-SAT with
$n'$ variables and $m'$ clauses can be solved in time ${m'}^{O(1)}2^{(1-\delta)n'}$ for a constant
$\delta(\epsilon)>0$,a problem for which not even $2^{n'}/poly(n')$ algorithms are known. Such
runtime for MAX-CNF-SAT would in particular refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).
Hence, we improve the lower bound of Abboud, Vassilevska-Williams, and Yu [STOC 2015], who showed
that for every fixed $\epsilon>0$ and $|S|=|T|=O(\sqrt{n})$, if the above problem can be solved
in time $O(n^{3/2-\epsilon})$, then some incomparable conjecture is false. Furthermore, a larger
lower bound than ours implies strictly super-linear time for maximum $st$-flow problem, which
would be an amazing breakthrough.
