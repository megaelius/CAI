Next-generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will have lower noise and therefore
increased sensitivity, enabling improved constraints on fundamental physics parameters such
as the sum of neutrino masses and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. Achieving competitive constraints
on these parameters requires high signal-to-noise extraction of the projected gravitational
potential from the CMB maps. Standard methods for reconstructing the lensing potential employ
the quadratic estimator (QE). However, the QE performs suboptimally at the low noise levels expected
in upcoming experiments. Other methods, like maximum likelihood estimators (MLE), are under active
development. In this work, we demonstrate reconstruction of the CMB lensing potential with deep
convolutional neural networks (CNN) - ie, a ResUNet. The network is trained and tested on simulated
data, and otherwise has no physical parametrization related to the physical processes of the CMB
and gravitational lensing. We show that, over a wide range of angular scales, ResUNets recover the
input gravitational potential with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the QE method, reaching
levels comparable to analytic approximations of MLE methods. We demonstrate that the network outputs
quantifiably different lensing maps when given input CMB maps generated with different cosmologies.
We also show we can use the reconstructed lensing map for cosmological parameter estimation. This
application of CNN provides a few innovations at the intersection of cosmology and machine learning.
First, while training and regressing on images, we predict a continuous-variable field rather
than discrete classes. Second, we are able to establish uncertainty measures for the network output
that are analogous to standard methods. We expect this approach to excel in capturing hard-to-model
non-Gaussian astrophysical foreground and noise contributions.
