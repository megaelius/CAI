With the rapid continuing spread of COVID-19, it is clearly important to be able to track the progress
of the virus over time in order to be better prepared to anticipate its emergence and spread in new
regions as well as declines in its presence in regions thereby leading to or justifying "reopening"
decisions. There are many applications and web sites that monitor officially released numbers
of cases which are likely to be the most accurate methods for tracking the progress of the virus; however,
they will not necessarily paint a complete picture. To begin filling any gaps in official reports,
we have developed the NewsStand CoronaViz web application (https://coronaviz.umiacs.io) that
can run on desktops and mobile devices that allows users to explore the geographic spread in discussions
about the virus through analysis of keyword prevalence in geotagged news articles and tweets in
relation to the real spread of the virus as measured by confirmed case numbers reported by the appropriate
authorities. NewsStand CoronaViz users have access to dynamic variants of the disease-related
variables corresponding to the numbers of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries
(where they are provided) via a map query interface. It has the ability to step forward and backward
in time using both a variety of temporal window sizes (day, week, month, or combinations thereof)
in addition to user-defined varying spatial window sizes specified by direct manipulation actions
(e.g., pan, zoom, and hover) as well as textually (e.g., by the name of the containing country, state
or province, or county as well as textually-specified spatially-adjacent combinations thereof),
and finally by the amount of spatio-temporally-varying news and tweet volume involving COVID-19.
