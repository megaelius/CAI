In this paper we study submodular maximization under a matroid constraint in the adaptive complexity
model. This model was recently introduced in the context of submodular optimization in [BS18a]
to quantify the information theoretic complexity of black-box optimization in a parallel computation
model. Informally, the adaptivity of an algorithm is the number of sequential rounds it makes when
each round can execute polynomially-many function evaluations in parallel. Since submodular
optimization is regularly applied on large datasets we seek algorithms with low adaptivity to enable
speedups via parallelization. Consequently, a recent line of work has been devoted to designing
constant factor approximation algorithms for maximizing submodular functions under various
constraints in the adaptive complexity model [BS18a, BS18b, BBS18, BRS19, EN19, FMZ19, CQ19, ENV18,
FMZ18]. Despite the burst in work on submodular maximization in the adaptive complexity model the
fundamental problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint has
remained elusive. In particular, all known techniques fail for this problem and there are no known
constant factor approximation algorithms whose adaptivity is sublinear in the rank of the matroid
$k$ or in the worst case sublinear in the size of the ground set $n$. In this paper we present an approximation
algorithm for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a matroid constraint
in the adaptive complexity model. The approximation guarantee of the algorithm is arbitrarily
close to the optimal $1-1/e$ and it has near optimal adaptivity of $O(\log(n)\log(k))$. This result
is obtained using a novel technique of adaptive sequencing which departs from previous techniques
for submodular maximization in the adaptive complexity model.
