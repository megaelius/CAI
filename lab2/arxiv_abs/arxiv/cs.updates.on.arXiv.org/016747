A fixed block reward and voluntary transaction fees are two sources of economic incentives for mining
in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For Bitcoin, the block reward halves every 210,000 blocks
and it is supposed to vanish gradually. The remaining incentive of transaction fees is optional
and arbitrary, and an undercutting attack becomes a potential threat, where the attacker deliberately
forks an existing chain by leaving wealthy transactions unclaimed to attract other miners. We look
into the profitability of the undercutting attack in this work. Our numerical simulations and experiments
demonstrate that (i) only miners with mining power > 40% have a reasonable probability of successfully
undercutting. (ii) As honest miners do not shift to the fork immediately in the first round, an undercutter's
profit drops with the number of honest miners. Given the current transaction fee rate distribution
in Bitcoin, with half of the miners being honest, undercutting cannot be profitable at all; With
25% honest mining power, an undercutter with > 45% mining power can expect income more than its "fair
share"; With no honest miners present, the threshold mining power for a profitable undercutting
is 42%. (iii) For the current largest Bitcoin mining pool with 17.2% mining power, the probability
of successfully launching an undercutting attack is tiny and the expected returns are far below
honest mining gains. (iv) While the larger the prize the undercutter left unclaimed, the higher
is the probability of the attack succeeding but the attack's profits also go down. Finally, we analyze
the best responses to undercutting for other rational miners. (v) For two rational miners and one
of them being the potential undercutter with 45% mining power, we find the dominant strategy for
the responding rational miner is to typical rational.
