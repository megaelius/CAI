The analysis of enormous datasets with missing data entries is a standard task in biological and
medical data processing. Large-scale, multi-institution clinical studies are the typical examples
of such datasets. These sets make possible the search for multi-parametric relations since from
the plenty of the data one is likely to find a satisfying number of subjects with the required parameter
ensembles. Specifically, finding combinatorial biomarkers for some given condition also needs
a very large dataset to analyze. For this goal, statistical regression analysis is not the preferred
tool of choice, since (i) the {\em a priori} knowledge of the parameter-sets to analyze is missing,
and (ii) typically relatively few subjects have the interesting parameter-value ensembles for
the analysis. For fast and automatic multi-parametric relation discovery association-rule finding
tools are used for more than two decades in the data-mining community. Here we present the SCARF webserver
for {\em generalized} association rule mining. Association rules are of the form: $a$ AND $b$ AND
... AND $x \rightarrow y$, meaning that the presence of properties $a$ AND $b$ AND ... AND $x$ implies
property $y$; our algorithm finds generalized association rules, since it also finds logical disjunctions
(i.e., ORs) at the left-hand side, allowing the discovery of more complex rules in a more compressed
form in the database. This feature also helps reducing the typically very large result-tables of
such studies, since allowing ORs in the left-hand side of a single rule could include dozens of classical
rules. The capabilities of the SCARF algorithm were demonstrated in mining the Alzheimer's database
of the Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) in our recent publication (Archives of Gerontology
and Geriatrics Vol. 73, pp. 300-307, 2017). Here we describe the webserver implementation of the
algorithm.
