Although the latent factor model achieves good accuracy in rating prediction, it suffers from many
problems including cold-start, non-transparency, and suboptimal results for individual user-item
pairs. In this paper, we exploit textual reviews and item images together with ratings to tackle
these limitations. Specifically, we first apply a proposed multi-modal aspect-aware topic model
(MATM) on text reviews and item images to model users' preferences and items' features from different
aspects, and also estimate the aspect importance of a user towards an item. Then the aspect importance
is integrated into a novel aspect-aware latent factor model (ALFM), which learns user's and item's
latent factors based on ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weight matrix to associate those
latent factors with the same set of aspects in MATM, such that the latent factors could be used to estimate
aspect ratings. Finally, the overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings,
which are weighted by the corresponding aspect importance. To this end, our model could alleviate
the data sparsity problem and gain good interpretability for recommendation. Besides, every aspect
rating is weighted by its aspect importance, which is dependent on the targeted user's preferences
and the targeted item's features. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method can model a
user's preferences on an item more accurately for each user-item pair. Comprehensive experimental
studies have been conducted on the Yelp 2017 Challenge dataset and Amazon product datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.
