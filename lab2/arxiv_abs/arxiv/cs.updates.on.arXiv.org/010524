Although increased automation has made it easier to control aircraft, ensuring a safe interaction
between the pilots and the autopilots is still a challenging problem, especially in the presence
of severe anomalies. Current approach consists of autopilot solutions that disengage themselves
when they become ineffective. This may cause reengagement of the pilot at the worst possible time,
which can result in undesired consequences. In this paper, a series of research studies that propose
pilot-autopilot interaction schemes based on the Capacity for Maneuver (CfM) concept, are covered.
CfM refers to the remaining capacity of the actuators that can be used for bringing the aircraft to
safety. It is demonstrated that CfM-based pilot-autopilot interaction schemes, or Shared Control
Architectures (SCA), can be promising alternatives to the existing schemes. Two SCAs are tested
in the experiments. In SCA1, the pilot takes over the control from the autopilot using the monitored
CfM information. In SCA2, the pilot takes on the role of a supervisor helping the autopilot whenever
a need arises, based on the CfM information. Whenever the aircraft experiences a severe anomaly,
the pilot assesses the situation based on his/her CfM monitoring and intervenes by providing two
control system parameter estimates to the autopilot. This increases the effectiveness of the autopilot.
Using human-in-the-loop simulations, it is shown that CfM based interactions provides smaller
tracking errors and larger overall CfM. The subjects including a commercial airline pilot and several
university students are trained using a systematic procedure. Creation of new cyber physical &
human systems is inevitable along with deeper engagement with the social science community so as
to get better insight into human decision making. The results reported here should be viewed as a
first of several steps in this research direction.
