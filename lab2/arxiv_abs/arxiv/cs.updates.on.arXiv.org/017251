Anomaly detection in retinal image refers to the identification of abnormality caused by various
retinal diseases/lesions, by only leveraging normal images in training phase. Normal images from
healthy subjects often have regular structures (e.g., the structured blood vessels in the fundus
image, or structured anatomy in optical coherence tomography image). On the contrary, the diseases
and lesions often destroy these structures. Motivated by this, we propose to leverage the relation
between the image texture and structure to design a deep neural network for anomaly detection. Specifically,
we first extract the structure of the retinal images, then we combine both the structure features
and the last layer features extracted from original health image to reconstruct the original input
healthy image. The image feature provides the texture information and guarantees the uniqueness
of the image recovered from the structure. In the end, we further utilize the reconstructed image
to extract the structure and measure the difference between structure extracted from original
and the reconstructed image. On the one hand, minimizing the reconstruction difference behaves
like a regularizer to guarantee that the image is corrected reconstructed. On the other hand, such
structure difference can also be used as a metric for normality measurement. The whole network is
termed as P-Net because it has a ``P'' shape. Extensive experiments on RESC dataset and iSee dataset
validate the effectiveness of our approach for anomaly detection in retinal images. Further, our
method also generalizes well to novel class discovery in retinal images and anomaly detection in
real-world images.
