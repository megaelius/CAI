Main memory database systems aim to provide users with low latency and high throughput access to
data. Most data resides in secondary storage, which is limited by the access speed of the technology.
For hot content, data resides in DRAM, which has become increasingly expensive as datasets grow
in size and access demand. With the emergence of low-latency storage solutions such as Flash and
Intel's 3D XPoint (3DXP), there is an opportunity for these systems to give users high Quality-of-Service
while reducing the cost for providers. To achieve high performance, providers must provision the
server hosts for these datasets with the proper amount of DRAM and secondary storage, as well as selecting
a storage technology. The growth of capacity and transaction load overtime makes it expensive to
flip back-and-forth between different storage technologies and memory-storage combinations.
Servers set up for one storage technology must now be reconfigured, repartitioned, and potentially
replaced altogether. As more low-latency storage solutions become available, how does one decide
on the right memory-storage combination, as well as selecting a storage technology, given a predicted
trend in dataset growth and offered load? In this paper, we describe and make the case for using the
TRaCaR ratio - the transaction rate divided by the storage capacity needed for a workload - for allowing
providers to choose the most cost-effective memory-storage combination and storage technology
given their predicted dataset trend and load requirement. We explore how the TRaCaR ratio can be
used with 3DXP and Flash with a highly-zipfian b-tree database, and discuss potential research
directions that can leverage the ratio.
