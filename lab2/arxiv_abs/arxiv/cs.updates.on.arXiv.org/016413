This paper serves as an introduction and overview of the potentially useful models and methodologies
from artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of transportation engineering for autonomous
vehicle (AV) control in the era of mixed autonomy. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications
of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, raise open questions, and help suggest
the building blocks and areas where AI could play a role in mixed autonomy. We divide the stage of autonomous
vehicle (AV) deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AVdominated, and
the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. It is the first-of-its-kind
survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for
mixed traffic modeling. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep
(reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily
focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large
number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate
human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in
the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized?
Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional
models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also reach out to other disciplines, in particular
robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic
ecosystem.
