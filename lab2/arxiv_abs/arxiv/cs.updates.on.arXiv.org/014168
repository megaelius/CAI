We investigate the overlap of topics of online news articles from a variety of sources. To do this,
we provide a platform for studying the news by measuring this overlap and scoring news stories according
to the degree of attention in near-real time. This can enable multiple studies, including identifying
topics that receive the most attention from news organizations and identifying slow news days versus
major news days. Our application, StoryGraph, periodically (10-minute intervals) extracts the
first five news articles from the RSS feeds of 17 US news media organizations across the partisanship
spectrum (left, center, and right). From these articles, StoryGraph extracts named entities (PEOPLE,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS, etc.) and then represents each news article with its set of extracted
named entities. Finally, StoryGraph generates a news similarity graph where the nodes represent
news articles, and an edge between a pair of nodes represents a high degree of similarity between
the nodes (similar news stories). Each news story within the news similarity graph is assigned an
attention score which quantifies the amount of attention the topics in the news story receive collectively
from the news media organizations. The StoryGraph service has been running since August 2017, and
using this method, we determined that the top news story of 2018 was the "Kavanaugh hearings" with
attention score of 25.85 on September 27, 2018. Similarly, the top news story for 2019 so far (2019-12-12)
is "AG William Barr's release of his principal conclusions of the Mueller Report," with an attention
score of 22.93 on March 24, 2019.
