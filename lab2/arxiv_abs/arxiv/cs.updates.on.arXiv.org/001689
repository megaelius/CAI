An electroencephalography (EEG) based brain activity recognition is a fundamental field of study
for a number of significant applications such as intention prediction, appliance control, and
neurological disease diagnosis in smart home and smart healthcare domains. Existing techniques
mostly focus on binary brain activity recognition for a single person, which limits their deployment
in wider and complex practical scenarios. Therefore, multi-person and multi-class brain activity
recognition has obtained popularity recently. Another challenge faced by brain activity recognition
is the low recognition accuracy due to the massive noises and the low signal-to-noise ratio in EEG
signals. Moreover, the feature engineering in EEG processing is time-consuming and highly re-
lies on the expert experience. In this paper, we attempt to solve the above challenges by proposing
an approach which has better EEG interpretation ability via raw Electroencephalography (EEG)
signal analysis for multi-person and multi-class brain activity recognition. Specifically,
we analyze inter-class and inter-person EEG signal characteristics, based on which to capture
the discrepancy of inter-class EEG data. Then, we adopt an Autoencoder layer to automatically refine
the raw EEG signals by eliminating various artifacts. We evaluate our approach on both a public and
a local EEG datasets and conduct extensive experiments to explore the effect of several factors
(such as normalization methods, training data size, and Autoencoder hidden neuron size) on the
recognition results. The experimental results show that our approach achieves a high accuracy
comparing to competitive state-of-the-art methods, indicating its potential in promoting future
research on multi-person EEG recognition.
