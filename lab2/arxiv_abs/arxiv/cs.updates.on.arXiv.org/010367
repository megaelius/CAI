As a crucial component in intelligent transportation systems, crowd flow prediction has recently
attracted widespread research interest in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) with the increasing
availability of large-scale traffic mobility data. Its key challenge lies in how to integrate diverse
factors (such as temporal laws and spatial dependencies) to infer the evolution trend of crowd flow.
To address this problem, we propose a unified neural network called Attentive Crowd Flow Machine
(ACFM), which can effectively learn the spatial-temporal feature representations of crowd flow
with an attention mechanism. In particular, our ACFM is composed of two progressive ConvLSTM units
connected with a convolutional layer. Specifically, the first LSTM unit takes normal crowd flow
features as input and generates a hidden state at each time-step, which is further fed into the connected
convolutional layer for spatial attention map inference. The second LSTM unit aims at learning
the dynamic spatial-temporal representations from the attentionally weighted crowd flow features.
Further, we develop two deep frameworks based on ACFM to predict citywide short-term/long-term
crowd flow by adaptively incorporating the sequential and periodic data as well as other external
influences. Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks well demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed method for crowd flow prediction. Moreover, to verify the generalization of our
method, we also apply the customized framework to forecast the passenger pickup/dropoff demands
and show its superior performance in this traffic prediction task.
