We consider the problem of designing affirmative action policies for selecting the top-k candidates
from a pool of applicants. We assume that for each candidate we have socio-demographic attributes
and a series of variables that serve as indicators of future performance (e.g., results on standardized
tests). We further assume that we have access to historical data including the actual performance
of previously selected candidates. Critically, performance information is only available for
candidates who were selected under some previous selection policy. In this work we assume that due
to legal requirements or voluntary commitments, an organization wants to increase the presence
of people from disadvantaged socio-demographic groups among the selected candidates. Hence,
we seek to design an affirmative action or positive action policy. This policy has two concurrent
objectives: (i) to select candidates who, given what can be learnt from historical data, are more
likely to perform well, and (ii) to select candidates in a way that increases the representation
of disadvantaged socio-demographic groups. Our motivating application is the design of university
admission policies to bachelor's degrees. We use a causal model as a framework to describe several
families of policies (changing component weights, giving bonuses, and enacting quotas), and compare
them both theoretically and through extensive experimentation on a large real-world dataset containing
thousands of university applicants. Our paper is the first to place the problem of affirmative-action
policy design within the framework of algorithmic fairness. Our empirical results indicate that
simple policies could favor the admission of disadvantaged groups without significantly compromising
on the quality of accepted candidates.
