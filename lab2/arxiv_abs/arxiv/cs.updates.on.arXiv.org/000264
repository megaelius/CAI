Objective: The main objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic performances of an alert
system integrated into the CPOE/EMR system for renally cleared drug dosing control. The generated
alerts were compared with the daily routine practice of pharmacists as part of the analysis of medication
orders. Materials and Methods: The pharmacists performed their analysis of medication orders
as usual and were not aware of the alert system interventions that were not displayed for the purpose
of the study neither to the physician nor to the pharmacist but kept with associate recommendations
in a log file. A senior pharmacist analyzed the results of medication order analysis with and without
the alert system. The unit of analysis was the drug prescription line. The primary study endpoints
were the detection of drug-dose prescription errors and inter-rater reliability between the alert
system and the pharmacists in the detection of drug dose error. Results: The alert system fired alerts
in 8.41% (421/5006) of cases: 5.65% (283/5006) exceeds max daily dose alerts and 2.76% (138/5006)
under dose alerts. The alert system and the pharmacists showed a relatively poor concordance: 0.106
(CI 95% [0.068, 0.144]). According to the senior pharmacist review, the alert system fired more
appropriate alerts than pharmacists, and made fewer errors than pharmacists in analyzing drug
dose prescriptions: 143 for the alert system and 261 for the pharmacists. Unlike the alert system,
most diagnostic errors made by the pharmacists were false negatives. The pharmacists were not able
to analyze a significant number (2097; 25.42%) of drug prescription lines because understaffing.
Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that an alert system would be complementary to the pharmacists
activity and contribute to drug prescription safety.
