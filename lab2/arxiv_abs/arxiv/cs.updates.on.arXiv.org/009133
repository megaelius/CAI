Temporal event data are collected across a broad range of domains, and a variety of visual analytics
techniques have been developed to empower analysts working with this form of data. These techniques
generally display aggregate statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common
patterns. Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many real-world
event sequence datasets because the large number of distinct event types within such data prevents
effective aggregation. A common coping strategy for this challenge is to group event types together
as a pre-process, prior to visualization, so that each group can be represented within an analysis
as a single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process also places significant
constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a dynamic hierarchical aggregation technique
that leverages a predefined hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness
of alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This allows users to dynamically
explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level of grouping to use at any individual step
within an analysis. Key contributions include an algorithm for interactively determining the
most informative set of event groupings from within a large-scale hierarchy of event types, and
a scatter-plus-focus visualization that supports interactive hierarchical exploration. While
these contributions are generalizable to other types of problems, we apply them to high-dimensional
event sequence analysis using large-scale event type hierarchies from the medical domain. We describe
their use within a medical cohort analysis tool called Cadence, demonstrate an example in which
the proposed technique supports better views of event sequence data, and report findings from domain
expert interviews.
