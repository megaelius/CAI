Community structure is an important area of research. It has received a considerable attention
from the scientific community. Despite its importance, one of the key problems in locating information
about community detection is the diverse spread of related articles across various disciplines.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no current comprehensive review of recent literature which
uses a scientometric analysis using complex networks analysis covering all relevant articles
from the Web of Science (WoS). Here we present a visual survey of key literature using CiteSpace.
The idea is to identify emerging trends besides using network techniques to examine the evolution
of the domain. Towards that end, we identify the most influential, central, as well as active nodes
using scientometric analyses. We examine authors, key articles, cited references, core subject
categories, key journals, institutions, as well as countries. The exploration of the scientometric
literature of the domain reveals that Yong Wang is a pivot node with the highest centrality. Additionally,
we have observed that Mark Newman is the most highly cited author in the network. We have also identified
that the journal, "Reviews of Modern Physics" has the strongest citation burst. In terms of cited
documents, an article by Andrea Lancichinetti has the highest centrality score. We have also discovered
that the origin of the key publications in this domain is from the United States. Whereas Scotland
has the strongest and longest citation burst. Additionally, we have found that the categories of
"Computer Science" and "Engineering" lead other categories based on frequency and centrality
respectively.
