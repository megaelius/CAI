This paper proposes the first known to us iris recognition methodology designed specifically for
post-mortem samples. We propose to use deep learning-based iris segmentation models to extract
highly irregular iris texture areas in post-mortem iris images. We show how to use segmentation
masks predicted by neural networks in conventional, Gabor-based iris recognition method, which
employs circular approximations of the pupillary and limbic iris boundaries. As a whole, this method
allows for a significant improvement in post-mortem iris recognition accuracy over the methods
designed only for ante-mortem irises, including the academic OSIRIS and commercial IriCore implementations.
The proposed method reaches the EER less than 1% for samples collected up to 10 hours after death,
when compared to 16.89% and 5.37% of EER observed for OSIRIS and IriCore, respectively. For samples
collected up to 369 hours post-mortem, the proposed method achieves the EER 21.45%, while 33.59%
and 25.38% are observed for OSIRIS and IriCore, respectively. Additionally, the method is tested
on a database of iris images collected from ophthalmology clinic patients, for which it also offers
an advantage over the two other algorithms. This work is the first step towards post-mortem-specific
iris recognition, which increases the chances of identification of deceased subjects in forensic
investigations. The new database of post-mortem iris images acquired from 42 subjects, as well
as the deep learning-based segmentation models are made available along with the paper, to ensure
all the results presented in this manuscript are reproducible.
