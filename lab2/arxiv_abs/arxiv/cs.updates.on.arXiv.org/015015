With the tremendous benefits of internet and advanced communications, there is a serious threat
from the data security perspective. There is a need of secure and robust encryption algorithm that
can be implemented on each and diverse software and hardware platforms. Also, in block symmetric
encryption algorithms, substitution boxes are the most vital part. In this paper, we investigate
semifield substitution boxes using permutation of symmetric group on a set of size 8 S_8 and establish
an effective procedure for generating S_8 semifield substitution boxes having same algebraic
properties. Further, the strength analysis of the generated substitution boxes is carried out
using the well-known standards namely bijectivity, nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion,
bit independence criterion, XOR table and differential invariant. Based on the analysis results,
it is shown that the cryptographic strength of generated substitution boxes is on par with the best
known $8\times 8$ substitution boxes. As application, an encryption algorithm is proposed that
can be employed to strengthen any kind of secure communication. The presented algorithm is mainly
based on the Shannon idea of (S-P) network where the process of substitution is performed by the proposed
S_8 semifield substitution boxes and permutation operation is performed by the binary cyclic shift
of substitution box transformed data. In addition, the proposed encryption algorithm utilizes
two different chaotic maps. In order to ensure the appropriate utilization of these chaotic maps,
we carry out in-depth analyses of their behavior in the context of secure communication and apply
the pseudo-random sequences of chaotic maps in the proposed image encryption algorithm accordingly.
The statistical and simulation results imply that our encryption scheme is secure against different
attacks and can resist linear and differential cryptanalysis.
