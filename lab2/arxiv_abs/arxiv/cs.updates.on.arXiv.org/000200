We consider an oriented network in which two subgraphs (modules X and Y), with a given intra-modular
edge density, are inter-connected by a fixed number of edges, in both directions. We study the adjacency
spectrum of this network, focusing in particular on two aspects: the changes in the spectrum in response
to varying the intra and inter-modular edge density, and the effects on the spectrum of perturbing
the edge configuration, while keeping the densities fixed. Since the general case is quite complex
analytically, we adopted a combination of analytical approaches to particular cases, and numerical
simulations for more results. After investigating the behavior of the mean and standard deviation
of the eigenvalues, we conjectured the robustness of the adjacency spectrum to variations in edge
geometry, when operating under a fixed density profile. We remark that, while this robustness increases
with the size N of the network, it emerges at small sizes, and should not be thought of as a property
that holds only in the large N limit. We argue that this may be helpful when studying applications
on small networks of nodes. We interpret our results in the context of existing literature, which
has been placing increasing attention to random graph models, with edges connecting two given nodes
with certain probabilities. We discuss whether properties such as Wigner's semicircle law, or
effects of community structure, still hold in our context. Finally, we suggest possible applications
of the model to understanding synaptic restructuring during learning algorithms, and to classifying
emotional responses based on the geometry of the emotion-regulatory neural circuit. In this light,
we argue that future directions should be directed towards relating hardwiring to the temporal
behavior of the network as a dynamical system .
