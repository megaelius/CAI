Physical embodiment is a required component for robots that are structurally coupled with their
real-world environments. However, most socially interactive robots do not need to physically
interact with their environments in order to perform their tasks. When and why should embodied robots
be used instead of simpler and cheaper virtual agents? This paper reviews the existing work that
explores the role of physical embodiment in socially interactive robots. This class consists of
robots that are not only capable of engaging in social interaction with humans, but are using primarily
their social capabilities to perform their desired functions. Socially interactive robots provide
entertainment, information, and/or assistance; this last category is typically encompassed
by socially assistive robotics. In all cases, such robots can achieve their primary functions without
performing functional physical work. To comprehensively evaluate the existing body of work on
embodiment, we first review work from established related fields including psychology, philosophy,
and sociology. We then systematically review 65 studies evaluating aspects of embodiment published
from 2003 to 2017 in major peer-reviewed robotics publication venues. We examine relevant aspects
of the selected studies, focusing on the embodiments compared, tasks evaluated, social roles of
robots, and measurements. We introduce three taxonomies for the types of robot embodiment, robot
social roles, and human-robot tasks. These taxonomies are used to deconstruct the design and interaction
spaces of socially interactive robots and facilitate analysis and discussion of the reviewed studies.
We use this newly-defined methodology to critically discuss existing works, revealing topics
within embodiment research for social interaction, assistive robotics, and service robotics.
