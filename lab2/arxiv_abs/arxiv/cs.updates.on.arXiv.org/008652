The minimum-weight $2$-edge-connected spanning subgraph (2-ECSS) problem is a natural generalization
of the well-studied minimum-weight spanning tree (MST) problem, and it has received considerable
attention in the area of network design. The latter problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph with
an edge connectivity of $1$ between each pair of vertices while the former strengthens this edge-connectivity
requirement to $2$. Despite this resemblance, the 2-ECSS problem is considerably more complex
than MST. While MST admits a linear-time centralized exact algorithm, 2-ECSS is NP-hard and the
best known centralized approximation algorithm for it (that runs in polynomial time) gives a $2$-approximation.
In this paper, we give a deterministic distributed algorithm with round complexity of $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$
that computes a $(5+\epsilon)$-approximation of 2-ECSS, for any constant $\epsilon>0$. Up to
logarithmic factors, this complexity matches the $\widetilde{\Omega}(D+\sqrt{n})$ lower bound
that can be derived from Das Sarma et al. [STOC'11], as shown by Censor-Hillel and Dory [OPODIS'17].
Our result is the first distributed constant approximation for 2-ECSS in the nearly optimal time
and it improves on a recent randomized algorithm of Dory [PODC'18], which achieved an $O(\log n)$-approximation
in $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds. We also present an alternative algorithm for $O(\log
n)$-approximation, whose round complexity is linear in the low-congestion shortcut parameter
of the network, following a framework introduced by Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA'16]. This algorithm
has round complexity $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ in worst-case networks but it provably runs
much faster in many well-behaved graph families of interest. For instance, it runs in $\widetilde{O}(D)$
time in planar networks and those with bounded genus, bounded path-width or bounded tree-width.
