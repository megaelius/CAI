In this work we investigate the problem of percolation centrality, a generalization of betweenness
centrality, in a weighted graph $G$ under the light of sample complexity theory. For both betweenness
and percolation centrality the computation of the {\it exact} value for a given vertex $v$ is not
known to be easier than the computation the same value, all at once, for all $n$ vertices of $G$. In
any one of these cases it is an open problem whether these measures can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^{3-c})$
time, for any constant $c>0$. In this paper we first present a $\mathcal{O}(m \log^2 n)$ randomized
approximation algorithm for the percolation centrality for every vertex of $G$, generalizing
techniques developed by \cite{RiondatoUpfal} (this complexity is reduced to $\mathcal{O}((m+n)
\log n)$ for unweighted graphs). The estimative obtained by the algorithm is within $\epsilon$
of the exact value with probability $1- \delta$, for {\it fixed} constants $0 < \epsilon,\delta
\leq 1$. Additionally, we show that sample complexity theory can be used to distinguish the problem
of estimating the percolation centrality of a single vertex, refered as computing $\tilde{p}(v)$,
from the problem of estimating the percolation centrality of every vertex of $G$, refered as computing
$\tilde{p}(G)$. More precisely, we show that $\tilde{p}(v)$ and $\tilde{p}(G)$ can be estimated
respectively in time $\mathcal{O}(m \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(m \log^2 n)$. Our results also imply
a similar "separation" for percolation estimation in unweighted dense graphs as well as separations
for the estimation of betweenness centrality that holds in any combination of the following scenarios:
weighted or unweighted for either sparse or dense graphs.
