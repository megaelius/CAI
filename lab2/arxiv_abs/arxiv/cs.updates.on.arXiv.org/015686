Environmental disasters such as flash floods are becoming more and more prevalent and carry an increasing
burden on human civilization. They are usually unpredictable, fast in development, and extend
across large geographical areas. The consequences of such disasters can be reduced through better
monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give timely and accurate information
to first responders and the public. Given the extended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying
nature of the phenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of locations
to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present informative mobile sensor routing
algorithms are either short-sighted or computationally demanding when applied to large scale
systems. In this paper, a real-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and
needs of city-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in forward
search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed parameter system, modeling
flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the causal relation expressed by a search tree, which
describes all possible sequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps
in the forward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance matrix between
observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a concrete example, numerical experiments
in this paper indicate that this scheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning
algorithms and other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper relies
on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states, and experiments suggest
that popular estimation techniques have very good performance when applied to precise data-driven
models.
