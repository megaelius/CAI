Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual responses is a central
challenge for current vision-based brain-machine interface techniques. To achieve high prediction
accuracy on neural signals, visual encoding models should include precise visual features and
appropriate prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft visual
features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven features (e.g., features extracted
from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also assume a linear mapping between feature representation
to brain activity. However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for maximizing
prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding framework to predict cortical
responses in a benchmark functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework,
we employ the transfer learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and
train a nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear mapping replaces
the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve prediction accuracy on brain activity.
Results: The proposed framework can significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early
visual areas (i.e., V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding models, we find
that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher prediction accuracy in all early visual
areas, especially in relatively anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work
proposes a new framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings
from visual features to brain activity.
