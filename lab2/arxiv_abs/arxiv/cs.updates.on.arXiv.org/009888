The design of communication systems capable of processing and exchanging information through
molecules and chemical processes is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field, which holds the
promise to revolutionize how we realize computing and communication devices. While molecular
communication (MC) theory has had major developments in recent years, more practical aspects in
designing components capable of MC functionalities remain less explored. Motivated by this, we
design a microfluidic MC system with a microfluidic MC transmitter and a microfluidic MC receiver
based on chemical reactions. Considering existing MC literature on information transmission
via molecular pulse modulation, the proposed microfluidic MC transmitter is capable of generating
continuously predefined pulse-shaped molecular concentrations upon rectangular triggering
signals using chemical reactions inspired by how cells generate pulse-shaped molecular signals
in biology. We further design a microfluidic MC receiver capable of demodulating a received signal
to a rectangular output signal using a thresholding reaction and an amplifying reaction. Our chemical
reactions-based microfluidic molecular communication system is reproducible and well-designed,
and more importantly, it overcomes the slow-speed, unreliability, and non-scalability of biological
processes in cells. To reveal design insights, we also derive the theoretical signal responses
for our designed microfluidic transmitter and receiver, which further facilitate the transmitter
design optimization. Our theoretical results are validated via simulations performed through
the COMSOL Multiphysics finite element solver. We demonstrate the predefined nature of the generated
pulse and the demodulated rectangular signal together with their dependence on design parameters.
