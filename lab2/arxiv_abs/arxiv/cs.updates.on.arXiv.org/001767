Many applications need to process massive streams of spatio-textual data in real-time against
continuous spatio-textual queries. For example, in location-aware ad targeting publish/subscribe
systems, it is required to disseminate millions of ads and promotions to millions of users based
on the locations and textual profiles of users. In this paper, we study indexing of continuous spatio-textual
queries. There exist several related spatio-textual indexes that typically integrate a spatial
index with a textual index. However, these indexes usually have a high demand for main-memory and
assume that the entire vocabulary of keywords is known in advance. Also, these indexes do not successfully
capture the variations in the frequencies of keywords across different spatial regions and treat
frequent and infrequent keywords in the same way. Moreover, existing indexes do not adapt to the
changes in workload over space and time. For example, some keywords may be trending at certain times
in certain locations and this may change as time passes. This affects the indexing and searching
performance of existing indexes significantly. In this paper, we introduce FAST, a Frequency-Aware
Spatio-Textual index for continuous spatio-textual queries. FAST is a main-memory index that
requires up to one third of the memory needed by the state-of-the-art index. FAST does not assume
prior knowledge of the entire vocabulary of indexed objects. FAST adaptively accounts for the difference
in the frequencies of keywords within their corresponding spatial regions to automatically choose
the best indexing approach that optimizes the insertion and search times. Extensive experimental
evaluation using real and synthetic datasets demonstrates that FAST is up to 3x faster in search
time and 5x faster in insertion time than the state-of-the-art indexes.
