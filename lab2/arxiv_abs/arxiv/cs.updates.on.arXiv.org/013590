The immersed boundary method is a mathematical framework for modeling fluid-structure interaction.
This formulation describes the momentum, viscosity, and incompressibility of the fluid-structure
system in Eulerian form, and it uses Lagrangian coordinates to describe the structural deformations,
stresses, and resultant forces. Integral transforms with Dirac delta function kernels connect
the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. The fluid and the structure are both typically treated as incompressible
materials. Upon discretization, however, the incompressibility of the structure is only maintained
approximately. To obtain an immersed method for incompressible hyperelastic structures that
is robust under large structural deformations, we introduce a volumetric energy in the solid region
that stabilizes the formulation and improves the accuracy of the numerical scheme. This formulation
augments the discrete Lagrange multiplier for the incompressibility constraint, thereby improving
the original method's accuracy. This volumetric energy is incorporated by decomposing the strain
energy into isochoric and dilatational components, as in standard solid mechanics formulations
of nearly incompressible elasticity. We study the performance of the stabilized method using several
quasi-static solid mechanics benchmarks, a dynamic fluid-structure interaction benchmark,
and a detailed three-dimensional model of esophageal transport. The accuracy achieved by the stabilized
immersed formulation is comparable to that of a stabilized finite element method for incompressible
elasticity using similar numbers of structural degrees of freedom.
