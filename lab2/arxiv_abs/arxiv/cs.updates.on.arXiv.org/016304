Social computing encompasses the mechanisms through which people interact with computational
systems: crowdsourcing systems, ranking and recommendation systems, online prediction markets,
citizen science projects, and collaboratively edited wikis, to name a few. These systems share
the common feature that humans are active participants, making choices that determine the input
to, and therefore the output of, the system. The output of these systems can be viewed as a joint computation
between machine and human, and can be richer than what either could produce alone. The term social
computing is often used as a synonym for several related areas, such as "human computation" and subsets
of "collective intelligence"; we use it in its broadest sense to encompass all of these things. Social
computing is blossoming into a rich research area of its own, with contributions from diverse disciplines
including computer science, economics, and other social sciences. Yet a broad mathematical foundation
for social computing is yet to be established, with a plethora of under-explored opportunities
for mathematical research to impact social computing. As in other fields, there is great potential
for mathematical work to influence and shape the future of social computing. However, we are far
from having the systematic and principled understanding of the advantages, limitations, and potentials
of social computing required to match the impact on applications that has occurred in other fields.
In June 2015, we brought together roughly 25 experts in related fields to discuss the promise and
challenges of establishing mathematical foundations for social computing. This document captures
several of the key ideas discussed.
