Emerging non-volatile main memory (NVRAM) technologies provide novel features for large-scale
graph analytics, combining byte-addressability, low idle power, and improved memory-density.
Systems are likely to have an order of magnitude more NVRAM than traditional memory (DRAM), allowing
large graph problems to be solved efficiently at a modest cost on a single machine. However, a significant
challenge in achieving high performance is in accounting for the fact that NVRAM writes can be significantly
more expensive than NVRAM reads. In this paper, we propose an approach to parallel graph analytics
in which the graph is stored as a read-only data structure (in NVRAM), and the amount of mutable memory
is kept proportional to the number of vertices. Similar to the popular semi-external and semi-streaming
models for graph analytics, the approach assumes that the vertices of the graph fit in a fast read-write
memory (DRAM), but the edges do not. In NVRAM systems, our approach eliminates writes to the NVRAM,
among other benefits. We present a model, the Parallel Semi-Asymmetric Model (PSAM), to analyze
algorithms in the setting, and run experiments on a 48-core NVRAM system to validate the effectiveness
of these algorithms. To this end, we study over a dozen graph problems. We develop parallel algorithms
for each that are efficient, often work-optimal, in the model. Experimentally, we run all of the
algorithms on the largest publicly-available graph and show that our PSAM algorithms outperform
the fastest prior algorithms designed for DRAM or NVRAM. We also show that our algorithms running
on NVRAM nearly match the fastest prior algorithms running solely in DRAM, by effectively hiding
the costs of repeatedly accessing NVRAM versus DRAM.
