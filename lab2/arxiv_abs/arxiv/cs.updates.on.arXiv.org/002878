Fifth generation~(5G) networks providing much higher bandwidth and faster data rates will allow
connecting vast number of static and mobile devices, sensors, agents, users, machines, and vehicles,
supporting Internet-of-Things (IoT), real-time dynamic networks of mobile things. Positioning
and location awareness will become increasingly important, enabling deployment of new services
and contributing to significantly improving the overall performance of the 5G~system. Many of
the currently talked about solutions to positioning in~5G are centralized, mostly requiring direct
line-of-sight (LoS) to deployed access nodes or anchors at the same time, which in turn requires
high-density deployments of anchors. But these LoS and centralized positioning solutions may
become unwieldy as the number of users and devices continues to grow without limit in sight. As an
alternative to the centralized solutions, this paper discusses distributed localization in a
5G enabled IoT environment where many low power devices, users, or agents are to locate themselves
without global or LoS access to anchors. Even though positioning is essentially a non-linear problem
(solving circle equations by trilateration or triangulation), we discuss a cooperative \textit{linear}
distributed iterative solution with only local measurements, communication and computation
needed at each agent. Linearity is obtained by reparametrization of the agent location through
barycentric coordinate representations based on local neighborhood geometry that may be computed
in terms of certain Cayley-Menger determinants involving relative local inter-agent distance
measurements.
