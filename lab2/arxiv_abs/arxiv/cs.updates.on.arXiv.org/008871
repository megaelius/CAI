Background: Chest X-rays are the most commonly performed, cost-effective diagnostic imaging
tests ordered by physicians. A clinically validated AI system that can reliably separate normals
from abnormals can be invaluble particularly in low-resource settings. The aim of this study was
to develop and validate a deep learning system to detect various abnormalities seen on a chest X-ray.
Methods: A deep learning system was trained on 2.3 million chest X-rays and their corresponding
radiology reports to identify various abnormalities seen on a Chest X-ray. The system was tested
against - 1. A three-radiologist majority on an independent, retrospectively collected set of
2000 X-rays(CQ2000) 2. Radiologist reports on a separate validation set of 100,000 scans(CQ100k).
The primary accuracy measure was area under the ROC curve (AUC), estimated separately for each abnormality
and for normal versus abnormal scans. Results: On the CQ2000 dataset, the deep learning system demonstrated
an AUC of 0.92(CI 0.91-0.94) for detection of abnormal scans, and AUC(CI) of 0.96(0.94-0.98), 0.96(0.94-0.98),
0.95(0.87-1), 0.95(0.92-0.98), 0.93(0.90-0.96), 0.89(0.83-0.94), 0.91(0.87-0.96), 0.94(0.93-0.96),
0.98(0.97-1) for the detection of blunted costophrenic angle, cardiomegaly, cavity, consolidation,
fibrosis, hilar enlargement, nodule, opacity and pleural effusion. The AUCs were similar on the
larger CQ100k dataset except for detecting normals where the AUC was 0.86(0.85-0.86). Interpretation:
Our study demonstrates that a deep learning algorithm trained on a large, well-labelled dataset
can accurately detect multiple abnormalities on chest X-rays. As these systems improve in accuracy,
applying deep learning to widen the reach of chest X-ray interpretation and improve reporting efficiency
will add tremendous value in radiology workflows and public health screenings globally.
