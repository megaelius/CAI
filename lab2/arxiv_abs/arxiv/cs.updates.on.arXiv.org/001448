We examine the task of privacy amplification from information-theoretic and coding-theoretic
points of view. In the former, we give a one-shot characterization of the optimal rate of privacy
amplification against classical adversaries in terms of the optimal type-II error in asymmetric
hypothesis testing. The converse significantly improves on previous bounds based on smooth min-entropy
by Watanabe and Hayashi [ISIT 2013; arXiv:1211.5252] and turns out to be equivalent to a recent formulation
in terms of the $E_\gamma$ divergence by Yang, Schaefer, and Poor [arXiv:1706.03866]. In the latter,
we show that protocols for privacy amplification based on linear codes can be easily repurposed
for channel simulation. Combined with known relations between channel simulation and lossy source
coding, this implies that privacy amplification can be understood as a basic primitive for both
channel simulation and lossy compression. Applied to symmetric channels or lossy compression
settings, our construction leads to protocols of optimal rate in the asymptotic i.i.d. limit. Finally,
appealing to the notion of channel duality recently detailed by us in [arXiv:1701.05583], we show
that linear error-correcting codes for symmetric channels with quantum output can be transformed
into linear lossy source coding schemes for classical variables arising from the dual channel.
This explains a "curious duality" in these problems for the (self-dual) erasure channel observed
by Martinian and Yedidia [Allerton 2003; arXiv:cs/0408008] and partly anticipates recent results
on optimal lossy compression by polar and low-density generator matrix codes.
