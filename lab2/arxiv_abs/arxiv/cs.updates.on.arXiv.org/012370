One of the main challenges in IoT is providing communication support to an increasing number of connected
devices. In recent years, narrowband radio technology has emerged to address this situation: Narrowband
Internet of Things (NB-IoT), which is now part of 5G. Supporting massive connectivity becomes particularly
demanding in extreme coverage scenarios such as underground or deep inside buildings sites. We
propose a novel strategy for these situations focused on optimizing NB-IoT shared channels through
the selection of link parameters: modulation and coding scheme, as well as the number of repetitions.
These parameters are established by the base station (BS) for each block transmitted until reaching
a target block error rate (BLER_t ). A wrong selection of these magnitudes leads to radio resource
waste and a decrease in the number of possible concurrent connections. Specifically, our strategy
is based on a look-up table (LUT) scheme which is used for rapidly delivering the optimal link parameters
given a target QoS. To validate our proposal, we compare with alternative strategies using an open
source NB-IoT uplink simulator. The experiments are based on transmitting blocks of 256 bits using
an AWGN channel over the NPUSCH. Results show that, especially under extreme conditions, only a
few options for link parameters are available, favoring robustness against measurement uncertainties.
Our strategy minimizes resource usage in all scenarios of acknowledged mode and remarkably reduces
losses in the unacknowledged mode, presenting also substantial gains in performance. We expect
to influence future BS software design and implementation, favoring connection support under
extreme environments.
