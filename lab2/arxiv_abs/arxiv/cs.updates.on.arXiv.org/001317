Rear end collisions are deadliest in nature and cause most of traffic casualties and injuries. In
the existing research, many rear end collision avoidance solutions have been proposed. However,
the problem with these proposed solutions is that they are highly dependent on precise mathematical
models. Whereas, the real road driving is influenced by non-linear factors such as road surface
situations, driver reaction time, pedestrian flow and vehicle dynamics, hence obtaining the accurate
mathematical model of the vehicle control system is challenging. This problem with precise control
based rear end collision avoidance schemes has been addressed using fuzzy logic, but the excessive
number of fuzzy rules straightforwardly prejudice their efficiency. Furthermore, these fuzzy
logic based controllers have been proposed without using proper agent based modeling that helps
in mimicking the functions of an artificial human driver executing these fuzzy rules. Keeping in
view these limitations, we have proposed an Enhanced Emotion Enabled Cognitive Agent (EEEC_Agent)
based controller that helps the Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to perform rear end collision avoidance
with less number of rules, designed after fear emotion, and high efficiency. To introduce a fear
emotion generation mechanism in EEEC_Agent, Orton, Clore & Collins (OCC) model has been employed.
The fear generation mechanism of EEEC_Agent has been verified using NetLogo simulation. Furthermore,
practical validation of EEEC_Agent functions has been performed using specially built prototype
AV platform. Eventually, the qualitative comparative study with existing state of the art research
works reflect that proposed model outperforms recent research.
