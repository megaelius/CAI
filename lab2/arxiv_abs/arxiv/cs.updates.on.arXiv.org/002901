The focus of this paper is on multi-user MIMO transmissions for millimeter wave systems with a hybrid
precoding architecture at the base-station. To enable multi-user transmissions, the base-station
uses a cell-specific codebook of beamforming vectors over an initial beam alignment phase. Each
user uses a user-specific codebook of beamforming vectors to learn the top-P (where P >= 1) beam pairs
in terms of the observed SNR in a single-user setting. The top-P beam indices along with their SNRs
are fed back from each user and the base-station leverages this information to generate beam weights
for simultaneous transmissions. A typical method to generate the beam weights is to use only the
best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam, or to utilize this information to
reduce multi-user interference. The other beams are used as fall back options to address blockage
or mobility. Such an approach completely discards information learned about the channel condition(s)
even though each user feeds back this information. With this background, this work develops an advanced
directional precoding structure for simultaneous transmissions at the cost of an additional marginal
feedback overhead. This construction relies on three main innovations: 1) Additional feedback
to allow the base-station to reconstruct a rank-P approximation of the channel matrix between it
and each user, 2) A zeroforcing structure that leverages this information to combat multi-user
interference by remaining agnostic of the receiver beam knowledge in the precoder design, and 3)
A hybrid precoding architecture that allows both amplitude and phase control at low-complexity
and cost to allow the implementation of the zeroforcing structure. Numerical studies show that
the proposed scheme results in a significant sum rate performance improvement over naive schemes
even with a coarse initial beam alignment codebook.
