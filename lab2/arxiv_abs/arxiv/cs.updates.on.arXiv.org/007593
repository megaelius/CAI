Automated surface-anomaly detection using machine learning has become an interesting and promising
area of research, with a very high and direct impact on the application domain of visual inspection.
Deep-learning methods have become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection
system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of exemplar images. This
paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection
and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack
detection. The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small number of
samples, which is an important requirement for practical applications. The proposed model is compared
with the related deep-learning methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software,
showing that the proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the domain of a surface-crack
detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the required precision of the annotation,
the number of required training samples and on the required computational cost. Experiments are
performed on a newly created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrate
that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected surfaces, using only approximately
25-30 defective training samples, instead of hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in
deep-learning applications. This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry
where the number of available defective samples is limited. The dataset is also made publicly available
to encourage the development and evaluation of new methods for surface-defect detection.
