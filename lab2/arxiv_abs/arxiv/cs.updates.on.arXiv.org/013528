Massive MIMO systems are seen by many researchers as a paramount technology toward next generation
networks. This technology consists of hundreds of antennas that are capable of sending and receiving
simultaneously a huge amount of data. One of the main challenges when using this technology is the
necessity of an efficient decoding framework. The latter must guarantee both a low complexity and
a good signal detection accuracy. The Sphere Decoder (SD) algorithm represents one of the promising
decoding algorithms in terms of detection accuracy. However, it is inefficient for dealing with
large MIMO systems due to its prohibitive complexity. To overcome this drawback, we propose to revisit
the sequential SD algorithm and implement several variants that aim at finding appropriate trade-offs
between complexity and performance. Then, we propose an efficient high-level parallel SD scheme
based on the master/worker paradigm, which permits multiple SD instances to simultaneously explore
the search space, while mitigating the overheads from load imbalance. The results of our parallel
SD implementation outperform the state-of-the-art by more than 5x using similar MIMO configuration
systems, and show a super-linear speedup on multicore platforms. Moreover, this paper presents
a new hybrid implementation that combines the strengths of SD and K-best algorithms, i.e., maintaining
the detection accuracy of SD, while reducing the complexity using the K-best way of pruning search
space. The hybrid approach extends our parallel SD implementation: the master contains the SD search
tree, and the workers use the K-best algorithm to accelerate its exploration. The resulting hybrid
approach enhances the diversification gain, and therefore, lowers the overall complexity. Our
synergistic hybrid approach permits to deal with large MIMO configurations up to 100x100, without
sacrificing the accuracy and complexity.
