Robust control and maintenance of the grid relies on accurate data. Both PMUs and state estimators
are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is crucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate
detection of an agent maliciously tampering with the data---for both preventing attacks that may
lead to blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control tasks of current and future grids. We propose
a decentralized false data injection detection scheme based on Markov graph of the bus phase angles.
We utilize the Conditional Covariance Test (CCT) to learn the structure of the grid. Using the DC
power flow model, we show that under normal circumstances, and because of walk-summability of the
grid graph, the Markov graph of the voltage angles can be determined by the power grid graph. Therefore,
a discrepancy between calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm.
Local grid topology is available online from the protection system and we exploit it to check for
mismatch. Should a mismatch be detected, we use correlation anomaly score to detect the set of attacked
nodes. Our method can detect the most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes
knowledge of bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state estimator, damaging
power network observatory, control, monitoring, demand response and pricing schemes. Specifically,
under the stealthy deception attack, the Markov graph of phase angles changes. In addition to detect
a state of attack, our method can detect the set of attacked nodes. To the best of our knowledge, our
remedy is the first to comprehensively detect this sophisticated attack and it does not need additional
hardware. Moreover, our detection scheme is successful no matter the size of the attacked subset.
Simulation of various power networks confirms our claims.
