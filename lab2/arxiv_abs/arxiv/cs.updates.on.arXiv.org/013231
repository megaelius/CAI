Early detection and classification of pulmonary nodules in Chest Computed tomography (CT) images
is an essential step for effective treatment of lung cancer. However, due to the large volume of CT
data, finding nodules in chest CT is a time consuming thus error prone task for radiologists. Benefited
from the recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets), many algorithms based on
ConvNets for automatic nodule detection have been proposed. According to the data representation
in their input, these algorithms can be further categorized into: 2D, 3D and 2.5D which uses a combination
of 2D images to approximate 3D information. Leveraging 3D spatial and contextual information,
the method using 3D input generally outperform that based on 2D or 2.5D input, whereas its large memory
footprints becomes the bottleneck for many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D data
representation of a 3D CT volume, which is constructed by spiral scanning a set of radials originated
from the 3D volume center, referred to as the 2.75D. Comparing to the 2.5D, the 2.75D representation
captures omni-directional spatial information of a 3D volume. Based on 2.75D representation of
3D nodule candidates in Chest CT, we train a convolutional neural network to perform the false positive
reduction in the nodule detection pipeline. We evaluate the nodule false positive reduction system
on the LUNA16 data set which contains 1186 nodules out of 551,065 candidates. By comparing 2.75D
with 2D, 2.5D and 3D, we show that our system using 2.75D input outperforms 2D and 2.5D, yet slightly
inferior to the systems using 3D input. The proposed strategy dramatically reduces the memory consumption
thus allow fast inference and training by enabling larger number of batches comparing to the methods
using 3D input.
