We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing
upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental
SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual
ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under
(near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact
when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal
masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal
masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks.
To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data
set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies,
their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates.
Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression
of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our
theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation
of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key
NPI; a "mouth-and-nose lockdown" is far more sustainable than a "full body lockdown", on economic,
social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at this http

and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational
goals of responsibly protecting one's community.
