The need for tomographic reconstruction from sparse measurements arises when the measurement
process is potentially harmful, needs to be rapid, or is uneconomical. In such cases, information
from previous longitudinal scans of the same object helps to reconstruct the current object while
requiring significantly fewer updating measurements. Our work is based on longitudinal data acquisition
scenarios where we wish to study new changes that evolve within an object over time, such as in repeated
scanning for disease monitoring, or in tomography-guided surgical procedures. While this is easily
feasible when measurements are acquired from a large number of projection views, it is challenging
when the number of views is limited. If the goal is to track the changes while simultaneously reducing
sub-sampling artefacts, we propose (1) acquiring measurements from a small number of views and
using a global unweighted prior-based reconstruction. If the goal is to observe details of new changes,
we propose (2) acquiring measurements from a moderate number of views and using a more involved reconstruction
routine. We show that in the latter case, a weighted technique is necessary in order to prevent the
prior from adversely affecting the reconstruction of new structures that are absent in any of the
earlier scans. The reconstruction of new regions is safeguarded from the bias of the prior by computing
regional weights that moderate the local influence of the priors. We are thus able to effectively
reconstruct both the old and the new structures in the test. In addition to testing on simulated data,
we have validated the efficacy of our method on real tomographic data. The results demonstrate the
use of both unweighted and weighted priors in different scenarios.
