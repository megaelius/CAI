Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) communication can significantly improve pedestrian safety at a
signalized intersection. It is unlikely that pedestrians will carry a low latency communication
enabled device and activate a pedestrian safety application in their hand-held device all the time.
Because of this limitation, multiple traffic cameras at the signalized intersection can be used
to accurately detect and locate pedestrians using deep learning and broadcast safety alerts related
to pedestrians to warn connected and automated vehicles around a signalized intersection. However,
unavailability of high-performance computing infrastructure at the roadside and limited network
bandwidth between traffic cameras and the computing infrastructure limits the ability of real-time
data streaming and processing for pedestrian detection. In this paper, we develop an edge computing
based real-time pedestrian detection strategy combining pedestrian detection algorithm using
deep learning and an efficient data communication approach to reduce bandwidth requirements while
maintaining a high object detection accuracy. We utilize a lossy compression technique on traffic
camera data to determine the tradeoff between the reduction of the communication bandwidth requirements
and a defined object detection accuracy. The performance of the pedestrian-detection strategy
is measured in terms of pedestrian classification accuracy with varying peak signal-to-noise
ratios. The analyses reveal that we detect pedestrians by maintaining a defined detection accuracy
with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) 43 dB while reducing the communication bandwidth from
9.82 Mbits/sec to 0.31 Mbits/sec, a 31x reduction.
