Convex optimization is a vibrant and successful area due to the existence of a variety of efficient
algorithms that leverage the rich structure provided by convexity. Convexity of a smooth set or
a function in a Euclidean space is defined by how it interacts with the standard differential structure
in this space -- the Hessian of a convex function has to be positive semi-definite everywhere. However,
in recent years, there is a growing demand to understand non-convexity and develop computational
methods to optimize non-convex functions. Intriguingly, there is a type of non-convexity that
disappears once one introduces a suitable differentiable structure and redefines convexity with
respect to the straight lines, or {\em geodesics}, with respect to this structure. Such convexity
is referred to as {\em geodesic convexity}. Interest in studying it arises due to recent reformulations
of some non-convex problems as geodesically convex optimization problems over geodesically convex
sets. Geodesics on manifolds have been extensively studied in various branches of Mathematics
and Physics. However, unlike convex optimization, understanding geodesics and geodesic convexity
from a computational point of view largely remains a mystery. The goal of this exposition is to introduce
the first part of geodesic convex optimization -- geodesic convexity -- in a self-contained manner.
We first present a variety of notions from differential and Riemannian geometry such as differentiation
on manifolds, geodesics, and then introduce geodesic convexity. We conclude by showing that certain
non-convex optimization problems such as computing the Brascamp-Lieb constant and the operator
scaling problem have geodesically convex formulations.
