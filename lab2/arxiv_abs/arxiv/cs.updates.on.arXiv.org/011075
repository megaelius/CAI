We develop a logic-based framework for formal specification and algorithmic verification of homogeneous
and dynamic concurrent multi-agent transition systems (HDMAS). Homogeneity means that all agents
have the same available actions at any given state and the actions have the same effects regardless
of which agents perform them. The state transitions are therefore determined only by the vector
of numbers of agents performing each action and are specified symbolically, by means of conditions
on these numbers definable in Presburger arithmetic. The agents are divided into controllable
(by the system supervisor/controller) and uncontrollable, representing the environment or adversary.
Dynamicity means that the numbers of controllable and uncontrollable agents may vary throughout
the system evolution, possibly at every transition. As a language for formal specification we use
a suitably extended version of Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL), where one can specify properties
of the type "a coalition of (at least) $n$ controllable agents can ensure against (at most) $m$ uncontrollable
agents that any possible evolution of the system satisfies a given objective $\varphi$", where
$\varphi$ is specified again as a formula of that language and each of $n$ and $m$ is either a fixed
number or a variable that can be quantified over. We provide formal semantics to our logic $\mathcal{L}_{HDMAS}$
and define normal form of its formulae. We then prove that every formula in $\mathcal{L}_{HDMAS}$
is equivalent in the finite to one in a normal form and develop an algorithm for global model checking
of formulae in normal form in finite HDMAS models, which invokes model checking truth of Presburger
formulae. We establish worst case complexity estimates for the model checking algorithm and illustrate
it on a running example.
