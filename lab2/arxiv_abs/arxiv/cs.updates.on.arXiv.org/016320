The shortage of people trained in STEM fields is becoming acute, and universities and colleges are
straining to satisfy this demand. In the case of computer science, for instance, the number of US
students taking introductory courses has grown three-fold in the past decade. Recently, massive
open online courses (MOOCs) have been promoted as a way to ease this strain. This at best provides
access to education. The bigger challenge though is coping with heterogeneous backgrounds of different
students, retention, providing feedback, and assessment. Personalized education relying on
computational tools can address this challenge. While automated tutoring has been studied at different
times in different communities, recent advances in computing and education technology offer exciting
opportunities to transform the manner in which students learn. In particular, at least three trends
are significant. First, progress in logical reasoning, data analytics, and natural language processing
has led to tutoring tools for automatic assessment, personalized instruction including targeted
feedback, and adaptive content generation for a variety of subjects. Second, research in the science
of learning and human-computer interaction is leading to a better understanding of how different
students learn, when and what types of interventions are effective for different instructional
goals, and how to measure the success of educational tools. Finally, the recent emergence of online
education platforms, both in academia and industry, is leading to new opportunities for the development
of a shared infrastructure. This CCC workshop brought together researchers developing educational
tools based on technologies such as logical reasoning and machine learning with researchers in
education, human-computer interaction, and cognitive psychology.
