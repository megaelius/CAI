Recent development of object detection mainly depends on deep learning with large-scale benchmarks.
However, collecting such fully-annotated data is often difficult or expensive for real-world
applications, which restricts the power of deep neural networks in practice. Alternatively, humans
can detect new objects with little annotation burden, since humans often use the prior knowledge
to identify new objects with few elaborately-annotated examples, and subsequently generalize
this capacity by exploiting objects from wild images. Inspired by this procedure of learning to
detect, we propose a novel Progressive Object Transfer Detection (POTD) framework. Specifically,
we make three main contributions in this paper. First, POTD can leverage various object supervision
of different domains effectively into a progressive detection procedure. Via such human-like
learning, one can boost a target detection task with few annotations. Second, POTD consists of two
delicate transfer stages, i.e., Low-Shot Transfer Detection (LSTD), and Weakly-Supervised Transfer
Detection (WSTD). In LSTD, we distill the implicit object knowledge of source detector to enhance
target detector with few annotations. It can effectively warm up WSTD later on. In WSTD, we design
a recurrent object labelling mechanism for learning to annotate weakly-labeled images. More importantly,
we exploit the reliable object supervision from LSTD, which can further enhance the robustness
of target detector in the WSTD stage. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on a number of challenging
detection benchmarks with different settings. The results demonstrate that, our POTD outperforms
the recent state-of-the-art approaches.
