Most graphs in real life keep changing with time. These changes can be in the form of insertion or deletion
of edges or vertices. Such rapidly changing graphs motivate us to study dynamic graph algorithms.
However, three important graph problems that are perhaps not sufficiently addressed in the literature
include independent sets, maximum matching (exact) and maximum flows. Maximal Independent Set
(MIS) is one of the most prominently studied problems in the distributed setting. Recently, the
first dynamic MIS algorithm for distributed networks was given by Censor-Hillel et al. [PODC16],
requiring expected $O(1)$ amortized rounds with $O(\Delta)$ messages per update, where $\Delta$
is the maximum degree of a vertex in the graph. They suggested an open problem to maintain MIS in fully
dynamic centralized setting more efficiently. Assadi et al. [STOC18] presented a deterministic
centralized fully dynamic MIS algorithm requiring $O(\min\{\Delta,m^{3/4}\})$ amortized time
per update. This result is quite complex involving an exhaustive case analysis. We report a surprisingly
simple deterministic centralized algorithm which improves the amortized update time to $O(\min\{\Delta,m^{2/3}\})$.
Additionally, we present some other minor results related to dynamic MIS, Maximum Flow, and Maximum
Matching. A common trait of all our results is that despite improving state of the art upper bounds
or matching state of the art lower bounds, they are surprisingly simple and are analysed using simple
amortization arguments. Further, they use no complicated data structures or black box algorithms
for their implementation.
