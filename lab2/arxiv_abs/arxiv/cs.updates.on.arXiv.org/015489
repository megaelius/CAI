Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm to achieve high spectral and energy
efficiency for future wireless networks by reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via
passive reflection. To reap the potential gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential,
whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited channel training resources.
In this paper, in order to optimize the performance of IRS-aided multiuser systems with imperfect
CSI, we propose to jointly design the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive
reflection coefficients of IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift and also
the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of each user is derived assuming
a practical IRS channel estimation method, which shows that the interference due to CSI errors is
intricately related to the AP transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection
coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Then, for the single-user case,
by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach method and block successive upper-bound
minimization (BSUM) method, a new penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize
the IRS reflection coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected
to CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm
is proposed to maximize the users' weighted sum-rate. Simulation results are presented to validate
the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular,
useful insights are drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control (with/without
the conventional phase shift) on the system performance under imperfect CSI.
