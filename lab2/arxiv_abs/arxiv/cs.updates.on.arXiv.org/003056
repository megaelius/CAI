We propose capacitively driven low-swing global interconnect circuit using a receiver that utilizes
magnetoelectric (ME) effect induced magnetization switching to reduce the energy consumption.
Capacitively driven wire has recently been shown to be effective in improving the performance of
global interconnects. Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect by using
a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional voltage supply. However, the large
reduction in signal swing makes it necessary to use differential signaling and amplification for
successful regeneration at the receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization
reversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low voltage to switch
a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide. Here, we propose an ME effect based receiver that
uses the low voltage at the receiving end of the global wire to switch a nanomagnet. The nanomagnet
is also used as the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the resistance of which is tuned
through the ME effect. This change in MTJ resistance is converted to full swing binary signals by
using simple digital components. This process allows capacitive low swing interconnection without
differential signaling or amplification, which leads to significant energy efficiency. Our simulation
results indicate that for 5-10 mm long global wires in IBM 45 nm technology, capacitive ME design
consumes 3x lower energy compared to full-swing CMOS design and 2x lower energy compared to differential
amplifier based low-swing capacitive CMOS design.
