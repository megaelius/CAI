Recently, data-driven methods for control of dynamic systems have received considerable attention
in system theory machine learning as they provide a mechanism for feedback synthesis from the observed
time-series data. However learning, say through direct policy updates, often requires assumptions
such as knowing a priori that the initial policy (gain) is stabilizing, e.g., when the open-loop
system is stable. In this paper, we examine online regulation of (possibly unstable) partially
unknown linear systems with no a priori assumptions on the initial controller. First, we introduce
and characterize the notion of ''regularizability'' for linear systems that gauges the capacity
of a system to be regulated in finite-time in contrast to its asymptotic behavior (commonly characterized
by stabilizability/controllability). Next, having access only to the input matrix, we propose
the Data-Guided Regulation (DGR) synthesis that--as its name suggests--regulates the underlying
states while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization
or system identification (sysID). The analysis is also related in spirit, to the spectrum and the
''instability number'' of the underlying linear system, a novel geometric property studied in
this work. We further elucidate our results by considering special structures for system parameters
as well as boosting the performance of the algorithm via a rank-one matrix update using the discrete
nature of data collection in the problem setup. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed
approach via an example involving direct (online) regulation of the X-29 aircraft.
