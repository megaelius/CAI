A \emph{$k$-bend path} is a rectilinear curve made up of $k + 1$ line segments. A \emph{$B_k$-VPG
representation} of a graph is a collection of $k$-bend paths such that each path in the collection
represents a vertex of the graph and two such paths intersect if and only if the vertices they represent
are adjacent in the graph. The graphs that have a $B_k$-VPG representation are called \emph{$B_k$-VPG
graphs}. In this paper, we address the open question posed by Chaplick et al. ({\textsc{wg 2012}})
asking whether $B_k$-VPG-chordal $\subsetneq$ $B_{k+1}$-VPG-chordal for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$,
where $B_k$-VPG denotes the class of graphs with bend number at most $k$. We prove there are infinitely
many $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $B_m$-VPG-split $\subsetneq$ $B_{m+1}$-VPG-split which provides
infinitely many positive examples with respect to the open question. We also prove that for all $t
\in \mathbb{N}$, $B_t$-VPG-$Forb(C_{\geq 5})$ $\subsetneq$ $B_{4t+29}$-VPG-$Forb(C_{\geq
5})$ where $Forb(C_{\geq 5})$ denotes the family of graphs that does not contain induced cycles
of length greater than 4. Furthermore, we show that $PB_t$-VPG-split $\subsetneq PB_{36t+80}$-VPG-split.
for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, where $PB_t$-VPG denotes the class of graphs with proper bend number
at most $t$. In this paper, we study the relationship between poset dimension and its bend number.
It is known that the poset dimension $dim(G)$ of a cocomparability graph $G$ is greater than or equal
to its bend number $bend(G)$. Cohen et al. ({\textsc{order 2015}}) asked for examples of cocomparability
graphs with low bend number and high poset dimension. We answer the above open question by proving
that for each $m, t \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a cocomparability graph $G_{t,m}$ with $t < bend(G_{t,m})
\leq 4t+29$ and $dim(G_{t,m})-bend(G_{t,m})$ is greater than $m$.
