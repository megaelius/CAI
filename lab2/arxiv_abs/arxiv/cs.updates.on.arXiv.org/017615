In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted system where a multi-antenna
base station (BS) serves a single-antenna user with the help of a multi-element IRS in the presence
of interference generated by a multi-antenna BS serving its own single-antenna user. The signal
and interference links via the IRS are modeled with Rician fading. To reduce phase adjustment cost,
we adopt quasi-static phase shift design where the phase shifts do not change with the instantaneous
channel state information (CSI). We investigate two cases of CSI at the BSs, namely, the instantaneous
CSI case and the statistical CSI case, and apply Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT) based on the complete
CSI and the CSI of the Line-of-sight (LoS) components, respectively. Different costs on channel
estimation and beamforming adjustment are incurred in the two CSI cases. First, we obtain a tractable
expression of the average rate in the instantaneous CSI case and a tractable expression of the ergodic
rate in the statistical CSI case. We also provide sufficient conditions for the average rate in the
instantaneous CSI case to surpass the ergodic rate in the statistical CSI case, at any phase shifts.
Then, we maximize the average rate and ergodic rate, both with respect to the phase shifts, leading
to two non-convex optimization problems. For each problem, we obtain a globally optimal solution
under certain system parameters, and propose an iterative algorithm based on parallel coordinate
descent (PCD) to obtain a stationary point under arbitrary system parameters. Next, in each CSI
case, we provide sufficient conditions under which the optimal quasi-static phase shift design
is beneficial, compared to the system without IRS. Finally, we numerically verify the analytical
results and demonstrate notable gains of the proposal solutions over existing ones.
