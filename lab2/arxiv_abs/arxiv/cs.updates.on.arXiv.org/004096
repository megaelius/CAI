In spite of the benefits of biometric-based authentication systems, there are few concerns raised
because of the sensitivity of biometric data to outliers, low performance caused due to intra-class
variations and privacy invasion caused by information leakage. To address these issues, we propose
a hybrid fusion framework where only the protected modalities are combined to fulfill the requirement
of secrecy and performance improvement. This paper presents a method to integrate cancelable modalities
utilizing mean-closure weighting (MCW) score level and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory based decision
level fusion for iris and fingerprint to mitigate the limitations in the individual score or decision
fusion mechanisms. The proposed hybrid fusion scheme incorporates the similarity scores from
different matchers corresponding to each protected modality. The individual scores obtained
from different matchers for each modality are combined using MCW score fusion method. The MCW technique
achieves the optimal weight for each matcher involved in the score computation. Further, DS theory
is applied to the induced scores to output the final decision. The rigorous experimental evaluations
on three virtual databases indicate that the proposed hybrid fusion framework outperforms over
the component level or individual fusion methods (score level and decision level fusion). As a result,
we achieve (48%,66%), (72%,86%) and (49%,38%) of performance improvement over unimodal cancelable
iris and unimodal cancelable fingerprint verification systems for Virtual_A, Virtual_B and Virtual_C
databases, respectively. Also, the proposed method is robust enough to the variability of scores
and outliers satisfying the requirement of secure authentication.
