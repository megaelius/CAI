RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a powerful technology that, due to its numerous advantages,
is supposed to replace the various identification systems such as barcodes or magnetic stripes
in a short time. There are three devices involved in an RFID protocol: a Reader, a Tag, and a back-end
Database. One of the key factors for the RFID technology is that, in order to be used on large scale,
the price of the Tags has to be cheap: it cannot be expensive because who is supposed to use it would
need a great amount of them, furthermore, Tags must have very small dimensions. The low-cost nature
of such devices implies the impossibility to use standard cryptographic protocols on them, furthermore,
Ultra-Lightweight Tags even lack the necessary computational power to generate random numbers.
Many experts are trying to build secure protocols that involve just simple bitwise logical operations
for these Tags, but, unfortunately, each of these protocols turned out to be vulnerable to some serious
attack after short time from publication. The need for a secure RFID authentication protocol today
seems more urgent than ever, because this technology is already used for security purposes, such
as electronic passports. The challenge to build a secure protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems
is so hard that in several years no one has been able to build one. In this thesis we analyze in great
detail a recently proposed protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems called SLAP, with the aim
of finding new vulnerabilities. SLAP has already been violated (along with a set of similar protocols)
by Safkhani and Bagheri, that have recently published a de-synchronization attack. At the end of
our analysis, we will propose an impersonification attack to the protocol, along with a fix for our
attack and some considerations on the attacks proposed on this kind of protocols.
