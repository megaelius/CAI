Point cloud is point sets defined in 3D metric space. Point cloud has become one of the most significant
data format for 3D representation. Its gaining increased popularity as a result of increased availability
of acquisition devices, such as LiDAR, as well as increased application in areas such as robotics,
autonomous driving, augmented and virtual reality. Deep learning is now the most powerful tool
for data processing in computer vision, becoming the most preferred technique for tasks such as
classification, segmentation, and detection. While deep learning techniques are mainly applied
to data with a structured grid, point cloud, on the other hand, is unstructured. The unstructuredness
of point clouds makes use of deep learning for its processing directly very challenging. Earlier
approaches overcome this challenge by preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid format
at the cost of increased computational cost or lost of depth information. Recently, however, many
state-of-the-arts deep learning techniques that directly operate on point cloud are being developed.
This paper contains a survey of the recent state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that mainly
focused on point cloud data. We first briefly discussed the major challenges faced when using deep
learning directly on point cloud, we also briefly discussed earlier approaches which overcome
the challenges by preprocessing the point cloud into a structured grid. We then give the review of
the various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches that directly process point cloud in its
unstructured form. We introduced the popular 3D point cloud benchmark datasets. And we also further
discussed the application of deep learning in popular 3D vision tasks including classification,
segmentation and detection.
