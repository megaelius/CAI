Security operation centers (SOCs) typically use a variety of tools to collect large volumes of host
logs for detection and forensic of intrusions. Our experience, supported by recent user studies
on SOC operators, indicates that operators spend ample time (e.g., hundreds of man-hours) on investigations
into logs seeking adversarial actions. Similarly, reconfiguration of tools to adapt detectors
for future similar attacks is commonplace upon gaining novel insights (e.g., through internal
investigation or shared indicators). This paper presents an automated malware pattern-extraction
and early detection tool, testing three machine learning approaches: TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse
document frequency), Fisher's LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and ET (extra trees/extremely
randomized trees) that can (1) analyze freshly discovered malware samples in sandboxes and generate
dynamic analysis reports (host logs); (2) automatically extract the sequence of events induced
by malware given a large volume of ambient (un-attacked) host logs, and the relatively few logs from
hosts that are infected with potentially polymorphic malware; (3) rank the most discriminating
features (unique patterns) of malware and from the learned behavior detect malicious activity;
and (4) allows operators to visualize the discriminating features and their correlations to facilitate
malware forensic efforts. To validate the accuracy and efficiency of our tool, we design three experiments
and test seven ransomware attacks (i.e., WannaCry, DBGer, Cerber, Defray, GandCrab, Locky, and
nRansom). The experimental results show that TF-IDF is the best of the three methods to identify
discriminating features, and ET is the most time-efficient and robust approach.
