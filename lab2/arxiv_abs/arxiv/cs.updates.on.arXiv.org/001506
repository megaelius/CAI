In this paper, we consider variations of the utility system considered by Vetta, in which users are
grouped together. Our aim is to establish how grouping and cooperation among users affect performance
bounds. We consider two types of grouping. The first type is from \cite{Zhang2014}, where each user
belongs to a group of users having social ties with it. For this type of utility system, each user's
strategy maximizes its social group utility function, giving rise to the notion of \emph{social-aware
Nash equilibrium}. We prove that this social utility system yields to the bounding results of Vetta
for non-cooperative system, thus establishing provable performance guarantees for the social-aware
Nash equilibrium. For the second type of grouping, the set of users is partitioned into $l$ disjoint
groups, where the users within a group cooperate to maximize their group utility function, giving
rise to the notion of \emph{group Nash equilibrium}. In this case, each group can be viewed as a new
user with vector-valued actions, and a 1/2 bound for the performance of group Nash equilibrium follows
from the result of Vetta. But as we show tighter bounds involving curvature can be established. By
defining the group curvature $c_{k_i}$ associated with group $i$ with $k_i$ users, we show that
if the social utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group Nash equilibrium
achieves at least $1/(1+\max_{1\leq i\leq l}c_{k_i})$ of the optimal social utility, which is
tighter than that for the case without grouping. As a special case, if each user has the same action
space, then we have that any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+c_{k^*})$ of the optimal
social utility, where $k^*$ is the least number of users among the $l$ groups. Finally, we present
an example of a utility system for database assisted spectrum access to illustrate our results.
