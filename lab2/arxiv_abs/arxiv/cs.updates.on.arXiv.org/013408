In this paper, we present a topology optimization (TO) framework to enable automated design of mechanical
components while ensuring the result can be manufactured using multi-axis machining. Although
TO improves the part's performance, the as-designed model is often geometrically too complex to
be machined and the as-manufactured model can significantly vary due to machining constraints
that are not accounted for during TO. In other words, many of the optimized design features cannot
be accessed by a machine tool without colliding with the part (or fixtures). The subsequent post-processing
to make the part machinable with the given setup requires trial-and-error without guarantees on
preserving the optimized performance. Our proposed approach is based on the well-established
accessibility analysis formulation using convolutions in configuration space that is extensively
used in spatial planning and robotics. We define an 'inaccessibility measure field' (IMF) over
the design domain to identify non-manufacturable features and quantify their contribution to
non-manufacturability. The IMF is used to penalize the sensitivity field of performance objectives
and constraints to prevent formation of inaccessible regions. Unlike existing discrete formulations,
our IMF provides a continuous spatial field that is desirable for TO convergence. Our approach applies
to arbitrary geometric complexity of the part, tools, and fixtures, and is highly parallelizable
on multi-core architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on benchmark and
realistic examples in 2D and 3D. We also show that it is possible to directly construct manufacturing
plans for the optimized designs based on the accessibility information.
