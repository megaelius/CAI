This article surveys blockchain-based approaches for several security services. These services
include authentication, confidentiality, privacy, and access control list (ACL), data and resource
provenance, and integrity assurance. All these services are critical for the current distributed
applications, especially due to the large amount of data being processed over the networks and the
use of cloud computing. Authentication ensures that the user is who he/she claims to be. Confidentiality
guarantees that data cannot be read by unauthorized users. Privacy provides the users the ability
to control who can access their data. Provenance allows an efficient tracking of the data and resources
along with their ownership and utilization over the network. Integrity helps in verifying that
the data has not been modified or altered. These services are currently managed by centralized controllers,
for example, a certificate authority. Therefore, the services are prone to attacks on the centralized
controller. On the other hand, blockchain is a secured and distributed ledger that can help resolve
many of the problems with centralization. The objectives of this paper are to give insights on the
use of security services for current applications, to highlight the state of the art techniques
that are currently used to provide these services, to describe their challenges, and to discuss
how the blockchain technology can resolve these challenges. Further, several blockchain-based
approaches providing such security services are compared thoroughly. Challenges associated
with using blockchain-based security services are also discussed to spur further research in this
area.
