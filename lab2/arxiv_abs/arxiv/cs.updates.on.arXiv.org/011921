Despite the high biometric performance, finger-vein recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation
attacks (aka., spoofing attacks). In this paper, we present a new and robust approach for detecting
presentation attacks on finger-vein biometric systems exploiting the 3D Shape (normal-map) and
material properties (diffuse-map) of the finger. Observing the normal-map and diffuse-map exhibiting
enhanced textural differences in comparison with the original finger-vein image, especially
in the presence of varying illumination intensity, we propose to employ textural feature-descriptors
on both of them independently. The features are subsequently used to compute a separating hyper-plane
using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for the features computed from normal-maps and
diffuse-maps independently. Given the scores from each classifier for normal-map and diffuse-map,
we propose sum-rule based score level fusion to make detection of such presentation attack more
robust. To this end, we construct a new database of finger-vein images acquired using a custom capture
device with three inbuilt illuminations and validate the applicability of the proposed approach.
The newly collected database consists of 936 images, which corresponds to 468 bona fide images and
468 artefact images. We establish the superiority of the proposed approach by benchmarking it with
classical textural feature-descriptor applied directly on finger-vein images. The proposed
approach outperforms the classical approaches by providing the Attack Presentation Classification
Error Rate (APCER) & Bona fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER) of 0% compared to
comparable traditional methods.
