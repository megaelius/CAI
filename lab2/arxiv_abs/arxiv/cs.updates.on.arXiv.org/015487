Consonant gemination in Italian affricates and fricatives was investigated, which completed
the overall study of gemination of Italian consonants. Results of the analysis of the other consonant
categories, i.e. stops, nasals, and liquids, had shown that closure duration for stops and consonant
duration for nasals and liquids, form the most salient acoustic cues to gemination. Frequency and
energy domain parameters were not significantly affected by gemination in a systematic way in all
consonant classes. Results on fricatives and affricates confirmed the above findings, i.e., that
the primary acoustic correlate of gemination is durational in nature, and corresponds to a lengthened
consonant duration for fricative geminates and a lengthened closure duration for affricate geminates.
An inverse correlation between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations was present for both
consonant categories, and also for both singleton and geminate word sets when considered separately.
This effect was reinforced for combined sets, confirming the hypothesis that a durational compensation
between different phonemes may serve to preserve rhythmical structures. Classification tests
of single against geminate consonants using the durational acoustic cues as classification parameters
confirmed their validity, and highlighted peculiarities of the two consonant classes. In particular,
a relatively poor classification performance was observed for affricates, which led to refining
the analysis by considering dental vs. non-dental affricates in two different sets. Results support
the hypothesis that dental affricates, in Italian, may not appear in intervocalic position as singletons
but only in their geminate form.
