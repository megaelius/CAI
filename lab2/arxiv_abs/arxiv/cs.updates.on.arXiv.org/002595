In this work, we aim at building a bridge from poor behavioral data to an effective, quick-response,
and robust behavior model for online identity theft detection. We concentrate on this issue in online
social networks (OSNs) where users usually have composite behavioral records, consisting of multi-dimensional
low-quality data, e.g., offline check-ins and online user generated content (UGC). As an insightful
result, we find that there is a complementary effect among different dimensions of records for modeling
users' behavioral patterns. To deeply exploit such a complementary effect, we propose a joint model
to capture both online and offline features of a user's composite behavior. We evaluate the proposed
joint model by comparing with some typical models on two real-world datasets: Foursquare and Yelp.
In the widely-used setting of theft simulation (simulating thefts via behavioral replacement),
the experimental results show that our model outperforms the existing ones, with the AUC values
$0.956$ in Foursquare and $0.947$ in Yelp, respectively. Particularly, the recall (True Positive
Rate) can reach up to $65.3\%$ in Foursquare and $72.2\%$ in Yelp with the corresponding disturbance
rate (False Positive Rate) below $1\%$. It is worth mentioning that these performances can be achieved
by examining only one composite behavior (visiting a place and posting a tip online simultaneously)
per authentication, which guarantees the low response latency of our method. This study would give
the cybersecurity community new insights into whether and how a real-time online identity authentication
can be improved via modeling users' composite behavioral patterns.
