A High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) is a network node that operates in the stratosphere at an
altitude around 20 km and is instrumental for providing communication services. Triggered by the
technological innovations in the areas of autonomous avionics, array antennas, solar panel efficiency
levels and the battery energy density, and fueled by the flourishing industry ecosystems, the HAPS
exerts itself as an indispensable component of the next generations of wireless networks. In this
article, we provide a vision and framework for the HAPS networks of the future supported by a comprehensive
and state-of-the-art literature survey. We highlight the undiscovered potential of HAPS systems,
and elaborate on their unique ability to serve metropolitan areas. The latest advancements and
promising technologies in the HAPS energy and payload systems are discussed. The integration of
the emerging Reconfigurable Smart Surface (RSS) technology in the communications payload of HAPS
systems for providing a costeffective deployment is proposed. A detailed overview of the radio
resource management in HAPS systems is presented along with synergistic physical layer techniques,
including Faster-Than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. Numerous aspects of handoff management in HAPS
systems are delineated. The notable contribution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in HAPS, including
machine learning in the design, topology management, handoff, and resource allocation aspects
are emphasized. The provided extensive overview of the literature is crucial for substantiating
our vision that that depicts the expected deployment opportunities and challenges in the next 10
years (next-generation networks), as well as in the subsequent 10 years (next-next-generation
networks).
