In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT),
including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research
and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).
ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger,
while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies
to construct Zero Knowledge Range Proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot in
2001; the one proposed in 2008 by Camenisch et al, and Bulletproofs, proposed in 2017. We also compare
these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since Bulletproofs is the most efficient construction,
we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only
more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement
that is not desirable in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain. In case
of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out
of thin air. Interestingly, Bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic Zero Knowledge Proofs
(ZKP), in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted
to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of Proof of Knowledge (PoK). Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more
powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs
protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced.
