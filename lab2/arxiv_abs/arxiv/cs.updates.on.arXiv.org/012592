3D object classification has been widely-applied into both academic and industrial scenarios.
However, most state-of-the-art algorithms are facing with a fixed 3D object classification task
set, which cannot well tackle the new coming data with incremental tasks as human ourselves. Meanwhile,
the performance of most state-of-the-art lifelong learning models can be deteriorated easily
on previously learned classification tasks, due to the existing of unordered, large-scale, and
irregular 3D geometry data. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Lifelong 3D Object
Classification (i.e., L3DOC) framewor, which can consecutively learn new 3D object classification
tasks via imitating 'human learning'. Specifically, the core idea of our proposed L3DOC model is
to factorize PointNet in a perspective of lifelong learning, while capturing and storing the shared
point-knowledge in a perspective of layer-wise tensor factorization architecture. To further
transfer the task-specific knowledge from previous tasks to the new coming classification task,
a memory attention mechanism is proposed to connect the current task with relevant previously tasks,
which can effectively prevent catastrophic forgetting via soft-transferring previous knowledge.
To our best knowledge, this is the first work about using lifelong learning to handle 3D object classification
task without model fine-tuning or retraining. Furthermore, our L3DOC model can also be extended
to other backbone network (e.g., PointNet++). To the end, comparisons on several point cloud datasets
validate that our L3DOC model can reduce averaged 1.68~3.36 times parameters for the overall model,
without sacrificing classification accuracy of each task.
