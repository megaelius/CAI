This paper investigates intelligent replacement policies for improving the hit-rate of gigascale
DRAM caches. Cache replacement policies are commonly used to improve the hit-rate of on-chip caches.
The most effective replacement policies often require the cache to track per-line reuse state to
inform their decision. A fundamental challenge on DRAM caches, however, is that stateful policies
would require significant bandwidth to maintain per-line DRAM cache state. As such, DRAM cache
replacement policies have primarily been stateless policies, such as always-install or probabilistic
bypass. Unfortunately, we find that stateless policies are often too coarse-grain and become ineffective
at the size and associativity of DRAM caches. Ideally, we want a replacement policy that can obtain
the hit-rate benefits of stateful replacement policies, but keep the bandwidth-efficiency of
stateless policies. In our study, we find that tracking per-line reuse state can enable an effective
replacement policy that can mitigate common thrashing patterns seen in gigascale caches. We propose
a stateful replacement/bypass policy called RRIP Age-On-Bypass (RRIP-AOB), that tracks reuse
state for high-reuse lines, protects such lines by bypassing other lines, and Ages the state On cache
Bypass. Unfortunately, such a stateful technique requires significant bandwidth to update state.
To this end, we propose Efficient Tracking of Reuse (ETR). ETR makes state tracking efficient by
accurately tracking the state of only one line from a region, and using the state of that line to guide
the replacement decisions for other lines in that region. ETR reduces the bandwidth for tracking
replacement state by 70%, and makes stateful policies practical for DRAM caches. Our evaluations
with a 2GB DRAM cache, show that our RRIP-AOB and ETR techniques provide 18% speedup while needing
less than 1KB of SRAM.
