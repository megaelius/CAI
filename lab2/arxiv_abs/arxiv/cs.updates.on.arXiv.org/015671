3D echocardiography is an increasingly popular tool for assessing cardiac remodelling in the right
ventricle (RV). It allows quantification of the cardiac chambers without any geometric assumptions,
which is the main weakness of 2D echocardiography. However, regional quantification of geometry
and function is limited by the lower spatial and temporal resolution and the scarcity of identifiable
anatomical landmarks. We developed a technique for regionally assessing the 3 relevant RV regions:
apical, inlet and outflow. The method's inputs are end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) segmented
3D surface models. The method first defines a partition of the ED endocardium using the geodesic
distances from each surface point to apex, tricuspid valve and pulmonary valve: the landmarks that
define the 3 regions. The ED surface mesh is then tetrahedralised, and the endocardial-defined
partition is interpolated in the blood cavity via the Laplace equation. For obtaining an ES partition,
the endocardial partition is transported from ED to ES using a commercial image-based tracking,
and then interpolated towards the endocardium, similarly to ED, for computing volumes and ejection
fraction (EF). We present a full assessment of the method's validity and reproducibility. First,
we assess reproducibility under segmentation variability, obtaining intra- and inter- observer
errors (4-10% and 10-23% resp.). Finally, we use a synthetic remodelling dataset to identify the
situations in which our method is able to correctly determine the region that has remodelled. This
dataset is generated by a novel mesh reconstruction method that deforms a reference mesh, locally
imposing a given strain, expressed in anatomical coordinates. We show that the parcellation method
is adequate for capturing local circumferential and global circumferential and longitudinal
RV remodelling.
