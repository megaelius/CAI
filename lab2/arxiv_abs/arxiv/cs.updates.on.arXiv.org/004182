Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) is an important non-convex optimization problem and is the state-of-the-art
formulation for SLAM in robotics. It also has applications like camera motion estimation, structure
from motion and 3D reconstruction in machine vision. Recent researches have shown the importance
of good initialization to bootstrap well-known iterative PGO solvers to converge to good solutions.
The state-of-the-art initialization methods, however, works in low noise or eventually moderate
noise problems, and they fail in challenging problems with high measurement noise. Consequently,
iterative methods may get entangled in local minima in high noise scenarios. In this paper we present
an initialization method which uses orientation measurements and then present a convergence analysis
of our iterative algorithm. We show how the algorithm converges to global optima in noise-free cases
and also obtain a bound for the difference between our result and the optimum solution in scenarios
with noisy measurements. We then present our second algorithm that uses both relative orientation
and position measurements to obtain a more accurate least squares approximation of the problem
that is again solved iteratively. In the convergence proof, a structural coefficient arises that
has important influence on the basin of convergence. Interestingly, simulation results show that
this coefficient also affects the performance of other solvers and so it can indicate the complexity
of the problem. Experimental results show the excellent performance of the proposed initialization
algorithm, specially in high noise scenarios.
