In the operation of networked control systems, where multiple processes share a resource-limited
and time-varying cost-sensitive network, communication delay is inevitable and primarily influenced
by, first, the control systems deploying intermittent sensor sampling to reduce the communication
cost by restricting non-urgent transmissions, and second, the network performing resource management
to minimize excessive traffic and eventually data loss. In a heterogeneous scenario, where control
systems may tolerate only specific levels of sensor-to-controller latency, delay sensitivities
need to be considered in the design of control and network policies to achieve the desired performance
guarantees. We propose a cross-layer optimal co-design of control, sampling and resource management
policies for an NCS consisting of multiple stochastic linear time-invariant systems which close
their sensor-to-controller loops over a shared network. Aligned with advanced communication
technology, we assume that the network offers a range of latency-varying transmission services
for given prices. Local samplers decide either to pay higher cost to access a low-latency channel,
or to delay sending a state sample at a reduced price. A resource manager residing in the network data-link
layer arbitrates channel access and re-allocates resources if link capacities are exceeded. The
performance of the local closed-loop systems is measured by a combination of linear-quadratic
Gaussian cost and a suitable communication cost, and the overall objective is to minimize a defined
social cost by all three policy makers. We derive optimal control, sampling and resource allocation
policies under different cross-layer awareness models, including constant and time-varying
parameters, and show that higher awareness generally leads to performance enhancement at the expense
of higher computational complexity.
