As an important technology in artificial intelligence Granular Computing (GrC) has emerged as
a new multi-disciplinary paradigm and received much attention in recent years. Information granules
forming an abstract and efficient characterization of large volumes of numeric data have been considered
as the fundamental constructs of GrC. By generating prototypes and partition matrix, fuzzy clustering
is a commonly encountered way of information granulation. Degranulation involves data reconstruction
completed on a basis of the granular representatives. Previous studies have shown that there is
a relationship between the reconstruction error and the performance of the granulation process.
Typically, the lower the degranulation error is, the better performance of granulation is. However,
the existing methods of degranulation usually cannot restore the original numeric data, which
is one of the important reasons behind the occurrence of the reconstruction error. To enhance the
quality of degranulation, in this study, we develop an augmented scheme through modifying the partition
matrix. By proposing the augmented scheme, we dwell on a novel collection of granulation-degranulation
mechanisms. In the constructed approach, the prototypes can be expressed as the product of the dataset
matrix and the partition matrix. Then, in the degranulation process, the reconstructed numeric
data can be decomposed into the product of the partition matrix and the matrix of prototypes. Both
the granulation and degranulation are regarded as generalized rotation between the data subspace
and the prototype subspace with the partition matrix and the fuzzification factor. By modifying
the partition matrix, the new partition matrix is constructed through a series of matrix operations.
We offer a thorough analysis of the developed scheme. The experimental results are in agreement
with the underlying conceptual framework
