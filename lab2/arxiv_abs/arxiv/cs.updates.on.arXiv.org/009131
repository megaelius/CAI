Scientific imaging techniques such as optical and electron microscopy and computed tomography
(CT) scanning are used to study the 3D structure of an object through 2D observations. These observations
are related to the original 3D object through orthogonal integral projections. For common 3D reconstruction
algorithms, computational efficiency requires the modeling of the 3D structures to take place
in Fourier space by applying the Fourier slice theorem. At present, it is unclear how to differentiate
through the projection operator, and hence current learning algorithms can not rely on gradient
based methods to optimize 3D structure models. In this paper we show how back-propagation through
the projection operator in Fourier space can be achieved. We demonstrate the validity of the approach
with experiments on 3D reconstruction of proteins. We further extend our approach to learning probabilistic
models of 3D objects. This allows us to predict regions of low sampling rates or estimate noise. A
higher sample efficiency can be reached by utilizing the learned uncertainties of the 3D structure
as an unsupervised estimate of the model fit. Finally, we demonstrate how the reconstruction algorithm
can be extended with an amortized inference scheme on unknown attributes such as object pose. Through
empirical studies we show that joint inference of the 3D structure and the object pose becomes more
difficult when the ground truth object contains more symmetries. Due to the presence of for instance
(approximate) rotational symmetries, the pose estimation can easily get stuck in local optima,
inhibiting a fine-grained high-quality estimate of the 3D structure.
