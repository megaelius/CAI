We argue that while this discourse on data ethics is of critical importance, it is missing one fundamental
point: If more and more efforts in business, government, science, and our daily lives are data-driven,
we should pay more attention to what exactly we are driven by. Therefore, we need more debate on what
fundamental properties constitute data. In the first section of the paper, we work from the fundamental
properties necessary for statistical computation to a definition of statistical data. We define
a statistical datum as the coming together of substantive and numerical properties and differentiate
between qualitative and quantitative data. Subsequently, we qualify our definition by arguing
that for data to be practically useful, it needs to be commensurable in a manner that reveals meaningful
differences that allow for the generation of relevant insights through statistical methodologies.
In the second section, we focus on what our conception of data can contribute to the discourse on data
ethics and beyond. First, we hold that the need for useful data to be commensurable rules out an understanding
of properties as fundamentally unique or equal. Second, we argue that practical concerns lead us
to increasingly standardize how we operationalize a substantive property; in other words, how
we formalize the relationship between the substantive and numerical properties of data. Thereby,
we also standardize the interpretation of a property. With our increasing reliance on data and data
technologies, these two characteristics of data affect our collective conception of reality.
Statistical data's exclusion of the fundamentally unique and equal influences our perspective
on the world, and the standardization of substantive properties can be viewed as profound ontological
practice, entrenching ever more pervasive interpretations of phenomena in our everyday lives.
