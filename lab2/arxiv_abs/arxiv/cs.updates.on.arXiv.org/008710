We develop a stochastic geometry framework to characterize the meta distributions of the downlink
signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR)/signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and data rate of a typical
{\color{black}outdoor} user in a coexisting sub-6GHz and millimeter wave (mm-wave) cellular
network. Macro base-stations (MBSs) transmit on sub-6GHz channels (which we term ``microwave''
channels), whereas small base-stations (SBSs) communicate with users on mm-wave channels. The
SBSs are connected to MBSs via a microwave ($\mu$wave) wireless backhaul. The $\mu$wave channels
are interference limited and mm-wave channels are noise limited; therefore, we have the meta-distribution
of SIR and SNR in $\mu$wave and mm-wave channels, respectively. To model the line-of-sight (LOS)
nature of mm-wave channels, we use Nakagami-m fading model. We first characterize the association
probabilities of a typical user to a $\mu$wave MBS, a LOS mm-wave SBS and a non-LOS (NLOS) mm-wave
SBS. Then, we characterize the conditional success probability (CSP) (or equivalently reliability)
and its b-th moment for a typical user (a) when it associates to a $\mu$wave MBS for {\em direct} transmission
and (b) when it associates to a mm-wave SBS for { dual-hop} transmission (backhaul and access transmission).
We then characterize the exact as well as approximate expressions for the meta distributions. Performance
metrics such as the mean and variance of the local delay (network jitter), mean of the CSP (coverage
probability), and variance of the CSP are studied. Closed-form expressions are presented for special
scenarios. The extensions of the developed framework to the $\mu$wave-only network or networks
where SBSs have mm-wave backhauls are discussed. Numerical results validate the analytical results.
Insights are extracted related to the reliability, coverage probability, and latency of the considered
network.
