The gradual patterns that model the complex co-variations of attributes of the form "The more/less
X, The more/less Y" play a crucial role in many real world applications where the amount of numerical
data to manage is important, this is the biological data. Recently, these types of patterns have
caught the attention of the data mining community, where several methods have been defined to automatically
extract and manage these patterns from different data models. However, these methods are often
faced the problem of managing the quantity of mined patterns, and in many practical applications,
the calculation of all these patterns can prove to be intractable for the user-defined frequency
threshold and the lack of focus leads to generating huge collections of patterns. Moreover another
problem with the traditional approaches is that the concept of gradualness is defined just as an
increase or a decrease. Indeed, a gradualness is considered as soon as the values of the attribute
on both objects are different. As a result, numerous quantities of patterns extracted by traditional
algorithms can be presented to the user although their gradualness is only a noise effect in the data.
To address this issue, this paper suggests to introduce the gradualness thresholds from which to
consider an increase or a decrease. In contrast to literature approaches, the proposed approach
takes into account the distribution of attribute values, as well as the user's preferences on the
gradualness threshold and makes it possible to extract gradual patterns on certain databases where
literature approaches fail due to too large search space. Moreover, results from an experimental
evaluation on real databases show that the proposed algorithm is scalable, efficient, and can eliminate
numerous patterns that do not verify specific gradualness requirements to show a small set of patterns
to the user.
