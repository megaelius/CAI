In 2010, P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu proposed the following three-phase dynamic problem, as a candidate
for proving polynomial lower bounds on the operational time of dynamic data structures: I: Preprocess
a collection of sets $\vec{S} = S_1, \ldots , S_k \subseteq [n]$, where $k=\operatorname{poly}(n)$.
II: A set $T\subseteq [n]$ is revealed, and the data structure updates its memory. III: An index $i
\in [k]$ is revealed, and the data structure must determine if $S_i\cap T=^? \emptyset$. P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu
conjectured that any data structure for the Multiphase problem must make $n^\epsilon$ cell-probes
in either Phase II or III, and showed that this would imply similar unconditional lower bounds on
many important dynamic data structure problems. Alas, there has been almost no progress on this
conjecture in the past decade since its introduction. We show an $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ cell-probe
lower bound on the Multiphase problem for data structures with general (adaptive) updates, and
queries with unbounded but "layered" adaptivity. This result captures all known set-intersection
data structures and significantly strengthens previous Multiphase lower bounds, which only captured
non-adaptive data structures. Our main technical result is a communication lower bound on a 4-party
variant of P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's Number-On-Forehead Multiphase game, using information complexity
techniques. We also show that a lower bound on P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's original NOF game would imply
a polynomial ($n^{1+\epsilon}$) lower bound on the number of wires of any constant-depth circuit
with arbitrary gates computing a random $\tilde{O}(n)\times n$ linear operator $x \mapsto Ax$,
a long-standing open problem in circuit complexity. This suggests that the NOF conjecture is much
stronger than its data structure counterpart.
