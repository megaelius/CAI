In this work, we study constrained submodular maximization problems and design algorithms that
improve the state-of-the-art in terms of query complexity and/or approximation guarantee. We
first present the \emph{adaptive decreasing threshold} algorithm, which achieves an approximation
ratio of $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$ by performing $O(\max \{\varepsilon^{-1},\log\log k \})$ queries
per element. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the fastest known \textbf{deterministic}
algorithm, and nearly achieves the optimal approximation ratio. We also study several other well-known
monotone submodular maximization problems. First, for the intersection of $p$-system and $d$
knapsack constraints, we propose the \emph{backtracking threshold} algorithm that obtains an
$(1/(p+\frac{7}{4}d+1)-\Theta(1))$-approximate solution by performing $O(\log n \cdot \log\log
n)$ queries per element, which improves the state-of-the-art in both time complexity and approximation
ratio. We next present an $(7/16-\varepsilon)$-approximate algorithm for a single knapsack constraint,
which requires $O(\max\{\varepsilon^{-1},\log\log n\})$ queries per element and two passes
in the streaming setting. Query complexity lower bounds of submodular maximization problems are
also studied in this paper. We first show a $o(n/\log n)$ lower bound for cardinality constraint
and monotone objective. Using a similar approach, we are able to present a complete characterization
of the query complexity of unconstrained submodular maximization. To establish the query complexity
lower bounds, we introduce a general relationship between randomized and deterministic complexity
of approximation algorithms. We envision that this characterization may be used in other problems
and may be interesting in its own right.
