As ethereum blockchain has become popular, the number of users and transactions has skyrocketed,
causing an explosive increase of its data size. As a result, ordinary clients using PCs or smartphones
cannot easily bootstrap as a full node, but rely on other full nodes such as the miners to run or verify
transactions. This may affect the security of ethereum, so light bootstrapping techniques such
as fast sync has been proposed to download only parts of full data, yet the space overhead is still
too high. One of the biggest space overhead that cannot easily be reduced is caused by saving the state
of all accounts in the block's state trie. Fortunately, we found that more than 90% of accounts are
inactive and old transactions are hard to be manipulated. Based on these observations, this paper
propose a novel optimization technique called ethanos that can reduce bootstrapping cost by sweeping
inactive accounts periodically and by not downloading old transactions. If an inactive account
becomes active, ethanos restore its state by running a restoration transaction. Also, ethanos
gives incentives for archive nodes to maintain the old transactions for possible re-verification.
We implemented ethanos by instrumenting the go-ethereum (geth) client and evaluated with the real
113 million transactions from 14 million accounts between 7M-th and 8M-th blocks in ethereum. Our
experimental result shows that ethanos can reduce the size of the account state by half, which, if
combined with removing old transactions, may reduce the storage size for bootstrapping to around
1GB. This would be reasonable enough for ordinary clients to bootstrap on their personal devices.
