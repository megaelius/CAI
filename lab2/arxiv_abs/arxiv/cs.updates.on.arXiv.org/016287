Ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) images is important
for accurate diagnosis of stroke in acute care units. However, it is challenged by low image contrast
and resolution of the perfusion parameter maps, in addition to the complex appearance of the lesion.
To deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework based on synthesized pseudo Diffusion-Weighted
Imaging (DWI) from perfusion parameter maps to obtain better image quality for more accurate segmentation.
Our framework consists of three components based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and is
trained end-to-end. First, a feature extractor is used to obtain both a low-level and high-level
compact representation of the raw spatiotemporal Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) images.
Second, a pseudo DWI generator takes as input the concatenation of CTP perfusion parameter maps
and our extracted features to obtain the synthesized pseudo DWI. To achieve better synthesis quality,
we propose a hybrid loss function that pays more attention to lesion regions and encourages high-level
contextual consistency. Finally, we segment the lesion region from the synthesized pseudo DWI,
where the segmentation network is based on switchable normalization and channel calibration for
better performance. Experimental results showed that our framework achieved the top performance
on ISLES 2018 challenge and: 1) our method using synthesized pseudo DWI outperformed methods segmenting
the lesion from perfusion parameter maps directly; 2) the feature extractor exploiting additional
spatiotemporal CTA images led to better synthesized pseudo DWI quality and higher segmentation
accuracy; and 3) the proposed loss functions and network structure improved the pseudo DWI synthesis
and lesion segmentation performance.
