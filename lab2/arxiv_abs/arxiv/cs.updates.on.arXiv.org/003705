From 1936-38, the Works Progress Administration interviewed thousands of former slaves about
their life experiences. While these interviews are crucial to understanding the "peculiar institution"
from the standpoint of the slave himself, issues relating to bias cloud analyses of these interviews.
The problem I investigate is the problem of candour in the WPA slave narratives: it is widely held
in the historical community that the strict racial caste system of the Deep South compelled black
ex-slaves to tell white interviewers what they thought they wanted to hear, suggesting that there
was a significant difference candour depending on whether their interviewer was white or black.
In this work, I attempt to quantitatively characterise this race-related problem of candour. Prior
work has either been of an impressionistic, qualitative nature, or utilised exceedingly simple
quantitative methodology. In contrast, I use more sophisticated statistical methods: in particular
word frequency and sentiment analysis and comparative topic modelling with LDA to try and identify
differences in the content and sentiment expressed by ex-slaves in front of white interviewers
versus black interviewers. While my sentiment analysis methodology was ultimately unsuccessful
due to the complexity of the task, my word frequency analysis and comparative topic modelling methods
both showed strong evidence that the content expressed in front of white interviewers was different
from that of black interviewers. In particular, I found that the ex-slaves spoke much more about
unfavourable aspects of slavery like whipping and slave patrollers in front of interviewers of
their own race. I hope that my more-sophisticated statistical methodology helps improve the robustness
of the argument for the existence of this problem of candour in the slave narratives, which some would
seek to deny for revisionist purposes.
