The unit commitment (UC) problem is a nonlinear, high-dimensional, highly constrained, mixed-integer
power system optimization problem and is generally solved in the literature considering minimizing
the system operation cost as the only objective. However, due to increasing environmental concerns,
the recent attention has shifted to incorporating emission in the problem formulation. In this
paper, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is proposed
to solve the UC problem as a multi-objective optimization problem considering minimizing cost
and emission as the multiple objec- tives. Since, UC problem is a mixed-integer optimization problem
consisting of binary UC variables and continuous power dispatch variables, a novel hybridization
strategy is proposed within the framework of MOEA/D such that genetic algorithm (GA) evolves the
binary variables while differential evolution (DE) evolves the continuous variables. Further,
a novel non-uniform weight vector distribution strategy is proposed and a parallel island model
based on combination of MOEA/D with uniform and non-uniform weight vector distribution strategy
is implemented to enhance the performance of the presented algorithm. Extensive case studies are
presented on different test systems and the effectiveness of the proposed hybridization strategy,
the non-uniform weight vector distribution strategy and parallel island model is verified through
stringent simulated results. Further, exhaustive benchmarking against the algorithms proposed
in the literature is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in obtaining
significantly better converged and uniformly distributed trade-off solutions.
