Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed and optimized by use of objective measures of image
quality (IQ). The Ideal Observer (IO) performance has been advocated to provide a figure-of-merit
for use in assessing and optimizing imaging systems because the IO sets an upper performance limit
among all observers. When joint signal detection and localization tasks are considered, the IO
that employs a modified generalized likelihood ratio test maximizes observer performance as characterized
by the localization receiver operating characteristic (LROC) curve. Computations of likelihood
ratios are analytically intractable in the majority of cases. Therefore, sampling-based methods
that employ Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have been developed to approximate the
likelihood ratios. However, the applications of MCMC methods have been limited to relatively simple
object models. Supervised learning-based methods that employ convolutional neural networks
have been recently developed to approximate the IO for binary signal detection tasks. In this paper,
the ability of supervised learning-based methods to approximate the IO for joint signal detection
and localization tasks is explored. Both background-known-exactly and background-known-statistically
signal detection and localization tasks are considered. The considered object models include
a lumpy object model and a clustered lumpy model, and the considered measurement noise models include
Laplacian noise, Gaussian noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. The LROC curves produced by
the supervised learning-based method are compared to those produced by the MCMC approach or analytical
computation when feasible. The potential utility of the proposed method for computing objective
measures of IQ for optimizing imaging system performance is explored.
