A variety of methods based on sequence similarity, reconciliation, synteny or functional characteristics,
can be used to infer homology relations, that is, orthology, paralogy and xenology relations between
genes of a given gene family $\mathbb{G}$. The (inferred) homology relations might not cover each
pair of genes and thus, provide only partial knowledge on the full set of homology relations. Moreover,
for particular pairs of genes it might be known with a high degree of certainty that they are not orthologs
(resp.\ paralogs, xenologs) which yields forbidden pairs of genes. The question arises as whether
such sets of (partial) homology relations with or without forbidden gene pairs are satisfiable,
i.e., can they simultaneously co-exist in an evolutionary history for $\mathbb{G}$. In this contribution,
we characterize satisfiable homology relations. To this end, we employ the graph structure provided
by these relations. In particular, the latter allows us to characterize full satisfiable homology
relations as so-called di-cographs. Let $m$ denote the total number of known and forbidden gene
pairs. We provide a simple $\mathcal{O}(|\mathbb{G}|^2 + m|\mathbb{G}|)$-time algorithm to
determine whether such homology relations are satisfiable and, in the positive case, to construct
event-labeled gene trees containing speciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
events that can explain the relations. The provided algorithm is evaluated on large-scaled simulated
data sets. As we shall see, a comparably small amount of information about the original homologous
relationships between the gene pairs is necessary to reconstruct most of the original relations.
The algorithm and datasets are freely-available.
