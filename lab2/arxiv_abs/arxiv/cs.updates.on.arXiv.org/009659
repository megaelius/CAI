Ubiquitous sensors and smart devices from factories and communities guarantee massive amounts
of data and ever-increasing computing power is driving the core of computation and services from
the cloud to the edge of the network. As an important enabler broadly changing people's lives, from
face recognition to ambitious smart factories and cities, artificial intelligence (especially
deep learning) applications and services have experienced a thriving development process. However,
due to efficiency and latency issues, the current cloud computing service architecture hinders
the vision of "providing artificial intelligence for every person and every organization at everywhere".
Thus, recently, a better solution is unleashing deep learning services from the cloud to the edge
near to data sources. Therefore, edge intelligence, aiming to facilitate the deployment of deep
learning services by edge computing, has received great attention. In addition, deep learning,
as the main representative of artificial intelligence, can be integrated into edge computing frameworks
to build intelligent edge for dynamic, adaptive edge maintenance and management. With regard to
mutually benefited edge intelligence and intelligent edge, this paper introduces and discusses:
1) the application scenarios of both; 2) the practical implementation methods and enabling technologies,
namely deep learning training and inference in the customized edge computing framework; 3) existing
challenges and future trends of more pervasive and fine-grained intelligence. We believe that
this survey can help readers to garner information scattered across the communication, networking,
and deep learning, understand the connections between enabling technologies, and promotes further
discussions on the fusion of edge intelligence and intelligent edge.
