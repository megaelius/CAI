Undetectable wireless transmissions are fundamental to avoid eavesdroppers. To address this
issue, wireless steganography hides covert information inside primary information by slightly
modifying the transmitted waveform such that primary information will still be decodable, while
covert information will be seen as noise by agnostic receivers. Since the addition of covert information
inevitably decreases the SNR of the primary transmission, key challenges in wireless steganography
are: i) to assess the impact of the covert channel on the primary channel as a function of different
channel conditions; and ii) to make sure that the covert channel is undetectable. Existing approaches
are protocol-specific, also we notice that existing wireless technologies rely on phase-keying
modulations that in most cases do not use the channel up to its Shannon capacity. Therefore, the residual
capacity can be leveraged to implement a wireless system based on a pseudo-noise asymmetric shift
keying (PN-ASK) modulation, where covert symbols are mapped by shifting the amplitude of primary
symbols. This way, covert information will be undetectable, since a receiver expecting phase-modulated
symbols will see their shift in amplitude as an effect of channel/path loss degradation. We first
investigate the SER of PN-ASK as a function of the channel; then, we find the optimal PN-ASK parameters
that optimize primary and covert throughput under different channel condition. We evaluate the
throughput performance and undetectability of PN-ASK through extensive simulations and on an
experimental testbed based on USRP N210 software-defined radios. We show that PN-ASK improves
the throughput by more than 8x with respect to prior art. Finally, we demonstrate through experiments
that PN-ASK is able to transmit covert data on top of IEEE 802.11g frames, which are correctly decoded
by an off-the-shelf laptop WiFi.
