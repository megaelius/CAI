Space Time Block Codes (STBCs) from orthogonal designs have attracted significant interest in
recent years. However, with the growing demand for higher capacity schemes, the multiantenna transmission
techniques must support and achieve higher symbol transmission rates. In this article, we focus
on three and four transmit antenna schemes. For over two decades, STBC schemes for three and four
transmit antennas that achieve a very high symbol transmission rate while being orthogonal, fully
diverse, delay-efficient, and with very low decoding complexity have not been achieved. The schemes
proposed so far trades off orthogonality, delay, diversity, or decoding complexity while achieving
rate or vice-versa. This work is first of its kind to solve this problem while fulfilling all the desired
properties. In this work, we carefully study the various aspects that must be considered in designing
higher symbol transmission rate STBCs. The proposed designs, hereby referred to as, Jagannath
schemes - for 4 x 3 and 4 x 4 configurations are orthogonal, achieve full diversity, and support a symbol
transmission rate of 2 symbols/s/Hz. The design methodology follows a coding gain maximization
approach. The low decoding complexity procedure to decode the proposed transmission schemes are
proposed as well as extensively evaluated in simulations under diverse settings. The performance
of proposed schemes are empirically compared to two state-of-the-art schemes; ACIOD and Jafarkhani.
Jagannath 4 x 3 was shown to outperform ACIOD by ~12 dB while Jagannath 4 x 4 exhibited a ~7 dB superior
performance in contrast to Jafarkhani at 4 bpcu. This motivates the adoption of Jagannath schemes
in tactical and commercial communication systems to effectively double the throughput or to extend
