We consider concurrent games played by two-players on a finite-state graph, where in every round
the players simultaneously choose a move, and the current state along with the joint moves determine
the successor state. We study a fundamental objective, namely, mean-payoff objective, where a
reward is associated to each transition, and the goal of player 1 is to maximize the long-run average
of the rewards, and the objective of player 2 is strictly the opposite. The path constraint for player
1 could be qualitative, i.e., the mean-payoff is the maximal reward, or arbitrarily close to it;
or quantitative, i.e., a given threshold between the minimal and maximal reward. We consider the
computation of the almost-sure (resp. positive) winning sets, where player 1 can ensure that the
path constraint is satisfied with probability 1 (resp. positive probability). Our main results
for qualitative path constraints are as follows: (1) we establish qualitative determinacy results
that show that for every state either player 1 has a strategy to ensure almost-sure (resp. positive)
winning against all player-2 strategies, or player 2 has a spoiling strategy to falsify almost-sure
(resp. positive) winning against all player-1 strategies; (2) we present optimal strategy complexity
results that precisely characterize the classes of strategies required for almost-sure and positive
winning for both players; and (3) we present quadratic time algorithms to compute the almost-sure
and the positive winning sets, matching the best known bound of algorithms for much simpler problems
(such as reachability objectives). For quantitative constraints we show that a polynomial time
solution for the almost-sure or the positive winning set would imply a solution to a long-standing
open problem (the value problem for turn-based deterministic mean-payoff games) that is not known
to be solvable in polynomial time.
