The web serving protocol stack is constantly changing and evolving to tackle technological shifts
in networking infrastructure and website complexity. As a result of this evolution, the web serving
stack includes a plethora of protocols and configuration parameters that enable the web serving
stack to address a variety of realistic network conditions. Yet, today, most content providers
have adopted a "one-size-fits-all" approach to configuring the networking stack of their user
facing web servers (or at best employ moderate tuning), despite the significant diversity in end-user
networks and devices. In this paper, we revisit this problem and ask a more fundamental question:
Are there benefits to tuning the network stack? If so, what system design choices and algorithmic
ensembles are required to enable modern content provider to dynamically and flexibly tune their
protocol stacks. We demonstrate through substantial empirical evidence that this "one-size-fits-all"
approach results in sub-optimal performance and argue for a novel framework that extends existing
CDN architectures to provide programmatic control over the configuration options of the CDN serving
stack. We designed ConfigTron a data-driven framework that leverages data from all connections
to identify their network characteristics and learn the optimal configuration parameters to improve
end-user performance. ConfigTron uses contextual multi-arm bandit-based learning algorithm
to find optimal configurations in minimal time, enabling a content providers to systematically
explore heterogeneous configurations while improving end-user page load time by as much as 19%
(upto 750ms) on median.
