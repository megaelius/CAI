In the Euclidean $k$-center problem in sliding window model, input points are given in a data stream
and the goal is to find the $k$ smallest congruent balls whose union covers the $N$ most recent points
of the stream. In this model, input points are allowed to be examined only once and the amount of space
that can be used to store relative information is limited. Cohen-Addad et al.~\cite{cohen-2016}
gave a $(6+\epsilon)$-approximation for the metric $k$-center problem using O($k/\epsilon \log
\alpha$) points, where $\alpha$ is the ratio of the largest and smallest distance and is assumed
to be known in advance. In this paper, we present a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
the Euclidean $1$-center problem using O($1/\epsilon \log \alpha$) points. We present an algorithm
for the Euclidean $k$-center problem that maintains a coreset of size $O(k)$. Our algorithm gives
a $(c+2\sqrt{3} + \epsilon)$-approximation for the Euclidean $k$-center problem using O($k/\epsilon
\log \alpha$) points by using any given $c$-approximation for the coreset where $c$ is a positive
real number. For example, by using the $2$-approximation~\cite{feder-greene-1988} of the coreset,
our algorithm gives a $(2+2\sqrt{3} + \epsilon)$-approximation ($\approx 5.465$) using $O(k\log
k)$ time. This is an improvement over the approximation factor of $(6+\epsilon)$ by Cohen-Addad
et al.~\cite{cohen-2016} with the same space complexity and smaller update time per point. Moreover
we remove the assumption that $\alpha$ is known in advance. Our idea can be adapted to the metric diameter
problem and the metric $k$-center problem to remove the assumption. For low dimensional Euclidean
space, we give an approximation algorithm that guarantees an even better approximation.
