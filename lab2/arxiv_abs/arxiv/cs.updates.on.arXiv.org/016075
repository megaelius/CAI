The current crisis, at the time of writing, has had a profound impact on the financial world, introducing
the need for creative approaches to revitalising the economy at the micro level as well as the macro
level. In this informal analysis and design proposal, we describe how infrastructure for digital
assets can serve as a useful monetary and fiscal policy tool and an enabler of existing tools in the
future, particularly during crises, while aligning the trajectory of financial technology innovation
toward a brighter future. We propose an approach to digital currency that would allow people without
banking relationships to transact electronically and privately, including both internet purchases
and point-of-sale purchases that are required to be cashless. We also propose an approach to digital
currency that would allow for more efficient and transparent clearing and settlement, implementation
of monetary and fiscal policy, and management of systemic risk. The digital currency could be implemented
as central bank digital currency (CBDC), or it could be issued by the government and collateralised
by public funds or Treasury assets. Our proposed architecture allows both manifestations and would
be operated by banks and other money services businesses, operating within a framework overseen
by government regulators. We argue that now is the time for action to undertake development of such
a system, not only because of the current crisis but also in anticipation of future crises resulting
from geopolitical risks, the continued globalisation of the digital economy, and the changing
value and risks that technology brings.
