This paper proposes a new procedure to construct test statistics for hypothesis testing by computer
vision and metrics learning. The application highlighted in this paper is applying computer vision
on Q-Q plot to construct a new test statistic for normality test. Traditionally, there are two families
of approaches for verifying the probability distribution of a random variable. Researchers either
subjectively assess the Q-Q plot or objectively use a mathematical formula, such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, to formally conduct a normality test. Graphical assessment by human beings is not rigorous
whereas normality test statistics may not be accurate enough when the uniformly most powerful test
does not exist. It may take tens of years for statistician to develop a new and more powerful test statistic.
The first step of the proposed method is to apply computer vision techniques, such as pre-trained
ResNet, to convert a Q-Q plot into a numerical vector. Next step is to apply metric learning to find
an appropriate distance function between a Q-Q plot and the centroid of all Q-Q plots under the null
hypothesis, which assumes the target variable is normally distributed. This distance metric is
the new test statistic for normality test. Our experimentation results show that the machine-learning-based
test statistics can outperform traditional normality tests in all cases, particularly when the
sample size is small. This study provides convincing evidence that the proposed method could objectively
create a powerful test statistic based on Q-Q plots and this method could be modified to construct
many more powerful test statistics for other applications in the future.
