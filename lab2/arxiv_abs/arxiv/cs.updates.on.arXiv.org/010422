Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on historical printings is a challenging task mainly due to
the complexity of the layout and the highly variant typography. Nevertheless, in the last few years
great progress has been made in the area of historical OCR, resulting in several powerful open-source
tools for preprocessing, layout recognition and segmentation, character recognition and post-processing.
The drawback of these tools often is their limited applicability by non-technical users like humanist
scholars and in particular the combined use of several tools in a workflow. In this paper we present
an open-source OCR software called OCR4all, which combines state-of-the-art OCR components and
continuous model training into a comprehensive workflow. A comfortable GUI allows error corrections
not only in the final output, but already in early stages to minimize error propagations. Further
on, extensive configuration capabilities are provided to set the degree of automation of the workflow
and to make adaptations to the carefully selected default parameters for specific printings, if
necessary. Experiments showed that users with minimal or no experience were able to capture the
text of even the earliest printed books with manageable effort and great quality, achieving excellent
character error rates (CERs) below 0.5%. The fully automated application on 19th century novels
showed that OCR4all can considerably outperform the commercial state-of-the-art tool ABBYY Finereader
on moderate layouts if suitably pretrained mixed OCR models are available. The architecture of
OCR4all allows the easy integration (or substitution) of newly developed tools for its main components
by standardized interfaces like PageXML, thus aiming at continual higher automation for historical
printings.
