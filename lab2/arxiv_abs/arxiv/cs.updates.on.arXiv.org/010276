We introduce the assortment auction optimization problem, defined as follows. A seller has a set
of substitute products with exogenously-given prices. Each buyer has a ranked list from which she
would like to purchase at most one product. The buyers report their lists to the seller, who then allocates
products to the buyers using a truthful mechanism, subject to constraints on how many products can
be allocated. The seller collects revenues equal to the prices of the products allocated, and would
like to design an auction to maximize total revenue, when the buyers' lists are drawn independently
from known distributions. If there is a single buyer, then our problem reduces to the assortment
optimization problem, which is solved for Markov Chain choice models. We extend this result and
compute the optimal assortment auction when each buyer's list distribution arises from its own
Markov chain. Moreover, we show that the optimal auction is structurally ``Myersonian'', in that
each buyer is assigned a virtual valuation based on her list and Markov chain, and then the mechanism
maximizes virtual surplus. Since Markov Chain choice models capture valuation distributions,
our optimal assortment auction generalizes the classical Myerson's auction. Markov chains also
capture the commonly used MNL choice model. We show that without the Markov chain assumption, the
optimal assortment auction may be structurally non-Myersonian. Finally, we apply the concept
of an assortment auction in online assortment problems. We show that any personalized assortment
policy is a special case of a truthful assortment auction, and that moreover, the optimal auction
provides a tighter relaxation for online policies than the commonly-used ``deterministic LP''.
Using this fact, we improve many online assortment policies, and derive the first approximation
guarantees that strictly exceed 1-1/e.
