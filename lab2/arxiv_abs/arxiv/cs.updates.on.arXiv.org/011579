Negative screening is one method to avoid interactions with inappropriate entities. For example,
financial institutions keep investment exclusion lists of inappropriate firms that have environmental,
social, and government (ESG) problems. They create their investment exclusion lists by gathering
information from various news sources to keep their portfolios profitable as well as green. International
organizations also maintain smart sanctions lists that are used to prohibit trade with entities
that are involved in illegal activities. In the present paper, we focus on the prediction of investment
exclusion lists in the finance domain. We construct a vast heterogeneous information network that
covers the necessary information surrounding each firm, which is assembled using seven professionally
curated datasets and two open datasets, which results in approximately 50 million nodes and 400
million edges in total. Exploiting these vast datasets and motivated by how professional investigators
and journalists undertake their daily investigations, we propose a model that can learn to predict
firms that are more likely to be added to an investment exclusion list in the near future. Our approach
is tested using the negative news investment exclusion list data of more than 35,000 firms worldwide
from January 2012 to May 2018. Comparing with the state-of-the-art methods with and without using
the network, we show that the predictive accuracy is substantially improved when using the vast
information stored in the heterogeneous information network. This work suggests new ways to consolidate
the diffuse information contained in big data to monitor dominant firms on a global scale for better
risk management and more socially responsible investment.
