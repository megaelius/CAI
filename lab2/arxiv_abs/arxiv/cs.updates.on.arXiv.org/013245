Many dynamical systems can be successfully analyzed by representing them as networks. Empirically
measured networks and dynamic processes that take place in these situations show heterogeneous,
non-Markovian, and intrinsically correlated topologies and dynamics. This makes their analysis
particularly challenging. Randomized reference models (RRMs) have emerged as a general and versatile
toolbox for studying such systems. Defined as random networks with given features constrained
to match those of an input (empirical) network, they may for example be used to identify important
features of empirical networks and their effects on dynamical processes unfolding in the network.
RRMs are typically implemented as procedures that reshuffle an empirical network, making them
very generally applicable. However, the effects of most shuffling procedures on network features
remain poorly understood, rendering their use non-trivial and susceptible to misinterpretation.
Here we propose a unified framework for classifying and understanding microcanonical RRMs (MRRMs)
that sample networks with uniform probability. Focusing on temporal networks, we survey applications
of MRRMs found in literature, and we use this framework to build a taxonomy of MRRMs that proposes
a canonical naming convention, classifies them, and deduces their effects on a range of important
network features. We furthermore show that certain classes of compatible MRRMs may be applied in
sequential composition to generate new MRRMs from the existing ones surveyed in this article. We
finally provide a tutorial showing how to apply a series of MRRMs to analyze how different network
features affect a dynamic process in an empirical temporal network.
