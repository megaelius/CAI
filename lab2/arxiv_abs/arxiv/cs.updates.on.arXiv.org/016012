Debate about fairness in machine learning has largely centered around competing definitions of
what fairness or nondiscrimination between groups requires. However, little attention has been
paid to what precisely a group is. Many recent approaches to "fairness" require one to specify a causal
model of the data generating process. These exercises make an implicit ontological assumption
that a racial or sex group is simply a collection of individuals who share a given trait. We show this
by exploring the formal assumption of modularity in causal models, which holds that the dependencies
captured by one causal pathway are invariant to interventions on any other pathways. Causal models
of sex propose two substantive claims: 1) There exists a feature, sex-on-its-own, that is an inherent
trait of an individual that causally brings about social phenomena external to it in the world; and
2) the relations between sex and its effects can be modified in whichever ways and the former feature
would still retain the meaning that sex has in our world. We argue that this ontological picture is
false. Many of the "effects" that sex purportedly "causes" are in fact constitutive features of
sex as a social status. They give the social meaning of sex features, meanings that are precisely
what make sex discrimination a distinctively morally problematic type of action. Correcting this
conceptual error has a number of implications for how models can be used to detect discrimination.
Formal diagrams of constitutive relations present an entirely different path toward reasoning
about discrimination. Whereas causal diagrams guide the construction of sophisticated modular
counterfactuals, constitutive diagrams identify a different kind of counterfactual as central
to an inquiry on discrimination: one that asks how the social meaning of a group would be changed if
its non-modular features were altered.
