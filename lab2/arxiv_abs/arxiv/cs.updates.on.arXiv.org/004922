We present CGO-AS, a generalized Ant System (AS) implemented in the framework of Cooperative Group
Optimization (CGO), to show the leveraged optimization with a mixed individual and social learning.
Ant colony is a simple yet efficient natural system for understanding the effects of primary intelligence
on optimization. However, existing AS algorithms are mostly focusing on their capability of using
social heuristic cues while ignoring their individual learning. CGO can integrate the advantages
of a cooperative group and a low-level algorithm portfolio design, and the agents of CGO can explore
both individual and social search. In CGO-AS, each ant (agent) is added with an individual memory,
and is implemented with a novel search strategy to use individual and social cues in a controlled
proportion. The presented CGO-AS is therefore especially useful in exposing the power of the mixed
individual and social learning for improving optimization. The optimization performance is tested
with instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The results prove that a cooperative ant
group using both individual and social learning obtains a better performance than the systems solely
using either individual or social learning. The best performance is achieved under the condition
when agents use individual memory as their primary information source, and simultaneously use
social memory as their searching guidance. In comparison with existing AS systems, CGO-AS retains
a faster learning speed toward those higher-quality solutions, especially in the later learning
cycles. The leverage in optimization by CGO-AS is highly possible due to its inherent feature of
adaptively maintaining the population diversity in the individual memory of agents, and of accelerating
the learning process with accumulated knowledge in the social memory.
