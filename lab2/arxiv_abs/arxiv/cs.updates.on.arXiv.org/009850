Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in medical image enhancement problems, such as super-resolution
or image synthesis. However, to date, little consideration has been given to uncertainty quantification
over the output image. Here we introduce methods to characterise different components of uncertainty
in such problems and demonstrate the ideas using diffusion MRI super-resolution. Specifically,
we propose to account for $intrinsic$ uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model and for
$parameter$ uncertainty through approximate Bayesian inference, and integrate the two to quantify
$predictive$ uncertainty over the output image. Moreover, we introduce a method to propagate the
predictive uncertainty on a multi-channelled image to derived scalar parameters, and separately
quantify the effects of intrinsic and parameter uncertainty therein. The methods are evaluated
for super-resolution of two different signal representations of diffusion MR images---DTIs and
Mean Apparent Propagator MRI---and their derived quantities such as MD and FA, on multiple datasets
of both healthy and pathological human brains. Results highlight three key benefits of uncertainty
modelling for improving the safety of DL-based image enhancement systems. Firstly, incorporating
uncertainty improves the predictive performance even when test data departs from training data.
Secondly, the predictive uncertainty highly correlates with errors, and is therefore capable
of detecting predictive "failures". Results demonstrate that such an uncertainty measure enables
subject-specific and voxel-wise risk assessment of the output images. Thirdly, we show that the
method for decomposing predictive uncertainty into its independent sources provides high-level
"explanations" for the performance by quantifying how much uncertainty arises from the inherent
difficulty of the task or the limited training examples.
