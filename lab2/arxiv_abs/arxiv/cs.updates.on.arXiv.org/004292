Natural and artificial self-propelled systems must manage environmental interactions during
movement. Such interactions, which we refer to as active collisions, are fundamentally different
from momentum-conserving interactions studied in classical physics, largely because the internal
driving of the locomotor can lead to persistent contact with heterogeneities. Here, we experimentally
and numerically study the effects of active collisions on a laterally-undulating sensory-deprived
robophysical model, whose dynamics are applicable to self-propelled systems across length scales
and environments. The robot moves via spatial undulation of body segments, with a nearly-linear
center-of-geometry trajectory. Interactions with a single rigid post scatter the robot, and these
deflections are proportional to the head-post contact duration. The distribution of scattering
angles is smooth and strongly-peaked directly behind the post. Interactions with a single row of
evenly-spaced posts (with inter-post spacing $d$) produce distributions reminiscent of far-field
diffraction patterns: as $d$ decreases, distinct secondary peaks emerge as large deflections
become more likely. Surprisingly, we find that the presence of multiple posts does not change the
nature of individual collisions; instead, multi-modal scattering patterns arise from multiple
posts altering the likelihood of individual collisions to occur. As $d$ decreases, collisions
near the leading edges of the posts become more probable, and we find that these interactions are
associated with larger deflections. Our results, which highlight the surprising dynamics that
can occur during active collisions of self-propelled systems, can inform control principles for
locomotors in complex terrain and facilitate design of task-capable active matter.
