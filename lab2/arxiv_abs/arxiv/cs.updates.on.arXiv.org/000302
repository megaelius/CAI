Introduction: Before embarking on the design of any computer system it is first necessary to assess
the magnitude of the problem. In the case of a web search engine this assessment amounts to determining
the current size of the web, the growth rate of the web, and the quantity of computing resource necessary
to search it, and projecting the historical growth of this into the future. Method: The over 20 year
history of the web makes it possible to make short-term projections on future growth. The longer
history of hard disk drives (and smart phone memory card) makes it possible to make short-term hardware
projections. Analysis: Historical data on Internet uptake and hardware growth is extrapolated.
Results: It is predicted that within a decade the storage capacity of a single hard drive will exceed
the size of the index of the web at that time. Within another decade it will be possible to store the
entire searchable text on the same hard drive. Within another decade the entire searchable web (including
images) will also fit. Conclusion: This result raises questions about the future architecture
of search engines. Several new models are proposed. In one model the user's computer is an active
part of the distributed search architecture. They search a pre-loaded snapshot (back-file) of
the web on their local device which frees up the online data centre for searching just the difference
between the snapshot and the current time. Advantageously this also makes it possible to search
when the user is disconnected from the Internet. In another model all changes to all files are broadcast
to all users (forming a star-like network) and no data centre is needed.
