We propose a novel family of connectionist models based on kernel machines and consider the problem
of learning layer-by-layer a compositional hypothesis class, i.e., a feedforward, multilayer
architecture, in a supervised setting. In terms of the models, we present a principled method to
"kernelize" (partly or completely) any neural network (NN). With this method, we obtain a counterpart
of any given NN that is powered by kernel machines instead of neurons. In terms of learning, when learning
a feedforward deep architecture in a supervised setting, one needs to train all the components simultaneously
using backpropagation (BP) since there are no explicit targets for the hidden layers (Rumelhart86).
We consider without loss of generality the two-layer case and present a general framework that explicitly
characterizes a target for the hidden layer that is optimal for minimizing the objective function
of the network. This characterization then makes possible a purely greedy training scheme that
learns one layer at a time, starting from the input layer. We provide realizations of the abstract
framework under certain architectures and objective functions. Based on these realizations,
we present a layer-wise training algorithm for an l-layer feedforward network for classification,
where l>=2 can be arbitrary. This algorithm can be given an intuitive geometric interpretation
that makes the learning dynamics transparent. Empirical results are provided to complement our
theory. We show that the kernelized networks, trained layer-wise, compare favorably with classical
kernel machines as well as other connectionist models trained by BP. We also visualize the inner
workings of the greedy kernelized models to validate our claim on the transparency of the layer-wise
algorithm.
