Provenance is a critical ingredient for establishing trust of published scientific content. This
is true whether we are considering a data set, a computational workflow, a peer-reviewed publication
or a simple scientific claim with supportive evidence. Existing vocabularies such as DC Terms and
the W3C PROV-O are domain-independent and general-purpose and they allow and encourage for extensions
to cover more specific needs. We identify the specific need for identifying or distinguishing between
the various roles assumed by agents manipulating digital artifacts, such as author, contributor
and curator. We present the Provenance, Authoring and Versioning ontology (PAV): a lightweight
ontology for capturing just enough descriptions essential for tracking the provenance, authoring
and versioning of web resources. We argue that such descriptions are essential for digital scientific
content. PAV distinguishes between contributors, authors and curators of content and creators
of representations in addition to the provenance of originating resources that have been accessed,
transformed and consumed. We explore five projects (and communities) that have adopted PAV illustrating
their usage through concrete examples. Moreover, we present mappings that show how PAV extends
the PROV-O ontology to support broader interoperability. The authors strived to keep PAV lightweight
and compact by including only those terms that have demonstrated to be pragmatically useful in existing
applications, and by recommending terms from existing ontologies when plausible. We analyze and
compare PAV with related approaches, namely Provenance Vocabulary, DC Terms and BIBFRAME. We identify
similarities and analyze their differences with PAV, outlining strengths and weaknesses of our
proposed model. We specify SKOS mappings that align PAV with DC Terms.
