This paper presents a new regularization method to train a fully convolutional network for semantic
tissue segmentation in histopathological images. This method relies on the benefit of unsupervised
learning, in the form of image reconstruction, for network training. To this end, it puts forward
an idea of defining a new embedding that allows uniting the main supervised task of semantic segmentation
and an auxiliary unsupervised task of image reconstruction into a single one and proposes to learn
this united task by a single generative model. This embedding generates an output image by superimposing
an input image on its segmentation map. Then, the method learns to translate the input image to this
embedded output image using a conditional generative adversarial network, which is known as quite
effective for image-to-image translations. This proposal is different than the existing approach
that uses image reconstruction for the same regularization purpose. The existing approach considers
segmentation and image reconstruction as two separate tasks in a multi-task network, defines their
losses independently, and combines them in a joint loss function. However, the definition of such
a function requires externally determining right contributions of the supervised and unsupervised
losses that yield balanced learning between the segmentation and image reconstruction tasks.
The proposed approach provides an easier solution to this problem by uniting these two tasks into
a single one, which intrinsically combines their losses. We test our approach on three datasets
of histopathological images. Our experiments demonstrate that it leads to better segmentation
results in these datasets, compared to its counterparts.
