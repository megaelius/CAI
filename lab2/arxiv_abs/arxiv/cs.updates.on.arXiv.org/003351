With the development of incipient technologies, user devices becoming more exposed and ill-used
by foes. In upcoming decades, traditional security measures will not be sufficient enough to handle
this huge threat towards distributed hardware and software. Lack of standard network attack taxonomy
has become an indispensable dispute on developing a clear understanding about the attacks in order
to have an operative protection mechanism. Present attack categorization techniques protect
a specific group of threat which has either messed the entire taxonomy structure or ambiguous when
one network attacks get blended with few others attacks. Hence, this raises concerns about developing
a common and general purpose taxonomy. In this study, a sequential question-answer based model
of categorization is proposed. In this article, an intrusion detection framework and threat grouping
schema are proposed on the basis of four sequential questions (Who, Where, How and What). We have
used our method for classifying traditional network attacks in order to identify initiator, source,
attack style and seriousness of an attack. Another focus of the paper is to provide a preventive list
of actions for network administrator as a guideline to reduce overall attack consequence. Recommended
taxonomy is designed to detect common attacks rather than any particular type of attack which can
have a practical effect in real life attack classification. From the analysis of the classifications
obtained from few infamous attacks, it is obvious that the proposed system holds certain benefits
related to the prevailing taxonomies. Future research directions have also been well acknowledged.
