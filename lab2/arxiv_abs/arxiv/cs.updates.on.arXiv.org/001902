Within the past few decades we have witnessed digital revolution, which moved scholarly communication
to electronic media and also resulted in a substantial increase in its volume. Nowadays keeping
track with the latest scientific achievements poses a major challenge for the researchers. Scientific
information overload is a severe problem that slows down scholarly communication and knowledge
propagation across the academia. Modern research infrastructures facilitate studying scientific
literature by providing intelligent search tools, proposing similar and related documents, visualizing
citation and author networks, assessing the quality and impact of the articles, and so on. In order
to provide such high quality services the system requires the access not only to the text content
of stored documents, but also to their machine-readable metadata. Since in practice good quality
metadata is not always available, there is a strong demand for a reliable automatic method of extracting
machine-readable metadata directly from source documents. This research addresses these problems
by proposing an automatic, accurate and flexible algorithm for extracting wide range of metadata
directly from scientific articles in born-digital form. Extracted information includes basic
document metadata, structured full text and bibliography section. Designed as a universal solution,
proposed algorithm is able to handle a vast variety of publication layouts with high precision and
thus is well-suited for analyzing heterogeneous document collections. This was achieved by employing
supervised and unsupervised machine-learning algorithms trained on large, diverse datasets.
The evaluation we conducted showed good performance of proposed metadata extraction algorithm.
The comparison with other similar solutions also proved our algorithm performs better than competition
for most metadata types.
