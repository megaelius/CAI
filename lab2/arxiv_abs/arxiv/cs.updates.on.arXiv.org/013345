Patients whose transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is unplanned are prone to higher mortality
rates than those who were admitted directly to the ICU. Recent advances in machine learning to predict
patient deterioration have introduced the possibility of \emph{proactive transfer} from the
ward to the ICU. In this work, we study the problem of finding \emph{robust} patient transfer policies
which account for uncertainty in statistical estimates due to data limitations when optimizing
to improve overall patient care. We propose a Markov Decision Process model to capture the evolution
of patient health, where the states represent a measure of patient severity. Under fairly general
assumptions, we show that an optimal transfer policy has a threshold structure, i.e., that it transfers
all patients above a certain severity level to the ICU (subject to available capacity). As model
parameters are typically determined based on statistical estimations from real-world data, they
are inherently subject to misspecification and estimation errors. We account for this parameter
uncertainty by deriving a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case reward across all plausible
values of the model parameters. We show that the robust policy also has a threshold structure under
fairly general assumptions. Moreover, it is more aggressive in transferring patients than the
optimal nominal policy, which does not take into account parameter uncertainty. We present computational
experiments using a dataset of hospitalizations at 21 KNPC hospitals, and present empirical evidence
of the sensitivity of various hospital metrics (mortality, length-of-stay, average ICU occupancy)
to small changes in the parameters. Our work provides useful insights into the impact of parameter
uncertainty on deriving simple policies for proactive ICU transfer that have strong empirical
performance and theoretical guarantees.
