Microarray gene expression data-based tumor classification is an active and challenging issue.
In this paper, an integrated tumor classification framework is presented, which aims to exploit
information in existing available samples, and focuses on the small sample problem and unbalanced
classification problem. Firstly, an inverse space sparse representation based classification
(ISSRC) model is proposed by considering the characteristics of gene-based tumor data, such as
sparsity and a small number of training samples. A decision information factors (DIF)-based gene
selection method is constructed to enhance the representation ability of the ISSRC. It is worth
noting that the DIF is established from reducing clinical misdiagnosis rate and dimension of small
sample data. For further improving the representation ability and classification stability of
the ISSRC, feature learning is conducted on the selected gene subset. The feature learning method
is constructed by complementing the advantages of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and
deep learning. Without confusion, the ISSRC combined with gene selection and feature learning
is called the integrated ISSRC, whose stability, optimization and the corresponding convergence
are analyzed. Extensive experiments on six public microarray gene expression datasets show the
integrated ISSRC-based tumor classification framework is superior to classical and state-of-the-art
methods. There are significant improvements in classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity,
whether there is a tumor in the early diagnosis, what kind of tumor, or whether metastasis occurs
after tumor surgery.
