Consider an interference channel consisting of $K_T$ transmitters and $K_R$ receivers with AWGN
noise and complex channel gains, and with $N$ files in the system. The one-shot $\mathsf{DoF}$ for
this channel is the maximum number of receivers which can be served simultaneously with vanishing
probability of error as the $\mathsf{SNR}$ grows large, under a class of schemes known as \textit{one-shot}
schemes. Consider that there exists transmitter and receiver side caches which can store fractions
$\frac{M_T}{N}$ and $\frac{M_R}{N}$ of the library respectively. Recent work for this cache-aided
interference channel setup shows that, using a carefully designed prefetching(caching) phase,
and a one-shot coded delivery scheme combined with a proper choice of beamforming coefficients
at the transmitters, we can achieve a $\mathsf{DoF}$ of $t_T+t_R$, where $t_T=\frac{M_T K_T}{N}$
and $t_R=\frac{M_R K_R}{N},$ which was shown to be almost optimal. The existing scheme involves
splitting the file into $F$ subfiles (the parameter $F$ is called the \textit{subpacketization}),
where $F$ can be extremely large (in fact, with constant cache fractions, it becomes exponential
in $K_R$, for large $K_R$). In this work, our first contribution is a scheme which achieves the same
$\mathsf{DoF}$ of $t_T+t_R$ with a smaller subpacketization than prior schemes. Our second contribution
is a new coded caching scheme for the interference channel based on projective geometries over finite
fields which achieves a one-shot $\mathsf{DoF}$ of $\Theta(log_qK_R+K_T)$, with a subpacketization
$F=q^{O(K_T+(log_qK_R)^2)}$ (for some prime power $q$) that is \textit{subexponential} in $K_R$,
for small constant cache fraction at the receivers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
coded caching scheme with subpacketization subexponential in the number of receivers for this
setting.
