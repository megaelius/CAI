The biological function of a protein stems from its 3-dimensional structure, which is thermodynamically
determined by the energetics of interatomic forces between its amino acid building blocks (the
order of amino acids, known as the sequence, defines a protein). Given the costs (time, money, human
resources) of determining protein structures via experimental means such as X-ray crystallography,
can we better describe and compare protein 3D structures in a robust and efficient manner, so as to
gain meaningful biological insights? We begin by considering a relatively simple problem, limiting
ourselves to just protein secondary structural elements. Historically, many computational methods
have been devised to classify amino acid residues in a protein chain into one of several discrete
secondary structures, of which the most well-characterized are the geometrically regular $\alpha$-helix
and $\beta$-sheet; irregular structural patterns, such as 'turns' and 'loops', are less understood.
Here, we present a study of Deep Learning techniques to classify the loop-like end cap structures
which delimit $\alpha$-helices. Previous work used highly empirical and heuristic methods to
manually classify helix capping motifs. Instead, we use structural data directly--including
(i) backbone torsion angles computed from 3D structures, (ii) macromolecular feature sets (e.g.,
physicochemical properties), and (iii) helix cap classification data (from CAPS-DB)--as the
ground truth to train a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model to classify helix cap
residues. We tried different network architectures and scanned hyperparameters in order to train
and assess several models; we also trained a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to use as a baseline.
Ultimately, we achieved 85% class-balanced accuracy with a deep BiLSTM model.
