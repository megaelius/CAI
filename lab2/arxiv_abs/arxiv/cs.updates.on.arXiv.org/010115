Today's Internet Services are undergoing fundamental changes and shifting to an intelligent computing
era where AI is widely employed to augment services. In this context, many innovative AI algorithms,
systems, and architectures are proposed, and thus the importance of benchmarking and evaluating
them rises. However, modern Internet services adopt a microservice-based architecture and consist
of various modules. The diversity of these modules and complexity of execution paths, the massive
scale and complex hierarchy of datacenter infrastructure, the confidential issues of data sets
and workloads pose great challenges to benchmarking. In this paper, we present the first industry-standard
Internet service AI benchmark suite---AIBench with seventeen industry partners, including several
top Internet service providers. AIBench provides a highly extensible, configurable, and flexible
benchmark framework that contains loosely coupled modules. We identify sixteen prominent AI problem
domains like learning to rank, each of which forms an AI component benchmark, from three most important
Internet service domains: search engine, social network, and e-commerce, which is by far the most
comprehensive AI benchmarking effort. On the basis of the AIBench framework, abstracting the real-world
data sets and workloads from one of the top e-commerce providers, we design and implement the first
end-to-end Internet service AI benchmark, which contains the primary modules in the critical paths
of an industry scale application and is scalable to deploy on different cluster scales. The specifications,
source code, and performance numbers are publicly available from the benchmark council web site
