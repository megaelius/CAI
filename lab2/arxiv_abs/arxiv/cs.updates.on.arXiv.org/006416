In partial function extension, we are given a partial function consisting of $n$ points from a domain
and a function value at each point. Our objective is to determine if this partial function can be extended
to a function defined on the domain, that additionally satisfies a given property, such as convexity.
This basic problem underlies research questions in many areas, such as learning, property testing,
and game theory. We formally study the problem of extending partial functions to satisfy fundamental
properties in combinatorial optimization, focusing on upper and lower bounds for extension and
applications to learning and property testing. (1) For subadditive functions, we show the extension
problem is coNP-complete, and we give tight bounds on the approximability. We also give an improved
lower bound for learning subadditive functions, and give the first nontrivial testers for subadditive
and XOS functions. (2) For submodular functions, we show that if a partial function can be extended
to a submodular function on the lattice closure (the minimal set that contains the partial function
and is closed under union and intersection) of the partial function, it can be extended to a submodular
function on the entire domain. We obtain algorithms for determining extendibility in a number of
cases, including if $n$ is a constant, or the points are nearly the same size. The complexity of extendibility
is in general unresolved. (3) Lastly, for convex functions in $\mathbb{R}^m$, we show an interesting
juxtaposition: while we can determine the existence of an extension efficiently, computing the
value of a widely-studied convex extension at a given point is strongly NP-hard.
