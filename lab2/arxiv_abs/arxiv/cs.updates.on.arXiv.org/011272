Effective patient education is critical for managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), one of the
most common chronic diseases in the United States. While some studies focus on the information-seeking
behavior of T2DM patients, other self-education behaviors including information processing
and utilization are rarely explored in the context of T2DM. This study sought to assess two self-education
behaviors of type 2 diabetics, namely, information seeking and information processing, to understand
more about how these behaviors affect the self-management of this common chronic disease. Semi-structured
interviews were conducted with 8 English speaking T2DM patients and qualitative content analysis
techniques were performed to analyze their responses. The information seeking and processing
behaviors vary across individuals based on their prognosis of T2DM, information needs, and personal
preferences. Patients are often dissatisfied with information from official sources, have difficulty
evaluating the trustworthiness of information sources, and desire information that is more personally
relevant to them. Several participants identified a lack of personalized information as a key factor
in the inability to adhere to T2DM management guidelines, which led them to experience increased
glucose levels, difficulty managing A1C levels, frustration, and anxiety. They mentioned that
they followed trial and error based approaches to tailor information according to their needs and
physiological conditions. Many participants identified conflicting or inconsistent information
from different sources as a major barrier to information processing. The results of this study indicate
a need for authentic, consistent, and individualized information for type 2 diabetics.
