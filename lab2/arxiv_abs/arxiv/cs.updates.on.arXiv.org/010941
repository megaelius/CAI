Wireless devices resorting to event-triggered communications have been proved to suffer critical
privacy issues, due to the intrinsic leakage associated with radio frequency emissions. In this
paper, we move the attack frontier forward by proposing BrokenStrokes: an inexpensive, easy to
implement, efficient, and effective attack able to detect the typing of a predefined keyword by
only eavesdropping the communication channel used by the wireless keyboard. BrokenStrokes achieves
its goal when the eavesdropping antenna is up to 15 meters from the target keyboard. We prove the attack
succeeds regardless of the encryption scheme, the communication protocol, the presence of radio
noise, and the presence of physical obstacles. We tested BrokenStrokes in three real scenarios
(close to the keyboard--e.g., the eavesdropping device is concealed under the desk--, wall separation--
eavesdropping from next office--, and eavesdropping from the public street--into the house of
one of the co-authors), under the following conditions: presence of radio noise, testing arbitrary
long keystroke sequences, and varying several system parameters. Performance are striking: BrokenStrokes
detects the presence of a keyword among the user's keystrokes in 90% of cases when the eavesdropping
antenna is placed in the proximity of the keyboard (up to 20 cm), while it guarantees at least 73% success
rate when the eavesdropping antenna is up to 15 meters far away from the target. We discuss the rationale
for the attack, its logical flow, and we detail the experimental setting and the algorithmic machinery
adopted. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures and sketch some future research directions.
The data utilized in this paper have been released as open-source to allow practitioners, industries,
and academia to verify our claims and use them as a basis for further developments.
