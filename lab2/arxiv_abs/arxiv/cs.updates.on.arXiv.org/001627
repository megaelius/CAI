Let S be a set of n points and let w be a function that assigns non-negative weights to points in S. The
additive weighted distance d_w(p, q) between two points p,q belonging to S is defined as w(p) + d(p,
q) + w(q) if p \ne q and it is zero if p = q. Here, d(p, q) denotes the (geodesic) Euclidean distance between
p and q. A graph G(S, E) is called a t-spanner for the additive weighted set S of points if for any two
points p and q in S the distance between p and q in graph G is at most t.d_w(p, q) for a real number t > 1.
Here, d_w(p,q) is the additive weighted distance between p and q. For some integer k \geq 1, a t-spanner
G for the set S is a (k, t)-vertex fault-tolerant additive weighted spanner, denoted with (k, t)-VFTAWS,
if for any set S' \subset S with cardinality at most k, the graph G \ S' is a t-spanner for the points in
S \ S'. For any given real number \epsilon > 0, we obtain the following results: - When the points in
S belong to Euclidean space R^d, an algorithm to compute a (k,(2 + \epsilon))-VFTAWS with O(kn) edges
for the metric space (S, d_w). Here, for any two points p, q \in S, d(p, q) is the Euclidean distance
between p and q in R^d. - When the points in S belong to a simple polygon P, for the metric space (S, d_w),
one algorithm to compute a geodesic (k, (2 + \epsilon))-VFTAWS with O(\frac{k n}{\epsilon^{2}}\lg{n})
edges and another algorithm to compute a geodesic (k, (\sqrt{10} + \epsilon))-VFTAWS with O(kn(\lg{n})^2)
edges. Here, for any two points p, q \in S, d(p, q) is the geodesic Euclidean distance along the shortest
path between p and q in P. - When the points in $S$ lie on a terrain T, an algorithm to compute a geodesic
(k, (2 + \epsilon))-VFTAWS with O(\frac{k n}{\epsilon^{2}}\lg{n}) edges.
