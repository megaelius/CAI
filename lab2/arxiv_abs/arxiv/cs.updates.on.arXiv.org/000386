A mashup is a combination of information from more than one source, mixed up in a way to create something
new, or at least useful. Anyone can find mashups on the internet, but these are always specifically
designed for a predefined purpose. To change that fact, we implemented a new platform we called the
SMART platform. SMART enables the user to make his own choices as for the REST web services he needs
to call in order to build an intelligent personalized mashup, from a Google-like simple search interface,
without needing any programming skills. In order to achieve this goal, we defined an ontology that
can hold REST web services descriptions. These descriptions encapsulate mainly, the input type
needed for a service, its output type, and the kind of relation that ties the input to the output. Then,
by matching the user input query keywords, with the REST web services definitions in our ontology,
we can find registered services individuals in this ontology, and construct the raw REST query for
each service found. The wrap up from the keywords, into semantic definitions, in order to find the
matching service individual, then the wrap down from the semantic service description of the found
individual, to the raw REST call, and finally the wrap up of the result again into semantic individuals,
is done for two main purposes: the first to let the user use simple keywords in order to build complex
mashups, and the second to benefit from the ontology inference engine in a way, where services instances
can be tied together into an intelligent mashup, simply by making each service output individuals,
stand as the next service input.
