The success of deep learning for unstructured data analysis is well documented but little evidence
has emerged related to the structured, tabular datasets used in decision support. We address this
research gap by considering the potential of deep learning to support financial risk management.
In particular, we develop a deep learning model for predicting whether individual spread traders
are likely to secure profits from future trades. This embodies typical modeling challenges faced
in risk and behavior forecasting. Conventional machine learning requires data that is representative
of the feature-target relationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, and
revision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable, heterogeneous patterns
such as the behavior of traders is challenging. Deep learning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical
distributed representations of the raw data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior),
it uncovers generative features that determine the target (e.g., trader's profitability), avoids
manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g. dynamic market conditions).
The results of employing a deep network for operational risk forecasting confirm the feature learning
capability of deep learning, provide guidance on designing a suitable network architecture and
demonstrate the superiority of deep learning over powerful machine learning benchmarks. Empirical
results suggest that the financial institution which provided the data can increase annual profits
by 16% through implementing a deep learning based risk management policy. The findings demonstrate
the potential of applying deep learning methods for management science problems in finance, marketing,
and accounting.
