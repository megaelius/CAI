The development of crowdsourced query processing systems has recently attracted a significant
attention in the database community. A variety of crowdsourced queries have been investigated.
In this paper, we focus on the crowdsourced join query which aims to utilize humans to find all pairs
of matching objects from two collections. As a human-only solution is expensive, we adopt a hybrid
human-machine approach which first uses machines to generate a candidate set of matching pairs,
and then asks humans to label the pairs in the candidate set as either matching or non-matching. Given
the candidate pairs, existing approaches will publish all pairs for verification to a crowdsourcing
platform. However, they neglect the fact that the pairs satisfy transitive relations. As an example,
if $o_1$ matches with $o_2$, and $o_2$ matches with $o_3$, then we can deduce that $o_1$ matches with
$o_3$ without needing to crowdsource $(o_1, o_3)$. To this end, we study how to leverage transitive
relations for crowdsourced joins. We propose a hybrid transitive-relations and crowdsourcing
labeling framework which aims to crowdsource the minimum number of pairs to label all the candidate
pairs. We prove the optimal labeling order in an ideal setting and propose a heuristic labeling order
in practice. We devise a parallel labeling algorithm to efficiently crowdsource the pairs following
the order. We evaluate our approaches in both simulated environment and a real crowdsourcing platform.
Experimental results show that our approaches with transitive relations can save much more money
and time than existing methods, with a little loss in the result quality.
