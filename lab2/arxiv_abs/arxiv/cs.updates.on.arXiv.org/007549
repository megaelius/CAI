We consider the problem of morphing between contact representations of a plane graph. In an $\mathcal
F$-contact representation of a plane graph $G$, vertices are realized by internally disjoint elements
from a family $\mathcal F$ of connected geometric objects. Two such elements touch if and only if
their corresponding vertices are adjacent. These touchings also induce the same embedding as in
$G$. In a morph between two $\mathcal F$-contact representations we insist that at each time step
(continuously throughout the morph) we have an $\mathcal F$-contact representation. We focus
on the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is the family of triangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that are the lower-right
half of axis-parallel rectangles. Such RT-representations exist for every plane graph and right
triangles are one of the simplest families of shapes supporting this property. Thus, they provide
a natural case to study regarding morphs of contact representations of plane graphs. We study piecewise
linear morphs, where each step is a linear morph moving the endpoints of each triangle at constant
speed along straight-line trajectories. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that decides
whether there is a piecewise linear morph between two RT-representations of an $n$-vertex plane
triangulation, and, if so, computes a morph with $\mathcal O(n^2)$ linear morphs. As a direct consequence,
we obtain that for $4$-connected plane triangulations there is a morph between every pair of RT-representations
where the ``top-most'' triangle in both representations corresponds to the same vertex. This shows
that the realization space of such RT-representations of any $4$-connected plane triangulation
forms a connected set.
