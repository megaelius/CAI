Electroencephalography (EEG) signals reflect activities on certain brain areas. Effective classification
of time-varying EEG signals is still challenging. First, EEG signal processing and feature engineer-
ing are time-consuming and highly rely on expert knowledge. In addition, most existing studies
focus on domain-specific classifi- cation algorithms which may not be applicable to other domains.
Moreover, the EEG signal usually has a low signal-to-noise ratio and can be easily corrupted. In
this regard, we propose a generic EEG signal classification framework that accommodates a wide
range of applications to address the aforementioned issues. The proposed framework develops a
reinforced selective attention model to auto- matically choose the distinctive information among
the raw EEG signals. A convolutional mapping operation is employed to dy- namically transform the
selected information to an over-complete feature space, wherein implicit spatial dependency
of EEG samples distribution is able to be uncovered. We demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed
framework using three representative scenarios: intention recognition with motor imagery EEG,
person identification, and neurological diagnosis. Three widely used public datasets and a local
dataset are used for our evaluation. The experi- ments show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines and achieves the accuracy of more than 97% on all the datasets with low latency and good
resilience of handling complex EEG signals across various domains. These results confirm the suit-
ability of the proposed generic approach for a range of problems in the realm of Brain-Computer Interface
applications.
