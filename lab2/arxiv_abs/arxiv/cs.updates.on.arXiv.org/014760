Combination therapy has shown to improve therapeutic efficacy while reducing side effects. Importantly,
it has become an indispensable strategy to overcome resistance in antibiotics, anti-microbials,
and anti-cancer drugs. Facing enormous chemical space and unclear design principles for small-molecule
combinations, the computational drug-combination design has not seen generative models to meet
its potential to accelerate resistance-overcoming drug combination discovery. We have developed
the first deep generative model for drug combination design, by jointly embedding graph-structured
domain knowledge and iteratively training a reinforcement learning-based chemical graph-set
designer. First, we have developed Hierarchical Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (HVGAE) trained
end-to-end to jointly embed gene-gene, gene-disease, and disease-disease networks. Novel attentional
pooling is introduced here for learning disease-representations from associated genes' representations.
Second, targeting diseases in learned representations, we have recast the drug-combination design
problem as graph-set generation and developed a deep learning-based model with novel rewards.
Specifically, besides chemical validity rewards, we have introduced a novel generative adversarial
award, being generalized sliced Wasserstein, for chemically diverse molecules with distributions
similar to known drugs. We have also designed a network principle-based reward for drug combinations.
Numerical results indicate that, compared to graph embedding methods, HVGAE learns more informative
and generalizable disease representations. Case studies on four diseases show that network-principled
drug combinations tend to have low toxicity. The generated drug combinations collectively cover
the disease module similar to FDA-approved drug combinations and could potentially suggest novel
systems-pharmacology strategies.
