Inspired by the vertebrate branch of the animal kingdom, articulated soft robots are robotic systems
embedding elastic elements into a classic rigid (skeleton\--like) structure. Leveraging on their
bodies elasticity, soft robots promise to push their limits far beyond the barriers that affect
their rigid counterparts. However, existing control strategies aiming at achieving this goal
are either tailored on specific examples, or rely on model cancellations - thus defeating the purpose
of introducing elasticity in the first place. In a series of recent works, we proposed to implement
efficient oscillatory motions in robots subject to a potential field, aimed at solving these issues.
A main component of this theory are Eigenmanifolds, that we defined as nonlinear continuations
of the classic linear eigenspaces. When the soft robot is initialized on one of these manifolds,
it evolves autonomously while presenting regular - and thus practically useful - evolutions, called
normal modes. In addition to that, we proposed a control strategy making modal manifolds attractors
for the system, and acting on the total energy of the soft robot to move from a modal evolution to the
other. In this way, a large class of autonomous behaviors can be excited, which are direct expression
of the embodied intelligence of the soft robot. Despite the fact that the idea behind our work comes
from physical intuition and preliminary experimental validations, the formulation that we have
provided so far is however rather theoretical, and very much in need of an experimental validation.
The aim of this paper is to provide such an experimental validation using as testbed the articulated
soft leg. We will introduce a simplified control strategy, and we will test its effectiveness on
this system, to implement swing-like oscillations. We plan to extend this validation with a soft
quadruped.
