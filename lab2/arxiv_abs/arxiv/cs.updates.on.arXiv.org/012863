Growing radiologic workload and shortage of medical experts worldwide often lead to delayed or
even unreported examinations, which poses a risk for patient's safety in case of unrecognized findings
in chest radiographs (CXR). The aim was to evaluate, whether deep learning algorithms for an intelligent
worklist prioritization might optimize the radiology workflow and can reduce report turnaround
times (RTAT) for critical findings, instead of reporting according to the First-In-First-Out-Principle
(FIFO). Furthermore, we investigated the problem of false negative prediction in the context of
worklist prioritization. To assess the potential benefit of an intelligent worklist prioritization,
three different workflow simulations based on our analysis were run and RTAT were compared: FIFO
(non-prioritized), Prio1 (prioritized) and Prio2 (prioritized, with RTATmax.). Examination
triage was performed by "ChestXCheck", a convolutional neural network, classifying eight different
pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion,
infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass and foreign object. The average RTAT
for all critical findings was significantly reduced by both Prio simulations compared to the FIFO
simulation (e.g. pneumothorax: 32.1 min vs. 69.7 min; p < 0.0001), while the average RTAT for normal
examinations increased at the same time (69.5 min vs. 90.0 min; p < 0.0001). Both effects were slightly
lower at Prio2 than at Prio1, whereas the maximum RTAT at Prio1 was substantially higher for all classes,
due to individual examinations rated false negative.Our Prio2 simulation demonstrated that intelligent
worklist prioritization by deep learning algorithms reduces average RTAT for critical findings
in chest X-ray while maintaining a similar maximum RTAT as FIFO.
