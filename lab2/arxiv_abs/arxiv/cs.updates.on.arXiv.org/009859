Complex computational models are often designed to simulate real-world physical phenomena in
many scientific disciplines. However, these simulation models tend to be computationally very
expensive and involve a large number of simulation input parameters which need to be analyzed and
properly calibrated before the models can be applied for real scientific studies. We propose a visual
analysis system to facilitate interactive exploratory analysis of high-dimensional input parameter
space for a complex yeast cell polarization simulation. The proposed system can assist the computational
biologists, who designed the simulation model, to visually calibrate the input parameters by modifying
the parameter values and immediately visualizing the predicted simulation outcome without having
the need to run the original expensive simulation for every instance. Our proposed visual analysis
system is driven by a trained neural network-based surrogate model as the backend analysis framework.
Surrogate models are widely used in the field of simulation sciences to efficiently analyze computationally
expensive simulation models. In this work, we demonstrate the advantage of using neural networks
as surrogate models for visual analysis by incorporating some of the recent advances in the field
of uncertainty quantification, interpretability and explainability of neural network-based
models. We utilize the trained network to perform interactive parameter sensitivity analysis
of the original simulation at multiple levels-of-detail as well as recommend optimal parameter
configurations using the activation maximization framework of neural networks. We also facilitate
detail analysis of the trained network to extract useful insights about the simulation model, learned
by the network, during the training process.
