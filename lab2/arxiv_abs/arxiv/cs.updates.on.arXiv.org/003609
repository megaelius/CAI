Consider the following process on a network: Each agent initially holds either opinion blue or red;
then, in each round, each agent looks at two random neighbors and, if the two have the same opinion,
the agent adopts it. This process is known as the 2-Choices dynamics and is arguably the most basic
non-trivial opinion dynamics modeling voting behavior on social networks. Despite its apparent
simplicity, 2-Choices has been analytically characterized only on networks with a strong expansion
property -- under assumptions on the initial configuration that establish it as a fast majority
consensus protocol. In this work, we aim at contributing to the understanding of the 2-Choices dynamics
by considering its behavior on a class of networks with core-periphery structure, a well-known
topological assumption in social networks. In a nutshell, assume that a densely-connected subset
of agents, the core, holds a different opinion from the rest of the network, the periphery. Then,
depending on the strength of the cut between the core and the periphery, a phase-transition phenomenon
occurs: Either the core's opinion rapidly spreads among the rest of the network, or a metastability
phase takes place, in which both opinions coexist in the network for superpolynomial time. The interest
of our result is twofold. On the one hand, by looking at the 2-Choices dynamics as a simplistic model
of competition among opinions in social networks, our theorem sheds light on the influence of the
core on the rest of the network, as a function of the core's connectivity towards the latter. On the
other hand, to the best of our knowledge, we provide the first analytical result which shows a heterogeneous
behavior of a simple dynamics as a function of structural parameters of the network. Finally, we
validate our theoretical predictions with extensive experiments on real networks.
