Agile techniques recently have received attention in developing safety-critical systems. However,
a lack of empirical knowledge of performing safety assurance techniques in practice, especially
safety analysis into agile development processes prevents further steps. In this article, we aim
at investigating the feasibility and the effects of our S-Scrum development process, and stepwise
improving and proposing an Optimized S-Scrum development process for safety-critical systems
in a real environment. We conducted an exploratory case study in a one-year student project "Smart
Home" at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. We participated in the project and collected quantitative
and qualitative data from questionnaire, interviews, participant observation, physical artifacts,
and documentation review. Furthermore, we evaluated the Optimized S-Scrum in industry by conducting
interviews. The first-stage results showed that by integrating STPA (System-Theoretic Process
Analysis) can ensure the safety during each sprint and enhance the safety of delivered products,
while the agility of S-Scrum is slightly worse than the original Scrum. Six challenges have been
explored: Management changes the team's priorities during an iteration; Disturbed safety-related
communication; Non-functional requirements are determined too late; Insufficient upfront planning;
Insufficient well-defined completion criteria; Excessive time to perform upfront planning.
We investigated further the causalities and optimizations. The second-stage results revealed
that the safety and agility have been improved after the optimizations. We have gained a positive
assessment and suggestions from industry. The optimized S-Scrum is feasible for developing safety-critical
systems concerning the capability to ensure safety and the acceptable agility in a student project.
Further attempt is still needed in industrial projects.
