While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied to choice analysis showing high
predictive power, it is unclear to what extent researchers can interpret economic information
from DNNs. This paper demonstrates that DNNs can provide economic information as complete as classical
discrete choice models (DCMs). The economic information includes choice predictions, choice
probabilities, market shares, substitution patterns of alternatives, social welfare, probability
derivatives, elasticities, marginal rates of substitution (MRS), and heterogeneous values of
time (VOT). Unlike DCMs, DNNs can automatically learn the utility function and reveal behavioral
patterns that are not prespecified by domain experts. However, the economic information obtained
from DNNs can be unreliable because of the three challenges associated with the automatic learning
capacity: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, model non-identification, and local irregularity.
To demonstrate the strength and challenges of DNNs, we estimated the DNNs using a stated preference
survey, extracted the full list of economic information from the DNNs, and compared them with those
from the DCMs. We found that the economic information either aggregated over trainings or population
is more reliable than the disaggregate information of the individual observations or trainings,
and that even simple hyperparameter searching can significantly improve the reliability of the
economic information extracted from the DNNs. Future studies should investigate other regularizations
and DNN architectures, better optimization algorithms, and robust DNN training methods to address
DNNs' three challenges, to provide more reliable economic information from DNN-based choice models.
