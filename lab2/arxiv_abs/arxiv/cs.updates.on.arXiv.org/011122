This paper studies energy-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless communications,
where the UAV acts as a flying base station (BS) to serve the ground users (GUs) within some predetermined
latency constraints, e.g., requested timeout (RT). Our goal is to design the UAV trajectory to minimize
the total energy consumption while satisfying the RT requirement and energy budget, which is accomplished
via jointly optimizing the trajectory and UAV's velocities along subsequent hops. The corresponding
optimization problem is difficult to solve due to its non-convexity and combinatorial nature.
To overcome this difficulty, we solve the original problem via two consecutive steps. Firstly,
we propose two algorithms, namely heuristic search, and dynamic programming (DP) to obtain a feasible
set of trajectories without violating the GU's RT requirements based on the traveling salesman
problem with time window (TSPTW). Then, they are compared with exhaustive search and traveling
salesman problem (TSP) used as reference methods. While the exhaustive algorithm achieves the
best performance at a high computation cost, the heuristic algorithm exhibits poorer performance
with low complexity. As a result, the DP is proposed as a practical trade-off between the exhaustive
and heuristic algorithms. Specifically, the DP algorithm results in near-optimal performance
at a much lower complexity. Secondly, for given feasible trajectories, we propose an energy minimization
problem via a joint optimization of the UAV's velocities along subsequent hops. Finally, numerical
results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. ...
