Tactile Internet is an emerging concept that focuses on supporting high-fidelity, ultra-responsive,
and widely available human-to-machine interactions. To reduce the transmission latency and alleviate
Internet congestion, fog computing has been advocated as an important component of the Tactile
Internet. In this paper, we focus on energy-efficient design of fog computing networks that support
low-latency Tactile Internet applications. We investigate two performance metrics: Service
response time of end-users and power usage efficiency of fog nodes. We quantify the fundamental
tradeoff between these two metrics and then extend our analysis to fog computing networks involving
cooperation between fog nodes. We introduce a novel cooperative fog computing concept, referred
to as offload forwarding, in which a set of fog nodes with different computing and energy resources
can cooperate with each other. The objective of this cooperation is to balance the workload processed
by different fog nodes, further reduce the service response time, and improve the efficiency of
power usage. We develop a distributed optimization framework based on dual decomposition to achieve
the optimal tradeoff. Our framework does not require fog nodes to disclose their private information
nor conduct back-and-forth negotiations with each other. Two distributed optimization algorithms
are proposed. One is based on the subgradient method with dual decomposition and the other is based
on distributed ADMM-VS. We prove that both algorithms can achieve the optimal workload allocation
that minimizes the response time under the given power efficiency constraints of fog nodes.
