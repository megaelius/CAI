Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a method of achieving nano- and micro-scale connectivity
by utilizing the free diffusion mechanism of information molecules. The randomness in diffusive
propagation is the main cause of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the limiting factor of high
data rate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between the transmitter
and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being artificially placed or occurring naturally,
surfaces or volumes that resemble an apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass.
Contrary to intuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication performance,
given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the ones that take more directed paths
towards the receiver. Furthermore, through both computer simulations and a theoretical signal
evaluation metric named signal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found
that the size of the aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and the ISI combating
capability of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture size that minimizes the bit error rate
(BER). It is observed that the trend of BER is accurately mirrored by SINAR, suggesting the proposed
metric's applicability to optimization tasks in MCvD systems, including finding the optimal aperture
size of an apertured plane. In addition, computer simulations and SINAR show that said optimal aperture
size is affected by the location of the aperture and the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects
of radial and angular offsets in the placement of the apertured plane, and finds that a reduction
in BER is still in effect up to certain offset values. Overall, our results imply that apertured plane-like
surfaces may actually help communication efficiency, even though they reduce the received signal
power.
