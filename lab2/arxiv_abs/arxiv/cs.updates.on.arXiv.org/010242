This work introduces the network uncertainty quantification (NetUQ) method for performing uncertainty
propagation in systems composed of interconnected components. The method assumes the existence
of a collection of components, each of which is characterized by exogenous-input random variables,
endogenous-input random variables, output random variables, and a local uncertainty-propagation
operator that computes output random variables from input random variables. The method assembles
the full-system network by connecting components, which is achieved simply by associating endogenous-input
random variables for each component with output random variables from other components; no other
inter-component compatibility conditions are required. The network uncertainty-propagation
problem is: Compute output random variables for all components given all exogenous-input random
variables. To solve this problem, the method applies classical relaxation methods (i.e., Jacobi
and Gauss--Seidel iteration with Anderson acceleration), which require only black-box evaluations
of component uncertainty-propagation operators. Compared with other available methods, this
approach is applicable to any network topology, promotes component independence by enabling components
to employ tailored uncertainty-propagation operators, supports general functional representations
of random variables, and requires no offline preprocessing stage. Also, because the method propagates
functional representations of random variables throughout the network (and not, e.g., probability
density functions), the joint distribution of any set of random variables throughout the network
can be estimated a posteriori in a straightforward manner. We perform supporting convergence and
error analysis and execute numerical experiments that demonstrate the weak- and strong-scaling
performance of the method.
