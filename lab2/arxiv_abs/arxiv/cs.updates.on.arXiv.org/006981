Iris segmentation and localization in non-cooperative environment is challenging due to illumination
variations, long distances, moving subjects and limited user cooperation, etc. Traditional methods
often suffer from poor performance when confronted with iris images captured in these conditions.
Recent studies have shown that deep learning methods could achieve impressive performance on iris
segmentation task. In addition, as iris is defined as an annular region between pupil and sclera,
geometric constraints could be imposed to help locating the iris more accurately and improve the
segmentation results. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task learning framework, named as
IrisParseNet, to exploit the inherent correlations between pupil, iris and sclera to boost up the
performance of iris segmentation and localization in a unified model. In particular, IrisParseNet
firstly applies a Fully Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Attention Network to simultaneously estimate
pupil center, iris segmentation mask and iris inner/outer boundary. Then, an effective post-processing
method is adopted for iris inner/outer circle localization.To train and evaluate the proposed
method, we manually label three challenging iris datasets, namely CASIA-Iris-Distance, UBIRIS.v2,
and MICHE-I, which cover various types of noises. Extensive experiments are conducted on these
newly annotated datasets, and results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on various benchmarks. All the ground-truth annotations, annotation codes and evaluation protocols
are publicly available at https://github.com/xiamenwcy/IrisParseNet.
