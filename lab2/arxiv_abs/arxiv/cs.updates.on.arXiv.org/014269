Designing functional molecules and advanced materials requires complex interdependent design
choices: tuning continuous process parameters such as temperatures or flow rates, while simultaneously
selecting categorical variables like catalysts or solvents. To date, the development of data-driven
experiment planning strategies for autonomous experimentation has largely focused on continuous
process parameters despite the urge to devise efficient strategies for the selection of categorical
variables to substantially accelerate scientific discovery. We introduce Gryffin, as a general
purpose optimization framework for the autonomous selection of categorical variables driven
by expert knowledge. Gryffin augments Bayesian optimization with kernel density estimation using
smooth approximations to categorical distributions. Leveraging domain knowledge from physicochemical
descriptors to characterize categorical options, Gryffin can significantly accelerate the search
for promising molecules and materials. Gryffin can further highlight relevant correlations between
the provided descriptors to inspire physical insights and foster scientific intuition. In addition
to comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate the capabilities and performance of Gryffin on three
examples in materials science and chemistry: (i) the discovery of non-fullerene acceptors for
organic solar cells, (ii) the design of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites for light-harvesting,
and (iii) the identification of ligands and process parameters for Suzuki-Miyaura reactions.
Our observations suggest that Gryffin, in its simplest form without descriptors, constitutes
a competitive categorical optimizer compared to state-of-the-art approaches. However, when
leveraging domain knowledge provided via descriptors, Gryffin can optimize at considerable higher
rates and refine this domain knowledge to spark scientific understanding.
