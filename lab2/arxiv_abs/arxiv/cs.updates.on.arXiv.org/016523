Motivated by recent research on combinatorial markets with endowed valuations by (Babaioff et
al., EC 2018) and (Ezra et al., EC 2020), we introduce a notion of perturbation stability in Combinatorial
Auctions (CAs) and study the extend to which stability helps in social welfare maximization and
mechanism design. A CA is $\gamma\textit{-stable}$ if the optimal solution is resilient to inflation,
by a factor of $\gamma \geq 1$, of any bidder's valuation for any single item. On the positive side,
we show how to compute efficiently an optimal allocation for 2-stable subadditive valuations and
that a Walrasian equilibrium exists for 2-stable submodular valuations. Moreover, we show that
a Parallel 2nd Price Auction (P2A) followed by a demand query for each bidder is truthful for general
subadditive valuations and results in the optimal allocation for 2-stable submodular valuations.
To highlight the challenges behind optimization and mechanism design for stable CAs, we show that
a Walrasian equilibrium may not exist for $\gamma$-stable XOS valuations for any $\gamma$, that
a polynomial-time approximation scheme does not exist for $(2-\epsilon)$-stable submodular
valuations, and that any DSIC mechanism that computes the optimal allocation for stable CAs and
does not use demand queries must use exponentially many value queries. We conclude with analyzing
the Price of Anarchy of P2A and Parallel 1st Price Auctions (P1A) for CAs with stable submodular and
XOS valuations. Our results indicate that the quality of equilibria of simple non-truthful auctions
improves only for $\gamma$-stable instances with $\gamma \geq 3$.
