With the increasing availability of wearable devices, continuous monitoring of individuals'
physiological and behavioral patterns has become significantly more accessible. Access to these
continuous patterns about individuals' statuses offers an unprecedented opportunity for studying
complex diseases and health conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a widely common chronic
disease that its roots and progression patterns are not fully understood. Predicting the progression
of T2D can inform timely and more effective interventions to prevent or manage the disease. In this
study, we have used a dataset related to 63 patients with T2D that includes the data from two different
types of wearable devices worn by the patients: continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and
activity trackers (ActiGraphs). Using this dataset, we created a model for predicting the levels
of four major biomarkers related to T2D after a one-year period. We developed a wide and deep neural
network and used the data from the demographic information, lab tests, and wearable sensors to create
the model. The deep part of our method was developed based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure
to process the time-series dataset collected by the wearables. In predicting the patterns of the
four biomarkers, we have obtained a root mean square error of 1.67% for HBA1c, 6.22 mg/dl for HDL cholesterol,
10.46 mg/dl for LDL cholesterol, and 18.38 mg/dl for Triglyceride. Compared to existing models
for studying T2D, our model offers a more comprehensive tool for combining a large variety of factors
that contribute to the disease.
