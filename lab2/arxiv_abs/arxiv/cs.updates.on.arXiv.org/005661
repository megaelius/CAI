Let $P$ be a set of $n$ colored points in the plane. Introduced by Hart (1968), a consistent subset
of $P$, is a set $S\subseteq P$ such that for every point $p$ in $P\setminus S$, the closest point of
$p$ in $S$ has the same color as $p$. The consistent subset problem is to find a consistent subset of
$P$ with minimum cardinality. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for two-colored point
sets. Since the initial presentation of this problem, aside from the hardness results, there has
not been a significant progress from the algorithmic point of view. In this paper we present the following
algorithmic results: 1. The first subexponential-time algorithm for the consistent subset problem.
2. An $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm that finds a consistent subset of size two in two-colored point
sets (if such a subset exists). Towards our proof of this running time we present a deterministic
$O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for computing a variant of the compact Voronoi diagram; this improves
the previously claimed expected running time. 3. An $O(n\log^2 n)$-time algorithm that finds a
minimum consistent subset in two-colored point sets where one color class contains exactly one
point; this improves the previous best known $O(n^2)$ running time which is due to Wilfong (SoCG
1991). 4. An $O(n)$-time algorithm for the consistent subset problem on collinear points; this
improves the previous best known $O(n^2)$ running time. 5. A non-trivial $O(n^6)$-time dynamic
programming algorithm for the consistent subset problem on points arranged on two parallel lines.
To obtain these results, we combine tools from planar separators, additively-weighted Voronoi
diagrams with respect to convex distance functions, point location in farthest-point Voronoi
diagrams, range trees, paraboloid lifting, minimum covering of a circle with arcs, and several
geometric transformations.
