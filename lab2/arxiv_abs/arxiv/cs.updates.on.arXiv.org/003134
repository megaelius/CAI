Designing RNA sequences that fold into specific structures and perform desired biological functions
is an emerging field in bioengineering with broad applications from intracellular chemical catalysis
to cancer therapy via selective gene silencing. Effective RNA design requires first solving the
inverse folding problem: given a target structure, propose a sequence that folds into that structure.
Although significant progress has been made in developing computational algorithms for this purpose,
current approaches are ineffective at designing sequences for complex targets, limiting their
utility in real-world applications. However, an alternative that has shown significantly higher
performance are human players of the online RNA design game EteRNA. Through many rounds of gameplay,
these players have developed a collective library of "human" rules and strategies for RNA design
that have proven to be more effective than current computational approaches, especially for complex
targets. Here, we present an RNA design agent, SentRNA, which consists of a fully-connected neural
network trained using the $eternasolves$ dataset, a set of $1.8 x 10^4$ player-submitted sequences
across 724 unique targets. The agent first predicts an initial sequence for a target using the trained
network, and then refines that solution if necessary using a short adaptive walk utilizing a canon
of standard design moves. Through this approach, we observe SentRNA can learn and apply human-like
design strategies to solve several complex targets previously unsolvable by any computational
approach. We thus demonstrate that incorporating a prior of human design strategies into a computational
agent can significantly boost its performance, and suggests a new paradigm for machine-based RNA
design.
