Nowadays, computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) systems have made a big leap in extracting the characteristics
of spermatozoa for studies or measuring human fertility. The first step in sperm characteristics
analysis is sperm detection in the frames of the video sample. In this article, we used RetinaNet,
a deep fully convolutional neural network as the object detector. Sperms are small objects with
few attributes, that makes the detection more difficult in high-density samples and especially
when there are other particles in semen, which could be like sperm heads. One of the main attributes
of sperms is their movement, but this attribute cannot be extracted when only one frame would be fed
to the network. To improve the performance of the sperm detection network, we concatenated some
consecutive frames to use as the input of the network. With this method, the motility attribute has
also been extracted, and then with the help of the deep convolutional network, we have achieved high
accuracy in sperm detection. The second step is tracking the sperms, for extracting the motility
parameters that are essential for indicating fertility and other studies on sperms. In the tracking
phase, we modify the CSR-DCF algorithm. This method also has shown excellent results in sperm tracking
even in high-density sperm samples, occlusions, sperm colliding, and when sperms exit from a frame
and re-enter in the next frames. The average precision of the detection phase is 99.1%, and the F1
score of the tracking method evaluation is 96.61%. These results can be a great help in studies investigating
sperm behavior and analyzing fertility possibility.
