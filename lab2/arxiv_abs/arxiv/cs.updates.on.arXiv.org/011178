In computer chip manufacturing, the study of etch patterns on silicon wafers, or metrology, occurs
on the nano-scale and is therefore subject to large variation from small, yet significant, perturbations
in the manufacturing environment. An enormous amount of information can be gathered from a single
etch process, a sequence of actions taken to produce an etched wafer from a blank piece of silicon.
Each final wafer, however, is costly to take measurements from, which limits the number of examples
available to train a predictive model. Part of the significance of this work is the success we saw
from the models despite the limited number of examples. In order to accommodate the high dimensional
process signatures, we isolated important sensor variables and applied domain-specific summarization
on the data using multiple feature engineering techniques. We used a neural network architecture
consisting of the summarized inputs, a single hidden layer of 4032 units, and an output layer of one
unit. Two different models were learned, corresponding to the metrology measurements in the dataset,
Recess and Remaining Mask. The outputs are related abstractly and do not form a two dimensional space,
thus two separate models were learned. Our results approach the error tolerance of the microscopic
imaging system. The model can make predictions for a class of etch recipes that include the correct
number of etch steps and plasma reactors with the appropriate sensors, which are chambers containing
an ionized gas that determine the manufacture environment. Notably, this method is not restricted
to some maximum process length due to the summarization techniques used. This allows the method
to be adapted to new processes that satisfy the aforementioned requirements. In order to automate
semiconductor manufacturing, models like these will be needed throughout the process to evaluate
production quality.
