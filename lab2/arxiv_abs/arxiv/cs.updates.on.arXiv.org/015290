The rampant coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought global crisis with its deadly spread
to more than 180 countries, and about 3,519,901 confirmed cases along with 247,630 deaths globally
as on May 4, 2020. The absence of any active therapeutic agents and the lack of immunity against COVID-19
increases the vulnerability of the population. Since there are no vaccines available, social distancing
is the only feasible approach to fight against this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article
proposes a deep learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social distancing
using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO v3 object detection model to
segregate humans from the background and Deepsort approach to track the identified people with
the help of bounding boxes and assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared
with other popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution neural
network) and single shot detector (SSD) in terms of mean average precision (mAP), frames per second
(FPS) and loss values defined by object classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized
L2 norm is computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the centroid
coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index term is proposed to quantize
the non adoption of social distancing protocol. From the experimental analysis, it is observed
that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score
to monitor the social distancing in real-time.
