Supervised learning is the workhorse for regression and classification tasks, but the standard
approach presumes ground truth for every measurement. In real world applications, limitations
due to expense or general in-feasibility due to the specific application are common. In the context
of agriculture applications, yield monitoring is one such example where simple-physics based
measurements such as volume or force-impact have been used to quantify mass flow, which incur error
due to sensor calibration. By utilizing semi-supervised deep learning with gradient aggregation
and a sequence of images, in this work it is shown we can accurate estimate a physical quantity (mass)
with complex data structures and sparse ground truth. Using a vision system capturing images of
a sugarcane elevator and running bamboo under controlled testing as a surrogate material to harvesting
sugarcane, mass is accurately predicted from images by training a DNN using only final load weights.
The DNN succeeds in capturing the complex density physics of random stacking of slender rods internally
as part of the mass prediction model, and surpasses older volumetric-based methods for mass prediction.
Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge about the system physics through the DNN architecture
and penalty terms, improvements in prediction accuracy and stability, as well as faster learning
are obtained. It is shown that the classic nonlinear regression optimization can be reformulated
with an aggregation term with some independence assumptions to achieve this feat. Since the number
of images for any given run are too large to fit on many GPUs, an implementation is shown that compensates
for the limited memory but still achieve fast training times. The same approach presented herein
could be applied to other applications like yield monitoring on grain combines or other harvesters
using vision or other instrumentation.
