Workflows provide an expressive programming model for fine-grained control of large-scale applications
in distributed computing environments. Accurate estimates of complex workflow execution metrics
on large-scale machines have several key advantages. The performance of scheduling algorithms
that rely on estimates of execution metrics degrades when the accuracy of predicted execution metrics
decreases. This in-progress paper presents a technique being developed to improve the accuracy
of predicted performance metrics of large-scale workflows on distributed platforms. The central
idea of this work is to train resource-centric machine learning agents to capture complex relationships
between a set of program instructions and their performance metrics when executed on a specific
resource. This resource-centric view of a workflow exploits the fact that predicting execution
times of sub-modules of a workflow requires monitoring and modeling of a few dynamic and static features.
We transform the input workflow that is essentially a directed acyclic graph of actions into a Physical
Resource Execution Plan (PREP). This transformation enables us to model an arbitrarily complex
workflow as a set of simpler programs running on physical nodes. We delegate a machine learning model
to capture performance metrics for each resource type when it executes different program instructions
under varying degrees of resource contention. Our algorithm takes the prediction metrics from
each resource agent and composes the overall workflow performance metrics by utilizing the structure
of the corresponding Physical Resource Execution Plan.
