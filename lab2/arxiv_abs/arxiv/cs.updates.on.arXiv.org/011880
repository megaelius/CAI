With the functions of plug-in charging and on-board electric generation, extended-range electric
vehicles (EREVs) can overcome limitations of pure electric vehicles, including short driving
range, large battery requirement, and charging interruption on road. Current EREVs mainly employ
a propulsion motor and single-speed transmission, which suffer poorer dynamic performance and
lower motor efficiency. Therefore, this research proposes two novel EREV powertrains to overcome
the above shortcomings. Both designs consist of the same electric drivetrain with dual propulsion
motors and four-speed automated manual transmission. The fundamental difference is from the range
extenders that connect the engines to the electric drivetrains in different ways. First, the parallel
engine powertrain (PEP) connects the engine mechanically through a frictional clutch. Second,
the series engine powertrain (SEP1) features the engine-generator unit for electric generation.
The performance improvements of the proposed configurations are compared to the traditional single
motor-series engine powertrain (SEP0). Based on dynamic requirements, the parameters of powertrain
components are designed to ensure all configurations equivalently. The model predictive control-based
energy management strategy with the forward dynamic programming solver is then designed. Performance
indexes for comparison include electric consumption, fuel consumption and gas emissions (CO,
HC, NOx, and PM). Simulation results in the driving cycle CBDC and ECEx5 show that, compared to the
traditional SEP0, the SEP1 improves all performance indexes significantly, while the PEP decreases
fuel consumption further but increases most noxious exhaust emissions considerably.
