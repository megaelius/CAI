Deep palmprint recognition has become an emerging issue with great potential for personal authentication
on handheld and wearable consumer devices. Previous studies of palmprint recognition are mainly
based on constrained datasets collected by dedicated devices in controlled environments, which
has to reduce the flexibility and convenience. In addition, general deep palmprint recognition
algorithms are often too heavy to meet the real-time requirements of embedded system. In this paper,
a new palmprint benchmark is established, which consists of more than 20,000 images collected by
5 brands of smart phones in an unconstrained manner. Each image has been manually labeled with 14
key points for region of interest (ROI) extraction. Further, the approach called Deep Distillation
Hashing (DDH) is proposed as benchmark for efficient deep palmprint recognition. Palmprint images
are converted to binary codes to improve the efficiency of feature matching. Derived from knowledge
distillation, novel distillation loss functions are constructed to compress deep model to further
improve the efficiency of feature extraction on light network. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted on both constrained and unconstrained palmprint databases. Using DDH, the accuracy
of palmprint identification can be increased by up to 11.37%, and the Equal Error Rate (EER) of palmprint
verification can be reduced by up to 3.11%. The results indicate the feasibility of our database,
and DDH can outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The collected
