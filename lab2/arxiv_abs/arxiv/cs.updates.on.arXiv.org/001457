The secretary problem is a classic model for online decision making. Recently, combinatorial extensions
such as matroid or matching secretary problems have become an important tool to study algorithmic
problems in dynamic markets. Here the decision maker must know the numerical value of each arriving
element, which can be a demanding informational assumption. In this paper, we initiate the study
of combinatorial secretary problems with ordinal information, in which the decision maker only
needs to be aware of a preference order consistent with the values of arrived elements. The goal is
to design online algorithms with small competitive ratios. For a variety of combinatorial problems,
such as bipartite matching, general packing LPs, and independent set with bounded local independence
number, we design new algorithms that obtain constant competitive ratios. For the matroid secretary
problem, we observe that many existing algorithms for special matroid structures maintain their
competitive ratios even in the ordinal model. In these cases, the restriction to ordinal information
does not represent any additional obstacle. Moreover, we show that ordinal variants of the submodular
matroid secretary problems can be solved using algorithms for the linear versions by extending
[Feldman and Zenklusen, 2015]. In contrast, we provide a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/(\log
n))$ for algorithms that are oblivious to the matroid structure, where $n$ is the total number of
elements. This contrasts an upper bound of $O(\log n)$ in the cardinal model, and it shows that the
technique of thresholding is not sufficient for good algorithms in the ordinal model.
