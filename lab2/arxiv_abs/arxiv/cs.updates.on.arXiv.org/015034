The storage industry is moving toward emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs), including the spin-transfer
torque magnetoresistive random-access memory (STT-MRAM) and the phase-change memory (PCM),
owing to their high density and low-power operation. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first
time, circuit models and performance benchmarking for the domain wall (DW) reversal-based magnetoelectric-antiferromagnetic
random access memory (ME-AFMRAM) at cell-level and at array-level. We also provide perspectives
for coherent rotation-based memory switching with topological insulator-driven anomalous Hall
read-out. In the coherent rotation regime, the ultra-low power magnetoelectric switching coupled
with the terahertz-range antiferromagnetic dynamics result in substantially lower energy-per-bit
and latency metrics for the ME-AFMRAM compared to other NVMs including STTMRAM and PCM. After characterizing
the novel ME-AFMRAM, we leverage its unique properties to build a dense, on-chip, secure NVM platform,
called SMART: A Secure Magnetoelectric Antiferromagnet- Based Tamper-Proof Non-Volatile Memory.
New NVM technologies open up challenges and opportunities from a data-security perspective. For
example, their sensitivity to magnetic fields and temperature fluctuations, and their data remanence
after power-down make NVMs vulnerable to data theft and tampering attacks. The proposed SMART memory
is not only resilient against data confidentiality attacks seeking to leak sensitive information
but also ensures data integrity and prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the memory. It
is impervious to particular power side-channel (PSC) attacks which exploit asymmetric read/write
signatures for 0 and 1 logic levels, and photonic side-channel attacks which monitor photo-emission
signatures from the chip backside.
