The beacon model is a recent paradigm for guiding the trajectory of messages or small robotic agents
in complex environments. A beacon is a fixed point with an attraction pull that can move points within
a given polygon. Points move greedily towards a beacon: if unobstructed, they move along a straight
line to the beacon, and otherwise they slide on the edges of the polygon. The Euclidean distance from
a moving point to a beacon is monotonically decreasing. A given beacon attracts a point if the point
eventually reaches the beacon. The problem of attracting all points within a polygon with a set of
beacons can be viewed as a variation of the art gallery problem. Unlike most variations, the beacon
attraction has the intriguing property of being asymmetric, leading to separate definitions of
attraction region and inverse attraction region. The attraction region of a beacon is the set of
points that it attracts. It is connected and can be computed in linear time for simple polygons. By
contrast, it is known that the inverse attraction region of a point---the set of beacon positions
that attract it---could have $\Omega(n)$ disjoint connected components. In this paper, we prove
that, in spite of this, the total complexity of the inverse attraction region of a point in a simple
polygon is linear, and present a $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm to construct it. This improves upon
the best previous algorithm which required $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space. Furthermore we prove
a matching $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound for this task in the algebraic computation tree model of
computation, even if the polygon is monotone.
