We investigate the achievable rate and capacity of a non-perfect photon-counting receiver. For
the case of long symbol duration, the achievable rate under on-off keying modulation is investigated
based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Chernoff $\alpha$-divergence. We prove the tightness
of the derived bounds for large peak power with zero background radiation with exponential convergence
rate, and for low peak power of order two convergence rate. For large peak power with fixed background
radiation and low background radiation with fixed peak power, the proposed bound gap is a small positive
value for low background radiation and large peak power, respectively. Moreover, we propose an
approximation on the achievable rate in the low background radiation and long symbol duration regime,
which is more accurate compared with the derived upper and lower bounds in the medium signal to noise
ratio (SNR) regime. For the symbol duration that can be sufficiently small, the capacity and the
optimal duty cycle are is investigated. We show that the capacity approaches that of continuous
Poisson capacity as $T_s=\tau\to0$. The asymptotic capacity is analyzed for low and large peak
power. Compared with the continuous Poisson capacity, the capacity of a non-perfect receiver is
almost lossless and loss with attenuation for low peak power given zero background radiation and
nonzero background radiation, respectively. For large peak power, the capacity with a non-perfect
receiver converges, while that of continuous Poisson capacity channel linearly increases. The
above theoretical results are extensively validated by numerical results.
