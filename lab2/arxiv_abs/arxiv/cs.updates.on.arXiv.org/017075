Coronaviruses constitute a family of virus that particularly gives rise to respiratory diseases.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus
also termed as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due to the rapid spread,
COVID-19 outbreak has been declared a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is most commonly used for the qualitative assessment of the presence
of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the high false-negative rate of RT-PCR test, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has
emerged to be a feasible alternative for the detection of COVID-19. In this work, we propose a multi-classification
model based on extreme learning machine, COV-ELM, that aims to classify the CXR images belonging
to three classes, namely COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. The choice of ELM in this work is based
on the fact that ELM significantly shortens the training time with the least interventions required
to tune the networks as compared to conventional gradient-based learning algorithms. The proposed
work is experimented on the COVID-19 chest X-ray (CXR) image data collected from three publicly
available sources. The image data is preprocessed and local features are extracted by exploiting
the frequency and texture regions to generate a feature pool. This pool of features is provided as
an input to the ELM and a 10-fold cross-validation method is employed to evaluate the proposed model.
The COV-ELM achieved a macro average of f1-score is 0.95 and the overall sensitivity of the COV-ELM
is ${0.94 \pm 0.03}$ at 95% confidence interval. The COV-ELM outperforms other competitive machine
learning algorithms in a three-class classification scenario. The results of COV-ELM are quite
promising which increases its suitability to be applied to bigger and more diverse datasets.
