The deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEAP) flap is the most common free flap used for
breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. It makes use of the skin and fat of the lower abdomen to
build a new breast mound either at the same time of the mastectomy or in a second surgery. This operation
requires preoperative imaging studies to evaluate the branches - the perforators - that irrigate
the tissue that will be used to reconstruct the breast mound. These branches will support tissue
viability after the microsurgical ligation of the inferior epigastric vessels to the receptor
vessels in the thorax. Usually through a Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), each perforator,
diameter and direction is manually identified by the imaging team, who will subsequently draw a
map for the identification of the best vascular support for the reconstruction. In the current work
we propose a semi-automatic methodology that aims at reducing the time and subjectivity inherent
to the manual annotation. In 21 CTAs from patients proposed for breast reconstruction with DIEAP
flaps, the subcutaneous region of each perforator was extracted, by means of a tracking procedure,
whereas the intramuscular portion was detected through a minimum cost approach. Both were subsequently
compared with the radiologist manual annotation. Results showed that the semi-automatic procedure
was able to correctly detect the course of the DIEAPs with a minimum error (average error of 0.64 mm
and 0.50 mm regarding the extraction of subcutaneous and intramuscular paths, respectively).
The objective methodology is a promising tool in the automatic detection of perforators in CTA and
can contribute to spare human resources and reduce subjectivity in the aforementioned task.
