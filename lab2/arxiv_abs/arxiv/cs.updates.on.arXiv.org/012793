Symmetry breaking is a popular technique to reduce the search space for SAT solving by exploiting
the underlying symmetry over variables and clauses in a formula. The key idea is to first identify
sets of assignments which fall in the same symmetry class, and then impose ordering constraints,
called Symmetry Breaking Predicates (SBPs), such that only one (or a small subset) of these assignments
is allowed to be a solution of the original SAT formula. While this technique has been exploited extensively
in the SAT literature, there is little work on using symmetry breaking for SAT Modulo Theories (SMT).
In SMT, logical constraints in SAT theories are combined with another set of theory operations defined
over non-Boolean variables such as integers, reals, etc. SMT solvers typically use a combination
of SAT solving techniques augmented with calls to the theory solver. In this work, we take up the advances
in SAT symmetry breaking and apply them to the domain of SMT. Our key technical contribution is the
formulation of symmetry breaking over the Boolean skeleton variables, which are placeholders
for actual theory operations in SMT solving. These SBPs are then applied over the SAT solving part
of the SMT solver. We implement our SBP ideas on top of CVC4, which is a state-of-the-art SMT solver.
Our approach can result in significantly faster solutions on several benchmark problems compared
to the state-of-the-art. Our final solver is a hybrid of the original CVC4 solver, and an SBP based
solver, and can solve up to 3.8% and 3.1% more problems in the QF_NIA category of 2018 and 2019 SMT benchmarks,
respectively, compared to CVC4, the top performer in this category.
