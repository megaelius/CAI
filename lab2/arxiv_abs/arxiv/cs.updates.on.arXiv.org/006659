This paper proposes a new Quantum Spatial Graph Convolutional Neural Network (QSGCNN) model that
can directly learn a classification function for graphs of arbitrary sizes. Unlike state-of-the-art
Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) models, the proposed QSGCNN model incorporates the
process of identifying transitive aligned vertices between graphs, and transforms arbitrary
sized graphs into fixed-sized aligned vertex grid structures. In order to learn representative
graph characteristics, a new quantum spatial graph convolution is proposed and employed to extract
multi-scale vertex features, in terms of quantum information propagation between grid vertices
of each graph. Since the quantum spatial convolution preserves the grid structures of the input
vertices (i.e., the convolution layer does not change the original spatial sequence of vertices),
the proposed QSGCNN model allows to directly employ the traditional convolutional neural network
architecture to further learn from the global graph topology, providing an end-to-end deep learning
architecture that integrates the graph representation and learning in the quantum spatial graph
convolution layer and the traditional convolutional layer for graph classifications. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed QSGCNN model in relation to existing state-of-the-art methods.
The proposed QSGCNN model addresses the shortcomings of information loss and imprecise information
representation arising in existing GCN models associated with the use of SortPooling or SumPooling
layers. Experiments on benchmark graph classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed QSGCNN model.
