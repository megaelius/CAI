Byzantine agreement (BA), the task of $n$ parties to agree on one of their input bits in the face of
malicious agents, is a powerful primitive that lies at the core of virtually every multi-party cryptographic
protocol. Interestingly, in protocols with the best overall communication complexity, the communication
demands of the parties are highly unbalanced: the amortized cost is $\tilde O(1)$ bits per party,
but some parties must send $\Omega(n)$ bits. In best known balanced protocols, the overall communication
is sub-optimal, with each party communicating $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. In this work, we ask whether
asymmetry is inherent for optimizing total communication. Our contributions in this line are as
follows: 1) We identify a cryptographic primitive, succinctly reconstructed distributed signatures
(SRDS), that suffices for constructing $\tilde O(1)$ balanced BA. We provide two constructions
of SRDS from different cryptographic and Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) assumptions. 2) The
SRDS-based BA follows a paradigm of boosting from "almost-everywhere" agreement to full agreement,
and does so in a single round. We prove that PKI setup and cryptographic assumptions are necessary
for such protocols in which every party sends $o(n)$ messages. 3) We further explore connections
between a natural approach toward attaining SRDS and average-case succinct non-interactive argument
systems for a particular type of "Subset-$f$" problems (generalizing Subset-Sum and Subset-Product).
Collectively, our results provide an initial mapping for the feasibility landscape of $\tilde
O(1)$ balanced BA, including new approaches forward, as well as limitations and barriers. Our approach
yields the first two BA protocols with $\tilde O(1)$ balanced communication, offering a tradeoff
between setup and cryptographic assumptions, and answering an open question presented by King
and Saia (DISC'09).
