The Joint Replenishment Problem (JRP) deals with optimizing shipments of goods from a supplier
to retailers through a shared warehouse. Each shipment involves transporting goods from the supplier
to the warehouse, at a fixed cost C, followed by a redistribution of these goods from the warehouse
to the retailers that ordered them, where transporting goods to a retailer $\rho$ has a fixed cost
$c_\rho$. In addition, retailers incur waiting costs for each order. The objective is to minimize
the overall cost of satisfying all orders, namely the sum of all shipping and waiting costs. JRP has
been well studied in Operations Research and, more recently, in the area of approximation algorithms.
For arbitrary waiting cost functions, the best known approximation ratio is 1.8. This ratio can
be reduced to 1.574 for the JRP-D model, where there is no cost for waiting but orders have deadlines.
As for hardness results, it is known that the problem is APX-hard and that the natural linear program
for JRP has integrality gap at least 1.245. Both results hold even for JRP-D. In the online scenario,
the best lower and upper bounds on the competitive ratio are 2.64 and 3, respectively. The lower bound
of 2.64 applies even to the restricted version of JRP, denoted JRP-L, where the waiting cost function
is linear. We provide several new approximation results for JRP. In the offline case, we give an algorithm
with ratio 1.791, breaking the barrier of 1.8. In the online case, we show a lower bound of 2.754 on
the competitive ratio for JRP-L (and thus JRP as well), improving the previous bound of 2.64. We also
study the online version of JRP-D, for which we prove that the optimal competitive ratio is 2.
