Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) in Software Defined Networks (SDN) emerged as a new technology
for creating virtual instances for smooth execution of multiple applications. Their amalgamation
provides flexible and programmable platforms to utilize the network resources for providing Quality
of Service (QoS) to various applications. In SDN-enabled NFV setups, the underlying network services
can be viewed as a series of virtual network functions (VNFs) and their optimal deployment on physical/virtual
nodes is considered a challenging task to perform. However, SDNs have evolved from single-domain
to multi-domain setups in the recent era. Thus, the complexity of the underlying VNF deployment
problem in multi-domain setups has increased manifold. Moreover, the energy utilization aspect
is relatively unexplored with respect to an optimal mapping of VNFs across multiple SDN domains.
Hence, in this work, the VNF deployment problem in multi-domain SDN setup has been addressed with
a primary emphasis on reducing the overall energy consumption for deploying the maximum number
of VNFs with guaranteed QoS. The problem in hand is initially formulated as a "Multi-objective Optimization
Problem" based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to obtain an optimal solution. However, the
formulated ILP becomes complex to solve with an increasing number of decision variables and constraints
with an increase in the size of the network. Thus, we leverage the benefits of the popular evolutionary
optimization algorithms to solve the problem under consideration. In order to deduce the most appropriate
evolutionary optimization algorithm to solve the considered problem, it is subjected to different
variants of evolutionary algorithms on the widely used MOEA framework (an open source java framework
based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms).
