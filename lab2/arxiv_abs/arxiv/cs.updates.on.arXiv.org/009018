We introduce the novel \textit{multivariate decomposition finite element method} (MDFEM) for
solving elliptic PDEs with lognormal diffusion coefficients, that is, when the diffusion coefficient
$a$ has the form $a=\exp(Z)$ where $Z$ is a Gaussian random field defined as $Z(y) = \sum_{j \geq 1}
y_j \phi_j$ with $y_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and a sequence of functions $\{\phi_j\}_{j \geq 1}$.
We estimate the expected value of some linear functional of the solution as an infinite-dimensional
integral over the parameter space. The proposed algorithm combines the \textit{multivariate
decomposition method} (MDM), to compute infinite-dimensional integrals, with the \textit{finite
element method} (FEM), to solve different instances of the PDE. This allows us to apply higher-order
multivariate quadrature methods for integration over the Euclidean space with respect to the Gaussian
distribution, and, hence, considerably improves upon existing results which only use first order
cubature rules. We develop multivariate quadrature methods for integration over the finite-dimensional
Euclidean space with respect to the Gaussian distribution. By linear transformations of interlaced
polynomial lattice rules from a unit cube to a multivariate box of the Euclidean space we achieve
higher-order convergence rates for functions belonging to a class of \textit{anchored Gaussian
Sobolev spaces}. These cubature rules are then used in the MDFEM algorithm. Under appropriate conditions,
applying higher-order cubature rules we achieve higher-order convergence rates in term of error
vs cost, i.e., the computational cost to achieve an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ is $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-(1+d/\tau)p^*/(1-p^*)
-d/\tau})$ where $d$ is the physical dimension, $\tau$ is the convergence rate of the finite element
method and $p^*$ represents the sparsity of $\{\phi_j\}_{j \geq 1}$.
