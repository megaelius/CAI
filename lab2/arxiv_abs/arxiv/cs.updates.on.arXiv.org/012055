Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) have attracted the attentions of academia and industry, which is
expected to become the next-generation memory. However, due to the nonvolatile property, NVMs
become vulnerable to attacks and require security mechanisms, e.g., counter mode encryption and
integrity tree, which introduce the security metadata. NVMs promise to recover these security
metadata after a system crash, including the counter and integrity tree. However, unlike merkle
tree reconstructed from user data, recovering SGX integrity tree (SIT) has to address the challenges
from unique top-down hierarchical dependency. Moreover, writing overhead and recovery time are
important metrics for evaluating persistent memory system due to the high costs of NVM writes and
IT downtime. How to recover the security metadata, i.e., counter blocks and integrity tree nodes,
with low write overhead and short recovery time, becomes much important. To provide a fast recovery
scheme with low write overhead, we propose STAR, a cost-efficient scheme for recovering counter
blocks and SGX integrity tree nodes after crashes. For fast recovery and verification, STAR synergizes
the MAC and correct data, uses bitmap lines in ADR to indicate the location of stale node and constructs
a cached merkle tree to verify the correctness of the recovery process. Moreover, STAR uses a multi-layer
index to speed up the recovery process. STAR also allows different configurations to meet adaptive
requirements for write overhead and recovery time. Our evaluation results show that the proposed
STAR reduces the number of memory writes by up to 87\% compared with state-of-the-art work, Anubis,
which needs extra 1x memory writes. For a 4MB security metadata cache, STAR needs 0.039s/0.023s/0.004s
in three different configurations to recover the metadata cache while Anubis needs 0.020s.
