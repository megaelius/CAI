Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a method of achieving nano- and micro-scale connectivity
by utilizing the free diffusion mechanism of information molecules. The randomness in diffusive
propagation is the main cause of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the limiting factor of high
data rate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between the transmitter
and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being artificially placed or occuring naturally,
surfaces or volumes that resemble an apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass.
Contrary to intuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication performance,
given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the ones that take more directed paths
towards the receiver. Furthermore, through both computer simulations and a theoretical cost function
named signal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found that the size of the
aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and the ISI combating capability
of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture size that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). In
addition, it is shown that the optimal aperture size is affected by the location of the aperture and
the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects of a radial offset in the placement of the apertured
plane, and finds that a reduction in BER is still in effect up to a certain offset value. Overall, our
results imply that apertured plane-like surfaces may actually help communication efficiency,
even though they reduce the received signal power.
