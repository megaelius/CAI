High-resolution digital microscopy provides ever more powerful tools for probing the real-time
dynamics of subcellular structures, and adequate record-keeping is necessary to evaluate results,
share data, and allow experiments to be repeated. In addition to advances in microscopic techniques,
post-acquisition procedures such as image-data processing and analysis (i.e., feature counting,
distance measurements, intensity comparison, and colocalization studies) are often required
for the reproducible and quantitative interpretation of images. While these techniques increase
the usefulness of microscopy data, the limits to which quantitative results may be interpreted
are often poorly quantified and documented. Keeping notes on microscopy experiments and calibration
procedures should be relatively unchallenging, as the microscope is a machine whose performance
should be easy to assess. Nevertheless, to this date, no widely adopted data provenance and quality
control metadata guidelines to be recorded or published with imaging data exist. Metadata automatically
recorded by microscopes from different companies vary widely and pose a substantial challenge
for microscope users to create a good faith record of their work. Similarly, the complexity and aim
of experiments using microscopes vary, leading to different reporting and quality control requirements
from the simple description of a sample to the need to document the complexities of sub-diffraction
resolution imaging in living cells and beyond. To solve this problem, the 4DN Imaging Standards
Working Group has put forth a tiered system of microscopy calibration and metadata standards for
images obtained through fluorescence microscopy. The proposal is an extension of the OME data model
and aims at increasing data fidelity, ease future analysis, and facilitate objective comparison
of different datasets, experimental setups, and essays.
