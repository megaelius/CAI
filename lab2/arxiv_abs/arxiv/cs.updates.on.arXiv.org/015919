Software defined networking (SDN) has been adopted to enforce the security of large-scale and complex
networks because of its programmable, abstract, centralized intelligent control and global and
real-time traffic view. However, the current SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms require
network managers to fully understand the underlying configurations of network. Facing the increasingly
complex and huge SDN networks, we urgently need a novel security policy management mechanism which
can be completely transparent to any underlying information. That is it can permit network managers
to define upper-level security policies without containing any underlying information of network,
and by means of model transformation system, these upper-level security policies can be transformed
into their corresponding lower-level policies containing underlying information automatically.
Moreover, it should ensure system model updated by the generated lower-level policies can hold
all of security properties defined in upper-level policies. Based on these insights, we propose
a security policy model transformation and verification approach for SDN in this paper. We first
present the formal definition of a security policy model (SPM) which can be used to specify the security
policies used in SDN. Then, we propose a model transformation system based on SDN system model and
mapping rules, which can enable network managers to convert SPM model into corresponding underlying
network configuration policies automatically, i.e., flow table model (FTM). In order to verify
SDN system model updated by the generated FTM models can hold the security properties defined in
SPM models, we design a security policy verification system based on model checking. Finally, we
utilize a comprehensive case to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
