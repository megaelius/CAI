Accurate diagnosis of tool wear in metal turning process remains an open challenge for both scientists
and industrial practitioners because of inhomogeneities in workpiece material, nonstationary
machining settings to suit production requirements, and nonlinear relations between measured
variables and tool wear. Common methodologies for tool condition monitoring still rely on batch
approaches which cannot cope with a fast sampling rate of metal cutting process. Furthermore they
require a retraining process to be completed from scratch when dealing with a new set of machining
parameters. This paper presents an online tool condition monitoring approach based on Parsimonious
Ensemble+, pENsemble+. The unique feature of pENsemble+ lies in its highly flexible principle
where both ensemble structure and base-classifier structure can automatically grow and shrink
on the fly based on the characteristics of data streams. Moreover, the online feature selection
scenario is integrated to actively sample relevant input attributes. The paper presents advancement
of a newly developed ensemble learning algorithm, pENsemble+, where online active learning scenario
is incorporated to reduce operator labelling effort. The ensemble merging scenario is proposed
which allows reduction of ensemble complexity while retaining its diversity. Experimental studies
utilising real-world manufacturing data streams and comparisons with well known algorithms were
carried out. Furthermore, the efficacy of pENsemble was examined using benchmark concept drift
data streams. It has been found that pENsemble+ incurs low structural complexity and results in
a significant reduction of operator labelling effort.
