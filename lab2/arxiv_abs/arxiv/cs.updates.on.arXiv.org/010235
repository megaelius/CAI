The Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of the rating matrix has shown to be an effective method
to tackle the recommendation problem. In this paper we propose new methods based on the NMF of the
rating matrix and we compare them with some classical algorithms such as the SVD and the regularized
and unregularized non-negative matrix factorization approach. In particular a new algorithm
is obtained changing adaptively the function to be minimized at each step, realizing a sort of dynamic
prior strategy. Another algorithm is obtained modifying the function to be minimized in the NMF
formulation by enforcing the reconstruction of the unknown ratings toward a prior term. We then
combine different methods obtaining two mixed strategies which turn out to be very effective in
the reconstruction of missing observations. We perform a thoughtful comparison of different methods
on the basis of several evaluation measures. We consider in particular rating, classification
and ranking measures showing that the algorithm obtaining the best score for a given measure is in
general the best also when different measures are considered, lowering the interest in designing
specific evaluation measures. The algorithms have been tested on different datasets, in particular
the 1M, and 10M MovieLens datasets containing ratings on movies, the Jester dataset with ranting
on jokes and Amazon Fine Foods dataset with ratings on foods. The comparison of the different algorithms,
shows the good performance of methods employing both an explicit and an implicit regularization
scheme. Moreover we can get a boost by mixed strategies combining a fast method with a more accurate
one.
