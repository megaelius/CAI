In this paper, we address the problem of synthesizing multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging
(mp-MRI) data, i.e. Apparent Diffusion Coefficients (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2w), containing
clinically significant (CS) prostate cancer (PCa) via semi-supervised adversarial learning.
Specifically, our synthesizer generates mp-MRI data in a sequential manner: first generating
ADC maps from 128-d latent vectors, followed by translating them to the T2w images. The synthesizer
is trained in a semisupervised manner. In the supervised training process, a limited amount of paired
ADC-T2w images and the corresponding ADC encodings are provided and the synthesizer learns the
paired relationship by explicitly minimizing the reconstruction losses between synthetic and
real images. To avoid overfitting limited ADC encodings, an unlimited amount of random latent vectors
and unpaired ADC-T2w Images are utilized in the unsupervised training process for learning the
marginal image distributions of real images. To improve the robustness of synthesizing, we decompose
the difficult task of generating full-size images into several simpler tasks which generate sub-images
only. A StitchLayer is then employed to fuse sub-images together in an interlaced manner into a full-size
image. To enforce the synthetic images to indeed contain distinguishable CS PCa lesions, we propose
to also maximize an auxiliary distance of Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between CS and nonCS
images. Experimental results show that our method can effectively synthesize a large variety of
mpMRI images which contain meaningful CS PCa lesions, display a good visual quality and have the
correct paired relationship. Compared to the state-of-the-art synthesis methods, our method
achieves a significant improvement in terms of both visual and quantitative evaluation metrics.
