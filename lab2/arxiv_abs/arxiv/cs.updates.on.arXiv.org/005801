In designing most software applications, much effort is placed upon the functional goals, which
make a software system useful. However, the failure to consider emotional goals, which make a software
system pleasurable to use, can result in disappointment and system rejection even if utilitarian
goals are well implemented. Although several studies have emphasized the importance of people's
emotional goals in developing software, there is little advice on how to address these goals in the
software system development process. This paper proposes a theoretically-sound and practical
method by combining the theories and techniques of software engineering, requirements engineering,
and decision making. The outcome of this study is the Emotional Goal Systematic Analysis Technique
(EG-SAT), which facilitates the process of finding software system capabilities to address emotional
goals in software design. EG-SAT is easy to learn and easy to use technique that helps analysts to
gain insights into how to address people's emotional goals. To demonstrate the method in use, a two-part
evaluation is conducted. First, EG-SAT is used to analyze the emotional goals of potential users
of a mobile learning application that provides information about low carbon living for tradespeople
and professionals in the building industry in Australia. The results of using EG-SAT in this case
study are compared with a professionally-developed baseline. Second, we ran a semi-controlled
experiment in which 12 participants were asked to apply EG-SAT and another technique on part of our
case study. The outcomes show that EG-SAT helped participants to both analyse emotional goals and
gain valuable insights about the functional and non-functional goals for addressing people's
emotional goals.
