Correlation clustering is perhaps the most natural formulation of clustering. Given $n$ objects
and a pairwise similarity measure, the goal is to cluster the objects so that, to the best possible
extent, similar objects are put in the same cluster and dissimilar objects are put in different clusters.
Despite its theoretical appeal, the practical relevance of correlation clustering still remains
largely unexplored, mainly due to the fact that correlation clustering requires the $\Theta(n^2)$
pairwise similarities as input. In this paper we initiate the investigation into \emph{local}
algorithms for correlation clustering. In \emph{local correlation clustering} we are given the
identifier of a single object and we want to return the cluster to which it belongs in some globally
consistent near-optimal clustering, using a small number of similarity queries. Local algorithms
for correlation clustering open the door to \emph{sublinear-time} algorithms, which are particularly
useful when the similarity between items is costly to compute, as it is often the case in many practical
application domains. They also imply $(i)$ distributed and streaming clustering algorithms,
$(ii)$ constant-time estimators and testers for cluster edit distance, and $(iii)$ property-preserving
parallel reconstruction algorithms for clusterability. Specifically, we devise a local clustering
algorithm attaining a $(3, \varepsilon)$-approximation in time $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ independently
of the dataset size. An explicit approximate clustering for all objects can be produced in time $O(n/\varepsilon)$
(which is provably optimal). We also provide a fully additive $(1,\varepsilon)$-approximation
with local query complexity $poly(1/\varepsilon)$ and time complexity $2^{poly(1/\varepsilon)}$.
The latter yields the fastest polynomial-time approximation scheme for correlation clustering
known to date.
