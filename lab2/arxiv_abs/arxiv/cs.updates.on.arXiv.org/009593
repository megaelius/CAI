Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches have focused on learning image intensity features
for segmentation, whereas the incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention.
In this paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to develop
a shape-constrained bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis CMR volumetric images.
The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark
localisation tasks simultaneously. The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation,
thus combining the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of addressing
3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the refinement
step is designed to explicitly enforce a shape constraint and improve segmentation quality. This
step is effective for overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions
and large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful 3D cardiac
shapes. The proposed pipeline is fully automated, due to network's ability to infer landmarks,
which are then used downstream in the pipeline to initialise atlas propagation. We validate the
pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical
experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable of producing
accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite the artefacts
in input CMR volumes.
