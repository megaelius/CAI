For a connected graph, the Hamiltonian cycle (path) is a simple cycle (path) that spans all the vertices
in the graph. It is known from \cite{muller,garey} that HAMILTONIAN CYCLE (PATH) are NP-complete
in general graphs and chordal bipartite graphs. A convex bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $(X,Y)$
and an ordering $X=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, is a bipartite graph such that for each $y \in Y$, the neighborhood
of $y$ in $X$ appears consecutively. $G$ is said to have convexity with respect to $X$. Further, convex
bipartite graphs are a subclass of chordal bipartite graphs. In this paper, we present a necessary
and sufficient condition for the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle in convex bipartite graphs and
further we obtain a linear-time algorithm for this graph class. We also show that Chvatal's necessary
condition is sufficient for convex bipartite graphs. The closely related problem is HAMILTONIAN
PATH whose complexity is open in convex bipartite graphs. We classify the class of convex bipartite
graphs as {\em monotone} and {\em non-monotone} graphs. For monotone convex bipartite graphs,
we present a linear-time algorithm to output a Hamiltonian path. We believe that these results can
be used to obtain algorithms for Hamiltonian path problem in non-monotone convex bipartite graphs.
It is important to highlight (a) in \cite{keil,esha}, it is incorrectly claimed that Hamiltonian
path problem in convex bipartite graphs is polynomial-time solvable by referring to \cite{muller}
which actually discusses Hamiltonian cycle (b) the algorithm appeared in \cite{esha} for the longest
path problem (Hamiltonian path problem) in biconvex and convex bipartite graphs have an error and
it does not compute an optimum solution always. We present an infinite set of counterexamples in
support of our claim.
