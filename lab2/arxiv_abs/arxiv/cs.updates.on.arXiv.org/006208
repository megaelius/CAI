In the IEEE 1609.4 legacy standard for multi-channel communications in vehicular ad hoc networks(VANETs),
the control channel (CCH) is dedicated to broadcast safety messages while the service channels
(SCH's) are dedicated to transmit infotainment service content. However, the SCH can be used as
an alternative to transmit high priority safety messages in the event that they are invoked during
the service channel interval (SCHI). This implies that there is a need to transmit safety messages
across multiple available utilized channels to ensure that all vehicles receive the safety message.
Transmission across multiple SCH's using the legacy IEEE 1609.4 requires multiple channel switching
and therefore introduces further end-to-end delays. Given that safety messaging is a life critical
application, it is important that optimal end-to-end delay performance is derived in multi-channel
VANET scenarios to ensure reliable safety message dissemination. To tackle this challenge, three
primary contributions are in this article: first, a channel coordinator selection approach based
on the least average separation distance (LAD) to the vehicles that expect to tune to other SCH's
and operates during the control channel interval (CCHI) is proposed. Second, a model to determine
the optimal time intervals in which CMD operates during the CCHI is proposed. Third, a contention
back-off mechanism for safety message transmission during the SCHI is proposed. Computer simulations
and mathematical analysis show that CMD performs better than the legacy IEEE 1609.4 and a selected
state-of-the-art multi-channel message dissemination schemes in terms of end-to-end delay and
packet reception ratio.
