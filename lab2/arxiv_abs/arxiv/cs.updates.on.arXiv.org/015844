In this work we study the quantum security of public key encryption schemes. Boneh and Zhandry (CRYPTO'13)
initiated this research area for symmetric and public key encryption, albeit restricted to a classical
indistinguishability phase. Gagliardoni et al. (CRYPTO'16) advanced the study of quantum security
by giving, for symmetric key encryption schemes, the first definition with a quantum indistinguishability
phase. For public key encryption schemes, on the other hand, no notion of quantum security with a
quantum indistinguishability phase exists. Our main result is a novel quantum security notion
(qINDqCPA) for public key encryption with a quantum indistinguishability phase, which closes
the aforementioned gap. Furthermore, we show that the canonical LWE-based encryption scheme achieves
our quantum security notion, show that our notion is strictly stronger than existing security notions,
and study the general classification of quantum-resistant public key encryption schemes. Our
core idea follows the approach of Gagliardoni et al. by using so-called type-2 operators for encrypting
the challenge message. At first glance, type-2 operators appear unnatural for public key encryption
schemes, as the canonical way of building them requires both the secret and the public key. However,
we identify a class of encryption schemes - which we call recoverable - and show that for this class
of schemes, type-2 operators require merely the public key. Moreover, recoverable schemes allow
to realise type-2 operators even if they suffer from decryption failures, which in general thwarts
the reversibility mandated by type-2 operators. Our work reveals that many real-world quantum-resistant
schemes, including most round 2 NIST PQC candidates, are indeed recoverable.
