Recently, FPGA has been increasingly applied to problems such as speech recognition, machine learning,
and cloud computation such as the Bing search engine used by Microsoft. This is due to FPGAs great
parallel computation capacity as well as low power consumption compared to general purpose processors.
However, these applications mainly focus on large scale FPGA clusters which have an extreme processing
power for executing massive matrix or convolution operations but are unsuitable for portable or
mobile applications. This paper describes research on single-FPGA platform to explore the applications
of FPGAs in these fields. In this project, we design a Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) Language
Model (LM) and implement a hardware accelerator with AXI Stream interface on a PYNQ board which is
equipped with a XILINX ZYNQ SOC XC7Z020 1CLG400C. The PYNQ has not only abundant programmable logic
resources but also a flexible embedded operation system, which makes it suitable to be applied in
the natural language processing field. We design the DRNN language model with Python and Theano,
train the model on a CPU platform, and deploy the model on a PYNQ board to validate the model with Jupyter
notebook. Meanwhile, we design the hardware accelerator with Overlay, which is a kind of hardware
library on PYNQ, and verify the acceleration effect on the PYNQ board. Finally, we have found that
the DRNN language model can be deployed on the embedded system smoothly and the Overlay accelerator
with AXI Stream interface performs at 20 GOPS processing throughput, which constitutes a 70.5X
and 2.75X speed up compared to the work in Ref.30 and Ref.31 respectively.
