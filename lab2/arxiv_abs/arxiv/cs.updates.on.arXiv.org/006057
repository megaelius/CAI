The way to accurately and effectively identify people has always been an interesting topic in research
and industry. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, facial recognition
gains lots of attention due to prompting the development of emerging identification methods. Compared
to traditional card recognition, fingerprint recognition and iris recognition, face recognition
has many advantages including non-contact interface, high concurrency, and user-friendly usage.
It has high potential to be used in government, public facilities, security, e-commerce, retailing,
education and many other fields. With the development of deep learning and the introduction of deep
convolutional neural networks, the accuracy and speed of face recognition have made great strides.
However, the results from different networks and models are very different with different system
architecture. Furthermore, it could take significant amount of data storage space and data processing
time for the face recognition system with video feed, if the system stores images and features of
human faces. In this paper, facial features are extracted by merging and comparing multiple models,
and then a deep neural network is constructed to train and construct the combined features. In this
way, the advantages of multiple models can be combined to mention the recognition accuracy. After
getting a model with high accuracy, we build a product model. The model will take a human face image
and extract it into a vector. Then the distance between vectors are compared to determine if two faces
on different picture belongs to the same person. The proposed approach reduces data storage space
and data processing time for the face recognition system with video feed scientifically with our
proposed system architecture.
