Malicious software is still a leading threat in cybersecurity. Anti-Virus (AV) companies are pivotal
in understanding and assigning labels to new malware samples. Currently, these labels are the sole
source of ground truth information available to the security community to evaluate malware analysis
methods. However, their adopted naming conventions are known to be inconsistent and unverifiable.
The labels are also black box since they do not represent the capabilities of malware. We believe
that we need a white box way to determine the capabilities of malware based on their behavior, rather
than black box family labels. The current state of the art in malware capability assessment contains
largely manual approaches. We propose a novel method called MalPaCA, which for a large part automates
capability assessment by clustering temporal behavior observed in malware's network traces.
MalPaCA uses network traces since most malware uses the Internet to carry out its objectives. In
doing so, we build behavioral profiles of malware families that are significantly more descriptive
than their black box family names. We also propose an intuitive, visualization-based cluster evaluation
method for the obtained clusters. We evaluate MalPaCA on 1.1k malware samples collected in the wild.
MalPaCA shows promising results: (i) It correctly discovers capabilities, such as port scans and
reuse of Command and Control servers; (ii) It discovers a number of discrepancies between behavioral
clusters and traditional malware family designations; and (iii) It demonstrates the effectiveness
of clustering unlabeled network traces using temporal features by producing a false positive rate
of mere 8%.
