The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are contained in m boxes, then at least one box has
no fewer than n/m items. It is utilized to solve many data management problems, especially for thresholded
similarity searches. Despite many pigeonhole principle-based solutions proposed in the last
few decades, the condition stated by the principle is weak. It only constrains the number of items
in a single box. By organizing the boxes in a ring, we observe that the number of items in multiple boxes
are also constrained. We propose a new principle called the pigeonring principle which formally
captures such constraints and yields stronger conditions. To utilize the pigeonring principle,
we focus on problems defined in the form of identifying data objects whose similarities or distances
to the query is constrained by a threshold. Many solutions to these problems utilize the pigeonhole
principle to find candidates that satisfy a filtering condition. By the pigeonring principle,
stronger filtering conditions can be established. We show that the pigeonhole principle is a special
case of the pigeonring principle. This suggests that all the solutions based on the pigeonhole principle
are possible to be accelerated by the pigeonring principle. A universal filtering framework is
introduced to encompass the solutions to these problems based on the pigeonring principle. Besides,
we discuss how to quickly find candidates specified by the pigeonring principle with minor modifications
on top of existing algorithms. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the applicability
of the pigeonring principle as well as the superior performance of the algorithms based on the principle.
