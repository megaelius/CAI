In most multi-robot systems, conditions of the floor, battery and mechanical parts are important
and impact cost-efficiency. The costs are generally interpreted through performance times. The
relation between performance times andthese factors are not directly derivable, though, performance
time has a direct correlation with discharge of batteries. Inroute planning, travel time of an edge
is the performance time and may be required to be estimated for multiple times.These estimated travel
times are different than heuristics costs as they depict the real states which are impossible toknow
from heuristics. This facilitates path planning algorithms to choose the edges with least real
travel times or coststo form the path. Nevertheless, a good estimation is dependent on historical
data which are close in time. But, there aresituations when all the travel times for one or more edge(s)
are not available for the entire duration of operation of theMRS to an individual robot. Then, it
is imperative for that robot to gather the necessary travel times from others inthe system as a reference
observation. The mechanism of information sharing between one robot to others in the systemhas
been devised in a form of a common ontology-based knowledge. This ontology helps to fetch and share
informationforming a collective knowledge base facilitating a comprehensive control and planning
for the system. This greatly helpsthe MR to estimate travel times more accurately and precisely.
Also, accurate estimation affects route planning to bemore precise with reduced cost. The total
cost of paths generated through the travel times estimated through sharingis 40% less on average
than that of paths generated through travel times without sharing.
