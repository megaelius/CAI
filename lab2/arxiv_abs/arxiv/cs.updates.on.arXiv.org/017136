In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented policies to curb the spread
of the novel virus. Little is known about how these policies impact various groups in society. This
paper explores the relationship between social distancing policies, traffic volumes and air quality
and how they impact various socioeconomic groups. This study aims to understand how disparate communities
respond to Stay-at-Home Orders and other social distancing policies to understand how human behavior
in response to policy may play a part in the prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases. We collected data
on traffic density, air quality, socio-economic status, and positive cases rates of COVID-19 for
each zip code of Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between February 17 and June 12, 2020. We studied the
impact of social distancing policies across three periods of policy implementation. We found that
wealthier and whiter zip codes experienced a greater reduction in traffic and air pollution during
the Stay-at-Home period. However, air quality did not necessarily follow traffic volumes in every
case due to the complexity of interactions between emissions and meteorology. We also found a strong
relationship between lower socioeconomic status and positive COVID-19 rates. This study provides
initial evidence for social distancing's effectiveness in limiting the spread of COVID-19, while
providing insight into how socioeconomic status has compounded vulnerability during this crisis.
Behavior restrictions disproportionately benefit whiter and wealthier communities both through
protection from spread of COVID-19 and reduction in air pollution. Such findings may be further
compounded by the impacts of air pollution, which likely exacerbate COVID-19 transmission and
mortality rates. Policy makers need to consider adapting social distancing policies to maximize
equity in health protection.
