Accurately forecasting urban development and its environmental and climate impacts critically
depends on realistic models of the spatial structure of the built environment, and of its dependence
on key factors such as population and economic development. Scenario simulation and sensitivity
analysis, i.e., predicting how changes in underlying factors at a given location affect urbanization
outcomes at other locations, is currently not achievable at a large scale with traditional urban
growth models, which are either too simplistic, or depend on detailed locally-collected socioeconomic
data that is not available in most places. Here we develop a framework to estimate, purely from globally-available
remote-sensing data and without parametric assumptions, the spatial sensitivity of the (\textit{static})
rate of change of urban sprawl to key macroeconomic development indicators. We formulate this spatial
regression problem as an image-to-image translation task using conditional generative adversarial
networks (GANs), where the gradients necessary for comparative static analysis are provided by
the backpropagation algorithm used to train the model. This framework allows to naturally incorporate
physical constraints, e.g., the inability to build over water bodies. To validate the spatial structure
of model-generated built environment distributions, we use spatial statistics commonly used
in urban form analysis. We apply our method to a novel dataset comprising of layers on the built environment,
nightlighs measurements (a proxy for economic development and energy use), and population density
for the world's most populous 15,000 cities.
