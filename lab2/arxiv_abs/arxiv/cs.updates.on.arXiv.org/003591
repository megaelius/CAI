In this paper, we consider the online problem of scheduling independent jobs \emph{non-preemptively}
so as to minimize the weighted flow-time on a set of unrelated machines. There has been a considerable
amount of work on this problem in the preemptive setting where several competitive algorithms are
known in the classical competitive model. %Using the speed augmentation model, Anand et al. showed
that the greedy algorithm is $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$-competitive in the preemptive
setting. In the non-preemptive setting, Lucarelli et al. showed that there exists a strong lower
bound for minimizing weighted flow-time even on a single machine. However, the problem in the non-preemptive
setting admits a strong lower bound. Recently, Lucarelli et al. presented an algorithm that achieves
a $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\right)$-competitive ratio when the algorithm is allowed to
reject $\epsilon$-fraction of total weight of jobs and $\epsilon$-speed augmentation. They further
showed that speed augmentation alone is insufficient to derive any competitive algorithm. An intriguing
open question is whether there exists a scalable competitive algorithm that rejects a small fraction
of total weights. In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question. Specifically, we show that
there exists a $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\right)$-competitive algorithm for minimizing
weighted flow-time on a set of unrelated machine that rejects at most $O(\epsilon)$-fraction of
total weight of jobs. The design and analysis of the algorithm is based on the primal-dual technique.
Our result asserts that alternative models beyond speed augmentation should be explored when designing
online schedulers in the non-preemptive setting in an effort to find provably good algorithms.
