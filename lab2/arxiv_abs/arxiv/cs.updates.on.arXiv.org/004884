Scientific journals are an important choice of publication venue for most authors. Publishing
in prestigious journal plays a decisive role for authors in hiring and promotions. In last decade,
citation pressure has become intact for all scientific entities more than ever before. Unethical
publication practices has started to manipulate widely used performance metric such as "impact
factor" for journals and citation based indices for authors. This threatens the integrity of scientific
quality and takes away deserved credit of legitimate authors and their authentic publications.
In this paper we extract all possible anomalous citation patterns between journals from a Computer
Science bibliographic dataset which contains more than 2,500 journals. Apart from excessive self-citations,
we mostly focus on finding several patterns between two or more journals such as bi-directional
mutual citations, chains, triangles, mesh, cartel relationships. On a macroscopic scale, the
motivation is to understand the nature of these patterns by modeling how journals mutually interact
through citations. On microscopic level, we differentiate between possible intentions (good
or bad) behind such patterns. We see whether such patterns prevail for long period or during any specific
time duration. For abnormal citation behavior, we study the nature of sudden inflation in impact
factor of journals on a time basis which may occur due to addition of irrelevant and superfluous citations
in such closed pattern interaction. We also study possible influences such as abrupt increase in
paper count due to the presence of self-referential papers or duplicate manuscripts, author self-citation,
author co-authorship network, author-editor network, publication houses etc. The entire study
is done to question the reliability of existing bibliometrics, and hence, it is an urgent need to
curtail their usage or redefine them.
