We seek to understand when heterogeneity in user preferences yields improved outcomes in terms
of overall cost. That this might be hoped for is based on the common belief that diversity is advantageous
in many settings. We investigate this in the context of routing. Our main result is a sharp characterization
of the network settings in which diversity always helps, versus those in which it is sometimes harmful.
Specifically, we consider routing games, where diversity arises in the way that users trade-off
two criteria (such as time and money, or, in the case of stochastic delays, expectation and variance
of delay). Our main contributions are the following: 1) A participant-oriented measure of cost
in the presence of user diversity, together with the identification of the natural benchmark: the
same cost measure for an appropriately defined average of the diversity. 2) A full characterization
of those network topologies for which diversity always helps, for all latency functions and demands.
For single-commodity routings, these are series-parallel graphs, while for multi-commodity
routings, they are the newly-defined "block-matching" networks. The latter comprise a suitable
interweaving of multiple series-parallel graphs each connecting a distinct source-sink pair.
While the result for the single-commodity case may seem intuitive in light of the well-known Braess
paradox, the two problems are different: there are instances where diversity helps although the
Braess paradox occurs, and vice-versa. But the main technical challenge is to establish the "only
if" direction of the result for multi-commodity networks. This follows by constructing an instance
where diversity hurts, and showing how to embed it in any network which is not block-matching, by
carefully exploiting the way the simple source-sink paths of the commodities intersect in the "non-block-matching"
portion of the network.
