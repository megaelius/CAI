I wrote this paper because technology can really improve people's lives. With it, we can live longer
in a healthy body, save time through increased efficiency and automation, and make better decisions.
To get to the next level, we need to start looking at intelligence from a much broader perspective,
and promote international interdisciplinary collaborations. Section 1 of this paper delves into
sociology and social psychology to explain that the mechanisms underlying intelligence are inherently
social. Section 2 proposes a method to classify intelligence, and describes the differences between
weak and strong intelligence. Section 3 examines the Chinese Room argument from a different perspective.
It demonstrates that a Turing-complete machine cannot have strong intelligence, and considers
the modifications necessary for a computer to be intelligent and have understanding. Section 4
argues that the existential risk caused by the technological explosion of a single agent should
not be of serious concern. Section 5 looks at the AI control problem and argues that it is impossible
to build a super-intelligent machine that will do what it creators want. By using insights from biology,
it also proposes a solution to the control problem. Section 6 discusses some of the implications
of strong intelligence. Section 7 lists the main challenges with deep learning, and asserts that
radical changes will be required to reach strong intelligence. Section 8 examines a neuroscience
framework that could help explain how a cortical column works. Section 9 lays out the broad strokes
of a road map towards strong intelligence. Finally, section 10 analyzes the impacts and the challenges
of greater intelligence.
