This work is motivated by our collaboration with a large consumer packaged goods (CPG) company.
We have found that while the company appreciates the advantages of dynamic pricing, they deem it
operationally much easier to plan out a static price calendar in advance. We investigate the efficacy
of static control policies for revenue management problems whose optimal solution is inherently
dynamic. In these problems, a firm has limited inventory to sell over a finite time horizon, over
which heterogeneous customers stochastically arrive. We consider both pricing and assortment
controls, and derive simple static policies in the form of a price calendar or a planned sequence
of assortments, respectively. In the assortment planning problem, we also differentiate between
the static vs. dynamic substitution models of customer demand. We show that our policies are within
1-1/e (approximately 0.63) of the optimum under stationary (IID) demand, and 1/2 of the optimum
under non-stationary demand, with both guarantees approaching 1 if the starting inventories are
large. We adapt the technique of prophet inequalities from optimal stopping theory to pricing and
assortment problems, and our results are very general, holding relative to the linear programming
relaxation and holding even if fractional amounts of inventory can be consumed at a time. Under the
special case of IID single-item pricing, our results improve the understanding of irregular and
discrete demand curves, by showing that a static calendar can be (1-1/e)-approximate if the prices
are sorted high-to-low. Finally, we demonstrate on both data from the CPG company and synthetic
data from the literature that our simple price and assortment calendars are effective.
