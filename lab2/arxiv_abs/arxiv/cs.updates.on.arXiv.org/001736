The affine Gaussian derivative model can in several respects be regarded as a canonical model for
receptive fields over a spatial image domain: (i) it can be derived by necessity from scale-space
axioms that reflect structural properties of the world, (ii) it constitutes an excellent model
for the receptive fields of simple cells in the primary visual cortex and (iii) it is covariant under
affine image deformations, which enables more accurate modelling of image measurements under
the local image deformations caused by the perspective mapping, compared to the more commonly used
Gaussian derivative model based on derivatives of the rotationally symmetric Gaussian kernel.
This paper presents a theory for discretizing the affine Gaussian scale-space concept underlying
the affine Gaussian derivative model, so that scale-space properties hold also for the discrete
implementation. Two ways of discretizing spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels are presented:
(i) by solving semi-discretized affine diffusion equation, which has derived by necessity from
the requirements of a semi-group structure over scale as parameterized by a family of spatial covariance
matrices and obeying non-creation of new structures from any finer to any coarser scale in terms
of non-enhancement of local extrema and (ii) approximating these semi-discrete affine receptive
fields by parameterized families of 3x3-kernels as obtained from an additional discretization
along the scale direction. The latter discrete approach can be optionally complemented by spatial
subsampling at coarser scales, leading to the notion of affine hybrid pyramids. Using these theoretical
results, we outline hybrid architectures for discrete affine covariant receptive field families,
to be used as a first processing layer for affine covariant and affine invariant visual operations
at higher levels.
