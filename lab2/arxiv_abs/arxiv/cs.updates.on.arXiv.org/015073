The automatic identification system (AIS), an automatic vessel-tracking system, has been widely
adopted to perform intelligent traffic management and collision avoidance services in maritime
Internet of Things (IoT) industries. With the rapid development of maritime transportation, tremendous
numbers of AIS-based vessel trajectory data have been collected, which make trajectory data compression
imperative and challenging. This paper mainly focuses on the compression and visualization of
large-scale vessel trajectories and their Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated implementations.
The visualization was implemented to investigate the influence of compression on vessel trajectory
data quality. In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) algorithms,
respectively utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated
through the massively parallel computation capabilities of GPU architecture. Comprehensive
experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS
data of recording ship movements collected from 3 different water areas, i.e., the South Channel
of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental
results illustrated that (1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could
significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization;
(2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible
if the compression threshold was selected suitably; (3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating
more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.
