This paper introduces a paradigm of smartphone application based disease diagnostics that may
completely revolutionise the way healthcare services are being provided. Although primarily
aimed to assist the problems in rendering the healthcare services during the coronavirus pandemic,
the model can also be extended to identify the exact disease that the patient is caught with from a
broad spectrum of pulmonary diseases. The app inputs Chest X-Ray images captured from the mobile
camera which is then relayed to the AI architecture in a cloud platform, and diagnoses the disease
with state of the art accuracy. Doctors with a smartphone can leverage the application to save the
considerable time that standard COVID-19 tests take for preliminary diagnosis. The scarcity of
training data and class imbalance issues were effectively tackled in our approach by the use of Data
Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN) and model architecture based as a Convolutional
Siamese Network with attention mechanism. The backend model was tested for robustness us-ing publicly
available datasets under two different classification scenarios(Binary/Multiclass) with minimal
and noisy data. The model achieved pinnacle testing accuracy of 99.30% and 98.40% on the two respective
scenarios, making it completely reliable for its users. On top of that a semi-live training scenario
was introduced, which helps improve the app performance over time as data accumulates. Overall,
the problems of generalisability of complex models and data inefficiency is tackled through the
model architecture. The app based setting with semi live training helps in ease of access to reliable
healthcare in the society, as well as help ineffective research of rare diseases in a minimal data
setting.
