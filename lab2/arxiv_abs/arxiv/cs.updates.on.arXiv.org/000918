To expand the toolbox available to network science, we study the isomorphism between distance and
Fuzzy (proximity or strength) graphs. Distinct transitive closures in Fuzzy graphs lead to closures
of their isomorphic distance graphs with widely different structural properties. For instance,
the All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem, based on the Dijkstra algorithm, is equivalent to a
metric closure, which is only one of the possible ways to calculate shortest paths. Understanding
and mapping this isomorphism is necessary to analyse models of complex networks based on weighted
graphs. Any conclusions derived from such models should take into account the distortions imposed
on graph topology when converting proximity/strength into distance graphs, to subsequently compute
path length and shortest path measures. We characterise the isomorphism using the max-min and Dombi
disjunction/conjunction pairs. This allows us to: (1) study alternative distance closures, such
as those based on diffusion, metric, and ultra-metric distances; (2) identify the operators closest
to the metric closure of distance graphs (the APSP), but which are logically consistent; and (3)
propose a simple method to compute alternative distance closures using existing algorithms for
the APSP. In particular, we show that a specific diffusion distance is promising for community detection
in complex networks, and is based on desirable axioms for logical inference or approximate reasoning
on networks; it also provides a simple algebraic means to compute diffusion processes on networks.
Based on these results, we argue that choosing different distance closures can lead to different
conclusions about indirect associations on network data, as well as the structure of complex networks,
and are thus important to consider.
