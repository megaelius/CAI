Content-centric mobile hybrid Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks consisting of mobile devices
and static femto access points (FAPs) are studied, where each device moves according to the random
walk mobility model and requests a content object from the library independently at random according
to a Zipf popularity distribution. Instead of allowing access to content objects at macro base stations
via costly backhaul providing connection to the core network, we consider a more practical scenario
where mobile devices and static FAPs, each having a finite-size cache space, are able to cache a subset
of content objects so that each request is served by other mobile devices or static FAPs. Under a general
multihop-based content delivery protocol, we analyze the order-optimal throughput--delay trade-off
by presenting a new cache allocation strategy. In particular, under a given caching strategy, we
first characterize a throughput--delay trade-off in terms of scaling laws along with the general
content delivery multihop routing protocol. Then, the order-optimal throughput--delay trade-off
is characterized by presenting the order-optimal cache allocation strategy, which jointly finds
the replication sets at mobile devices and static FAPs via a novel variable decoupling approach.
In our mobile IoT network, an interesting observation is that highly popular content objects are
mainly served by mobile devices while the rest of content objects are served by static FAPs. We perform
numerical evaluation to validate our analytical results. We also show that the order-optimal strategy
strictly outperforms a baseline approach, where the replication sets at mobile devices and static
FAPs are optimized separately.
