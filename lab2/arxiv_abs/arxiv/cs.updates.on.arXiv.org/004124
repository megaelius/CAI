We examine the problem of almost-uniform sampling proper $q$-colorings of a graph whose maximum
degree is $\Delta$. A famous result, discovered independently by Jerrum(1995) and Salas and Sokal(1997),
is that, assuming $q > (2+\delta) \Delta$, the Glauber dynamics (a.k.a. single-site dynamics)
for this problem has mixing time $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and thus provides
a nearly linear time sampling algorithm for this problem. A natural question is the extent to which
this algorithm can be parallelized. Previous work Feng, Sun and Yin [PODC'17] has shown that a $O(\Delta
\log n)$ time parallelized algorithm is possible, and that $\Omega(\log n)$ time is necessary.
We give a distributed sampling algorithm, which we call the Lazy Local Metropolis Algorithm, that
achieves an optimal parallelization of this classic algorithm. It improves its predecessor, the
Local Metropolis algorithm of Feng, Sun and Yin [PODC'17], by introducing a step of distributed
symmetry breaking that helps the mixing of the distributed sampling algorithm. For sampling almost-uniform
proper $q$-colorings of graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, we show that the Lazy Local Metropolis algorithm
achieves an optimal $O(\log n)$ mixing time if either of the following conditions is true for an arbitrary
constant $\delta>0$: $\bullet$ $q\ge(2+\delta)\Delta$, on general graphs with maximum degree
$\Delta$; $\bullet$ $q \geq (\alpha^* + \delta)\Delta$, where $\alpha^* \approx 1.763$ satisfies
$\alpha^* = \mathrm{e}^{1/\alpha^*}$, on graphs with sufficiently large maximum degree $\Delta\ge
\Delta_0(\delta)$ and girth at least $9$.
