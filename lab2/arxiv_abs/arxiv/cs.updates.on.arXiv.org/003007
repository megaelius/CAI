Applied researchers often construct a network from a random sample of nodes in order to infer properties
of the parent network. Two of the most widely used sampling schemes are subgraph sampling, where
we sample each vertex independently with probability $p$ and observe the subgraph induced by the
sampled vertices, and neighborhood sampling, where we additionally observe the edges between
the sampled vertices and their neighbors. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the number
of motifs as induced subgraphs under both models from a statistical perspective. We show that: for
any connected $h$ on $k$ vertices, to estimate $s=\mathsf{s}(h,G)$, the number of copies of $h$
in the parent graph $G$ of maximum degree $d$, with a multiplicative error of $\epsilon$, (a) For
subgraph sampling, the optimal sampling ratio $p$ is $\Theta_{k}(\max\{ (s\epsilon^2)^{-\frac{1}{k}},
\; \frac{d^{k-1}}{s\epsilon^{2}} \})$, achieved by Horvitz-Thompson type of estimators. (b)
For neighborhood sampling, we propose a family of estimators, encompassing and outperforming
the Horvitz-Thompson estimator and achieving the sampling ratio $O_{k}(\min\{ (\frac{d}{s\epsilon^2})^{\frac{1}{k-1}},
\; \sqrt{\frac{d^{k-2}}{s\epsilon^2}}\})$. This is shown to be optimal for all motifs with at
most $4$ vertices and cliques of all sizes. The matching minimax lower bounds are established using
certain algebraic properties of subgraph counts. These results quantify how much more informative
neighborhood sampling is than subgraph sampling, as empirically verified by experiments on both
synthetic and real-world data. We also address the issue of adaptation to the unknown maximum degree,
and study specific problems for parent graphs with additional structures, e.g., trees or planar
graphs.
