In this paper, the degrees of freedom (DoF) regions of constant coefficient multiple antenna interference
channels are investigated. First, we consider a $K$-user Gaussian interference channel with $M_k$
antennas at transmitter $k$, $1\le k\le K$, and $N_j$ antennas at receiver $j$, $1\le j\le K$, denoted
as a $(K,[M_k],[N_j])$ channel. Relying on a result of simultaneous Diophantine approximation,
a real interference alignment scheme with joint receive antenna processing is developed. The scheme
is used to obtain an achievable DoF region. The proposed DoF region includes two previously known
results as special cases, namely 1) the total DoF of a $K$-user interference channel with $N$ antennas
at each node, $(K, [N], [N])$ channel, is $NK/2$; and 2) the total DoF of a $(K, [M], [N])$ channel is
at least $KMN/(M+N)$. We next explore constant-coefficient interference networks with $K$ transmitters
and $J$ receivers, all having $N$ antennas. Each transmitter emits an independent message and each
receiver requests an arbitrary subset of the messages. Employing the novel joint receive antenna
processing, the DoF region for this set-up is obtained. We finally consider wireless X networks
where each node is allowed to have an arbitrary number of antennas. It is shown that the joint receive
antenna processing can be used to establish an achievable DoF region, which is larger than what is
possible with antenna splitting. As a special case of the derived achievable DoF region for constant
coefficient X network, the total DoF of wireless X networks with the same number of antennas at all
nodes and with joint antenna processing is tight while the best inner bound based on antenna splitting
cannot meet the outer bound. Finally, we obtain a DoF region outer bound based on the technique of
transmitter grouping.
