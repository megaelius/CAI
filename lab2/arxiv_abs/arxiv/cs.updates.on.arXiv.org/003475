CONTEXT: The role of expert judgement is essential in our quest to improve software project planning
and execution. However, its accuracy is dependent on many factors, not least the avoidance of judgement
biases, such as the anchoring bias, arising from being influenced by initial information, even
when it's misleading or irrelevant. This strong effect is widely documented. OBJECTIVE: We aimed
to replicate this anchoring bias using professionals and, novel in a software engineering context,
explore de-biasing interventions through increasing knowledge and awareness of judgement biases.
METHOD: We ran two series of experiments in company settings with a total of 410 software developers.
Some developers took part in a workshop to heighten their awareness of a range of cognitive biases,
including anchoring. Later, the anchoring bias was induced by presenting low or high productivity
values, followed by the participants' estimates of their own project productivity. Our hypothesis
was that the workshop would lead to reduced bias, i.e., work as a de-biasing intervention. RESULTS:
The anchors had a large effect (robust Cohen's $d=1.19$) in influencing estimates. This was substantially
reduced in those participants who attended the workshop (robust Cohen's $d=0.72$). The reduced
bias related mainly to the high anchor. The de-biasing intervention also led to a threefold reduction
in estimate variance. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of anchors upon judgement was substantial. Learning
about judgement biases does appear capable of mitigating, although not removing, the anchoring
bias. The positive effect of de-biasing through learning about biases suggests that it has value.
