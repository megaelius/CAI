As we are moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), the number of sensors deployed around the world
is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments
over the past decade and has predicted a substantial acceleration of the growth rate in the future.
It is also evident that the increasing number of IoT middleware solutions are developed in both research
and commercial environments. However, sensor search and selection remain a critical requirement
and a challenge. In this paper, we present CASSARAM, a context-aware sensor search, selection,
and ranking model for Internet of Things to address the research challenges of selecting sensors
when large numbers of sensors with overlapping and sometimes redundant functionality are available.
CASSARAM proposes the search and selection of sensors based on user priorities. CASSARAM considers
a broad range of characteristics of sensors for search such as reliability, accuracy, battery life
just to name a few. Our approach utilises both semantic querying and quantitative reasoning techniques.
User priority based weighted Euclidean distance comparison in multidimensional space technique
is used to index and rank sensors. Our objectives are to highlight the importance of sensor search
in IoT paradigm, identify important characteristics of both sensors and data acquisition processes
which help to select sensors, understand how semantic and statistical reasoning can be combined
together to address this problem in an efficient manner. We developed a tool called CASSARA to evaluate
the proposed model in terms of resource consumption and response time.
