Our objective is to develop an artificially intelligent system which aims at checking the compatibility
between the roommates of same or different sex sharing a common area of residence. There are a few
key factors determining one's compatibility with the other person. Interpersonal behaviour ,
situational awareness, communication skills. Here we are trying to build a system that evaluates
user on these key factors not via pen paper test but through a highly engaging set of questions and
answers. Hence using these scores as an input to our machine learning algorithm which is based on
previous trends to come up with percentage probability of user being compatible with another user.
With the growing population there is always a challenge for organisation and educational institutions
to make the students and their employees more and more productive and in such cases a person's social
environment comes into play. A person may be a genius but as long as he is not able to work well with his
peers there will always be a chance of more productive performance. It is a well-established fact
that human are and have always been a social animal and this has helped in creating communities of
like-minded people. Many times, even when there are a large no of people employed to do a particular
task the result may not be as expected as people may not compatible in working with one another. This
at the end creates performance gaps, hinders organisation success and in many cases loss of precious
resources. Our intent is not to remove the non-compatible people from the picture but to find out
the perfect compatible match for the person elsewhere that will not only save the resources will
also enable effective use of resources. Through the use of various machine learning classification
techniques, we intent to do this.
