Requirements Engineering (RE) is closely tied to other development activities and is at the heart
and foundation of every software development process. This makes RE the most data and communication-intensive
activity compared to other development tasks. The highly demanding communication makes task switching
and interruptions inevitable in RE activities. While task switching often allows us to perform
tasks effectively, it imposes a cognitive load and can be detrimental to the primary task, particularly
in complex tasks as the ones typical for RE activities. Visualization mechanisms enhanced with
analytical methods and interaction techniques help software developers obtain a better cognitive
understanding of the complexity of RE decisions, leading to timelier and higher quality decisions.
In this paper, we propose to apply interactive visual analytics techniques for managing requirements
decisions from various perspectives, including stakeholders communication, RE task switching,
and interruptions. We propose a new layered visualization framework that supports the analytical
reasoning process of task switching. This framework consists of both data analysis and visualization
layers. The visual layers offer interactive knowledge visualization components for managing
task interruption decisions at different stages of an interruption (i.e. before, during, and after).
The analytical layers provide narrative knowledge about the consequences of task switching decisions
and help requirements engineers to recall their reasoning process and decisions upon resuming
a task. Moreover, we surveyed 53 software developers to test our visual prototype and to explore
more required features for the visual and analytical layers of our framework.
