Searching for a person's name is a common online activity. However, web search engines suffer from
low numbers of accurate results to a query containing names. Underlying these poor results are the
multiple legitimate spelling variations for a given name, as opposed to regular text with a single
way to be spelled correctly. Today, most of the techniques used to suggest related names in an online
search are based on pattern matching and phonetic encoding. However, they frequently lead to poor
performance. Here, we propose a revolutionary approach to tackle the problem of similar name suggestions.
Our novel algorithm utilizes historical data collected from genealogy websites, along with graph
algorithms. In contrast to previous approaches, we propose a general method that suggests similar
names based on the construction and analysis of digitized ancestral family trees. Similar names
are extracted from the graph using generic ordering functions that outperform other algorithms
that suggest names based on a single dimension, which limits their performance. Utilizing a large-scale
online genealogy dataset with over 17 million profiles and more than 200,000 unique first names,
we constructed a vast name-based graph. Using this graph along with 7,399 labeled given names with
their true synonyms, we evaluated our proposed approach. The results showed that our approach gave
superior performance in terms of accuracy, F1, and precision compared to other algorithms, including
phonetic and string similarity algorithms. We propose our algorithm as a useful and valuable tool
for suggesting similar names based on constructing a name-based graph using family trees.
