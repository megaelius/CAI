The need for a high-performance transceiver with high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) has driven the
communication system to utilize the latest technique identified as oversampling systems. It was
the most economical modulator and decimation in the communication system. It has been proven to
increase the SNR and is used in many high-performance systems such as in the Analog to Digital Converter
(ADC) for wireless transceiver. This research work presented the design of the novel class of decimation
and it's VLSI implementation which was the sub-component in the oversampling technique. The design
and realization of the main unit of decimation stage that was the Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC)
filter, the associated half-band filters, and the droop correction are also designed. The Verilog
HDL code in Xilinx ISE environment has been derived to describe the proposed advanced CIC filter
properties. Consequently, Virtex-II FPGA board was used to implement and test the design on the
real hardware. The ASIC design implementation was performed accordingly and resulted in power
and area measurement on-chip core layout. The proposed design focused on the trade-off between
the high speed and the low power consumption as well as the silicon area and high resolution for the
chip implementation which satisfies wireless communication systems. The synthesis report illustrates
the maximum clock frequency of 332 MHz with the active core area of 0.308 x 0.308 mm2. It can be concluded
that VLSI implementation of proposed filter architecture is an enabler in solving problems that
affect communication capability in DSP application.
