Automated ways to extract stance (denying vs. supporting opinions) from conversations on social
media are essential to advance opinion mining research. Recently, there is a renewed excitement
in the field as we see new models attempting to improve the state-of-the-art. However, for training
and evaluating the models, the datasets used are often small. Additionally, these small datasets
have uneven class distributions, i.e., only a tiny fraction of the examples in the dataset have favoring
or denying stances, and most other examples have no clear stance. Moreover, the existing datasets
do not distinguish between the different types of conversations on social media (e.g., replying
vs. quoting on Twitter). Because of this, models trained on one event do not generalize to other events.
In the presented work, we create a new dataset by labeling stance in responses to posts on Twitter
(both replies and quotes) on controversial issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently
the largest human-labeled stance dataset for Twitter conversations with over 5200 stance labels.
More importantly, we designed a tweet collection methodology that favors the selection of denial-type
responses. This class is expected to be more useful in the identification of rumors and determining
antagonistic relationships between users. Moreover, we include many baseline models for learning
the stance in conversations and compare the performance of various models. We show that combining
data from replies and quotes decreases the accuracy of models indicating that the two modalities
behave differently when it comes to stance learning.
