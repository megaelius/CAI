This paper presents a method to obtain geometric registrations between high-genus ($g\geq 1$)
surfaces. Surface registration between simple surfaces, such as simply-connected open surfaces,
has been well studied. However, very few works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus
surfaces. The high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface registration.
A possible approach is to partition surfaces into simply-connected patches and registration is
done patch by patch. Consistent cuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone
to error. In this work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between high-genus
surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to conformally parameterize the
surface into its universal covering space, which is either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic
disk embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space
by minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity between the two
surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth registration between high-genus
surfaces that matches geometric information as much as possible. The algorithm can also be applied
to find a smooth and bijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical
experiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is effective for registering
high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also applied the method to register anatomical
structures for medical imaging, which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.
