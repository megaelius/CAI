Imagine an assembly line where a box with a lid and liquid in it enters in some unknown orientation.
The box should leave the line with the open lid facing upwards with the liquid still in it. To save costs
there are no complex sensors or image recognition software available on the assembly line, so a reset
sequence needs to be computed. But how can the dependencies of the deforming impact of a transformation
of the box, such as 'do not tilt the box over when the lid is open' or 'open the lid again each time it gets
closed' be modeled? We present three attempts to model constraints of these kinds on the order in
which the states of an automaton are transitioned by a synchronizing word. The first two concepts
relate the last visits of states and form constraints on which states still need to be reached, whereas
the third concept concerns the first visits of states and forms constraints on which states might
still be reached. We examine the computational complexity of different variants of the problem,
whether an automaton can be synchronized with a word that respects the constraints defined in the
respective concept, and obtain nearly a full classification. While most of the problems are PSPACE-complete
we also observe NP-complete variants and variants solvable in polynomial time. We will also observe
a drop of the complexity if we track the orders of states on several paths simultaneously instead
of tracking the set of active states. Further, we give upper bounds on the length of a synchronizing
word depending on the size of the input relation and show that the Cerny conjecture holds for partial
weakly acyclic automata.
