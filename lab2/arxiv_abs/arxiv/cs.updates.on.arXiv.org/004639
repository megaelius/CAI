Yield and its prediction is one of the most important tasks in grapevine breeding purposes and vineyard
management. Commonly, this trait is estimated manually right before harvest by extrapolation,
which mostly is labor-intensive, destructive and inaccurate. In the present study an automated
image-based workflow was developed quantifying inflorescences and single flowers in unprepared
field images of grapevines, i.e. no artificial background or light was applied. It is a novel approach
for non-invasive, inexpensive and objective phenotyping with high-throughput. First, image
regions depicting inflorescences were identified and localized. This was done by segmenting the
images into the classes "inflorescence" and "non-inflorescence" using a Fully Convolutional
Network (FCN). Efficient image segmentation hereby is the most challenging step regarding the
small geometry and dense distribution of flowers (several hundred flowers per inflorescence),
similar color of all plant organs in the fore- and background as well as the circumstance that only
approximately 5% of an image show inflorescences. The trained FCN achieved a mean Intersection
Over Union (IOU) of 87.6% on the test data set. Finally, individual flowers were extracted from the
"inflorescence"-areas using Circular Hough Transform. The flower extraction achieved a recall
of 80.3% and a precision of 70.7% using the segmentation derived by the trained FCN model. Summarized,
the presented approach is a promising strategy in order to predict yield potential automatically
in the earliest stage of grapevine development which is applicable for objective monitoring and
evaluations of breeding material, genetic repositories or commercial vineyards.
