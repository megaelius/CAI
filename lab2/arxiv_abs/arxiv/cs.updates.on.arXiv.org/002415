Cross-lingual plagiarism (CLP) occurs when texts written in one language are translated into a
different language and used without acknowledging the original sources. One of the most common
methods for detecting CLP requires online machine translators (such as Google or Microsoft translate)
which are not always available, and given that plagiarism detection typically involves large document
comparison, the amount of translations required would overwhelm an online machine translator,
especially when detecting plagiarism over the web. In addition, when translated texts are replaced
with their synonyms, using online machine translators to detect CLP would result in poor performance.
This paper addresses the problem of cross-lingual plagiarism detection (CLPD) by proposing a model
that uses simulated word embeddings to reproduce the predictions of an online machine translator
(Google translate) when detecting CLP. The simulated embeddings comprise of translated words
in different languages mapped in a common space, and replicated to increase the prediction probability
of retrieving the translations of a word (and their synonyms) from the model. Unlike most existing
models, the proposed model does not require parallel corpora, and accommodates multiple languages
(multi-lingual). We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting CLP in standard
datasets that contain CLP cases, and evaluated its performance against a state-of-the-art baseline
that relies on online machine translator (T+MA model). Evaluation results revealed that the proposed
model is not only effective in detecting CLP, it outperformed the baseline. The results indicate
that CLP could be detected with state-of-the-art performances by leveraging the prediction accuracy
of an internet translator with word embeddings, without relying on internet translators.
