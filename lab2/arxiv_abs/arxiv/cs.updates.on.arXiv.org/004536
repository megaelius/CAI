In this paper, we consider a novel business model of video websites via Membership-Advertising
Mode in wireless network, where the video websites provide three video services for mobile users:
\textit{VIP-Member} service, Regular-Member service and Non-Member service. The VIP-Member
(Regular-Member) service provides the highest level (middle level) quality and non-advertising
video service with high (low) price, while the Non-Member service provides the lowest level quality
and advertising-containing video service for free. Meanwhile, the video websites sell their advertising
spaces to the advertiser to create extra revenues. We formulate the interactions among the advertiser,
video websites and mobile users as a three-stage Stackelberg game. Specifically, in Stage I, the
advertiser decides the advertising budget; in Stage II, the video websites determine their advertising
spaces selling strategies for advertiser and the membership pricing strategies for mobile users;
in Stage III, the mobile users make their own decisions on video watching strategies for each video
website. We analyze the equilibrium of each sub-game. Particularly, we derive the closed-form
solutions of each mobile user's optimal video watching strategies, each video website's optimal
membership price and the optimal advertising spaces selling number. In addition, we also investigate
the piece-wise structure of the advertiser's utility function, and further propose an efficient
algorithm to obtain the optimal advertising budget. Finally, numerical results show the impacts
of different parameters' values on each entity's utility as well as the key indicators.
