Network data appears in very diverse applications, like biological, social, or sensor networks.
Clustering of network nodes into categories or communities has thus become a very common task in
machine learning and data mining. Network data comes with some information about the network edges.
In some cases, this network information can even be given with multiple views or multiple layers,
each one representing a different type of relationship between the network nodes. Increasingly
often, network nodes also carry a feature vector. We propose in this paper to extend the node clustering
problem, that commonly considers only the network information, to a problem where both the network
information and the node features are considered together for learning a clustering-friendly
representation of the feature space. Specifically, we design a generic two-step algorithm for
multilayer network data clustering. The first step aggregates the different layers of network
information into a graph representation given by the geometric mean of the network Laplacian matrices.
The second step uses a neural net to learn a feature embedding that is consistent with the structure
given by the network layers. We propose a novel algorithm for efficiently training the neural net
via stochastic gradient descent, which encourages the neural net outputs to span the leading eigenvectors
of the aggregated Laplacian matrix, in order to capture the pairwise interactions on the network,
and provide a clustering-friendly representation of the feature space. We demonstrate with an
extensive set of experiments on synthetic and real datasets that our method leads to a significant
improvement w.r.t. state-of-the-art multilayer graph clustering algorithms, as it judiciously
combines nodes features and network information in the node embedding algorithms.
