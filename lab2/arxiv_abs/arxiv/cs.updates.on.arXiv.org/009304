Purpose: Modern mathematicians and scientists of math-related disciplines often use Document
Preparation Systems (DPS) to write and Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) to calculate mathematical
expressions. Usually, they translate the expressions manually between DPS and CAS. This process
is time-consuming and error-prone. Our goal is to automate this translation. This paper uses Maple
and Mathematica as the CAS, and LaTeX as our DPS. Design/methodology/approach: Bruce Miller at
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a collection of special LaTeX
macros that create links from mathematical symbols to their definitions in the NIST Digital Library
of Mathematical Functions (DLMF). We are using these macros to perform rule-based translations
between the formulae in the DLMF and CAS. Moreover, we develop software to ease the creation of new
rules and to discover inconsistencies. Findings: We created 396 mappings and translated 58.8%
of DLMF formulae (2,405 expressions) successfully between Maple and DLMF. For a significant percentage,
the special function definitions in Maple and the DLMF were different. Therefore, an atomic symbol
in one system maps to a composite expression in the other system. The translator was also successfully
used for automatic verification of mathematical online compendia and CAS. Our evaluation techniques
discovered two errors in the DLMF and one defect in Maple. Originality: This paper introduces the
first translation tool for special functions between LaTeX and CAS. The approach improves error-prone
manual translations and can be used to verify mathematical online compendia and CAS.
