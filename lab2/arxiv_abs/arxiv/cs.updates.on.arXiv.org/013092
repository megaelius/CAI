The design of models that govern diseases in population is commonly built on information and data
gathered from past outbreaks. However, epidemic outbreaks are never captured in statistical data
alone but are communicated by narratives, supported by empirical observations. Outbreak reports
discuss correlations between populations, locations and the disease to infer insights into causes,
vectors and potential interventions. The problem with these narratives is usually the lack of consistent
structure or strong conventions, which prohibit their formal analysis in larger corpora. Our interdisciplinary
research investigates more than 100 reports from the third plague pandemic (1894-1952) evaluating
ways of building a corpus to extract and structure this narrative information through text mining
and manual annotation. In this paper we discuss the progress of our ongoing exploratory project,
how we enhance optical character recognition (OCR) methods to improve text capture, our approach
to structure the narratives and identify relevant entities in the reports. The structured corpus
is made available via Solr enabling search and analysis across the whole collection for future research
dedicated, for example, to the identification of concepts. We show preliminary visualisations
of the characteristics of causation and differences with respect to gender as a result of syntactic-category-dependent
corpus statistics. Our goal is to develop structured accounts of some of the most significant concepts
that were used to understand the epidemiology of the third plague pandemic around the globe. The
corpus enables researchers to analyse the reports collectively allowing for deep insights into
the global epidemiological consideration of plague in the early twentieth century.
