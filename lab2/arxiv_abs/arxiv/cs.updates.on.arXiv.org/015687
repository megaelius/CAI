Neural sequence-to-sequence text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) can produce high-quality speech
directly from text or simple linguistic features such as phonemes. Unlike traditional pipeline
TTS, the neural sequence-to-sequence TTS does not require manually annotated and complicated
linguistic features such as part-of-speech tags and syntactic structures for system training.
However, it must be carefully designed and well optimized so that it can implicitly extract useful
linguistic features from the input features. In this paper we investigate under what conditions
the neural sequence-to-sequence TTS can work well in Japanese and English along with comparisons
with deep neural network (DNN) based pipeline TTS systems. Unlike past comparative studies, the
pipeline systems also use autoregressive probabilistic modeling and a neural vocoder. We investigated
systems from three aspects: a) model architecture, b) model parameter size, and c) language. For
the model architecture aspect, we adopt modified Tacotron systems that we previously proposed
and their variants using an encoder from Tacotron or Tacotron2. For the model parameter size aspect,
we investigate two model parameter sizes. For the language aspect, we conduct listening tests in
both Japanese and English to see if our findings can be generalized across languages. Our experiments
suggest that a) a neural sequence-to-sequence TTS system should have a sufficient number of model
parameters to produce high quality speech, b) it should also use a powerful encoder when it takes
characters as inputs, and c) the encoder still has a room for improvement and needs to have an improved
architecture to learn supra-segmental features more appropriately.
