With the growing number of deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure for a wide variety
of applications, the battery maintenance has become a major limitation for the sustainability
of such infrastructure. To overcome this problem, energy harvesting offers a viable alternative
to autonomously power IoT devices, resulting in a number of battery-less energy harvesting IoTs
(or EH-IoTs) appearing in the market in recent years. Standards activities are also underway, which
involve wireless protocol design suitable for EH-IoTs as well as testing procedures for various
energy harvesting methods. Despite the early commercial and standards activities, IoT sensing,
computing and communications under unpredictable power supply still face significant research
challenges. This paper systematically surveys recent advances in EH-IoTs from several perspectives.
First, it reviews the recent commercial developments for EH-IoT in terms of both products and services,
followed by initial standards activities in this space. Then it surveys methods that enable the
use of energy harvesting hardware as a proxy for conventional sensors to detect contexts in energy
efficient manner. Next it reviews the advancements in efficient checkpointing and timekeeping
for intermittently powered IoT devices. We also survey recent research in novel wireless communication
techniques for EH-IoTs, such as the applications of reinforcement learning to optimize power allocations
on-the-fly under unpredictable energy productions, and packet-less IoT communications and backscatter
communication techniques for energy impoverished environments. The paper is concluded with a
discussion of future research directions.
