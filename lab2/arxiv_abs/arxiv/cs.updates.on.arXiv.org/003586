In the contemporary era, social media has its influence on people in making decisions. The proliferation
of online reviews with diversified and verbose content often causes problems inaccurate decision
making. Since online reviews have an impact on people of all walks of life while taking decisions,
choosing appropriate reviews based on the podsolization consisting is very important since it
relies on using such micro-reviews consistency to evaluate the review set section. Micro-reviews
are very concise and directly talk about product or service instead of having unnecessary verbose
content. Thus, micro-reviews can help in choosing reviews based on their personalized consistency
that is related to directly or indirectly to the main profile of the reviews. Personalized reviews
selection that is highly relevant with high personalized coverage in terms of matching with micro-reviews
is the main problem that is considered in this paper. Furthermore, personalization with user preferences
while making review selection is also considered based on the personalized users' profile. Towards
this end, we proposed a framework known as PeRView for personalized review selection using micro-reviews
based on the proposed evaluation metric approach which considering two main factors (personalized
matching score and subset size). Personalized Review Selection Algorithm (PRSA) is proposed which
makes use of multiple similarity measures merged to have highly efficient personalized reviews
matching function for selection. The experimental results based on using reviews dataset which
is collected from YELP.COM while micro-reviews dataset is obtained from Foursqure.COM. show that
the personalized reviews selection is a very empirical case of study.
