Asthma is becoming a very serious problem with every passing day, especially in children. However,
it is very difficult to detect this disorder in them, since the breathing motion of children tends
to change when they reach an age of 6. This, thus makes it very difficult to monitor their respiratory
state easily. In this paper, we present a cheap non-contact alternative to the current methods that
are available. This is using a stereo camera, that captures a video of the patient breathing at a frame
rate of 30Hz. For further processing, the captured video has to be rectified and converted into a
point cloud. The obtained point clouds need to be aligned in order to have the output with respect
to a common plane. They are then converted into a surface mesh. The depth is further estimated by subtracting
every point cloud from the reference point cloud (the first frame). The output data, however, when
plotted with respect to real time produces a very noisy plot. This is filtered by determining the
signal frequency by taking the Fast Fourier Transform of the breathing signal. The system was tested
under 4 different breathing conditions: deep, shallow and normal breathing and while coughing.
On its success, it was tested with mixed breathing (combination of normal and shallow breathing)
and was lastly compared with the output of the expensive 3dMD system. The comparison showed that
using the stereo camera, we can reach to similar sensitivity for respiratory motion observation.
The experimental results show that, the proposed method provides a major step towards development
of low-cost home-based observation systems for asthma patients and care-givers.
