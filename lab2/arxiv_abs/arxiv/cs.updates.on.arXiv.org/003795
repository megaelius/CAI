We study information elicitation without verification (IEWV) and ask the following question:
Can we achieve truthfulness in dominant strategy in IEWV? This paper considers two elicitation
settings. The first setting is when the mechanism designer has access to a random variable that is
a noisy or proxy version of the ground truth, with known biases. The second setting is the standard
peer prediction setting where agents' reports are the only source of information that the mechanism
designer has. We introduce surrogate scoring rules (SSR) for the first setting, which use the noisy
ground truth to evaluate quality of elicited information, and show that SSR achieve truthful elicitation
in dominant strategy. Built upon SSR, we develop a multi-task mechanism, dominant truth serum (DTS),
to achieve truthful elicitation in dominant strategy when the mechanism designer only has access
to agents' reports (the second setting). The method relies on an estimation procedure to accurately
estimate the average bias in the reports of other agents. With the accurate estimation, a random
peer agent's report serves as a noisy ground truth and SSR can then be applied to achieve truthfulness
in dominant strategy. A salient feature of SSR and DTS is that they both quantify the quality or value
of information despite lack of ground truth, just as proper scoring rules do for the with verification
setting. Our work complements both the strictly proper scoring rule literature by solving the case
where the mechanism designer only has access to a noisy or proxy version of the ground truth, and the
peer prediction literature by achieving truthful elicitation in dominant strategy.
