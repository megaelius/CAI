This work is part of the field of the hypergraph theory and focuses on hypergraph minimal transversal.
The problem of extracting the minimal transversals from a hypergraph received the interest of many
researchers as shown the number of algorithms proposed in the literature, and this is mainly due
to the solutions offered by the minimal transversal in various application areas such as databases,
artificial intelligence, e-commerce, semantic web, etc. In view of the wide range of fields of minimal
transversal application and the interest they generate, the objective of this thesis is to explore
new application paths of minimal transversal by proposing methods to optimize the extraction.
This has led to three proposed contributions in this thesis. The first approach takes advantage
of the emergence of Web 2.0 and, therefore, social networks using minimal transversal for the detection
of important actors within these networks. The second part of research in this thesis has focused
on reducing the number of hypergraph minimal transversal. A concise and accurate representation
of minimal transversal was proposed and is based on the construction of an irredundant hypergraph,
hence are calculated the irredundant minimal transversal of the initial hypergraph. An application
of this representation to the dependency inference problem is presented to illustrate the usefulness
of this approach. The last approach includes the hypergraph decomposition into partial hypergraph
the local minimal transversal are calculated and their Cartesian product can generate all the hypergraph
transversal sets. Different experimental studies have shown the value of these proposed approaches.
