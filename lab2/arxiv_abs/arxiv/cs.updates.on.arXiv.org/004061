We consider the {\em stochastic matching} problem. An edge-weighted general (i.e., not necessarily
bipartite) graph $G(V, E)$ is given in the input, where each edge in $E$ is {\em realized} independently
with probability $p$; the realization is initially unknown, however, we are able to {\em query}
the edges to determine whether they are realized. The goal is to query only a small number of edges
to find a {\em realized matching} that is sufficiently close to the maximum matching among all realized
edges. This problem has received a considerable attention during the past decade due to its numerous
real-world applications in kidney-exchange, matchmaking services, online labor markets, and
advertisements. Our main result is an {\em adaptive} algorithm that for any arbitrarily small $\epsilon
> 0$, finds a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation in expectation, by querying only $O(1)$ edges per vertex.
We further show that our approach leads to a $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximate {\em non-adaptive}
algorithm that also queries only $O(1)$ edges per vertex. Prior to our work, no nontrivial approximation
was known for weighted graphs using a constant per-vertex budget. The state-of-the-art adaptive
(resp. non-adaptive) algorithm of Maehara and Yamaguchi [SODA 2018] achieves a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation
(resp. $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation) by querying up to $O(w\log{n})$ edges per vertex where
$w$ denotes the maximum integer edge-weight. Our result is a substantial improvement over this
bound and has an appealing message: No matter what the structure of the input graph is, one can get
arbitrarily close to the optimum solution by querying only a constant number of edges per vertex.
To obtain our results, we introduce novel properties of a generalization of {\em augmenting paths}
to weighted matchings that may be of independent interest.
