Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and promising paradigm to substantially improve
the spectral and energy efficiency of wireless networks, by constructing favorable communication
channels via tuning massive low-cost passive reflecting elements. Despite recent advances in
the link-level performance optimization for various IRS-aided wireless systems, it still remains
an open problem whether the large-scale deployment of IRSs in wireless networks can be a cost-effective
solution to achieve their sustainable capacity growth in the future. To address this problem, we
study in this paper a new hybrid wireless network comprising both active base stations (BSs) and
passive IRSs, and characterize its achievable spatial throughput in the downlink as well as other
pertinent key performance metrics averaged over both channel fading and random locations of the
deployed BSs/IRSs therein based on stochastic geometry. Compared to prior works on characterizing
the performance of wireless networks with active BSs only, our analysis needs to derive the power
distributions of both the signal and interference reflected by distributed IRSs in the network
under spatially correlated channels, which exhibit channel hardening effects when the number
of IRS elements becomes large. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our analysis
and demonstrate the effectiveness of deploying distributed IRSs in enhancing the hybrid network
throughput against the conventional network without IRS, which significantly boosts the signal
power but results in only marginally increased interference in the network. Moreover, it is unveiled
that there exists an optimal IRS/BS density ratio that maximizes the hybrid network throughput
subject to a total deployment cost given their individual costs, while the conventional network
without IRS is generally suboptimal in terms of throughput per unit cost.
