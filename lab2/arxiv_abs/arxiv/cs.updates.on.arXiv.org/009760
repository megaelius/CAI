In theoretical analysis of deep learning, discovering which features of deep learning lead to good
performance is an important task. In this paper, using the framework for analyzing the generalization
error developed in Suzuki (2018), we derive a fast learning rate for deep neural networks with more
general activation functions. In Suzuki (2018), assuming the scale invariance of activation functions,
the tight generalization error bound of deep learning was derived. They mention that the scale invariance
of the activation function is essential to derive tight error bounds. Whereas the rectified linear
unit (ReLU; Nair and Hinton, 2010) satisfies the scale invariance, the other famous activation
functions including the sigmoid and the hyperbolic tangent functions, and the exponential linear
unit (ELU; Clevert et al., 2016) does not satisfy this condition. The existing analysis indicates
a possibility that a deep learning with the non scale invariant activations may have a slower convergence
rate of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ when one with the scale invariant activations can reach a rate faster than
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$. In this paper, without the scale invariance of activation functions, we derive
the tight generalization error bound which is essentially the same as that of Suzuki (2018). From
this result, at least in the framework of Suzuki (2018), it is shown that the scale invariance of the
activation functions is not essential to get the fast rate of convergence. Simultaneously, it is
also shown that the theoretical framework proposed by Suzuki (2018) can be widely applied for analysis
of deep learning with general activation functions.
