Evaluating and optimising human comfort within the built environment is challenging due to the
large number of physiological, psychological and environmental variables that affect occupant
comfort preference. Human perception could be helpful to capture these disparate phenomena and
interpreting their impact; the challenge is collecting spatially and temporally diverse subjective
feedback in a scalable way. This paper presents a methodology to collect intensive longitudinal
subjective feedback of comfort-based preference using micro ecological momentary assessments
on a smartwatch platform. An experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced 4,378 field-based
surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The occupants and the spaces in which they
left feedback were then clustered according to these preference tendencies. These groups were
used to create different feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological variables,
for use in a multi-class classification task. These classification models were trained on a feature
set that was developed from time-series attributes, environmental and near-body sensors, heart
rate, and the historical preferences of both the individual and the comfort group assigned. The
most accurate model had multi-class classification F1 micro scores of 64%, 80% and 86% for thermal,
light, and noise preference, respectively. The discussion outlines how these models can enhance
comfort preference prediction when supplementing data from installed sensors. The approach presented
prompts reflection on how the building analysis community evaluates, controls, and designs indoor
environments through balancing the measurement of variables with strategically asking for occupant
preferences in an intensive longitudinal way.
