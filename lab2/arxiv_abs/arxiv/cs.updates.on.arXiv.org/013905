Researchers often have to deal with heterogeneous population with mixed regression relationships,
increasingly so in the era of data explosion. In such problems, when there are many candidate predictors,
it is not only of interest to identify the predictors that are associated with the outcome, but also
to distinguish the true sources of heterogeneity, i.e., to identify the predictors that have different
effects among the clusters and thus are the true contributors to the formation of the clusters. We
clarify the concepts of the source of heterogeneity that account for potential scale differences
of the clusters and propose a regularized finite mixture effects regression to achieve heterogeneity
pursuit and feature selection simultaneously. As the name suggests, the problem is formulated
under an effects-model parameterization, in which the cluster labels are missing and the effect
of each predictor on the outcome is decomposed to a common effect term and a set of cluster-specific
terms. A constrained sparse estimation of these effects leads to the identification of both the
variables with common effects and those with heterogeneous effects. We propose an efficient algorithm
and show that our approach can achieve both estimation and selection consistency. Simulation studies
further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method under various practical scenarios. Three
applications are presented, namely, an imaging genetics study for linking genetic factors and
brain neuroimaging traits in Alzheimer's disease, a public health study for exploring the association
between suicide risk among adolescents and their school district characteristics, and a sport
analytics study for understanding how the salary levels of baseball players are associated with
their performance and contractual status.
