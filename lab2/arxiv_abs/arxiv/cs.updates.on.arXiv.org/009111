Event cameras are novel sensors that report brightness changes in the form of a stream of asynchronous
"events" instead of intensity frames. They offer significant advantages with respect to conventional
cameras: high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and no motion blur. While the stream of events
encodes in principle the complete visual signal, the reconstruction of an intensity image from
a stream of events is an ill-posed problem in practice. Existing reconstruction approaches are
based on hand-crafted priors and strong assumptions about the imaging process as well as the statistics
of natural images. In this work we propose to learn to reconstruct intensity images from event streams
directly from data instead of relying on any hand-crafted priors. We propose a novel recurrent network
to reconstruct videos from a stream of events, and train it on a large amount of simulated event data.
During training we propose to use a perceptual loss to encourage reconstructions to follow natural
image statistics. We further extend our approach to synthesize color images from color event streams.
Our network surpasses state-of-the-art reconstruction methods by a large margin in terms of image
quality (> 20%), while comfortably running in real-time. We show that the network is able to synthesize
high framerate videos (> 5,000 frames per second) of high-speed phenomena (e.g. a bullet hitting
an object) and is able to provide high dynamic range reconstructions in challenging lighting conditions.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our reconstructions as an intermediate representation
for event data. We show that off-the-shelf computer vision algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions
for tasks such as object classification and visual-inertial odometry and that this strategy consistently
outperforms algorithms that were specifically designed for event data.
