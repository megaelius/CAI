Over the past decade, the study of exoplanets has shifted from their detection to the characterization
of their atmospheres. Atmospheric retrieval, the inverse modeling technique used to determine
an atmosphere's temperature and composition from an observed spectrum, is both time-consuming
and compute-intensive, requiring complex algorithms that compare thousands to millions of atmospheric
models to the observational data to find the most probable values and associated uncertainties
for each model parameter. For rocky, terrestrial planets, the retrieved atmospheric composition
can give insight into the surface fluxes of gaseous species necessary to maintain the stability
of that atmosphere, which may in turn provide insight into the geological and/or biological processes
active on the planet. These atmospheres contain many molecules, some of which are biosignatures,
or molecules indicative of biological activity. Runtimes of traditional retrieval models scale
with the number of model parameters, so as more molecular species are considered, runtimes can become
prohibitively long. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and computer vision offer new ways
to reduce the time to perform a retrieval by orders of magnitude, given a sufficient data set to train
with. Here we present an ML-based retrieval framework called Intelligent exoplaNet Atmospheric
RetrievAl (INARA) that consists of a Bayesian deep learning model for retrieval and a data set of
3,000,000 spectra of synthetic rocky exoplanets generated using the NASA Planetary Spectrum Generator
(PSG). Our work represents the first ML model for rocky, terrestrial exoplanets and the first synthetic
data set of spectra generated at this scale.
