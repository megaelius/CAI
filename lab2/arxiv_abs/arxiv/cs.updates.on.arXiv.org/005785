Good quality of medical images is a prerequisite for the success of subsequent image analysis pipelines.
Quality assessment of medical images is therefore an essential activity and for large population
studies such as the UK Biobank (UKBB), manual identification of artefacts such as those caused by
unanticipated motion is tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for automatic
image quality assessment techniques. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect
the presence of motion-related artefacts in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) cine images. We compare
two deep learning architectures to classify poor quality CMR images: 1) 3D spatio-temporal Convolutional
Neural Networks (3D-CNN), 2) Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN). Though in real
clinical setup motion artefacts are common, high-quality imaging of UKBB, which comprises cross-sectional
population data of volunteers who do not necessarily have health problems creates a highly imbalanced
classification problem. Due to the high number of good quality images compared to the relatively
low number of images with motion artefacts, we propose a novel data augmentation scheme based on
synthetic artefact creation in k-space. We also investigate a learning approach using a predetermined
curriculum based on synthetic artefact severity. We evaluate our pipeline on a subset of the UK Biobank
data set consisting of 3510 CMR images. The LRCN architecture outperformed the 3D-CNN architecture
and was able to detect 2D+time short axis images with motion artefacts in less than 1ms with high recall.
We compare our approach to a range of state-of-the-art quality assessment methods. The novel data
augmentation and curriculum learning approaches both improved classification performance achieving
overall area under the ROC curve of 0.89.
