Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies
encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of
this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless,
it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data,
for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links.
We consider 531,889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for
labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content
and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different
statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data
availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2% of 31,956
BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link
to data in a repository -- rather than being available on request or included as supporting information
files -- are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8% of PLOS publications and 12.2% of BMC publications
provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles
that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36% ($\pm$~1.07%) higher citation
impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of
these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their
data in repositories. All our data and code are made available in order to reproduce and extend our
results.
