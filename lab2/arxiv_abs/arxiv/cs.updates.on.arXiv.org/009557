Recent studies from all over the world show that more boys than girls play video games. The numbers
are different for mobile gaming apps, where 65% of women are identified as gamers. Adapting game
design activities for academic purposes is a widely applied approach at schools or off-school initiatives
is seen as a promising opportunity for all teenagers to learn to code in an entertaining way. This
raise the questions do special girls' game-design patterns exist, and what can we learn from them?
This paper describes a girl-only intervention where girls were asked to create their own games.
This "Girls' Coding Week" was designed as an off-school event and took place during summer 2018 with
13 girls between 11 to 14 years old. To explain the basic steps of programming and to create personalized
games, the visual coding app Pocket Code, an app developed at Graz University of Technology, was
used. The girls created their own games with the help of a storyboard after receiving all important
information about coding. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected through open interviews,
as well as created artefacts and surveys which refer to motivational aspects. The findings show
that gaming elements female teenagers tend to like, create, and play, mostly follow stereotypical
expectations. In contrast to our experiences in heterogeneous course settings, this was not seen
as something negative by girls. Furthermore, the findings provided evidence for game-making environments
for girls. Subsequently, the results contributed to the development of new featured games to be
used in our app to inspire female users around the world to code their own games. The authors argue
that by understanding these differences in game design, we can support girls so that they become
game designers and thereby more interested in coding.
