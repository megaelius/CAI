Motivated by the practical challenge in monitoring the performance of a large number of algorithmic
trading orders, this paper provides a methodology that leads to automatic discovery of the causes
that lie behind a poor trading performance. It also gives theoretical foundations to a generic framework
for real-time trading analysis. Academic literature provides different ways to formalize these
algorithms and show how optimal they can be from a mean-variance, a stochastic control, an impulse
control or a statistical learning viewpoint. This paper is agnostic about the way the algorithm
has been built and provides a theoretical formalism to identify in real-time the market conditions
that influenced its efficiency or inefficiency. For a given set of characteristics describing
the market context, selected by a practitioner, we first show how a set of additional derived explanatory
factors, called anomaly detectors, can be created for each market order. We then will present an
online methodology to quantify how this extended set of factors, at any given time, predicts which
of the orders are underperforming while calculating the predictive power of this explanatory factor
set. Armed with this information, which we call influence analysis, we intend to empower the order
monitoring user to take appropriate action on any affected orders by re-calibrating the trading
algorithms working the order through new parameters, pausing their execution or taking over more
direct trading control. Also we intend that use of this method in the post trade analysis of algorithms
can be taken advantage of to automatically adjust their trading action.
