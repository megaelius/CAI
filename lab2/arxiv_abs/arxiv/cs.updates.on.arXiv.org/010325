A Natural Language Interface (NLI) facilitates users to pose queries to retrieve information from
a database without using any artificial language such as the Structured Query Language (SQL). Several
applications in various domains including healthcare, customer support and search engines, require
elaborating structured data having information on text. Moreover, many issues have been explored
including configuration complexity, processing of intensive algorithms, and popularity of relational
databases, due to which translating natural language to database query has become a secondary area
of investigation. The emerging trend of querying systems and speech-enabled interfaces revived
natural language to database queries research area., The last survey published on this topic was
six years ago in 2013. To best of our knowledge, there is no recent study found which discusses the
current state of the art translations frameworks for natural language for structured and non-structured
query languages. In this paper, we have reviewed 47 frameworks from 2008 to 2018. Out of 47, 35 were
closely relevant to our work. SQL based frameworks have been categorized as statistical, symbolic
and connectionist approaches. Whereas, NoSQL based frameworks have been categorized as semantic
matching and pattern matching. These frameworks are then reviewed based on their supporting language,
scheme of their heuristic rule, interoperability support, dataset scope and their overall performance
score. The findings stated that 70% of the work in natural language to database querying has been
carried out for SQL, and NoSQL share 15%, 10% and 5% of languages like SPAROL, CYPHER and GREMLIN respectively.
It has also been observed that most of the frameworks support English language only.
