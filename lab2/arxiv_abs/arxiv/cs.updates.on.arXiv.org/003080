The problem of complex data analysis is a central topic of modern statistical science and learning
systems and is becoming of broader interest with the increasing prevalence of high-dimensional
data. The challenge is to develop statistical models and autonomous algorithms that are able to
acquire knowledge from raw data for exploratory analysis, which can be achieved through clustering
techniques or to make predictions of future data via classification (i.e., discriminant analysis)
techniques. Latent data models, including mixture model-based approaches are one of the most popular
and successful approaches in both the unsupervised context (i.e., clustering) and the supervised
one (i.e, classification or discrimination). Although traditionally tools of multivariate analysis,
they are growing in popularity when considered in the framework of functional data analysis (FDA).
FDA is the data analysis paradigm in which the individual data units are functions (e.g., curves,
surfaces), rather than simple vectors. In many areas of application, the analyzed data are indeed
often available in the form of discretized values of functions or curves (e.g., time series, waveforms)
and surfaces (e.g., 2d-images, spatio-temporal data). This functional aspect of the data adds
additional difficulties compared to the case of a classical multivariate (non-functional) data
analysis. We review and present approaches for model-based clustering and classification of functional
data. We derive well-established statistical models along with efficient algorithmic tools to
address problems regarding the clustering and the classification of these high-dimensional data,
including their heterogeneity, missing information, and dynamical hidden structure. The presented
models and algorithms are illustrated on real-world functional data analysis problems from several
application area.
