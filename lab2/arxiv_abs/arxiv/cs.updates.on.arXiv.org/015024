Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 CT scans plays an important role in the quantitative
management of patients. Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets
that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy
fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation
methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated
with different metrics. In this paper, we created a COVID-19 3D CT dataset with 20 cases that contains
1800+ annotated slices and made it publicly available. To promote the development of annotation-efficient
deep learning methods, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation that contain
current main research interests, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge
transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide unified
training, validation and testing dataset splits, and evaluation metrics and corresponding code.
In addition, we provided more than 40 pre-trained baseline models for the benchmarks, which not
only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers
who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this
work presents the largest public annotated COVID-19 CT volume dataset, the first segmentation
benchmark, and the most pre-trained models up to now. We hope these resources (\url{https://gitee.com/junma11/COVID-19-CT-Seg-Benchmark})
could advance the development of deep learning methods for COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited
data.
