Sufficient high-quality traffic data are a crucial component of various Intelligent Transportation
System (ITS) applications and research related to congestion prediction, speed prediction, incident
detection, and other traffic operation tasks. Nonetheless, missing traffic data are a common issue
in sensor data which is inevitable due to several reasons, such as malfunctioning, poor maintenance
or calibration, and intermittent communications. Such missing data issues often make data analysis
and decision-making complicated and challenging. In this study, we have developed a generative
adversarial network (GAN) based traffic sensor data imputation framework (TSDIGAN) to efficiently
reconstruct the missing data by generating realistic synthetic data. In recent years, GANs have
shown impressive success in image data generation. However, generating traffic data by taking
advantage of GAN based modeling is a challenging task, since traffic data have strong time dependency.
To address this problem, we propose a novel time-dependent encoding method called the Gramian Angular
Summation Field (GASF) that converts the problem of traffic time-series data generation into that
of image generation. We have evaluated and tested our proposed model using the benchmark dataset
provided by Caltrans Performance Management Systems (PeMS). This study shows that the proposed
model can significantly improve the traffic data imputation accuracy in terms of Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art models on the benchmark
dataset. Further, the model achieves reasonably high accuracy in imputation tasks even under a
very high missing data rate ($>$ 50\%), which shows the robustness and efficiency of the proposed
model.
