Mobile users have not been able to exploit spatio-temporal differences between individual mobile
networks operators for a variety of reasons. End user network switching and multihoming are two
promising mechanisms that could allow such exploitation. However these mechanisms have not been
thoroughly explored at a general system level with QoE metrics. Therefore, in this work we analyze
these mechanisms in a variety of diverse scenarios through a system level model based on an agent
based modeling framework. In terms of results, we find that in all scenarios end user network switching
provides significant benefits in terms of both throughput and mean opinion score as the number of
available networks increases. However, contrastingly, end user multihoming in most scenarios
does not provide significant benefits over network switching given the same number of available
networks. The major reason is inefficient radio resource allocation resulting from individual
networks not taking the multihoming nature of end users into account. Though, in low user density
situations this inefficiency is not a problem and multihoming does provide increased throughput
though not increased mean opinion scores. Finally, scenarios that vary the fraction of users adopting
multihoming suggests that both early and late adopters will have similar gains over users not adopting
multihoming. Thus the adoption dynamics of multihoming appear favorable. Overall, the results
support the applicability of end user network switching for improving mobile user experience and
the applicability of end user multihoming in more limited situations.
