It is well known that many complex systems, both in technology and nature, exhibit hierarchical
modularity: smaller modules, each of them providing a certain function, are used within larger
modules that perform more complex functions. What is not well understood however is how this hierarchical
structure (which is fundamentally a network property) emerges, and how it evolves over time. We
propose a modeling framework, referred to as Evo-Lexis, that provides insight to some fundamental
questions about evolving hierarchical systems. Evo-Lexis models the most elementary modules
of the system as symbols ("sources") and the modules at the highest level of the hierarchy as sequences
of those symbols ("targets"). Evo-Lexis computes the optimized adjustment of a given hierarchy
when the set of targets changes over time by additions and removals (a process referred to as "incremental
design"). In this paper we use computation modeling to show that: - Low-cost and deep hierarchies
emerge when the population of target sequences evolves through tinkering and mutation. - Strong
selection on the cost of new candidate targets results in reuse of more complex (longer) nodes in
an optimized hierarchy. - The bias towards reuse of complex nodes results in an "hourglass architecture"
(i.e., few intermediate nodes that cover almost all source-target paths). - With such bias, the
core nodes are conserved for relatively long time periods although still being vulnerable to major
transitions and punctuated equilibria. - Finally, we analyze the differences in terms of cost and
structure between incrementally designed hierarchies and the corresponding "clean-slate" hierarchies
which result when the system is designed from scratch after a change.
