This thesis explores the ways by how people express their opinions on German Twitter, examines current
approaches to automatic mining of these feelings, and proposes novel methods, which outperform
state-of-the-art techniques. For this purpose, I introduce a new corpus of German tweets that have
been manually annotated with sentiments, their targets and holders, as well as polar terms and their
contextual modifiers. Using these data, I explore four major areas of sentiment research: (i) generation
of sentiment lexicons, (ii) fine-grained opinion mining, (iii) message-level polarity classification,
and (iv) discourse-aware sentiment analysis. In the first task, I compare three popular groups
of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and word-embedding-based ones, finding
that dictionary-based systems generally yield better lexicons than the last two groups. Apart
from this, I propose a linear projection algorithm, whose results surpass many existing automatic
lexicons. Afterwords, in the second task, I examine two common approaches to automatic prediction
of sentiments, sources, and targets: conditional random fields and recurrent neural networks,
obtaining higher scores with the former model and improving these results even further by redefining
the structure of CRF graphs. When dealing with message-level polarity classification, I juxtapose
three major sentiment paradigms: lexicon-, machine-learning-, and deep-learning-based systems,
and try to unite the first and last of these groups by introducing a bidirectional neural network
with lexicon-based attention. Finally, in order to make the new classifier aware of discourse structure,
I let it separately analyze the elementary discourse units of each microblog and infer the overall
polarity of a message from the scores of its EDUs with the help of two new approaches: latent-marginalized
CRFs and Recursive Dirichlet Process.
