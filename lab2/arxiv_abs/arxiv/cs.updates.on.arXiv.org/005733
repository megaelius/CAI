Language is hierarchically organized: words are built into phrases, sentences, and paragraphs
to represent complex ideas. Here we ask whether the organization of language in written text displays
the fractal hierarchical architecture common in systems optimized for efficient information
transmission. We test the hypothesis that the expositional structure of scientific research articles
displays Rentian scaling, and that the exponent of the scaling law changes as the article's information
transmission capacity changes. Using 32 scientific manuscripts - each containing between three
and 26 iterations of revision - we construct semantic networks in which nodes represented unique
words in each manuscript, and edges connect nodes if two words appeared within the same 5-word window.
We show that these semantic networks display clear Rentian scaling, and that the Rent exponent varies
over the publication life cycle, from the first draft to the final revision. Furthermore, we observe
that manuscripts fell into three clusters in terms of how the scaling exponents changed across drafts:
exponents rising over time, falling over time, and remaining relatively stable over time. This
change in exponent reflects the evolution in semantic network structure over the manuscript revision
process, highlighting a balance between network complexity, which increases the exponent, and
network efficiency, which decreases the exponent. Lastly, the final value of the Rent exponent
is negatively correlated with the number of authors. Taken together, our results suggest that semantic
networks reflecting the structure of exposition in scientific research articles display striking
hierarchical architecture that arbitrates tradeoffs between competing constraints on network
organization, and that this arbitration is navigated differently depending on the social environment
characteristic of the collaboration.
