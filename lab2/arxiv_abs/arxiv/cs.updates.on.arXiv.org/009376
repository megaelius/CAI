Next-generation wireless networks must support ultra-reliable, low-latency communication
and intelligently manage a massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in real-time, within
a highly dynamic environment. This need for stringent communication quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements as well as mobile edge and core intelligence can only be realized by integrating fundamental
notions of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning across the wireless infrastructure
and end-user devices. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive tutorial that introduces
the main concepts of machine learning, in general, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), in particular,
and their potential applications in wireless communications. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive
overview on a number of key types of neural networks that include feed-forward, recurrent, spiking,
and deep neural networks. For each type of neural network, we present the basic architecture and
training procedure, as well as the associated challenges and opportunities. Then, we provide an
in-depth overview on the variety of wireless communication problems that can be addressed using
ANNs, ranging from communication using unmanned aerial vehicles to virtual reality and edge caching.For
each individual application, we present the main motivation for using ANNs along with the associated
challenges while also providing a detailed example for a use case scenario and outlining future
works that can be addressed using ANNs. In a nutshell, this article constitutes one of the first holistic
tutorials on the development of machine learning techniques tailored to the needs of future wireless
networks.
