The paper presents for the first time a quantification of the photospheric electric current ribbon
evolutions during an eruptive flare, accurately predicted by the standard 3D flare model. The standard
flare model in 3D has been developed with the MHD code OHM, which models the evolution of an unstable
flux rope. Through a series of paper, the model has been successful in explaining observational
characteristics of eruptive flares, as well as the intrinsic 3D reconnection mechanism. Such a
model also explains the increase of the photospheric currents as a consequence of the evolution
of the coronal current layer where reconnection takes place. The photospheric footprints of the
3D current layer reveal a ribbon shape structure. In the present paper, the evolution of the current
density is analyzed for the X-class flare that occurred on 15/02/2011 in AR 11158. We first describe
the structural evolution of the high vertical current density regions derived with the UNNOFIT
inversion code from magnetograms (HMI, every 12 mn). These currents develop in current ribbons
at similar locations to the flare ribbons. Their evolutions remain continuous during the flare.
These ribbons are J-shaped, and they show a widening and an elongation during the impulsive phase
of the flare. Spatial integration of the electric current density over small parts of the ribbons
shows an increase up to 2x the pre-flare values. The EUV data show similar evolutions for the flare
ribbons as pointed out for the electric current ribbons. This evolution characterizes the sudden
collapse of the coronal current layer that is predicted in the standard 3D model. Finally, this study
further enhances the close correspondence obtained between the theoretical predictions of the
3D model and flare observations indicating that the main key physical elements are incorporated
in the model.
