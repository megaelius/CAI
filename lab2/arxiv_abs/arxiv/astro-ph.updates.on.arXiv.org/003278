We present a systematic evaluation of JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444) as a transport data format to enable
rapid remote searches for fast transient events as part of the Deeper Wider Faster program (DWF).
DWF uses ~20 telescopes from radio to gamma-rays to perform simultaneous and rapid-response follow-up
searches for fast transient events on millisecond-to-hours timescales. DWF search demands have
a set of constraints that is becoming common amongst large collaborations. Here, we focus on the
rapid optical data component of DWF led by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at CTIO. Each DECam image
has 70 total CCDs saved as a ~1.2 gigabyte FITS file. Near real-time data processing and fast transient
candidate identifications -- in minutes for rapid follow-up triggers on other telescopes -- requires
computational power exceeding what is currently available on-site at CTIO. In this context, data
files need to be transmitted rapidly to a foreign location for supercomputing post-processing,
source finding, visualization and analysis. This step in the search process poses a major bottleneck,
and reducing the data size helps accommodate faster data transmission. To maximise our gain in transfer
time and still achieve our science goals, we opt for lossy data compression -- keeping in mind that
raw data is archived and can be evaluated at a later time. We evaluate how lossy JPEG2000 compression
affects the process of finding transients, and find only a negligible effect for compression ratios
up to ~25:1. We also find a linear relation between compression ratio and the mean estimated data
transmission speed-up factor. Adding highly customized compression and decompression steps
to the science pipeline considerably reduces the transmission time -- validating its introduction
to the DWF science pipeline and enabling science that was otherwise too difficult with current technology.
