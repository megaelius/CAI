Jupiter played an important role in determining the structure and configuration of the Solar System.
Whereas hot-Jupiter type exoplanets preferentially form around metal-rich stars, the conditions
required for the formation of planets with masses, orbits and eccentricities comparable to Jupiter
(Jupiter analogues) are unknown. Using spectroscopic metallicities, we show that stars hosting
Jupiter analogues have an average metallicity close to solar, in contrast to their hot-Jupiter
and eccentric cool Jupiter counterparts, which orbit stars with super-solar metallicities. Furthermore,
the eccentricities of Jupiter analogues increase with host star metallicity, suggesting that
planet-planet scatterings producing highly eccentric cool Jupiters could be more common in metal-rich
environments. To investigate a possible explanation for these metallicity trends, we compare
the observations to numerical simulations, which indicate that metal-rich stars typically form
multiple Jupiters, leading to planet-planet interactions and, hence, a prevalence of either eccentric
cool Jupiters or hot-Jupiters with circularized orbits. Although the samples are small and exhibit
variations in their metallicities, suggesting that numerous processes other than metallicity
affect the formation of planetary systems, the data in hand suggests that Jupiter analogues and
terrestrial-sized planets form around stars with average metallicities close to solar, whereas
high metallicity systems preferentially host eccentric cool Jupiter or hot-Jupiters, indicating
higher metallicity systems may not be favorable for the formation of planetary systems akin to the
Solar System.
