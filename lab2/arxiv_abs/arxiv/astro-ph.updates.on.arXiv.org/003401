Galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) are a critical uncertainty for current and future weak lensing
measurements. We describe a perturbative expansion of IA, analogous to the treatment of galaxy
biasing. From an astrophysical perspective, this model includes the expected large-scale alignment
mechanisms for galaxies that are pressure-supported (tidal alignment) and rotation-supported
(tidal torquing) as well as the cross-correlation between the two. Alternatively, this expansion
can be viewed as an effective model capturing all relevant effects up to the given order. We include
terms up to second order in the density and tidal fields and calculate the resulting IA contributions
to two-point statistics at one-loop order. For fiducial amplitudes of the IA parameters, we find
the quadratic alignment and linear-quadratic cross terms can contribute order-unity corrections
to the total intrinsic alignment signal at $k\sim0.1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, depending on the source
redshift distribution. These contributions can lead to significant biases on inferred cosmological
parameters in Stage IV photometric weak lensing surveys. We perform forecasts for an LSST-like
survey, finding that use of the standard "NLA" model for intrinsic alignments cannot remove these
large parameter biases, even when allowing for a more general redshift dependence. The model presented
here will allow for more accurate and flexible IA treatment in weak lensing and combined probes analyses,
and an implementation is made available as part of the public FAST-PT code. The model also provides
a more advanced framework for understanding the underlying IA processes and their relationship
to fundamental physics.
