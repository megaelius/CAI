A bright, soft X-ray source was detected on 2010 July 14 during an XMM--Newton slew at a position consistent
with the galaxy GSN 069 (z=0.018). Previous ROSAT observations failed to detect the source and imply
that GSN 069 is now >240 times brighter than it was in 1994 in the soft X-ray band. We report here
results from a ~1 yr monitoring with Swift and XMM-Newton, as well as from optical spectroscopy.
GSN 069 is an unabsorbed, ultra-soft source in X-rays, with no flux detected above ~1 keV. The soft
X-rays exhibit significant variability down to timescales of hundreds of seconds. The UV-to-X-ray
spectrum of GSN 069 is consistent with a pure accretion disc model which implies an Eddington ratio
of ~0.5 and a black hole mass of ~ 1.2 million solar masses. A new optical spectrum, obtained ~3.5 months
after the XMM-Newton slew detection, is consistent with earlier spectra and lacks any broad line
component, classifying the source as a Seyfert 2 galaxy. The lack of cold X-ray absorption and the
short timescale variability in the soft X-rays rule out a standard Seyfert 2 interpretation of the
X-ray data. We discuss our results within the framework of two possible scenarios for the broad-line-region
(BLR) in AGN, namely the two-phase model (cold BLR clouds in pressure equilibrium with a hotter medium),
and models in which the BLR is part of an outflow, or disc-wind. Finally, we point out that GSN 069 may
be a member of a population of super-soft AGN whose SED is completely dominated by accretion disc
emission, as it is the case in some black hole X-ray binary transients during their outburst evolution.
The disc emission for a typical AGN with larger black hole mass than GSN 069 does not enters the soft
X-ray band, so that GSN 069-like objects would likely be missed by current X-ray surveys, or mis-classified
as Compton-thick candidates. (ABRIDGED)
