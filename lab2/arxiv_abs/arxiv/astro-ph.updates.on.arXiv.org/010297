Isotope anomalies among planetary bodies provide key constraints on planetary genetics and the
Solar System's dynamical evolution. However, to unlock the full potential of these anomalies for
constraining the processing, mixing, and transport of material in the disk it is essential to identify
the main components responsible for producing planetary-scale isotope variations, and to investigate
how they relate to the isotopic heterogeneity inherited from the Solar System's parental molecular
cloud. To address these issues we measured the Ti and Sr isotopic compositions of Ca,Al-rich inclusions
(CAIs) from the Allende CV3 chondrite, as well as acid leachates and an insoluble residue from the
Murchison CM2 chondrite, and combine these results with literature data for presolar grains, hibonites,
chondrules, and bulk meteorites. Our analysis reveals that the mineral-scale nebular isotopic
heterogeneity as sampled by leachates and presolar grains is largely decoupled from the planetary-scale
isotope anomalies. Combining isotope anomaly data for a large number of elements reveals that the
difference between non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites is the product of mixing
between NC material and a nebular reservoir (termed IC) whose isotopic composition is similar to
that of CAIs, but whose chemical composition is similar to bulk chondrites. In our preferred model,
the distinct isotopic compositions of these two nebular reservoirs reflect an inherited heterogeneity
of the solar system's parental molecular cloud core, which therefore has never been fully homogenized
during collapse. Planetary-scale isotopic anomalies are thus caused by variable mixing of isotopically
distinct primordial disk reservoirs, the selective processing of these reservoirs in different
nebular environments, and the heterogeneous distribution of the thereby forming nebular products.
