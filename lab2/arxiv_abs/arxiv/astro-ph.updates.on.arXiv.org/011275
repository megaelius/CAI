We present DASH (Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier), a novel software package that automates
the classification of the type, age, redshift, and host galaxy of supernova spectra. DASH makes
use of a new approach that does not rely on iterative template matching techniques like all previous
software, but instead classifies based on the learned features of each supernova's type and age.
It has achieved this by employing a deep convolutional neural network to train a matching algorithm.
This approach has enabled DASH to be orders of magnitude faster than previous tools, being able to
accurately classify hundreds or thousands of objects within seconds. We have tested its performance
on four years of data from the Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). The deep learning models were
developed using TensorFlow, and were trained using over 4000 supernova spectra taken from the CfA
Supernova Program and the Berkeley SN Ia Program as used in SNID (Supernova Identification software,
Blondin & Tonry 2007). Unlike template matching methods, the trained models are independent of
the number of spectra in the training data, which allows for DASH's unprecedented speed. We have
developed both a graphical interface for easy visual classification and analysis of supernovae,
and a Python library for the autonomous and quick classification of several supernova spectra.
The speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and versatility of DASH presents an advancement to existing
spectral classification tools. We have made the code publicly available on GitHub and PyPI (pip
install astrodash) to allow for further contributions and development. The package documentation
