We study the coupling of the force-free magnetosphere to the long-term internal evolution of a magnetar.
We allow the relation between the poloidal and toroidal stream functions - that characterizes the
magnetosphere - to evolve freely without constraining its particular form. We find that, on timescales
of the order of kyrs, the energy stored in the magnetosphere gradually increases, as the toroidal
region grows and the field lines expand outwards. This continues until a critical point is reached
beyond which force-free solutions for the magnetosphere can no longer be constructed, likely leading
to some large scale magnetospheric reorganization. The energy budget available for such events
can be as high as several $10^{45}\,$erg for fields of $10^{14}\,$G. Subsequently, starting from
the new initial conditions, the evolution proceeds in a similar manner. The timescale to reach the
critical point scales inversely with the magnetic field amplitude. Allowing currents to pass through
the last few meters below the surface, where the magnetic diffusivity is orders of magnitude larger
than in the crust, should give rise to a considerable amount of energy deposition through Joule heating.
We estimate that, the effective surface temperature could increase locally from $\sim 0.1\,$keV
to $\sim 0.3 - 0.6\,$keV, in good agreement with observations. Similarly, the power input from the
interior into the magnetosphere could be as high as $10^{35} - 10^{36}\,$erg/s, which is consistent
with peak luminosities observed during magnetar outbursts. Therefore, a detailed treatment of
currents flowing through the envelope may be needed to explain the thermal properties of magnetars.
