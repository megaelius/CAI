Massive, quiescent galaxies at high redshift have been found to be considerably more compact than
galaxies of similar mass in the local universe. How these compact galaxies formed has yet to be determined,
though several progenitor populations have been proposed. Here we investigate the formation processes
and quantify the assembly histories of such galaxies in Illustris, a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations encompassing a sufficiently large volume to include rare objects, while simultaneously
resolving the internal structure of galaxies. We select massive (~10^11 solar masses) and compact
(stellar half-mass radius < 2 kpc) galaxies from the simulation at z=2. Within the Illustris
suite, we find that these quantities are not perfectly converged, but are reasonably reliable for
our purposes. The resulting population is composed primarily of quiescent galaxies, but we also
find several star-forming compact galaxies. The simulated compact galaxies are similar to observed
galaxies in star formation activity, appearance, and number density. We follow their evolution
at high redshift in the simulation and find that there are multiple pathways to form these compact
galaxies, dominated by two mechanisms: (i) intense, centrally concentrated starbursts generally
triggered by gas-rich major mergers between z~2-4, reducing the galaxies' half-mass radii by a
factor of a few to below 2 kpc, and (ii) assembly at very early times when the universe was much denser;
the galaxies formed compact and remained so until z~2. These compact galaxies represent a tail in
the overall galaxy distribution rather than a special class, with their small sizes simply one end
of a smooth distribution which is a natural consequence of all the various physical processes galaxies
may undergo at high redshift.
