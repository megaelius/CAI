Faint dwarf satellite galaxies are important as tracers of small-scale structure, but remain poorly
characterized outside the Local Group, due to the difficulty of identifying them consistently
at larger distances. We review a recently proposed method for estimating the average satellite
population around a given sample of nearby bright galaxies, using a combination of size and magnitude
cuts (to select low-redshift dwarf galaxies preferentially) and clustering measurements (to
estimate the fraction of true satellites in the cut sample). We test this method using the high-precision
photometric redshift catalog of the COSMOS survey, exploring the effect of specific cuts on the
clustering signal. The most effective of the size-magnitude cuts considered recover the clustering
signal around low-redshift primaries (z < 0.15) with about two-thirds of the signal and 80\%\ of
the signal-to-noise ratio obtainable using the full COSMOS photometric redshifts. These cuts
are also fairly efficient, with more than one third of the selected objects being clustered satellites.
We conclude that structural selection represents a useful tool in characterizing dwarf populations
to fainter magnitudes and/or over larger areas than are feasible with spectroscopic surveys.}
In reviewing the low-redshift content of the COSMOS field, we also note the existence of several
dozen objects that appear resolved or partially resolved in the HST imaging, and are confirmed to
be local (at distances of $\sim$250 Mpc or less) by their photometric or spectroscopic redshifts.
This underlines the potential for future space-based surveys to reveal local populations of intrinsically
faint galaxies through imaging alone.
