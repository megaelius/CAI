Motivated by the reported dearth of debris discs around M stars, we use survival models to study the
occurrence of planetesimal discs around them. These survival models describe a planetesimal disc
with a small number of parameters, determine if it may survive a series of dynamical processes and
compute the associated infrared excess. For the WISE satellite, we demonstrate that the dearth
of debris discs around M stars may be attributed to the small semi-major axes generally probed if
either: 1. the dust grains behave like blackbodies emitting at a peak wavelength coincident with
the observed one; 2. or the grains are hotter than predicted by their blackbody temperatures and
emit at peak wavelengths that are shorter than the observed one. At these small distances from the
M star, planetesimals are unlikely to survive or persist for time scales of 300 Myr or longer if the
disc is too massive. Conversely, our survival models allow for the existence of a large population
of low-mass debris discs that are too faint to be detected with current instruments. However, our
interpretation becomes less clear and large infrared excesses are allowed if only one of these scenarios
holds: 3. the dust grains are hotter than blackbody and predominantly emit at the observed wavelength;
4. or are blackbody in nature and emit at peak wavelengths longer than the observed one. Both scenarios
imply that the parent planetesimals reside at larger distances from the star than inferred if the
dust grains behaved like blackbodies. In all scenarios, we show that the infrared excesses detected
at 22 and 70 microns from AU Mic are easily reconciled with its young age. We elucidate the conditions
under which stellar wind drag may be neglected when considering dust populations around M stars.
The WISE satellite should be capable of detecting debris discs around young M stars with ages on the
order of 10 Myr.
