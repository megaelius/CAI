We study the dynamics of large, charged dust grains in turbulent giant molecular clouds (GMCs).
Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in primarily neutral dense gas, and thus are
able to produce dramatic small-scale fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016)
directly simulated the dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical
of GMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on small scales, with
important implications for star formation, stellar abundances, and dust behavior and growth.
However, even in primarily neutral gas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces
are non-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the effects of Lorentz
forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small charged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz
forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio fluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz
forces have essentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of dust magnetization.
In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can enhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless,
for the physically expected scaling of dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects
depend on grain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order correction.
We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three dimensionless numbers in the limit
of weak background magnetic fields: the turbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional
to grain size) and a dust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to generalize
our simulations to a wide range of conditions.
