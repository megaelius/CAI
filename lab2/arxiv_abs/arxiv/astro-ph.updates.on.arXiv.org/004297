High-mass stars form in much richer environments than those associated with isolated low-mass
stars, and once they reach a certain mass, produce ionised (HII) regions. The formation of these
pockets of ionised gas are unique to the formation of high-mass stars (M $>8$ M$_\odot$), and present
an excellent opportunity to study the final stages of accretion, which could include accretion
through the HII region itself. This study of the dynamics of the gas on both sides of these ionisation
boundaries in very young HII regions aims to quantify the relationship between the HII regions and
their immediate environments.We present high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.5$"$) ALMA observations
of nine HII regions selected from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey with compact radio emission and
bolometric luminosities greater than 10$^4$ L$_\odot$. We focus on the initial presentation of
the data, including initial results from the radio recombination line H29$\alpha$, some complementary
molecules, and the 256 GHz continuum emission. Of the six (out of nine) regions with H29$\alpha$
detections, two appear to have cometary morphologies with velocity gradients across them, and
two appear more spherical with velocity gradients suggestive of infalling ionised gas. The remaining
two were either observed at low resolution or had signals that were too weak to draw robust conclusions.
We also present a description of the interactions between the ionised and molecular gas (as traced
by CS (J=5-4)), often (but not always) finding theHII region had cleared its immediate vicinity
of molecules. Of our sample of nine, the observations of the two clusters expected to have the youngest
HII regions (from previous radio observations) are suggestive of having infalling motions in the
H29$\alpha$ emission, which could be indicative of late stage accretion onto the stars despite
the presence of an HII region.
