We present the first maps of NGC 3044 and NGC 4157 at $\lambda\,450 \mu$m and $\lambda\,850 \mu$m
from the JCMT as well as the first maps at 617 MHz from the GMRT. High latitude emission has been detected
in both the radio continuum and sub-mm for NGC 3044 and in the radio continuum for NGC 4157, including
several new features. The dust spectrum at long wavelengths required fitting with a two-temperature
model for both galaxies, implying the presence of cold dust. Dust masses are $M_d\,=\,1.6\,\times\,10^8
M_\odot$ and $M_d\,=\,2.1\,\times\,10^7 M_\odot$ for NGC 3044 and NGC 4157, respectively, and
are dominated by the cold component. There is a clear correlation between the 617 MHz and $\lambda\,850
\mu$m emission in the two galaxies. In the case of NGC 3044, this implies a relation between the non-thermal
synchrotron emission and cold dust. The 617 MHz component represents an integration of massive
star formation over the past $10^{7-8}$ yr and the $\lambda \,850 \mu$m emission represents heating
from the diffuse interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The 617 MHz -- $\lambda\,850 \mu$m correlation
improves when a smoothing kernel is applied to the $\lambda\,850 \mu$m data to account for differences
between the CR electron diffusion scale and the mean free path of an ISRF photon to dust. The best-fit
relation is $L_{617_{\rm MHz}}\,\propto\,{L_{850 \mu{\rm m}}}^{2.1\,\pm\,0.2}$ for NGC 3044.
If variations in the cold dust emissivity are dominated by variations in dust density, and the synchrotron
emission depends on magnetic field strength (a function of gas density) as well as CR electron generation
(a function of massive star formation rate and therefore density via the Schmidt law) then the expected
correlation for NGC 3044 is $L_{617_{\rm MHz}}\,\propto\,{L_{850 \mu{\rm m}}}^{2.2}$, in agreement
with the observed correlation.
