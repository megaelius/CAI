Using an unconventional single line diagnostic that unambiguously identifies AGNs in composite
galaxies we report statistical differences in the properties (stellar age, [OII] luminosity,
colour) between active and inactive galaxies at 0.62<z<1.2 extracted from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic
Redshift Survey (VIPERS). The nuclear activity is probed by the high-ionization [NeV] emission
line and along with their parent samples, the galaxies are properly selected according to their
stellar mass, redshift, and colour distributions. We report younger underlying stellar ages and
higher [OII] luminosities of active galaxies in the green valley and in the blue cloud compared to
control samples. We observe higher fractions of green galaxies hosting AGN activity at progressively
bluer (r-K) colours. Depending on the location of the host galaxy in the NUVrK colour diagram we find
higher AGN fractions in massive blue galaxies and in the least massive red galaxies, in agreement
with the picture that black holes vary their properties when hosted in either star-forming or passive
galaxies. Exactly where the fast quenching processes are expected to play a role, we identify a novel
class of active galaxies in the blue cloud with signatures typical for a suddenly suppression of
their star formation activity after a burst happening in the recent past. Their optical spectra
resemble those of post-starburst galaxies, that would never be identified in a spectroscopic search
using classical selection techniques. Broadly, these active galaxies selected on the [NeV] line
are not commonly represented in shallow X-ray, mid-IR, or classical line diagnostics. If we consider
that our results are limited by the shallow observational limits and rapid AGN variability, the
impact of AGN feedback on galaxy formation and evolution may represent an important channel of fast-transiting
galaxies moving to the red sequence.
