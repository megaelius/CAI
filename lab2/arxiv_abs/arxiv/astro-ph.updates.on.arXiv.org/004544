We present the latest results of our search for planets with HARPS-N at the 3.6 m Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo under the Tracking Advanced Planetary Systems project: an in-depth study of the 15 most
Li abundant giants from the PennState - Toru\'n Planet Search sample. Our goals are first, to obtain
radial velocities of the most Li-rich giants we identified in our sample to search for possible low-mass
substellar companions, and second, to perform an extended spectral analysis to define the evolutionary
status of these stars. Methods. This work is based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope and its High Resolution Spectro- graph, and with the HARPS-N spectrograph
at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. Two stars, HD 181368 and HD 188214 , were also observed with
UVES at the VLT to determine beryllium abundances. We report i) the discovery of two new planetary
systems around the Li-rich giant stars: HD 238914 and TYC 3318-01333- 1 (a binary system); ii) reveal
a binary Li-rich giant, HD 181368 ; iii) although our current phase coverage is not complete, we suggest
the presence of planetary mass companions around TYC 3663-01966-1 and TYC 3105-00152-1 ; iv) we
confirm the previous result for BD+48 740 and present updated orbital parameters, and v) we find
a lack of a relation between the Li enhancement and the Be abundance for the stars HD 181368 and HD 188214
, for which we acquired blue spectra. We found seven stars with stellar or potential planetary companions
among the 15 Li-rich giant stars. The binary star frequency of the Li-rich giants in our sample appears
to be normal, but the planet frequency is twice that of the general sample, which suggests a possible
connection between hosting a companion and enhanced Li abundance in giant stars. We also found most
of the companions orbits to be highly eccentric.
