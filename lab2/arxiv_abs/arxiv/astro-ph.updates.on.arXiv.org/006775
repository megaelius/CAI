Intra-galaxy signals contain a wealth of information on fundamental physics, both the dark sector
and the nature of gravity. While so far largely unexplored, such probes are set to rise dramatically
in importance as upcoming surveys provide data of unprecedented quantity and quality on galaxy
structure and dynamics. In this paper, we use warping of stellar disks to test the chameleon- or symmetron-screened
fifth forces which generically arise when new fields couple to matter. We take r-band images of mostly
late-type galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas and develop an automated algorithm to quantify the
degree of U-shaped warping they exhibit. We then forward-model the warp signal as a function of fifth-force
strength $\Delta G/G_N$ and range $\lambda_C$, and the gravitational environments and internal
properties of the galaxies, including full propagation of the non-Gaussian uncertainties. Convolving
this fifth-force likelihood function with a Gaussian describing astrophysical and observational
noise and then constraining $\Delta G/G_N$ and $\lambda_C$ by Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we find
the overall likelihood to be significant increased ($\Delta\log(\mathcal{L}) \simeq 20$) by
adding a screened fifth force with $\lambda_C \simeq 2$ Mpc, $\Delta G/G_N \simeq 0.01$. The variation
of $\Delta\log(\mathcal{L})$ with $\lambda_C$ is quantitatively as expected from the correlation
of the magnitude of the fifth-force field with the force's range, and a similar model without screening
achieves no increase in likelihood over the General Relativistic case $\Delta G=0$. Although these
results are in good agreement with a previous analysis of the same model using offsets between galaxies'
stellar and gas mass centroids (Desmond et al. 2018), we caution that the effects of confounding
baryonic and dark matter physics must be thoroughly investigated for the results of the inference
to be unambiguous.
