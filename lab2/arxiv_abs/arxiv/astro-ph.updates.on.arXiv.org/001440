We investigate the chemo-kinematic properties of the Milky Way disc by exploring the first year
of data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and compare
our results to smaller optical high-resolution samples in the literature, as well as results from
lower resolution surveys such as GCS, SEGUE and RAVE. We start by selecting a high-quality sample
in terms of chemistry ($\sim$ 20.000 stars) and, after computing distances and orbital parameters
for this sample, we employ a number of useful subsets to formulate constraints on Galactic chemical
and chemodynamical evolution processes in the Solar neighbourhood and beyond (e.g., metallicity
distributions -- MDFs, [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] diagrams, and abundance gradients). Our red giant
sample spans distances as large as 10 kpc from the Sun. We find remarkable agreement between the recently
published local (d $<$ 100 pc) high-resolution high-S/N HARPS sample and our local HQ sample
(d $<$ 1 kpc). The local MDF peaks slightly below solar metallicity, and exhibits an extended
tail towards [Fe/H] $= -$1, whereas a sharper cut-off is seen at larger metallicities. The APOGEE
data also confirm the existence of a gap in the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance diagram. When
expanding our sample to cover three different Galactocentric distance bins, we find the high-[$\alpha$/Fe]
stars to be rare towards the outer zones, as previously suggested in the literature. For the gradients
in [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], measured over a range of 6 $ < $ R $ <$ 11 kpc in Galactocentric distance,
we find a good agreement with the gradients traced by the GCS and RAVE dwarf samples. For stars with
1.5 $<$ z $<$ 3 kpc, we find a positive metallicity gradient and a negative gradient in [$\alpha$/Fe].
