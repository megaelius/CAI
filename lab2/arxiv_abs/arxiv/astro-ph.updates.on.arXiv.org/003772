A large fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), 30-50%, are expected to originate from the
low-mass end of progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}~= 8-12~M_\odot$. However, degeneracy effects
make stellar evolution modelling of such stars challenging, and few predictions for their supernova
light curves and spectra have been presented. Here we calculate synthetic nebular spectra of a 9
$M_\odot$ Fe CCSN model exploded with the neutrino mechanism. The model predicts emission lines
with FWHM$\sim$1000 km/s, including signatures from each deep layer in the metal core. We compare
this model to observations of the three subluminous IIP SNe with published nebular spectra; SN 1997D,
SN 2005cs, and SN 2008bk. The prediction of both line profiles and luminosities are in good agreement
with SN 1997D and SN 2008bk. The close fit of a model with no tuning parameters provides strong evidence
for an association of these objects with low-mass Fe CCSNe. For SN 2005cs, the interpretation is
less clear, as the observational coverage ended before key diagnostic lines from the core had emerged.
We perform a parameterised study of the amount of explosively made stable nickel, and find that none
of these three SNe show the high $^{58}$Ni/$^{56}$Ni ratio predicted by current models of electron
capture SNe (ECSNe) and ECSN-like explosions. Combined with clear detection of lines from O and
He shell material, these SNe rather originate from Fe core progenitors. We argue that the outcome
of self-consistent explosion simulations of low-mass stars, which gives fits to many key observables,
strongly suggests that the class of subluminous Type IIP SNe is the observational counterpart of
the lowest mass CCSNe.
