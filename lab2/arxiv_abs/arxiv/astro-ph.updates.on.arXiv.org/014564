Dust plays a key role during star, disk and planet formation. Yet, its dynamics during the protostellar
collapse remains a poorly investigated field. Recent studies seem to indicate that dust may decouple
efficiently from the gas during these early stages. We aim to understand how much and in which regions
dust grains concentrate during the early phases of the protostellar collapse, and see how it depends
on the properties of the initial cloud and of the solid particles. We use the multiple species dust
dynamics solver of the grid-based code RAMSES to perform various simulations of dusty collapses.
We perform hydrodynamical and MHD simulations where we vary the maximum grain size, the thermal-to-gravitational
energy ratio and the magnetic properties of the cloud. We simulate the simultaneous evolution of
ten neutral dust grains species with grain sizes varying from a few nm to a few hundredth of microns.
We obtain a significant decoupling between the gas and the dust for grains of typical sizes a few 10
microns. This decoupling strongly depends on the thermal-to-gravitational energy ratio, the
grain sizes or the inclusion of a magnetic field. With a semi-analytic model calibrated on our results,
we show that the dust ratio mostly varies exponentially with the initial Stokes number at a rate that
depends on the local cloud properties. We find that larger grains tend to settle and drift efficiently
in the first-core and in the newly formed disk. This can produce dust-to-gas ratios of several times
the initial value. Dust concentrates in high density regions and is depleted in low density regions.
The size at which grains decouple from the gas depends on the initial properties of the clouds. Since
dust can not necessarily be used as a proxy for gas during the collapse, we emphasize on the necessity
of including the treatment of its dynamics in collapse simulations.
