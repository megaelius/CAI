Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars are important to astrophysics because their complex
atmospheres lend themselves perfectly to the investigation of the interplay between such diverse
phenomena as atomic diffusion, magnetic fields, and stellar rotation. The present work is aimed
at identifying new mCP stars using spectra collected by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST). Suitable candidates were selected by searching LAMOST DR4 spectra for the
presence of the characteristic 5200A flux depression. Spectral classification was carried out
with a modified version of the MKCLASS code and the accuracy of the classifications was estimated
by comparison with results from manual classification and the literature. Using parallax data
and photometry from Gaia DR2, we investigated the space distribution of our sample stars and their
properties in the colour-magnitude diagram. Our final sample consists of 1002 mCP stars, most of
which are new discoveries (only 59 previously known). Traditional mCP star peculiarities have
been identified in all but 36 stars, highlighting the efficiency of the code's peculiarity identification
capabilities. The derived temperature and peculiarity types are in agreement with manually derived
classifications and the literature. Our sample stars are between 100 Myr and 1 Gyr old, with the majority
having masses between 2M(Sun) and 3M(Sun). Our results could be considered as strong evidence for
an inhomogeneous age distribution among low-mass (M < 3M(Sun)) mCP stars. We identified several
astrophysically interesting objects: two mCP stars have distances and kinematical properties
in agreement with halo stars; an eclipsing binary system hosting an mCP star component; and an SB2
system likely comprising of an mCP star and a supergiant component.
