We study molecular outflows in a sample of 45 local galaxies, both star forming and AGN, primarily
by using CO data from the ALMA archive and from the literature. For a subsample we also compare the
molecular outflow with the ionized and neutral atomic phases. We infer an empirical analytical
function relating the outflow rate simultaneously to the SFR, $L_{\rm AGN}$, and galaxy stellar
mass; this relation is much tighter than the relations with the individual quantities. The outflow
kinetic power shows a larger scatter than in previous studies, spanning from 0.1 to 5~per cent of
$L_{\rm AGN}$, while the momentum rate ranges from 1 to 30 times $L_{\rm AGN}/c$, indicating that
these outflows can be both energy-driven, but with a broad range of coupling efficiencies with the
ISM, and radiation pressure-driven. For about 10~per cent of the objects the outflow properties
significantly exceed the maximum theoretical values; we interpret these as "fossil outflows"
resulting from activity of a past strong AGN, which has now faded. We estimate that, in the stellar
mass range probed here ($>$ 10$^{10}~\rm M_{\odot}$), less than 5~per cent of the outflowing gas
escapes the galaxy. The molecular gas depletion time associated with the outflow can be as short
as a few million years in powerful AGNs, however the total gas (H$_2$+HI) depletion times are much
longer. Altogether, our findings suggest that even AGN-driven outflows might be relatively ineffective
in clearing galaxies of their entire gas content, although they are likely capable of clearing and
quenching the central region. Finally, we find no correlation between molecular outflow rate and
radio power, suggesting that on average radio jets do not play a major role in driving massive molecular
outflows in the luminosity range (log($L_{\rm AGN}$) = 41-46 erg s$^{-1}$) probed here.
