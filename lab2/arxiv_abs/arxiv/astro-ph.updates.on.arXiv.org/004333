High resolution radio imaging of AGN have revealed that some sources present motion of superluminal
knots and transverse stratification of their jet. Recent observational projects have provided
new observational constraints on the central region of rotating black holes in AGN, suggesting
that there is an inner- or spine-jet surrounded by a disk wind. This relativistic spine-jet is likely
to be composed of electron - positron pairs extracting energy from the black hole. In this article
we present an extension and generalization to relativistic jets in Kerr metric of the meridional
self similar mechanism. We aim at modeling the inner spine-jet of AGN as the relativistic light outflow
emerging from a spherical corona surrounding a Kerr black hole. The model is built by expanding the
metric and the forces with colatitude to first order in the magnetic flux function. Conversely to
previous models, effects of the light cylinder are not neglected. Solutions with high Lorentz factor
are obtained and provide spine-jet models up to the polar axis. As in previous publications, we calculate
the magnetic collimation efficiency parameter, which measures the variation of the available
energy across the field lines. This collimation efficiency is an integral of the model, generalizing
to Kerr metric the classical magnetic rotator efficiency criterion. We study the variation of the
magnetic efficiency and acceleration with the spin of the black hole and show their high sensitivity
to this integral. These new solutions model collimated or radial, relativistic or ultra-relativistic
outflows. We discuss the relevance of our solutions to model the M87 spine-jet. We study the efficiency
of the central black hole spin to collimate a spine-jet and show that the jet power is of the same order
with that determined by numerical simulations.
