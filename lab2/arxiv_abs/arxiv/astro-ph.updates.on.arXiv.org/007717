Detecting the cosmological sky-averaged (global) 21 cm spectrum as a function of observed frequency
will provide a powerful tool to study the ionization and thermal history of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) in the early Universe ($\sim$ 400 million years after the Big Bang). The biggest challenge
in conventional ground-based total-power global 21 cm experiments is the removal of the foreground
synchrotron emission ($\sim 10^3$-$10^4$ K) to uncover the weak cosmological signal (tens to hundreds
of mK) due to corruptions on the spectral smoothness of the foreground spectrum by instrumental
effects. An absorption profile has been reported recently at 78 MHz in the sky-averaged spectrum
by the EDGES experiment. An independent approach is necessary to confirm that this observed feature
is indeed the global 21 cm signal. In this paper, we present a new polarimetry-based observational
approach that relies on the dynamic characteristics of the foreground emission at the circumpolar
region to track and remove the foreground spectrum directly, without relying on generic foreground
models as in conventional approaches. Due to asymmetry and the Earth's rotation, the projection
of the anisotropic foreground sources onto a wide-view antenna pointing at the North Celestial
Pole (NCP) induces a net polarization which varies with time in a unique twice-diurnal periodicity.
Different from the total-power global 21 cm experiments, the Cosmic Twilight Polarimeter (CTP)
is designed to measure and separate the varying foreground from the isotropic cosmological background
simultaneously in the same observation. By combining preliminary results of the prototype instrument
with numerical simulations, we evaluate the practicality and feasibility for implementing this
technique to obtain an independent global 21 cm measurement in the near future using an upgraded
CTP.
