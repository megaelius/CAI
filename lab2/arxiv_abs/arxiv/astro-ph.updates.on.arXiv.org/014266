GW190425 is the newly discovered gravitational wave (GW) source consistent with a neutron star-neutron
star merger with chirp mass of $1.44\pm0.02M_\odot.$ This value falls in the $ambiguous$ interval
as from the GW signal alone we can not rule out the presence of a black hole in the binary. In this case,
the system would host a neutron star and a very light stellar black hole, with mass close to the maximum
value for neutron stars, filling the $mass$ $gap$. No electromagnetic counterpart is firmly associated
with this event, due to the poorly informative sky localisation and larger distance, compared to
GW/GRB170817. We construct here kilonova light curve models for GW190425, for both double neutron
star and black hole-neutron star systems, considering two equations of state consistent with current
constraints from the signals of GW170817/GW190425 and the NICER results, including black hole
spin effects and assuming a new formula for the mass of the ejecta. The putative presence of a light
black hole in GW190425 would have produced a brighter kilonova emission compared to the double neutron
star case, letting us to distinguish the nature of the companion to the neutron star. Concerning
candidate counterparts of GW190425, classified later on as supernovae, our models could have discarded
two transients detected in their early $r$-band evolution. Combining the chirp mass and luminosity
distance information from the GW signal with a library of kilonova light curves helps identifying
the electromagnetic counterpart early on. We remark that the release in low latency of the chirp
mass in this interval of $ambiguous$ values appears to be vital for successful electromagnetic
follow-ups.
