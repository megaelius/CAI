We present a radiative transfer analysis of latitudinally resolved H (1.487-1.783 micron) and
K (2.028-2.364 micron) band spectra of Uranus, from which we infer the distributions of aerosols
and methane in the planet's atmosphere. Data were acquired in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2007 using
the 200-inch (5.1 m) Hale Telescope and the Palomar High Angular Resolution Observer (PHARO) near-infrared
adaptive optics (AO) camera system (Hayward, 2001). Observations sample a range of latitudes between
80-deg S and 60-deg N on the Uranian disk. At each latitude, a vertical distributions of aerosols
was retrieved using a custom non-linear constrained retrieval algorithm. Two layers of aerosols
are needed to match the observations: a thin upper layer peaking just below the 100-mb tropopause
and a lower clouds at ~1.9 bars. Latitudinal variations in aerosols are interpreted in context of
notional circulation models, while temporal changes suggest potential seasonal effects. We infer
significant reduction in aerosol scattering optical thickness in southern latitudes between
2001 and 2007, in agreement with trends reported in studies covering part of the same period using
different data and retrieval algorithms (e.g., Irwin et al., 2009, 2010, 2012; Sromovsky et al.,
2009). Best fits to the data are consistent with proposed models of polar depletion of methane (e.g.,
Karkoschka and Tomasko, 2011). Finally, a discrete cloud from 2007 is analyzed in context of simple
parcel theory, with the goal of identifying likely formation mechanisms. The low scattering optical
thicknesses of the discrete high cloud are consistent with formation associated with vortices
and shallow lift rather than deep convection.
