The origin of polarized emission from protoplanetary disks is uncertain. Three mechanisms have
been proposed for such polarized emission: grain alignment with magnetic fields, grain alignment
with radiation gradients, and self-scattering of thermal dust emission. Aiming to observationally
identify the polarization mechanisms, we present ALMA polarization observations of the 0.87 mm
dust continuum emission toward the circumstellar disk around HD 142527 with high spatial resolution.
We confirm that the polarization vectors in the northern region are consistent with self-scattering.
Furthermore, we show that the polarization vectors in the southern region are consistent with grain
alignment by magnetic fields, although self-scattering cannot be ruled out. To understand the
differences between the polarization mechanisms, we propose a simple grain size segregation model:
small dust grains ($\lesssim$ 100 microns) are dominant and aligned with magnetic fields in the
southern region, and middle-sized ($\sim100$ microns) grains in the upper layer emit self-scattered
polarized emission in the northern region. The grain size near the middle plane in the northern region
cannot be measured because the emission at 0.87 mm is optically thick. However, it can be speculated
that larger dust grains ($\gtrsim$ cm) may accumulate near this plane. These results are consistent
with those of a previous analysis of the disk, in which large grain accumulation and optically thick
emission from the northern region were found. This model is also consistent with theories where
smaller dust grains are aligned with magnetic fields. The magnetic fields are toroidal, at least
in the southern region.
