Spectropolarimetry is a powerful technique for investigating the physical properties of gas and
solid materials in cometary comae without mutual contamination, but there have been few spectropolarimetric
studies to extract each component. We attempt to derive the continuum polarization degree of comet
2P/Encke, free from influence of molecular emissions. The target is unique in that it has an orbit
dynamically decoupled from Jupiter like main-belt asteroids, while ejecting gas and dust like
ordinary comets. We observed the comet using the Higashi-Hiroshima Optical and Near-Infrared
Camera attached to the Cassegrain focus of the 150-cm Kanata telescope on UT 2017 February 21 when
the comet was at the solar phase angle of 75.7 deg. We find that the continuum polarization degree
with respect to the scattering plane is 33.8+/-2.7 % at the effective wavelength of 0.815 um, which
is significantly higher than those of cometary dust in a high-Pmax group at similar phase angles.
Assuming that an ensemble polarimetric response of 2P/Encke's dust as a function of phase angle
is morphologically similar with those of other comets, its maximum polarization degree is estimated
to > 40 % at the phase angle of ~100 deg. In addition, we obtain the polarization degrees of the C2 swan
bands (0.51-0.56 um), the NH2 alpha bands (0.62-0.69 um) and the CN-red system (0.78-0.94 um) in
a range of 3-19 %, which depend on the molecular species and rotational quantum numbers of each branch.
The polarization vector aligns nearly perpendicularly to the scattering plane with the average
of 0.4 deg over a wavelength range of 0.50-0.97 um. From the observational evidence, we conjecture
that the large polarization degree of 2P/Encke would be attributable to a dominance of large dust
particles around the nucleus, which have remained after frequent perihelion passages near the
Sun.
