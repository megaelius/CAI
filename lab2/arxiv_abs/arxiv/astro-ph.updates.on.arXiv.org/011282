We explore deep rest-frame UV to FIR data in the COSMOS field to measure the individual spectral energy
distributions (SED) of the ~4000 SC4K (Sobral et al. 2018) Lyman-alpha (Lya) emitters (LAEs) at
z~2-6. We find typical stellar masses of 10$^{9.3\pm0.6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and star formation rates
(SFR) of SFR$_{SED}=4.5^{+8.8}_{-2.5}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr and SFR$_{Lya}=5.9^{+6.3}_{-2.6}$
M$_{\odot}$/yr, combined with very blue UV slopes of beta=-2.0$^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$, but with significant
variations within the population. M$_{UV}$ and beta are correlated in a similar way to UV-selected
sources, but LAEs are consistently bluer. This suggests that LAEs are the youngest and/or most dust-poor
subset of the UV-selected population. We also study the Lya rest-frame equivalent width (EW$_0$)
and find 45 "extreme" LAEs with EW$_0>240$ A (3 $\sigma$), implying a low number density of $(7\pm1)\times10^{-7}$
Mpc$^{-3}$. Overall, we measure little to no evolution of the Lya EW$_0$ and scale length parameter
($w_0$) which are consistently high (EW$_0=140^{+280}_{-70}$ A, $w_0=129^{+11}_{-11}$ A) from
z~6 to z~2 and below. However, $w_0$ is anti-correlated with M$_{UV}$ and stellar mass. Our results
imply that sources selected as LAEs have a high Lya escape fraction (f$_{esc, Lya}$) irrespective
of cosmic time, but f$_{esc, Lya}$ is still higher for UV-fainter and lower mass LAEs. The least massive
LAEs ($<10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) are typically located above the star formation "Main Sequence"
(MS), but the offset from the MS decreases towards z~6 and towards $10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. Our results
imply a lack of evolution in the properties of LAEs across time and reveals the increasing overlap
in properties of LAEs and UV-continuum selected galaxies as typical star-forming galaxies at high
redshift effectively become LAEs.
