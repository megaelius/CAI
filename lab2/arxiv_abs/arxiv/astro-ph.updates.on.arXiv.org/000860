We suggest a direct link between the two "missing" baryon problems of contemporary galaxy formation
theory: (1) that large galaxies are known to contain too little gas and stars and (2) that too few dwarf
satellite galaxies are observed around large galaxies compared with cosmological simulations.
The former can be explained by invoking some energetic process -- most likely AGN or star formation
feedback -- which expels to infinity a significant fraction of the gas initially present in the proto-galaxy,
while the latter problem is usually explained by star formation feedback inside the dwarf or tidal
and ram pressure stripping of the gas from the satellite galaxy by its parent. Here we point out that
the host galaxy "missing" baryons, if indeed ejected at velocities of hundreds to a thousand km s$^{-1}$,
must also affect smaller satellite galaxies by stripping or shocking the gas there. We estimate
the fraction of gas removed from the satellites as a function of the satellite galaxy's properties.
Applying these results to a Milky Way like dark matter halo, we find that this singular shock ram pressure
stripping event may be quite efficient in removing the gas from the satellites provided that they
are close enough. We also use the orbital and mass modelling data for eight Galactic dwarf spheroidal
(dSph) satellites, and find that it is likely that many of them have been affected by the Galactic
outflow. We point out that galactic outflows of the host may also trigger a starburst in the satellite
galaxies by over-pressuring their gas discs. This process may be responsible for the formation
of the globular clusters observed in some of the Milky Way's dSphs (e.g. the Fornax and Sagittarius
dSphs).
