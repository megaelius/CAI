Searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) using terrestrial detectors
typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs of detectors. The sensitivity of such cross-correlation
analyses depends, among other things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller
the separation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is more sensitive
to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located detector pair. However, co-located
detectors are also expected to suffer from correlated noise from instrumental and environmental
effects that could contaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and
mitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential increase in sensitivity
of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first SGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors
and address the complications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated
noise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO Hanford detectors,
H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run. At low frequencies, 40 - 460 Hz, we are unable to sufficiently
mitigate the correlated noise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochastic
gravitational-wave signal. However, at high frequencies, 460-1000 Hz, these techniques are sufficient
to set a $95\%$ confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on the gravitational-wave energy density of
\Omega(f)<7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 Hz)^3, which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor
of $\sim 180$. In doing so, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches using
advanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields) may affect even
widely separated detectors.
