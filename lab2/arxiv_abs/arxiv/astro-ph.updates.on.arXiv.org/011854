Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief flashes of gamma rays, considered to be the most energetic explosive
phenomena in the Universe. The emission from GRBs comprises a short (typically tens of seconds)
and bright prompt emission, followed by a much longer afterglow phase. During the afterglow phase,
the shocked outflow -- produced by the interaction between the ejected matter and the circumburst
medium -- slows down, and a gradual decrease in brightness is observed. GRBs typically emit most
of their energy via gamma-rays with energies in the kiloelectronvolt-to-megaelectronvolt range,
but a few photons with energies of tens of gigaelectronvolts have been detected by space-based instruments.
However, the origins of such high-energy (above one gigaelectronvolt) photons and the presence
of very-high-energy (more than 100 gigaelectronvolts) emission have remained elussive. Here
we report observations of very-high-energy emission in the bright GRB 180720B deep in the GRB afterglow
-ten hours after the end of the prompt emission phase, when the X-ray flux had already decayed by four
orders of magnitude. Two possible explanations exist for the observed radiation: inverse Compton
emission and synchrotron emission of ultrarelativistic electrons. Our observations show that
the energy fluxes in the X-ray and gamma-ray range and their photon indices remain comparable to
each other throughout the afterglow. This discovery places distinct constraints on the GRB environment
for both emission mechanisms, with the inverse Compton explanation alleviating the particle energy
requirements for the emission observed at late times. The late timing of this detection has consequences
for the future observations of GRBs at the highest energies.
