It is common practice nowadays to derive spins and 3D shapes of asteroids from the inversion of photometric
light curves. However, this method requires a good number of photometric points and dedicated observing
sessions. On the other hand, the photometric observations carried out by the Gaia mission will be
sparse and their number relatively small. For this reason, a multi-parametric shape described
by a large number of elementary facets cannot probably be derived from Gaia data alone. Therefore,
the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), implemented a simpler solution as an unattended
data reduction pipeline which relies on three axial ellipsoids for the shape representation. However,
overall accuracy of such triaxial shape solutions has to be assessed. How adequate is an ellipsoidal
approximation to represent the overall properties of an irregular body? Which error is made on the
volume in comparison a more accurate model with irregular shape? To answer these questions, we have
implemented numerical procedures for comparing ellipsoids to more complex and irregular shapes,
and we performed a full simulation of the photometric signal from these objects, using both shape
representations. Implementing the same software algorithm that will be used for the analysis of
Gaia asteroid photometry, rotation period, spin axis orientation and ellipsoidal shape were derived
from simulated observations of selected Main Belt asteroids assuming a geometric scattering model
(work is in progress for more complex scattering models). We found that the ellipsoids by photometry
inversion are closely similar to the best-fitting ellipsoids of the simulated complex shapes and
that the error on the asteroid volume (relative to a complex shape) is generally low, usually around
$10\%$.
