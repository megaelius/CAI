We describe a new method for simulating ionizing radiation and supernova feedback in the analogues
of low-redshift galactic disks. In this method, which we call star-forming molecular cloud (SFMC)
particles, we use a ray-tracing technique to solve the radiative transfer equation for ultraviolet
photons emitted by thousands of distinct particles on the fly. Joined with high numerical resolution
of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedback helps to self-regulate star formation.
This new feedback scheme also enables us to study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming
clumps and from a galaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. By
simulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find that the average escape fraction from
all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding the central 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08%
and 5.9% during a ~20 Myr period with a mean value of 1.1%. The flux of escaped photons from these sources
is not strongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degree from the galactic
pole. Further, we investigate the escape fraction per SFMC particle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves
as the particle ages. We discover that the average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number
of SFMC particles with high f_esc(i). On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC particle rises
from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle lifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles
drift away from the dense gas clumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming
clumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback. The framework established in
this study brings deeper insight into the physics of photon escape fraction from an individual star-forming
clump, and from a galactic disk.
