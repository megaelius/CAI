We derive two-dimensional dust attenuation maps at $\sim1~\mathrm{kpc}$ resolution from the
UV continuum for ten galaxies on the $z\sim2$ Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS). Comparison with
IR data shows that 9 out of 10 galaxies do not require further obscuration in addition to the UV-based
correction, though our sample does not include the most heavily obscured, massive galaxies. The
individual rest-frame $V$-band dust attenuation (A$_{\rm V}$) radial profiles scatter around
an average profile that gently decreases from $\sim1.8$ mag in the center down to $\sim0.6$ mag at
$\sim3-4$ half-mass radii. We use these maps to correct UV- and H$\alpha$-based star-formation
rates (SFRs), which agree with each other. At masses $<10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$, the dust-corrected
specific SFR (sSFR) profiles are on average radially constant at a mass-doubling timescale of $\sim300~\mathrm{Myr}$,
pointing at a synchronous growth of bulge and disk components. At masses $>10^{11}~M_{\rm sun}$,
the sSFR profiles are typically centrally-suppressed by a factor of $\sim10$ relative to the galaxy
outskirts. With total central obscuration disfavored, this indicates that at least a fraction
of massive $z\sim2$ SFMS galaxies have started inside-out their star-formation quenching that
will move them to the quenched sequence. In combination with other observations, galaxies above
and below the ridge of the SFMS relation have respectively centrally-enhanced and centrally-suppressed
sSFRs relative to their outskirts, supporting a picture where bulges are built due to gas `compaction'
that leads to a high central SFR as galaxies move towards the upper envelope of SFMS.
