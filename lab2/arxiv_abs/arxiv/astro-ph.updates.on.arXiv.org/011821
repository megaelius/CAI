We conduct a thorough investigation into the possibility that residing in an overdense region of
the Universe may induce bias in measurements of the large-scale structure. We compute the conditional
correlation function and angular power spectrum of density and lensing fluctuations while holding
the local spherically-averaged density fixed and show that for Gaussian fields this has no effect
on the angular power at $l>0$. We identify a range of scales where a perturbative approach allows
analytic progress to be made, and we compute leading-order conditional power spectra using an Edgeworth
expansion and second-order perturbation theory. We find no evidence for any significant bias to
cosmological power spectra from our local density contrast. We show that when smoothed over a large
region around the observer, conditioning on the local density typically affects density power
spectra by less than a percent at cosmological distances, below cosmic variance. We find that while
typical corrections to the lensing angular power spectrum can be at the 10% level on the largest angular
scales and for source redshifts $z_s \lesssim 0.1$, for the typical redshifts targeted by upcoming
wide imaging surveys the corrections are sub-percent and negligible, in contrast to previous claims
in the literature. Using an estimate of the local spherically-averaged density from a composite
galaxy redshift catalogue we find that the corrections from conditioning on our own local density
are below cosmic variance and subdominant to other non-linear effects. We discuss the potential
implications of our results for cosmology and point out that a measurement of the local density contrast
may be used as a consistency test of cosmological models.
