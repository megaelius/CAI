We re-analyze correlations between global molecular gas depletion time (Tdep) and galaxy parameters
including stellar mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR), stellar mass surface density and
concentration index. The analysis is based on the COLD GASS survey, which includes galaxies with
stellar mass in the range 10^10 - 10^11.5 Msun with molecular gas mass estimates derived from CO(1-0)
line measurements. We improve on previous work by Saintonge et al. (2011b) by estimating SFRs using
the combination of GALEX FUV and WISE 22 micron data and by deriving Tdep within a fixed aperture set
by the IRAM beam size. In our new study we find correlations with much smaller scatter. Dependences
of the Tdep on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surface density and concentration
index are now weak or absent. Differences with previous work arise because dust extinction correlates
strongly with galaxy structural parameters. We further demonstrate that the 'primary' global
parameter correlation is between Tdep and sSFR; all other remaining correlations can be shown to
be induced by this primary dependence. This implies that galaxies with high current-to-past-averaged
star formation activity, will drain their molecular gas reservoir sooner. We then analyze molecular
gas depletion times on 1-kpc scales in galactic disks using data from the HERACLES survey. There
is remarkably good agreement between the global Tdep versus sSFR relation for the COLD GASS galaxies
and that derived for 1 kpc scale grid regions in disks. The strong correlation between Tdep and sSFR
extends continuously over a factor of 10 in Tdep from log(SFR/M*) = -11.5 to -9, i.e. from nearly quiescent
patches of the disk to disk regions with very strong star formation. This leads to the conclusion
that the local molecular gas depletion time in galactic disks is dependent on the local fraction
of young-to-old stars.
