The current generation of (sub)mm-telescopes has allowed molecular line emission to become a major
tool for studying the physical, kinematic, and chemical properties of extragalactic systems,
yet exploiting these observations requires a detailed understanding of where emission lines originate
within the Milky Way. In this paper, we present 60$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$3pc) resolution observations
of many 3mm-band molecular lines across a large map of the W49 massive star-forming region ($\sim$100$\times$100pc
at 11kpc), which were taken as part of the "LEGO" IRAM-30m large project. We find that the spatial
extent or brightness of the molecular line transitions are not well correlated with their critical
densities, highlighting abundance and optical depth must be considered when estimating line emission
characteristics. We explore how the total emission and emission efficiency (i.e. line brightness
per H$_{2}$ column density) of the line emission vary as a function of molecular hydrogen column
density and dust temperature. We find that there is not a single region of this parameter space responsible
for the brightest and most efficiently emitting gas for all species. For example, we find that the
HCN transition shows high emission efficiency at high column density ($10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$) and
moderate temperatures (35K), whilst e.g. N$_2$H$^+$ emits most efficiently towards lower temperatures
($10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$; <20K). We determine $X_{\mathrm{CO} (1-0)} \sim 0.3 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-2}(Kkms^{-1})^{-1}}$,
and $\alpha_{\mathrm{HCN} (1-0)} \sim 30\mathrm{M_\odot(Kkms^{-1}pc^2)^{-1}}$, which both
differ significantly from the commonly adopted values. In all, these results suggest caution should
be taken when interpreting molecular line emission.
