We describe a method to extract resonant orbits from N-body simulations exploiting the fact that
they close in a frame rotating with a constant pattern speed. Our method is applied to the N-body simulation
of the Milky Way by Shen et al. (2010). This simulation hosts a massive bar, which drives strong resonances
and persistent angular momentum exchange. Resonant orbits are found throughout the disc, both
close to the bar itself and out to the very edges of the disc. Using Fourier spectrograms, we demonstrate
that the bar is driving kinematic substructure even in the very outer parts of the disc. We identify
two major orbit families in the outskirts of the disc that make significant contributions to the
kinematic landscape, namely the m:l = 3:-2 and 1:-1 families resonating with the pattern speed of
the bar. A mechanism is described that produces bimodal distributions of Galactocentric radial
velocities at selected azimuths in the outer disc. It occurs as a result of the temporal coherence
of particles on the 3:-2 resonant orbits, which causes them to arrive simultaneously at pericentre
or apocentre. This resonant clumping, due to the in-phase motion of the particles through their
epicycle, leads to both inward and outward moving groups which belong to the same orbital family
and consequently produce bimodal radial velocity distributions. This is a possible explanation
of the bimodal velocity distributions observed towards the Galactic anti-Centre by Liu et al. (2012).
Another consequence is that transient overdensities appear and dissipate (in a symmetric fashion)
on timescales equal to the their epicyclic period resulting in a periodic pulsing of the disc's surface
density.
