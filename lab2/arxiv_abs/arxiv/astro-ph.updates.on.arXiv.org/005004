The neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 was followed over several days by optical-wavelength ("blue")
kilonova (KN) emission likely powered by the radioactive decay of light r-process nuclei synthesized
by ejecta with a low neutron abundance (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.25-0.35). While the composition
and high velocities of the blue KN ejecta are consistent with shock-heated dynamical material,
the large quantity is in tension with the results of numerical simulations. We propose an alternative
ejecta source: the neutrino-heated, magnetically-accelerated wind from the strongly-magnetized
hypermassive NS (HMNS) remnant. A rapidly-spinning HMNS with an ordered surface magnetic field
of strength B ~ 1-3e14 G and lifetime t_rem ~ 0.1-1 s can simultaneously explain the velocity, total
mass, and electron fraction of the blue KN ejecta. The inferred HMNS lifetime is close to its Alfven
crossing time, suggesting global magnetic torques could be responsible for bringing the HMNS into
solid body rotation and instigating its gravitational collapse. Different origins for the KN ejecta
may be distinguished by their predictions for the emission in the first hours after the merger, when
the luminosity is enhanced by heating from internal shocks; the latter are likely generic to any
temporally-extended ejecta source (e.g. magnetar or accretion disk wind) and are not unique to
the emergence of a relativistic jet. The same shocks could mix and homogenizes the composition to
a low but non-zero lanthanide mass fraction, X_La ~ 1e-3, as advocated by some authors, but only if
the mixing occurs after neutrons are consumed in the r-process on a timescale >~ 1 s.
