We analyze the influence of higher curvature effects on stellar structure and conclude from empirical
results that such effects may significantly change our interpretation of observational data gathered
from experiments. A model of a superdense star with strange star equation of state is constructed
within the framework of the Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet theory. Under these assumptions large classes
of solutions are admitted by the field equations. We isolate a particular class with the ansatz of
the Vaidya--Tikekar superdense star spatial gravitational potential. The model is found to satisfy
elementary requirements for physical applicability and displays surface redshift ranges comporting
to neutron stars in the general relativity limit. In particular, we obtain a pressure profile that
is positive definite within a finite radius occurring at a hypersurface of vanishing pressure.
Within the radius, the density profile, sound--speed and energy conditions are all well behaved.
The surface gravitational redshift function is consistent with the expectation for strange stars.
Moreover, the adiabatic stability criterion of Chandrasekhar is satisfied as is the positivity
of the difference between the sound speeds squared in the radial and transverse directions. A pleasing
equation of state curve is evident for a particular choice of parameters. The mass profile and consequently
the compactification index are all found to be reasonable. The parameter values chosen are consistent
with observed star models. A significant effect of the higher curvature terms is to reduce the speed
of sound and to drastically reduce the values of the surface gravitational redshift compared to
the Einstein counterpart. These latter results have implications for observations in relativistic
astrophysics which are often made against the background of the standard general theory of relativity.
