One of the most interesting astronomical objects is the Galactic Center. We concentrate our discussion
on a theoretical analysis of observational data of bright stars in the IR-band obtained with large
telescopes. We also discuss the importance of VLBI observations of bright structures which could
characterize the shadow at the Galactic Center. There are attempts to describe the Galactic Center
with alternative theories of gravity and in this case one can constrain parameters of such theories
with observational data for the Galactic Center. In particular, theories of massive gravity are
intensively developing and theorists have overcome pathologies presented in initial versions
of these theories. In theories of massive gravity, a graviton is massive in contrast with GR where
a graviton is massless. Now these theories are considered as an alternative to GR. For example, the
LIGO-Virgo collaboration obtained the graviton mass constraint of about $1.2 \times 10^{-22}$
eV in their first publication about the discovery of the first gravitational wave detection event
that resulted of the merger of two massive black holes. Surprisingly, one could obtain a consistent
and comparable constraint of graviton mass at a level around $m_{g} < 2.9 \times 10^{-21}$ eV from
analysis of observational data on the trajectory of the star S2 near the Galactic Center. Therefore,
observations of bright stars with existing and forthcoming telescopes such as the European Extremely
Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) are extremely useful for investigating
the structure of the Galactic Center in the framework of GR, but these observations also give a tool
to confirm, rule out or constrain alternative theories of gravity.
