This paper presents one analytical tidal theory for a viscoelastic multi-layered body with an arbitrary
number of homogeneous layers. Starting with the static equilibrium figure, modified to include
tide and differential rotation, and using the Newtonian creep approach, we find the dynamical equilibrium
figure of the deformed body, which allows us to calculate the tidal potential and the forces acting
on the tide generating body, as well as the rotation and orbital elements variations. In the particular
case of the two-layer model, we study the tidal synchronization when the gravitational coupling
and the friction in the interface between the layers is added. For high relaxation factors (low viscosity),
the stationary solution of each layer is synchronous with the orbital mean motion (n) when the orbit
is circular, but the spin rates increase if the orbital eccentricity increases. For low relaxation
factors (high viscosity), as in planetary satellites, if friction remains low, each layer can be
trapped in different spin-orbit resonances with frequencies n/2,n,3n/2,... . We apply the theory
to Titan. The main results are: i) the rotational constraint does not allow us confirm or reject the
existence of a subsurface ocean in Titan; and ii) the crust-atmosphere exchange of angular momentum
can be neglected. Using the rotation estimate based on Cassini's observation, we limit the possible
value of the shell relaxation factor, when a subsurface ocean is assumed, to 10^-9 Hz, which correspond
to a shell's viscosity 10^18 Pa s, depending on the ocean's thickness and viscosity values. In the
case in which the ocean does not exist, the maximum shell relaxation factor is one order of magnitude
smaller and the corresponding minimum shell's viscosity is one order higher.
