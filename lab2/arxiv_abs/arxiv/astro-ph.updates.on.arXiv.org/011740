The total luminosity of satellite galaxies around a central galaxy, L$_{sat}$, is a powerful metric
for probing dark matter halos. In this paper we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI
Legacy Imaging Surveys to explore the relationship between L$_{sat}$ and various observable galaxy
properties for a sample of 117,966 central galaxies out to $z = 0.15$. At fixed stellar mass, every
galaxy property we explore shows a correlation with L$_{sat}$. This implies that dark matter halos
play a possibly significant role in determining these secondary galaxy properties. We quantify
these correlations by computing the mutual information between L$_{sat}$ and secondary properties
and explore how this mutual information varies as a function of stellar mass and when separating
the sample into star-forming and quiescent central galaxies. We find that absolute r-band magnitude
correlates more strongly with L$_{sat}$ than stellar mass across all galaxy populations; and that
effective radius, velocity dispersion, and S\'ersic index do so as well for star-forming and quiescent
galaxies. L$_{sat}$ is sensitive to both the mass of the host halo as well as the halo formation history,
with younger halos having higher L$_{sat}$. L$_{sat}$ by itself cannot distinguish between these
two effects, but measurements of galaxy large-scale environment can break this degeneracy. For
star-forming central galaxies, we find that r$_{\rm eff}$, $\sigma_v$, and S\'ersic index all
correlate with large-scale density, implying that these halo age plays a role in determining these
properties. For quiescent galaxies, we find that all secondary properties are independent of environment,
implying that correlations with L$_{sat}$ are driven only by halo mass. These results are a significant
step forward in quantifying the full extent of the galaxy-halo connection, and present a new test
of galaxy formation models.
