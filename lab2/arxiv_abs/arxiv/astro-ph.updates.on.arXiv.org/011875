One of the main goals of Cosmology is to search for the imprint of primordial gravitational waves
in the CMB polarisation field, to probe inflationary theories. One of the obstacles toward the detection
of the primordial signal is to extract the B-mode polarisation from astrophysical contaminations.
We present a complete analysis of extragalactic foreground contamination due to polarised emission
of radio and dusty star-forming galaxies. We update or use up-to-date models that are validated
using the most recent measurements. We predict the flux limit (confusion noise) for the future CMB
space or balloon experiments (IDS, PIPER, SPIDER, LiteBIRD, PICO), as well as ground-based experiments
(C-BASS, NEXT-BASS, QUIJOTE, AdvACTPOL, BICEP3+Keck, BICEPArray, CLASS, SO, SPT3G, S4). Telescope
aperture size (and frequency) is the main characteristic impacting the level of confusion noise.
Using the flux limits and assuming constant polarisation fractions for radio and dusty galaxies,
we compute the B-mode power spectra of the three extragalactic foregrounds (radio source shot noise,
dusty galaxy shot noise and clustering), discuss their relative levels and compare their amplitudes
to that of the primordial tensor modes parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. At the reionization
bump (l=5), contamination by extragalactic foregrounds is negligible. At the recombination peak
(l=80), while the contamination is much lower than the targeted sensitivity on r for large-aperture
telescopes, it is at comparable level for some of the medium- and small-aperture telescope experiments.
For example, the contamination is at the level of the 68 per cent confidence level uncertainty on
the primordial r for the LiteBIRD and PICO space experiments. Finally we also provide some useful
unit conversion factors and give some predictions for the SPICA B-BOP experiment. Abridged
