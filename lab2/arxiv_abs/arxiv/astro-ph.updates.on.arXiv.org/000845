GRB 090510, observed both by Fermi and AGILE satellites, is the first bright short-hard Gamma-Ray
Burst (GRB) with an emission from the keV up to the GeV energy range. Within the Fireshell model, we
interpret the faint precursor in the light curve as the emission at the transparency of the expanding
e+e- plasma: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB). From the observed isotropic energy we assume a total energy
Ee+e-=(1.10+-0.06)*10^53 erg and derive a Baryon load B=(1.45+-0.28)*10^(-3) and a Lorentz factor
at transparency Gamma=(6.7+-1.6)*10^2. The main emission 0.4 s after the initial spike is interpreted
as the extended afterglow, due to the interaction of the ultrarelativistic baryons with the CircumBurst
Medium (CBM). Using the condition of fully radiative regime, we infer a CBM average spherically
symmetric density of nCBM=(1.85+-0.14)10^3 cm^(-3), one of the highest found in the Fireshell
model. The value of the filling factor, 1.5*10^(-10)<R<3.8*10^(-8), leads to the estimate
of filaments with densities nfil=nCBM/R=(10^6 - 10^14) cm^(-3). The sub-MeV and the MeV emissions
are well reproduced. When compared to the canonical GRBs with nCBM=1 cm^(-3) and to the disguised
short GRBs with nCBM=10^(-3) cm^(-3), the case of GRB 090510 leads to the existence of a new family
of bursts exploding in an over-dense galactic region with hn nCBM=10^3 cm^(-3). The joint effect
of the high Lorentz factor and the high density compresses in time and "inflates" in intensity the
extended afterglow, making it appear as a short burst, which we here define as "disguised short GRB
by excess". The determination of the above parameters values may represent an important step towards
the explanation of the GeV emission.
