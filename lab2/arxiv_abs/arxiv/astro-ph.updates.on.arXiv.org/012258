The supergiant ionized shell SMC-SGS 1 (DEM 167), located in the outer Wing of the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC), resembles structures that originate from an energetic star-formation event and later
stimulate star formation as they expand into the ambient medium. However, stellar populations
within and surrounding SMC-SGS 1 tell a different story. We present a photometric study of the stellar
population encompassed by SMC-SGS 1 in order to trace the history of this structure and its potential
influence on star formation within the low-density, low-metallicity SMC Wing. For a stellar population
that is physically associated with SMC-SGS 1, we combined near-ultraviolet (NUV) photometry from
the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) with archival optical (V-band) photometry from the ESO Danish
1.54m Telescope. Given their colors and luminosities, we estimated stellar ages and masses by matching
observed photometry to theoretical stellar isochrone models. We find that the investigated region
supports an active, extended star-formation event spanning $\sim$ 25 - 40 Myr ago, as well as continued
star formation into the present. Using a standard initial mass function (IMF), we infer a lower bound
on the stellar mass from this period of $\sim 3 \times 10^4 M_{\odot}$, corresponding to a star-formation
intensity of $\sim$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$. The spatial and temporal
distributions of young stars encompassed by SMC-SGS 1 imply a slow, consistent progression of star
formation over millions of years. Ongoing star formation along the edge of and interior to SMC-SGS
1 suggests a combined stimulated and stochastic mode of star formation within the SMC Wing. A slow
expansion of the shell within this low-density environment may preserve molecular clouds within
the volume of the shell, leaving them to form stars even after nearby stellar feedback expels local
gas and dust.
