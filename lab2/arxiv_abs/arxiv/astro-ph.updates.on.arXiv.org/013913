Several semi-analytic models (SAMs) try to explain how galaxies form, evolve and interact inside
the dark matter large-scale structure. These SAMs can be tested by comparing their predictions
for galaxy-galaxy-galaxy-lensing (G3L), which is weak gravitational lensing around galaxy pairs,
with observations. We evaluate the SAMs by Henriques et al. (2015; H15) and by Lagos et al. (2012;
L12), implemented in the Millennium Run, by comparing their predictions for G3L to observations
at smaller scales than previous studies and also for pairs of lens galaxies from different populations.
We compare the G3L signal predicted by the SAMs to measurements in the overlap of the Galaxy And Mass
Assembly survey (GAMA), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy
survey (VIKING), splitting lens galaxies into two colour and five stellar-mass samples. Using
an improved G3L estimator, we measure the three-point correlation of the matter distribution for
mixed lens pairs with galaxies from different samples, and unmixed lens pairs with galaxies from
the same sample. Predictions by the H15 SAM agree with the observations for all colour-selected
and all but one stellar-mass-selected sample with 95% confidence. Deviations occur for lenses
with stellar masses below $9.5h^{-2}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at scales below $0.2h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$.
Predictions by the L12 SAM for stellar-mass selected samples and red galaxies are significantly
higher than observed, while the predicted signal for blue galaxy pairs is too low. The L12 SAM predicts
more pairs of small stellar-mass and red galaxies than the H15 SAM and the observations, as well as
fewer pairs of blue galaxies. Likely explanations are different treatments of environmental effects
by the SAMs and different models of the initial mass function. We conclude that G3L provides a stringent
test for models of galaxy formation and evolution.
