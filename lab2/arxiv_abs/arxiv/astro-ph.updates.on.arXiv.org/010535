The three-dimensional (3-D) shape of a galaxy inevitably is tied to how it has formed and evolved
and to its dark matter halo. Local extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs; defined as having an average
gas-phase metallicity < 0.1 solar) are important objects for understanding galaxy evolution largely
because they appear to be caught in the act of accreting gas from the cosmic web, and their 3-D shape
may reflect this. Here we report on the 3-D shape of XMPs as inferred from their observed projected
minor-to-major axial ratios using a hierarchical Bayesian inference model, which determines
the likely shape and orientation of each galaxy while simultaneously inferring the average shape
and dispersion. We selected a sample of 149 XMPs and divided it into three sub-samples according
to physical size and found that (1) the stellar component of XMPs of all sizes tends to be triaxial,
with an intermediate axis approx 0.7 times the longest axis and that (2) smaller XMPs tend to be relatively
thicker, with the shortest axis going from approx 0.15 times the longest axis for the large galaxies
to approx 0.4 for the small galaxies. We provide the inferred 3-D shape and inclination of the individual
XMPs in electronic format. We show that our results for the intermediate axis are not clouded by a
selection effect against face-on XMPs. We discuss how an intermediate axis significantly smaller
than the longest axis may be produced by several mechanisms, including lopsided gas accretion,
non-axisymmetric star formation, or coupling with an elongated dark matter halo. Large relative
thickness may reflect slow rotation, stellar feedback, or recent gas accretion.
