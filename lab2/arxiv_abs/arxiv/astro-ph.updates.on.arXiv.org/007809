The filamentary infrared dark cloud L1287 is actively forming a dense cluster of low-mass YSOs at
its inner $\sim$0.1 pc region. To help understand the origin of this low-mass YSO cluster, the present
work aims at resolving the gas structures and kinematics. We have performed $\sim$1$"$ angular
resolution ($\sim$930 AU) SMA observations at $\sim$1.3 mm. From a $\sim$2$"$ resolution 1.3 mm
continuum image we identified six dense cores, namely SMA1-6 with masses in the range of $\sim0.4-4$
M$_\odot$. From a $\sim$1$"$ resolution 1.3 mm continuum image, we find a high fragmentation level,
with 14 compact millimeter sources within 0.1 pc (two of them associated with the known accretion
outburst YSOs RNO 1C and RNO 1B). The dense gas tracer DCN (3--2) traces well the dust continuum emission
and shows a clear velocity gradient along the NW-SE direction centered at SMA3. There is another
velocity gradient with opposite direction around the most luminous YSO IRAS 00338+6312. The fragmentation
within 0.1 pc in L1287 is very high compared to other regions at the same spatial scales. The incoherent
motions of dense gas flows are sometimes interpreted by being influenced by (proto)stellar feedback
(e.g., outflows), which is not yet ruled out in this particular target source. The directions of
the velocity gradients traced by DCN are approximately perpendicular to those of the dominant CO
outflow(s). Therefore, we alternatively hypothesize that the velocity gradients revealed by
DCN trace the convergence from the $\gtrsim$0.1 pc scales infalling motion towards the rotational
motions around the more compact ($\sim0.02$ pc) sources. This global molecular gas converging
flow may feed the formation of the dense low-mass YSO cluster. IRAS 00338+6312 is the most likely
powering source of the dominant CO outflow. A compact blue-shifted outflow from RNO 1C is also identified.
