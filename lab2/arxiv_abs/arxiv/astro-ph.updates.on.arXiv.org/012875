We present a new semi-empirical model for the dust continuum number counts of galaxies at 1.1 millimeter
and 850 \micron. Our approach couples an observationally motivated model for the stellar mass and
SFR distribution of galaxies with empirical scaling relations to predict the dust continuum flux
density of these galaxies. Without a need to tweak the IMF, the model reproduces the currently available
observations of the 1.1 millimeter and 850 \micron number counts, including the observed flattening
in the 1.1 millimeter number counts below 0.3 mJy \citep{Gonzalez2019numbercounts} and the number
counts in discrete bins of different galaxy properties. Predictions of our work include : (1) the
galaxies that dominate the number counts at flux densities below 1 mJy (3 mJy) at 1.1 millimeter (850
$\mu$m) have redshifts between $z=1$ and $z=2$, stellar masses of $\sim 5\times10^{10}~\rm{M}_\odot$,
and dust masses of $\sim 10^{8}~\rm{M}_\odot$; (2) the flattening in the observed 1.1 millimeter
number counts corresponds to the knee of the 1.1 millimeter luminosity function. A similar flattening
is predicted for the number counts at 850 $\mu$m; (3) the model reproduces the redshift distribution
of current 1.1 millimeter detections; (4) to efficiently detect large numbers of galaxies through
their dust continuum, future surveys should scan large areas once reaching a 1.1 millimeter flux
density of 0.1 mJy rather than integrating to fainter fluxes. Our modeling framework also suggests
that the amount of information on galaxy physics that can be extracted from the 1.1 millimeter and
850 $\mu$m number counts is almost exhausted.
