The broad Mg II line in quasars has distinct variability properties compared with broad Balmer lines:
it is less variable, and usually does not display a "breathing" mode, the increase in the average
cloud distance when luminosity increases. We demonstrate that these variability properties of
Mg II can be reasonably well explained by simple Locally Optimally Emitting Cloud (LOC) photoionization
models, confirming earlier photoionization results. In the fiducial LOC model, the Mg II-emitting
gas is on average more distant from the ionizing source than the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ gas, and responds
with a lower amplitude to continuum variations. If the broad-line region (BLR) is truncated at a
physical radius of $\sim 0.3$ pc (for a $10^{8.5}M_{\odot}$ BH accreting at Eddington ratio of 0.1),
most of the Mg II flux will always be emitted near this outer boundary and hence will not display breathing.
These results indicate that reverberation mapping results on broad Mg II, while generally more
difficult to obtain due to the lower line responsivity, can still be used to infer the Mg II BLR size
and hence black hole mass. But it is possible that Mg II does not have a well defined intrinsic BLR size-luminosity
relation for individual quasars, even though a global one for the general population may still exist.
The dramatic changes in broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ emission in the observationally-rare changing-look
quasars are fully consistent with photoionization responses to extreme continuum variability,
and the LOC model provides natural explanations for the persistence of broad Mg II in changing-look
quasars defined on H$\alpha$/H$\beta$, and the rare population of broad Mg II emitters in the spectra
of massive inactive galaxies.
