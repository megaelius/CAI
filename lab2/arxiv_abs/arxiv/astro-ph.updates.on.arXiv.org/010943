Turbulence is ubiquitously observed in nearly collisionless heliospheric plasmas, including
the solar wind and corona and the Earth's magnetosphere. Understanding the collisionless mechanisms
responsible for the energy transfer from the turbulent fluctuations to the particles is a frontier
in kinetic turbulence research. Collisionless energy transfer from the turbulence to the particles
can take place reversibly, resulting in non-thermal energy in the particle velocity distribution
functions (VDFs) before eventual collisional thermalization is realized. Exploiting the information
contained in the fluctuations in the VDFs is valuable. Here we apply a recently developed method
based on VDFs, the field-particle correlation technique, to a $\beta=1$, solar-wind-like, low-frequency
Alfv\'enic turbulence simulation with well resolved phase space to identify the field-particle
energy transfer in velocity space. The field-particle correlations reveal that the energy transfer,
mediated by the parallel electric field, results in significant structuring of the ion and electron
VDFs in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Fourier modes representing the length scales
between the ion and electron gyroradii show that energy transfer is resonant in nature, localized
in velocity space to the Landau resonances for each Fourier mode. The energy transfer closely follows
the Landau resonant velocities with varying perpendicular wavenumber $k_\perp$ and plasma $\beta$.
This resonant signature, consistent with Landau damping, is observed in all diagnosed Fourier
modes that cover the dissipation range of the simulation.
