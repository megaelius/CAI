Probing the structure of complex astrophysical objects requires effective three-dimensional
(3D) numerical simulation of the relevant radiative transfer (RT) processes. As with any numerical
simulation code, the choice of an appropriate discretization is crucial. Adaptive grids with cuboidal
cells such as octrees have proven very popular, however several recently introduced hydrodynamical
and RT codes are based on a Voronoi tessellation of the spatial domain. Such an unstructured grid
poses new challenges in laying down the rays (straight paths) needed in RT codes. We show that it is
straightforward to implement accurate and efficient RT on 3D Voronoi grids. We present a method
for computing straight paths between two arbitrary points through a 3D Voronoi grid in the context
of a RT code. We implement such a grid in our RT code SKIRT, using the open source library Voro++ to obtain
the relevant properties of the Voronoi grid cells based solely on the generating points. We compare
the results obtained through the Voronoi grid with those generated by an octree grid for two synthetic
models, and we perform the well-known Pascucci RT benchmark using the Voronoi grid. The presented
algorithm produces correct results for our test models. Shooting photon packages through the geometrically
much more complex 3D Voronoi grid is only about three times slower than the equivalent process in
an octree grid with the same number of cells, while in fact the total number of Voronoi grid cells may
be lower for an equally good representation of the density field. We conclude that the benefits of
using a Voronoi grid in RT simulation codes will often outweigh the somewhat slower performance.
