We present a detailed comparative systematic study using a sample of 221 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1)
galaxies in comparison to a redshift matched sample of 154 Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies
based on their observations using ROSAT and/or XMM-Newton telescopes in soft X-ray band (0.1-2.0
keV). A homogeneous analysis is carried out to estimate their soft X-ray photon indices ($\Gamma^{s}_{X}$)
and its correlations with other parameters of nuclear activities such as Eddington ratios (R$_\mathrm{Edd}$),
bolometric luminosities (L$_\mathrm{bol}$), black hole masses (M$_\mathrm{BH}$) and the widths
of the broad component of H$\beta$ lines (FWHM(H$\beta$)). In our analysis, we found clear evidence
of the difference in the $\Gamma^{s}_{X}$ and R$_\mathrm{Edd}$ distributions among NLSy1 and
BLSy1 galaxies, with steeper $\Gamma^{s}_{X}$ and higher R$_\mathrm{Edd}$ for the former. Such
a difference also exists in the spectral indices distribution in hard X-ray ($\Gamma^{h}_{X}$),
based on the analysis of 53 NLSy1 and 46 BLSy1 galaxies in the 2-10 keV energy band. The difference
in R$_\mathrm{Edd}$ distributions does exist even after applying the average correction for the
difference in the inclination angle of NLSy1 and BLSy1 galaxies. We also estimated R$_\mathrm{Edd}$,
based on SED fitting of 34 NLSy1 and 30 BLSy1 galaxies over the 0.3-10 keV energy band and found that
results are still consistent with R$_\mathrm{Edd}$ estimates based on the optical bolometric
luminosity. Our analysis suggests that the higher R$_\mathrm{Edd}$ in NLSy1 is responsible for
its steeper X-ray spectral slope compared to the BLSy1, consistent with the disc-corona model as
proposed for the luminous AGNs.
