We use the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 9 (DR9) to detect and measure
the position of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in the three-dimensional correlation
function in the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations at a redshift z=2.4. The feature is clearly
detected at significance between 3 and 5 sigma (depending on the broadband model and method of error
covariance matrix estimation) and is consistent with predictions of the standard LCDM model. We
assess the biases in our method, stability of the error covariance matrix and possible systematic
effects. We fit the resulting correlation function with several models that decouple the broadband
and acoustic scale information. For an isotropic dilation factor, we measure 100x(alpha_iso-1)
= -1.6 ^{+2.0+4.3+7.4}_{-2.0-4.1-6.8} (stat.) +/- 1.0 (syst.) (multiple statistical errors
denote 1,2 and 3 sigma confidence limits) with respect to the acoustic scale in the fiducial cosmological
model (flat LCDM with Omega_m=0.27, h=0.7). When fitting separately for the radial and transversal
dilation factors we find marginalised constraints 100x(alpha_par-1) = -1.3 ^{+3.5+7.6 +12.3}_{-3.3-6.7-10.2}
(stat.) +/- 2.0 (syst.) and 100x(alpha_perp-1) = -2.2 ^{+7.4+17}_{-7.1-15} +/- 3.0 (syst.). The
dilation factor measurements are significantly correlated with cross-correlation coefficient
of ~ -0.55. Errors become significantly non-Gaussian for deviations over 3 standard deviations
from best fit value. Because of the data cuts and analysis method, these measurements give tighter
constraints than a previous BAO analysis of the BOSS DR9 Lyman-alpha forest sample, providing an
important consistency test of the standard cosmological model in a new redshift regime.
