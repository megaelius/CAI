The angular momentum deficit (AMD) of a planetary system is a measure of its orbital excitation and
a predictor of long-term stability. We adopt the AMD-stability criteria to constrain the orbital
architectures for exoplanetary systems. Previously, He, Ford, & Ragozzine (2019) (arXiv:1907.07773v2)
showed through forward modelling (SysSim) that the observed multiplicity distribution can be
well reproduced by two populations consisting of a low and a high mutual inclination component.
Here, we show that a broad distribution of mutual inclinations arising from systems at the AMD-stability
limit can also match the observed Kepler population. We show that distributing a planetary system's
maximum AMD amongst its planets results in a multiplicity-dependent distribution of eccentricities
and mutual inclinations. Systems with intrinsically more planets have lower median eccentricities
and mutual inclinations, and this trend is well described by power-law functions of the intrinsic
planet multiplicity ($n$): $\tilde{\mu}_{e,n} \propto n^{-1.74_{-0.07}^{+0.11}}$ and $\tilde{\mu}_{i,n}
\propto n^{-1.73_{-0.08}^{+0.09}}$, where $\tilde{\mu}_{e,n}$ and $\tilde{\mu}_{i,n}$ are
the medians of the eccentricity and inclination distributions. We also find that intrinsic single
planets have higher eccentricities ($\sigma_{e,1} \sim 0.25$) than multi-planet systems, and
that the trends with multiplicity appear in the observed distributions of period-normalized transit
duration ratios. We show that the observed preferences for planet size orderings and uniform spacings
are more extreme than what can be produced by the detection biases of the Kepler mission alone. Finally,
we find that for systems with detected transiting planets between 5 and 10d, there is another planet
with a greater RV signal $\simeq~53\%$ of the time.
