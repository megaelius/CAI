We determine an optimized clustering statistic to be used for galaxy samples with significant redshift
uncertainty, such as those that rely on photometric redshifts. To do so, we study the baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) information content as a function of the orientation of galaxy clustering modes
with respect to their angle to the line-of-sight (LOS). The clustering along the LOS, as observed
in a redshift-space with significant redshift uncertainty, has contributions from clustering
modes with a range of orientations with respect to the true LOS. For redshift uncertainty $\sigma_z
\geq 0.02(1+z)$ we find that while the BAO information is confined to transverse clustering modes
in the true space, it is spread nearly evenly in the observed space. Thus, measuring clustering in
terms of the projected separation (regardless of the LOS) is an efficient and nearly lossless compression
of the signal for $\sigma_z \geq 0.02(1+z)$. For reduced redshift uncertainty, a more careful consideration
is required. We then use more than 1700 realizations (combining two separate sets) of galaxy simulations
mimicking the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 sample to validate our analytic results and optimized analysis
procedure. We find that using the correlation function binned in projected separation, we can achieve
uncertainties that are within 10 per cent of those predicted by Fisher matrix forecasts. We predict
that DES Y1 should achieve a 5 per cent distance measurement using our optimized methods. We expect
the results presented here to be important for any future BAO measurements made using photometric
redshift data.
