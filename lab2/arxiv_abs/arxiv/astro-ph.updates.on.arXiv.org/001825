Doppler planet searches revealed that many giant planets orbit close to their host star or in highly
eccentric orbits. These and subsequent observations inspired new theories of planet formation
that invoke gravitation interactions in multiple planet systems to explain the excitation of orbital
eccentricities and even short-period giant planets. Recently, NASA's Kepler mission has identified
over 300 systems with multiple transiting planet candidates, including many potentially rocky
planets. Most of these systems include multiple planets with closely-spaced orbits and sizes between
that of Earth and Neptune. These systems represent yet another new and unexpected class of planetary
systems and provide an opportunity to test the theories developed to explain the properties of giant
exoplanets. Presently, we have limited knowledge about such planetary systems, mostly about their
sizes and orbital periods. With the advent of long-term, nearly continuous monitoring by Kepler,
the method of transit timing variations (TTVs) has blossomed as a new technique for characterizing
the gravitational effects of mutual planetary perturbations for hundreds of planets. TTVs can
provide precise (but complex) constraints on planetary masses, densities and orbits, even for
planetary systems with faint host stars. In the coming years, astronomers will translate TTV observations
into increasingly powerful constraints on the formation and orbital evolution of planetary systems
with low-mass planets. Between TTVs, improved Doppler surveys, high-contrast imaging campaigns
and microlensing surveys, astronomers can look forward to a much better understanding of planet
formation in the coming decade.
