The nature of dark matter remains one of the key science questions. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs) are among the best motivated particle physics candidates, allowing to explain the measured
dark matter density by employing standard big-bang thermodynamics. Examples include the lightest
supersymmetric particle, though many alternative particles have been suggested as a solution
to the dark matter puzzle. We introduce here a radically new version of the widely used DarkSUSY package,
which allows to compute the properties of such dark matter particles numerically. With DarkSUSY
6 one can accurately predict a large variety of astrophysical signals from dark matter, such as direct
detection in low-background counting experiments and indirect detection through antiprotons,
antideuterons, gamma rays and positrons from the Galactic halo, or high-energy neutrinos from
the center of the Earth or of the Sun. For WIMPs, high-precision tools are provided for the computation
of the relic density in the Universe today, as well as for the size of the smallest dark matter protohalos.
Compared to earlier versions, DarkSUSY 6 introduces many significant physics improvements and
extensions. The most fundamental new feature of this release, however, is that the code has been
completely re-organized and brought into a highly modular and flexible shape. Switching between
different pre-implemented dark matter candidates has thus become straight-forward, just as adding
new -- WIMP or non-WIMP -- particle models or replacing any given functionality in a fully user-specified
way. In this article, we describe the physics behind the computer package, along with the main structure
and philosophy of this major revision of DarkSUSY. A detailed manual is provided together with the
public release at this http URL
