Since 2014, the LBT's First Light Adaptive Optics (FLAO) system has also included a seldom used capability,
known as Enhanced Seeing Mode (ESM), that can improve the angular resolution over a 4' x 4' field of
view (FOV). In full AO operation, FLAO provides diffraction limited (DL) capabilities over a small
(30" x 30") FOV. By comparison, ESM can achieve significantly enhanced resolution, over natural
seeing, across a far larger FOV. This improves operational efficiency over standard seeing limited
(SL) observations and is applicable across a broader range of scientific targets. ESM uses 11 modes
of correction (including tip and tilt) to remove residual aberrations and jitter which significantly
improves angular resolution over the full FOV. While this mode does not reach the DL, it can achieve
uniform angular resolutions as good as 0".22 over the FOV. Furthermore, it allows for the use of multi-object
spectroscopy with R~10,000 or imaging with angular resolution similar to that achieved by the Wide-Field
Camera 3 infrared channel on the Hubble Space Telescope, but powered by 11.6 meters of effective
aperture in binocular mode. As part of the on-going characterization of ESM, we have demonstrated
that even in poor seeing conditions (1".5-2") the image quality delivered to the focal station is
improved by factors of 2-3. Here, we present the first results of the characterization of ESM, including
systematic tests of the delivered PSF across the FOV as a function of the brightness of, and distance
from, the AO Reference Star. We present a range of galactic and extra-galactic targets showing the
improvements obtained over a broad range of seeing conditions and propose ESM as a standard observational
mode for near-Infrared observations.
