We present a comparative study between the results of most hydrodynamic simulations of the common
envelope binary interaction to date and observations of post common envelope binaries. The goal
to evaluate whether this dataset indicates the existence of a formula that may predict final separations
of post-common envelope systems as a function of pre-common envelope parameters. Some of our conclusions
are not surprising while others are more subtle. We find that: (i) Some common envelope simulations
share a common range of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ values despite the fact that only some of these simulations
achieve envelope unbinding. The addition of recombination energy to the simulations does not seem
to systematically alter the final separation of the simulations. (ii) Some simulations deviate
dramatically from the trend, with final separations that are both larger and smaller. (iii) Despite
large reconstruction errors, the post-RGB observations reconstructed parameters are in agreement
with some of the simulations. (iv) The post-AGB observations behave instead as if they had a systematically
lower value of $\alpha_{\rm CE}$. The lack of common envelope simulations with low mass AGB stars
leaves us with no insight as to why this is the case. (v) The limited resolution of some of the simulations
may have resulted in a too wide a final separation. (vi) Observations with separations larger than
$\sim$10~\rs, tend to have high $M_2/M_1$ mass ratios and may go through a relatively long phase
of unstable Roche lobe mass transfer followed by a weakened common envelope (or with no common envelope
at all). Common envelope simulations cannot easily reproduce these systems.
