Extracting stellar fundamental parameters from SPectro-Interferometric (SPI) data requires
reliable estimates of observables and with robust uncertainties (visibility, triple product,
phase closure). A number of fine calibration procedures is necessary throughout the reduction
process. Testing departures from centro-symmetry of brightness distributions is a useful complement.
Developing a set of automatic routines, called SPIDAST (made available to the community) to reduce,
calibrate and interpret raw data sets of instantaneous spectro-interferograms at the spectral
channel level, we complement (and in some respects improve) the ones contained in the amdlib Data
Reduction Software. Our new software SPIDAST is designed to work in an automatic mode, free from
subjective choices, while being versatile enough to suit various processing strategies. SPIDAST
performs the following automated operations: weighting of non-aberrant SPI data (visibility,
triple product), fine spectral calibration (sub-pixel level), accurate and robust determinations
of stellar diameters for calibrator sources (and their uncertainties as well), correction for
the degradations of the interferometer response in visibility and triple product, calculation
of the Centro-Symmetry Parameter (CSP) from the calibrated triple product, fit of parametric chromatic
models on SPI observables, to extract model parameters. SPIDAST is currently applied to the scientific
study of 18 cool giant and supergiant stars, observed with the VLTI/AMBER facility at medium resolution
in the K band. Because part of their calibrators have no diameter in the current catalogs, SPIDAST
provides new determinations of the angular diameters of all calibrators. Comparison of SPIDAST
final calibrated observables with amdlib determinations shows good agreement, under good and
poor seeing conditions.
