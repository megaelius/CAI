We demonstrate how galaxy morphologies can be represented by weighted sums of 'eigengalaxies'
and how eigengalaxies can be used in a probabilistic framework to enable principled and simplified
approaches in a variety of applications. Eigengalaxies can be derived from a Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) of sets of single- or multi-band images. They encode the image space equivalent of
basis vectors that can be combined to describe the structural properties of large samples of galaxies
in a massively reduced manner. As an illustration, we show how a sample of 10,243 galaxies in the Hubble
Space Telescope CANDELS survey, which have visual classifications from Galaxy Zoo, can be represented
by just 12 eigengalaxies whilst retaining 96% explained variance. We show how the emphasis of certain
eigengalaxy components correspond to visual features (e.g. disc, point source, etc.), and explore
the correspondence between combinations of eigengalaxies and features defined in the Galaxy Zoo-CANDELS
catalogue. We also describe a probabilistic extension to PCA (PPCA) which enables the eigengalaxy
framework to assign probabilities to galaxies and characterise a whole population as a generative
distribution. We present four practical applications of the probabilistic eigengalaxy framework
that are particularly relevant for the next generation of large imaging surveys: we (i) show how
low probability galaxies make for natural candidates for outlier detection (ii) demonstrate how
missing data can be predicted (iii) show how a similarity search can be performed on exemplars (iv)
demonstrate how unsupervised clustering of objects can be implemented.
