The asteroid 2014 JO25, considered to be "potentially hazardous" by the Minor Planet Center, was
spectroscopically followed during its close-Earth encounter on 19th and 20th of April 2017. The
spectra of the asteroid were taken with the low resolution spectrograph (LISA), mounted on the 1.2-m
telescope at the Mount Abu Infrared Observatory, India. Coming from a region close to the Hungaria
population of asteroids, this asteroid follows a comet-like orbit with a relatively high inclination
and large eccentricity. Hence, we carried out optical spectroscopic observations of the asteroid
to look for comet-like molecular emissions or outbursts. However, the asteroid showed a featureless
spectrum, devoid of any comet-like features. The asteroid's light curve was analyzed using V band
magnitudes derived from the spectra and the most likely solution for the rotation of the asteroid
was obtained. The absolute magnitude $H$ and the slope parameter $G$ were determined for the asteroid
in V filter band using the IAU accepted standard two parameter H-G model. A peculiar, rarely found
result from these observations is its phase bluing trend. The relative B-V color index seems to decrease
with increasing phase angle, which indicates a phase bluing trend. Such trends have seldom been
reported in literature. However, phase reddening in asteroids is very common. The asymmetry parameter
$g$ and the single scattering albedo $w$ were estimated for the asteroid by fitting the Hapke phase
function to the observed data. The asteroid shows relatively large value for the single scattering
albedo and a highly back scattering surface.
