Many of the characteristics of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), such as high Photon Detection
Efficiency (PDE), are well matched to the requirements of the cameras of the Small-Sized Telescopes
(SSTs) proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. In fact, compared to a single mirror, the double
mirror Schwarzschild Couder configuration provides a much better Point Spread Function over a
large field of view. It allows better correction of aberrations at large off axis angles and facilitates
the construction of compact telescopes. Moreover, the small plate scale of the dual-mirror SSTs
allows the use of SiPM detectors despite their small pixel sizes. These sensors have two further
advantages compared to the Photo Multipliers Tubes: the low cost and the possibility to observe
in very high Night Sky Background (NSB) light level without any damage. However, one area in which
SiPM performance has required improvement is Optical CrossTalk (OCT), where multiple avalanches
are induced by a single impinging photon. OCT, coupled with the typical NSB rate of 25 MCnts/s per
pixel during Cherenkov observations, can place severe constraints on the triggering capability
of the cameras. This paper describes the performance of novel Low Voltage Reverse (LVR) 2nd and 3rd
generation Multi Pixel Photon Counters manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics. These are designed
to have both enhanced PDE and reduced OCT. Two 7 x 7 mm2 S14520 LVR2 MPPCs with 75 um microcells are tested
and compared with detectors of the same pixel size with 50 um microcells. A comparative analysis
of a 3 x 3 mm2 S14520 LVR2 device and an S14520 LVR3 device is also carried out, demonstrating that the
LVR3 gives better photon detection in the 240 380 nm wavelength range. Finally, the effect of an infrared
filter on the OCT is analysed.
