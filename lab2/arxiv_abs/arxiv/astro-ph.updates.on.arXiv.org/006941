Using a high resolution simulation of an isolated dwarf galaxy, accounting for multi-channel stellar
feedback and chemical evolution on a star-by-star basis, we investigate how each of 15 metal species
are distributed within our multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and ejected from our galaxy by
galactic winds. For the first time, we demonstrate that the mass fraction probability distribution
functions (PDFs) of individual metal species in the ISM are well described by a piecewise log-normal
and power-law distribution. The log-normal component generally describes gas at lower metal fractions
undergoing enrichment towards the mean metal fraction, driven by recent enrichment events in the
power-law tail. The PDF properties, and relative significance of these two components, vary within
each ISM phase. Hot gas is dominated by recent enrichment, with a significant power-law tail to high
metal fractions, while cold gas is dominated by the log-normal component. In addition, elements
dominated by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind enrichment, such as N and Ba, mix less efficiently
than elements dominated by supernova enrichment, such as alpha elements and Fe. This difference
is driven by the differences in source energetics and source locations, particularly the higher
chance compared to massive stars for AGB stars to eject material into cold gas. Nearly all of the produced
metals are ejected from the galaxy (only 4% are retained), but metals dominated by AGB enrichment
are retained at a fraction of 20%. In dwarf galaxies, therefore, elements synthesized predominately
through AGB winds should be both overabundant and have a larger spread compared to elements synthesized
in core collapse supernovae. We discuss the observational implications of these results, their
potential use in developing improved models of galactic chemical evolution, and their generalization
to more massive galaxies.
