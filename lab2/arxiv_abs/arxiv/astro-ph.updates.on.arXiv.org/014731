We present a comparison of the physical properties of the gas in the circumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic
(IGM) media at $z\sim0$ between observations and four cosmological hydrodynamical simulations:
Illustris, TNG300 of the IllustrisTNG project, EAGLE, and one of the Magneticum simulations. For
the observational data, we use the gas properties that are inferred from cross-correlating the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) from the {\it Planck} CMB maps with the haloes and the large-scale
structure reconstructed from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. Both the observational and simulation
results indicate that the integrated gas pressure in haloes deviates from the self-similar case,
showing that feedback impacts haloes with $M_{500}\sim 10^{12-13}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The simulations
predict that more than half the baryons are displaced from haloes, while the gas fraction inferred
from our observational data roughly equals the cosmic baryon fraction throughout the $M_{500}\sim
10^{12-14.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ halo mass range. All simulations tested here predict that the mean
gas temperature in haloes is about the virial temperature, while that inferred from the SZE is up
to one order of magnitude lower than that from the simulations (and also from X-ray observations).
While a remarkable agreement is found for the average properties of the IGM between the observation
and some simulations, we show that their dependence on the large-scale tidal field can break the
degeneracy between models that show similar predictions otherwise. Finally, we show that the gas
pressure and the electron density profiles from simulations are not well described by a generalized
NFW (GNFW) profile. Instead, we present a new model with a mass-dependent shape that fits the profiles
accurately.
