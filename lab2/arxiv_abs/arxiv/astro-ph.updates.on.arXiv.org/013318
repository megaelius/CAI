We present the catalogue of Radio sources associated with Optical Galaxies and having Unresolved
or Extended morphologies I (ROGUE I). It was generated by cross-matching galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR 7) as well as radio sources from the First Images of Radio
Sky at Twenty Centimetre (FIRST) and the National Radio Astronomical Observatory VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS) catalogues. We created the largest handmade catalogue of visually classified radio objects
and associated with them optical host galaxies, containing 32,616 galaxies with a FIRST core within
3 arcsec of the optical position. All listed objects possess the good quality SDSS DR 7 spectra with
the signal-to-noise ratio $>$10 and spectroscopic redshifts up to $z=0.6$. The radio morphology
classification was performed by a visual examination of the FIRST and the NVSS contour maps overlaid
on a DSS image, while an optical morphology classification was based on the 120 arcsec snapshot images
from SDSS DR 7. The majority of radio galaxies in ROGUE I, i.e. $\sim$ 93%, are unresolved (compact
or elongated), while the rest of them exhibit extended morphologies, such as Fanaroff-Riley (FR)
type I, II, and hybrid, wide-angle tail, narrow-angle tail, head-tail sources, and sources with
intermittent or reoriented jet activity, i.e. double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped. Most of
FR IIs have low radio luminosities, comparable to the luminosities of FR Is. Moreover, due to visual
check of all radio maps and optical images, we were able to discover or reclassify a number of radio
objects as giant, double-double, X-shaped, and Z-shaped radio galaxies. The presented sample
can serve as a database for training automatic methods of identification and classification of
optical and radio galaxies.
