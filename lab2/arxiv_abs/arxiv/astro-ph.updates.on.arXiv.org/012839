We study the origin of tail-like structures recently detected around the disk of SU Aurigae and several
FU~Orionis-type stars. Dynamic protostellar disks featuring ejections of gaseous clumps and
quiescent protoplanetary disks experiencing a close encounter with an intruder star were modeled
using the numerical hydrodynamics code FEOSAD. Both the gas and dust dynamics were taken into account,
including dust growth and mutual friction between the gas and dust components. Only plane-of-the-disk
encounters were considered. Ejected clumps produce a unique type of tail that is characterized
by a bow-shock shape. Such tails originate from the supersonic motion of ejected clumps through
the dense envelope that often surrounds young gravitationally unstable protostellar disks. The
ejected clumps either sit at the head of the tail-like structure or disperse if their mass is insufficient
to withstand the head wind of the envelope. On the other hand, close encounters with quiescent protoplanetary
disks produce three types of the tail-like structure; we define these as pre-collisional, post-collisional,
and spiral tails. These tails can in principle be distinguished from one another by particular features
of the gas and dust flow in and around them. We find that the brown-dwarf-mass intruders do not capture
circumintruder disks during the encounter, while the subsolar-mass intruders can acquire appreciable
circumintruder disks with elevated dust-to-gas ratios, which can ease their observational detection.
However, this is true only for prograde collisions; the retrograde intruders fail to collect appreciable
amounts of gas or dust from the disk of the target. The predicted mass of dust in the model tail-like
structures is higher than what was inferred for similar structures in SU~Aur, FU~Ori, and Z~CMa,
making their observational detection feasible. Abridged.
