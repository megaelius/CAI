In this work we measure and study the cross-correlation signal between a foreground sample of GAMA
galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$, and a background sample of H-ATLAS
galaxies with photometric redshifts $\gtrsim1.2$. It constitutes a substantial improvement
over the cross-correlation measurements made by Gonzalez-Nuevo et al. (2014) with updated catalogues
and wider area (with $S/N\gtrsim 5$ below 10' and reaching $S/N\sim 20$ below 30"). The better statistics
allow us to split the sample in different redshift bins and to perform a tomographic analysis (with
$S/N\gtrsim 3$ below 10 arcmin and reaching $S/N\sim 15$ below 30"). Moreover, we implement a halo
model to extract astrophysical information about the background galaxies and the deflectors that
are producing the lensing link between the foreground (lenses) and background (sources) samples.
In the case of the sources, we find typical mass values in agreement with previous studies: a minimum
halo mass to host a central galaxy, $M_{min}\sim 10^{12.26} M_\odot$, and a pivot halo mass to have
at least one sub-halo satellite, $M_1\sim 10^{12.84} M_\odot$. However, the lenses are massive
galaxies or even galaxy groups/clusters, with minimum mass of $M_{min}^{lens}\sim 10^{13.06}
M_\odot$. Above a mass of $M_1^{lens}\sim 10^{14.57} M_\odot$ they contain at least one additional
satellite galaxy which contributes to the lensing effect. The tomographic analysis shows that,
while $M_1^{lens}$ is almost redshift independent, there is a clear evolution of increase $M_{min}^{lens}$
with redshift in agreement with theoretical estimations. Finally, the halo modeling allows us
to identify a strong lensing contribution to the cross-correlation for angular scales below 30".
This interpretation is supported by the results of basic but effective simulations.
