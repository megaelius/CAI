We investigate the role of dense Mpc-scale environment in processing molecular gas in distant Low
luminosity radio galaxies (LLRGs) in galaxy (proto-)clusters. We have selected within the COSMOS
and DES surveys a sample of five LLRGs at $z=0.4-2.6$ that show evidence of ongoing star formation
on the basis of their far-infrared emission. We have assembled and modeled the far-infrared-to-ultraviolet
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the LLRGs. We have observed the sources with the IRAM-30m
telescope to search for CO emission. We have then searched for dense Mpc-scale overdensities associated
with the LLRGs using photometric redshifts of galaxies and the Poisson Probability Method, that
we have upgraded using the wavelet-transform ($\mathit{w}$PPM), to characterize the overdensity
in the projected space. Color-color and color-magnitude plots have been derived for the fiducial
cluster members. We set upper limits to the CO emission of the LLRGs, at $z=0.39, 0.61, 0.91, 0.97$,
and $2.6$. For the most distant radio source, COSMOS-FRI 70 at $z=2.6$, a hint of CO(7$\rightarrow$6)
emission is found at 2.2$\sigma$. The upper limits found for the molecular gas content $M({\rm H}_2)/M_\star<0.16$,
0.14, 2.71, 2.29, and 0.43, respectively, and depletion time $\tau_{\rm dep}\lesssim(0.4-0.9)$
Gyr of the five LLRGs are overall consistent with the values of main sequence field galaxies. Our
SED modeling implies large stellar masses for the LLRGs, in the range $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)=10.9-11.5$,
while the associated Mpc-scale overdensities show a complex morphology. The color-color and color-magnitude
plots suggest that the LLRGs are consistent with being star forming and on the high-luminosity tail
of the red sequence. The present study increases the limited statistics of distant cluster core
galaxies with CO observations. The radio galaxies of this work are excellent targets for ALMA and
JWST.
