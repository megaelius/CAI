In this study, the main goal is to understand the molecular cloud core collapse through the stages
of first and second hydrostatic core formation. We investigate the properties of Larson's first
and second cores following the evolution of the molecular cloud core until formation of Larson's
cores. We expand these collapse studies for the first time to span a wide range of initial cloud masses
from 0.5 to 100 Msun. Understanding the complexity of the numerous physical processes involved
in the very early stages of star formation requires detailed thermodynamical modeling in terms
of radiation transport and phase transitions. For this we use a realistic gas equation of state via
a density and temperature-dependent adiabatic index and mean molecular weight to model the phase
transitions. We use a gray treatment of radiative transfer coupled with hydrodynamics to simulate
Larson's collapse in spherical symmetry. We reveal a dependence of a variety of first core properties
on the initial cloud mass. The first core radius and mass increase from the low-mass to the intermediate-mass
regime and decrease from the intermediate-mass to the high-mass regime. The lifetime of first cores
strongly decreases towards the intermediate- and high-mass regime. Our studies show the presence
of a transition region in the intermediate-mass regime. Low-mass protostars tend to evolve through
two distinct stages of formation which are related to the first and second hydrostatic cores. In
contrast, in the high-mass star formation regime, the collapsing cloud cores rapidly evolve through
the first collapse phase and essentially immediately form Larson's second cores.
