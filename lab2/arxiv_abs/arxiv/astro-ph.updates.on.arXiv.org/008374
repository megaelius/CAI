We present an analysis of Chandra X-ray spectra of the gravitationally lensed active galactic nuclei
Q J0158-4325, HE 0435-1223, SDSS J1004+4112, HE 1104-1805, and Q 2237+0305. We confirm the previous
detections of FeK\alpha\ emission lines in most images of these objects with high significance.
The line energies range from 5.8 to 6.8 keV with widths from unresolved to 0.6 keV, and these lines
are consistent with emission close to spinning black holes viewed at different inclination angles.
We also confirm the positive offset from the Iwasawa-Taniguchi effect, the inverse correlation
between the equivalent width of metal emission lines and the X-ray luminosity in AGN, where our measured
equivalent widths are larger in lensed quasars. We attribute this effect to microlensing, and perform
a microlensing likelihood analysis to constrain the emission size of the relativistic reflection
region and the spin of supermassive black holes, assuming that the X-ray corona and the reflection
region, responsible for the iron emission line, both follow power-law emissivity profiles. The
microlensing analysis yields strong constraints on the spin and emissivity index of the reflection
component for Q 2237+0305, with a > 0.92 and n > 5.4. For the remaining four targets, we jointly constrain
the two parameters, yielding $a=0.8\pm0.16$ and an emissivity index of $n=4.0\pm 0.8$, suggesting
that the relativistic X-ray reflection region is ultra-compact and very close to the innermost
stable circular orbits of black holes, which are spinning at close to the maximal value. We successfully
constrain the half light radius of the emission region to < 2.4 r_g = GM/c^2 for Q 2237+0305 and in the
range 5.9-7.4 r_g for the joint sample.
