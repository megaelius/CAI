Binary evolution is indispensable in stellar evolution to understand the formation and evolution
of most peculiar and energetic objects, such as binary compact objects, Type Ia supernovae, X-ray
binaries, cataclysmic variables, blue stragglers, hot subdwarfs, and central binaries in planetary
nebulae. Mass transfer in binary stars can change the evolutionary path and fate of the corresponding
objects relative to what is expected from single stellar evolution. What is the critical mass ratio
at which unstable mass transfer occurs is an unsolved fundamental problem in binary evolution.
To resolve this issue, we construct the thermal equilibrium mass loss model and derive critical
mass ratios for both thermal timescale mass transfer and unstable mass transfer, the latter of which
occurs when the outer Lagrangian point, L2, is overfilled. Using several 3.2 Msun stellar models
as examples, we study the stellar response to thermal equilibrium mass loss and present the thresholds
for thermal timescale mass transfer. We study the possible mass transfer channels of binary systems
containing a 3.2 Msun donor star, taking into account thermal timescale mass transfer, unstable
mass transfer through L2, and dynamical timescale mass transfer. We repeat this simulation for
a grid of donor stars with different masses (from 0.1 to 100 Msun with Z = 0.02) and at different evolutionary
stages, and present our results. The results show that unstable mass transfer due to the overfilling
of the outer Lagrangian point may also play an essential role in the formation of common envelopes
for late red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch donors.
