The Halo Assembly in Lambda-CDM: Observations in 7 Dimensions (HALO7D) dataset consists of Keck
II/DEIMOS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope-measured proper motions of Milky Way (MW) halo
main sequence turnoff stars in the CANDELS fields. In this paper, the second in the HALO7D series,
we present the proper motions for the HALO7D sample. We discuss our measurement methodology, which
makes use of a Bayesian mixture modeling approach for creating the stationary reference frame of
distant galaxies. Using the 3D kinematic HALO7D sample, we estimate the parameters of the halo velocity
ellipsoid, $\langle v_{\phi} \rangle, \sigma_r, \sigma_{\phi}, \sigma_{\theta}$, and the velocity
anisotropy $\beta$. Using the full HALO7D sample, we find $\beta=0.63 \pm 0.05$ at $\langle r \rangle
=24$ kpc. We also estimate the ellipsoid parameters for our sample split into three apparent magnitude
bins; the posterior medians for these estimates of $\beta$, while consistent with one another,
increase as a function of mean sample distance. Finally, we estimate $\beta$ in each of the individual
HALO7D fields. We find that the velocity anisotropy $\beta$ can vary from field to field, which suggests
that the halo is not phase mixed at $\langle r \rangle =24$ kpc. We explore the $\beta$ variation across
the skies of two stellar halos from the \textit{Latte} suite of FIRE-2 simulations, finding that
both simulated galaxies show $\beta$ variation over a similar range to the variation observed across
the four HALO7D fields. The accretion histories of the two simulated galaxies result in different
$\beta$ variation patterns; spatially mapping $\beta$ is thus a way forward in characterizing
the accretion history of the Galaxy.
