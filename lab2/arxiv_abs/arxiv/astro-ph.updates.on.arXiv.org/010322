Observations with modern instruments such as Herschel reveal that stars form clustered inside
filamentary arms of ~1 pc length embedded in Giant Molecular Clouds. On smaller scales (~1000 au),
observations of, e.g., IRAS 16293--2422 show signs of filamentary `bridge' structures connecting
young protostars in their birth environment. We investigate the formation of a deeply embedded
triple protostellar system, and characterize its connection to the filamentary structure present
on GMC scales. Using the magnetohydrodynamical code RAMSES, we carry out zoom-in simulations of
low-mass star formation starting from Giant-Molecular-Cloud-scales. Colliding flows of gas
in the filamentary arms induce the formation of two protostellar companions at distances of ~1000
au from the primary. After their birth, the stellar companions quickly (~10 kyr) approach and orbit
the primary on eccentric orbits with separations of ~100 au. The colliding flows induce transient
structures lasting for up to a few 10 kyr connecting two forming protostellar objects that are kinematically
quiescent along the line-of-sight. Colliding flows compress the gas and trigger the formation
of stellar companions via turbulent fragmentation. Our results suggest that protostellar companions
form with a wide separation of ~1000 au. Smaller separations (~100 au or less) are a consequence of
subsequent migration and capturing. Associated with the formation phase of the companion, the
turbulent environment induces arc- and bridge-like structures. These bridges can become kinematically
quiescent, when the velocity components of the colliding flows eliminate each other. However,
the gas in bridges still contributes to stellar accretion later. Our results demonstrate: bridge-like
structures are a transient phenomenon of stellar multiple formation.
