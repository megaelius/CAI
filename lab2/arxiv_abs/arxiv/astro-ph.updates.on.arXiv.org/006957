We present and analyse mock stellar catalogues that match the selection criteria and observables
(including uncertainties) of the Gaia satellite data release 2 (DR2). The source are six cosmological
high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic $\Lambda$CDM zoom simulations of the formation of Milky
Way analogues from the AURIGA project. Mock data are provided for stars with $V < 16$ mag, and $V < 20$
mag at $|b|>20$ degrees. The mock catalogues are made using two different methods: the public SNAPDRAGONS
code, and a method based on that of Lowing et al. that preserves the phase-space distribution of the
model stars. These publicly available catalogues contain 5-parameter astrometry, radial velocities,
multi-band photometry, stellar parameters, dust extinction values, and uncertainties in all
these quantities. In addition, we provide the gravitational potential and information on the origin
of each star. By way of demonstration, we apply the mock catalogues to analyses of the young stellar
disc and the stellar halo. We show that: i) the young outer stellar disc exhibits a flared distribution
that is detectable in the height and vertical velocity distribution of A- and B-dwarf stars up to
radii of ~15 kpc; and ii) the spin of the stellar halo out to 100 kpc can be accurately measured with
Gaia DR2 RR Lyrae stars. These catalogues are well suited for comparisons with observations and
should help to: i) develop and test analysis methods for the Gaia DR2 data; ii) gauge the limitations
and biases of the data and iii) interpret the data in the light of theoretical predictions from realistic
$ab$ $initio$ simulations of galaxy formation in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.
