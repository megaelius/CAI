In the context of the upcoming SRG/eROSITA survey, we present an N-body simulation-based mock catalogue
for X-ray selected AGN samples. The model reproduces the observed hard X-ray AGN luminosity function
(XLF) and the soft X-ray logN-logS from redshift 0 to 6. The XLF is reproduced to within $\pm5\%$ and
the logN-logS to within $\pm20\%$. We develop a joint X-ray -- optical extinction and classification
model. We adopt a set of empirical spectral energy distributions to predict observed magnitudes
in the UV, optical and NIR. With the latest eROSITA all sky survey sensitivity model, we create a high-fidelity
full-sky mock catalogue of X-ray AGN. It predicts their distributions in right ascension, declination,
redshift and fluxes. Using empirical medium resolution optical spectral templates and an exposure
time calculator, we find that $1.1\times10^6$ ($4\times10^5$) fiber-hours are needed to follow-up
spectroscopically from the ground the detected X-ray AGN with an optical magnitude $21<r<22.8$
($22.8<r<25$) with a 4-m (8-m) class multi-object spectroscopic facility. We find that future
clustering studies will measure the AGN bias to the percent level at redshift $z<1.2$ and should
discriminate possible scenarios of galaxy-AGN co-evolution. We predict the accuracy to which
the baryon acoustic oscillation standard ruler will be measured using X-ray AGN: better than 3\%
for AGN between redshift 0.5 to 3 and better than 1\% using the Ly$\alpha$ forest of X-ray QSOs discovered
between redshift 2 and 3. eROSITA will provide an outstanding set of targets for future galaxy evolution
and cosmological studies.
