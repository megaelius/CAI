The Dawn mission confirms predictions that the asteroid 4 Vesta is differentiated with an iron-rich
core, a silicate mantle and a basaltic crust, and confirms Vesta as the parent body of the HED meteorites.
To better understand its early evolution, we perform numerical calculations of the thermo-chemical
evolution adopting new data obtained by the Dawn mission such as mass, bulk density and size of the
asteroid. We have expanded the model of Neumann et al. (2012) that includes accretion, compaction,
melting and associated changes of material properties and partitioning of 26Al, advective heat
transport, and differentiation by porous flow, to include convection and effective cooling in
a magma ocean. Depending on the melt fraction, the heat transport by melt segregation is modelled
either by porous flow or by convection and heat flux of a magma ocean with a high effective thermal
conductivity. We show that partitioning of 26Al and its transport with the silicate melt is crucial
for the formation of a magma ocean. Due to the accumulation of 26Al in the sub-surface (for formation
times t0<1.5 Ma), a shallow magma ocean with a thickness of 1 to a few tens of km (depending on the
silicate melt viscosity) forms. The lifetime of the shallow magma ocean is O(10^4)-O(10^6) years
and convection in this layer is accompanied by the extrusion of 26Al at the surface. The interior
differentiates from the outside inward with a mantle that is depleted in 26Al and core formation
is completed within ~0.3 Ma. The lower mantle experiences melting below 45% suggesting a harzburgitic
to dunitic composition. Our results support the formation of eucrites by the extrusion of early
partial melt and cumulative eucrites and diogenites may form from the crystallizing shallow magma
ocean. Silicate melt is present for up to 150 Ma, and core convects for ~100 Ma, supporting the idea
of an early magnetic field.
