Although there have been numerous studies of chemical abundances in the Galactic bulge, the central
two degrees have been relatively unexplored due to the heavy and variable interstellar extinction,
extreme stellar crowding, and the presence of complex foreground disk stellar populations. In
this paper we discuss the metallicity distribution function, vertical and radial gradients and
chemical abundances of $\alpha$-elements in the inner two degrees of the Milky Way, as obtained
by recent IR spectroscopic surveys. We use a compilation of recent measurements of metallicities
and $\alpha$-element abundances derived from medium-high resolution spectroscopy. We compare
these metallicities with low-resolution studies. Defining "metal-rich" as stars with $ \rm [Fe/H]>0$,
and "metal-poor" as stars with $\rm [Fe/H]<0$, we find compelling evidence for a higher fraction
($\sim 80\%$) of metal-rich stars in the Galactic Center (GC) compared to the values (50-60\%) measured
in the low latitude fields within the innermost 600 pc. The high fraction of metal-rich stars in the
GC region implies a very high mean metallicity of +0.2 dex, while in the inner 600 pc of the bulge the
mean metallicity is rather homogenous around the solar value. A vertical metallicity gradient
of -0.27 dex/kpc in the inner 600 pc is only measured if the GC is included, otherwise the distribution
is about flat and consistent with no vertical gradient. In addition to its high stellar density,
the Galactic center/nuclear star cluster is also extreme in hosting high stellar abundances, compared
to the surrounding inner bulge stellar populations; this has implications for formation scenarios
and strengthens the case for the NSC being a distinct stellar system.
