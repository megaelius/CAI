We explore fundamental properties of the distribution of low mass dark matter halos within the cosmic
web using warm dark matter (WDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological simulations. Using self
abundance-matched mock galaxy catalogs, we show that the distribution of dwarf galaxies in a WDM
universe, wherein low mass halo formation is heavily suppressed, is nearly indistinguishable
to that of a CDM universe whose low mass halos are not seen because galaxy formation is suppressed
below some threshold halo mass. However, if the scatter between dwarf galaxy luminosity and halo
properties is large enough, low mass CDM halos would sometimes host relatively bright galaxies
thereby populating CDM voids with the occasional isolated galaxy and reducing the numbers of completely
empty voids. Otherwise, without high mass to light scatter, all mock galaxy clustering statistics
that we consider--the auto-correlation function, the numbers and radial profiles of satellites,
the numbers of isolated galaxies, and the PDF of small voids--are nearly identical in CDM and WDM.
WDM voids are neither larger nor emptier than CDM voids, when constructed from abundance-matched
halo catalogs. It is thus a challenge to determine whether the CDM problem of the over-abundance
of small halos with respect to the number density of observed dwarf galaxies has a cosmological solution
or an astrophysical solution. However, some clues about the dark matter particle and the scatter
between the properties of dwarf galaxies and their dark matter halo hosts might be found in the cosmic
web of galaxies in future surveys of the local volume.
