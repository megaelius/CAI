Both multi-messenger astronomy and new high-throughput wide-field surveys require flexible
tools for the selection and analysis of astrophysical transients. We here introduce the Alert Management,
Photometry and Evaluation of Lightcurves (AMPEL) system, a streaming data analysis framework.
AMPEL incorporates an alert broker, coupling it with the capability to host user contributed code
to analyze and react to events. These tools are embedded into a framework that encourages provenance
and keeps track of the varying information states that a transient displays. The latter concept
includes information gathered over time, but also varying data access levels and e.g. improved
calibration. We further describe the AMPEL live multi-messenger correlation between ZTF data
and IceCube neutrino alerts. To demonstrate AMPEL we reprocess the first four months of Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) public alerts and compare the yields of more than 200 different transient selection
functions in terms of how early and effectively they rediscover Type Ia supernovae reported to the
Transient Name Server (TNS). We highlight three channels suitable for (1) the collection of a complete
sample of extragalactic transients, (2) immediate follow-up of nearby transients and (3) follow-up
campaigns targeting young, extragalactic transients. We confirm ZTF completeness in that all
TNS supernovae positioned on active CCD regions were detected. AMPEL can assist in filtering transients
in real time, running alert reaction simulations, reprocessing of full datasets as well as the final
scientific analysis of transient data. This text also introduces how users can design their own
channels for inclusion in the AMPEL live instance that parses the ZTF stream and the real-time submission
of high quality extragalactic supernova candidates to the TNS.
