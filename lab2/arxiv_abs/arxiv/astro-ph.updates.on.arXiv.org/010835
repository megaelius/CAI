N131 is a typical infrared dust bubble showing an expanding ringlike shell. We study what kinds of
CO line ratios can be used to trace the interaction in the expanding bubble. We carry out new $\rm CO\,(3-2)$
observations towards bubble N131 using JCMT 15-m telescope, and derive line ratios by combining
with our previous $\rm CO\,(2-1)$ and $\rm CO\,(1-0)$ data from IRAM 30-m observations. To trace
the interaction between the molecular gas and the ironized gas in the HII region, we use RADEX to model
the dependence of CO line ratios on kinetic temperature and H$_2$ volume density, and examine the
abnormal line ratios based on other simulations. We present $\rm CO\,(3-2)$, $\rm CO\,(2-1)$,
and $\rm CO\,(1-0)$ integrated intensity maps convolved to the same angular resolution (22.5$"$).
The three different CO transition maps show apparently similar morphology. The line ratios of $W_{\rm
CO\,(3-2)}$/$W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}$ mostly range from 0.2 to 1.2 with a median of $0.54\pm0.12$, while
the line ratios of $W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}$/$W_{\rm CO\,(1-0)}$ range from 0.5 to 1.6 with a median of
$0.84\pm0.15$. The high CO line ratios $W_{\rm CO\,(3-2)}$/$W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}\gtrsim 0.8 $ and
$W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}$/$W_{\rm CO\,(1-0)}\gtrsim 1.2$ are beyond the threshold predicted by numerical
simulations based on the assumed density-temperature structure for the inner rims of ringlike
shell, where are the compressed areas in bubble N131. These high CO integrated intensity ratios,
such as $W_{\rm CO\,(3-2)}$/$W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}\gtrsim0.8$ and $W_{\rm CO\,(2-1)}$/$W_{\rm
CO\,(1-0)}\gtrsim1.2$, can be used as a tracer of gas compressed regions with a relatively high
temperature and density. This further suggests that the non-Gaussian part of the line-ratio distribution
can be used to trace the interaction between the molecular gas and the hot gas in the bubble.
