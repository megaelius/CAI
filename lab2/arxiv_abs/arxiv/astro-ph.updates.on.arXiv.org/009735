CMB lensing from current and upcoming wide-field CMB experiments such as AdvACT, SPT-3G and Simons
Observatory relies heavily on temperature (vs. polarization). In this regime, foreground contamination
to the temperature map produces significant lensing biases, which cannot be fully controlled by
multi-frequency component separation, masking or bias hardening. In this letter, we split the
standard CMB lensing quadratic estimator into a new set of optimal "multipole" estimators. On large
scales, these multipole estimators reduce to the known magnification and shear estimators, and
a new shear B-mode estimator. We leverage the different symmetries of the lensed CMB and extragalactic
foregrounds to argue that the shear-only estimator should be approximately immune to extragalactic
foregrounds. We build a new method to compute separately and without noise the primary, secondary
and trispectrum biases to CMB lensing from foreground simulations. Using this method, we demonstrate
that the shear estimator is indeed insensitive to extragalactic foregrounds, even when applied
to a single-frequency temperature map contaminated with CIB, tSZ, kSZ and radio point sources.
This dramatic reduction in foreground biases allows us to include higher temperature multipoles
than with the standard quadratic estimator, thus increasing the total lensing signal-to-noise
beyond the quadratic estimator. In addition, magnification-only and shear B-mode estimators
provide useful diagnostics for potential residuals. Our Python code LensQuEst to forecast the
signal-to-noise of the various estimators, generate mock maps, lense them, and apply the various
lensing estimators to them is publicly available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/LensQuEst
