Young circumstellar are of prime interest to understand the physical and chemical conditions under
which planet formation takes place. Only very few detections of planet candidates within these
disks exist, and most of them are currently suspected to be disk features. In this context, the transition
disk around the young star PDS 70 is of particular interest, due to its large gap identified in previous
observations, indicative of ongoing planet formation. We aim to search for the presence of planets
and search for disk structures indicative for disk-planet interactions and other evolutionary
processes. We analyse new and archival near-infrared (NIR) images of the transition disk PDS 70
obtained with the VLT/SPHERE, VLT/NaCo and Gemini/NICI instruments in polarimetric differential
imaging (PDI) and angular differential imaging (ADI) modes. We detect a point source within the
gap of the disk at about 195 mas (about 22 au) projected separation. The detection is confirmed at
five different epochs, in three filter bands and using different instruments. The astrometry results
in an object of bound nature, with high significance. The comparison of the measured magnitudes
and colours to evolutionary tracks suggests that the detection is a companion of planetary mass.
We confirm the detection of a large gap of about 54 au in size within the disk in our scattered light
images, and detect a signal from an inner disk component. We find that its spatial extent is very likely
smaller than about 17 au in radius. The images of the outer disk show evidence of a complex azimuthal
brightness distribution which may in part be explained by Rayleigh scattering from very small grains.
Future observations of this system at different wavelengths and continuing astrometry will allow
us to test theoretical predictions regarding planet-disk interactions, planetary atmospheres
and evolutionary models.
