The advent of large surveys is making possible the unravelling of the mass assembly history of the
Milky Way. Studies of the kinematics and chemical compositions of Galactic globular clusters (GCs)
enable the reconstruction of the history of star formation, chemical evolution, and mass assembly
of the Galaxy. Using the latest data release (DR16) of the SDSS/APOGEE survey, we identify 3,090
stars associated with 46 GCs. Using a previously defined kinematic association, we break the sample
down into eight separate groups and examine how the kinematics-based classification maps into
chemical composition space, considering only $\alpha$ (mostly Si and Mg) elements and Fe. Our results
show that: (i) The loci of both \textit{in situ} and accreted subgroups in chemical space match those
of their field counterparts; (ii) GCs from different individual accreted subgroups occupy the
same locus in chemical space. This could either mean that they share a similar origin or that they
are associated with distinct satellites which underwent similar chemical enrichment histories;
(iii) The chemical compositions of the GCs associated with the low orbital energy subgroup defined
by Massari and collaborators is broadly consistent with an \textit{in situ} origin. However, at
the low metallicity end, the distinction between accreted and \textit{in situ} populations is
blurred; (iv) Regarding the status of GCs whose origin is ambiguous, we conclude the following:
the position in Si-Fe plane suggests an \textit{in situ} origin for Liller 1 and a likely accreted
origin for NGC 5904 and NGC 6388. The case of NGC 288 is unclear, as its orbital properties suggest
an accretion origin, its chemical composition suggests it may have formed {\it in situ}.
