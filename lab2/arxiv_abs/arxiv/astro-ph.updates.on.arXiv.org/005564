We present mass estimates of supermassive black holes in six nearby fast rotating early-type galaxies
(NGC4339, NGC4434, NGC4474, NGC4551, NGC4578 and NGC4762) with effective stellar velocity dispersion
around 100 km/s. We use near-infrared laser-guide adaptive optics observations with the GEMINI/NIFS
to derive stellar kinematics in the galactic nuclei, and SAURON observations from the ATLAS3D Survey
for large-scale kinematics. We build axisymmetric Jeans anisotropic models and axisymmetric
Schwarzschild dynamical models. Both modelling approaches recover consistent orbital anisotropies
and black hole masses within 1-2sigma confidence level, except for one galaxy for which the difference
is just above the 3sigma level. Two black holes (NGC4339 and NGC4434) are amongst the largest outliers
from the current black hole mass - velocity dispersion relation, with masses of $(4.3^{+4.8}_{-2.3})\times10^7$
and $(7.0^{+2.0}_{-2.8})\times10^7$ M$_\odot$, respectively ($3\sigma$ confidence level).
The black holes in NGC4578 and NGC4762 lie on the scaling relation with masses of $(1.9^{+0.6}_{-1.4})\times10^7$
and $(2.3^{+0.9}_{-0.6})\times10^7$ M$_\odot$, respectively (3sigma confidence level). For
two galaxies (NGC4474 and NGC4551) we are able to place upper limits on their black holes masses ($<7\times10^6$
and $<5\times10^6$ M$_\odot$, respectively, $3\sigma$ confidence level). The kinematics for
these galaxies clearly indicate central velocity dispersion drops within a radius of 35 pc and 80
pc, respectively. These drops cannot be associated with cold stellar structures and our data do
not have the resolution to exclude black holes with masses an order of magnitude smaller than the
predictions. Parametrizing the orbital distribution in spherical coordinates, the vicinity
of the black holes is characterized by isotropic or mildly tangential anisotropy.
