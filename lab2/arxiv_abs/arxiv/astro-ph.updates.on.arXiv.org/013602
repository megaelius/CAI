Context: Atomic and molecular cloud formation is a dynamical process. However, kinematic signatures
of these processes are still observationally poorly constrained. Methods: Targeting the cloud-scale
environment of the prototypical infrared dark cloud G28.3, we employ spectral line imaging observations
of the two atomic lines HI and [CI] as well as molecular lines observations in 13CO in the 1--0 and 3--2
transitions. The analysis comprises investigations of the kinematic properties of the different
tracers, estimates of the mass flow rates, velocity structure functions, a Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) study as well as comparisons to simulations. Results: The central IRDC is embedded
in a more diffuse envelope of cold neutral medium (CNM) traced by HI self-absorption (HISA) and molecular
gas. The spectral line data as well as the HOG and structure function analysis indicate a possible
kinematic decoupling of the HI from the other gas compounds. Spectral analysis and position-velocity
diagrams reveal two velocity components that converge at the position of the IRDC. Estimated mass
flow rates appear rather constant from the cloud edge toward the center. The velocity structure
function analysis is consistent with gas flows being dominated by the formation of hierarchical
structures. Conclusions: The observations and analysis are consistent with a picture where the
IRDC G28 is formed at the center of two converging gas flows. While the approximately constant mass
flow rates are consistent with a self-similar, gravitationally driven collapse of the cloud, external
compression by, e.g., spiral arm shocks or supernovae explosions cannot be excluded yet. Future
investigations should aim at differentiating the origin of such converging gas flows.
