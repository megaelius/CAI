Homogeneous observations and careful analysis of transit light curves can lead to the identification
of transit timing variations (TTVs). TrES-2 is one of few exoplanets, which offer the matchless
possibility to combine long-term ground-based observations with continuous satellite data.
Our research aimed at the search for TTVs that would be indicative of perturbations from additional
bodies in the system. We also wanted to refine the system parameters and the orbital elements. We
obtained 44 ground-based light curves of 31 individual transit events of TrES-2. Eight 0.2 - 2.2-m
telescopes located at six observatories in Germany, Poland and Spain were used. In addition, we
analysed 18 quarters (Q0-Q17) of observational data from NASA's space telescope Kepler including
435 individual transit events and 11 publicly available ground-based light curves. Assuming different
limb darkening (LD) laws we performed an analysis for all light curves and redetermined the parameters
of the system. We also carried out a joint analysis of the ground- and space-based data. The long observation
period of seven years (2007-2013) allowed a very precise redetermination of the transit ephemeris.
For a total of 490 transit light curves of TrES-2, the time of transit mid-point was determined. The
transit times support neither variations on long time-scale nor on short time-scales. The nearly
continuous observations of Kepler show no statistically significant increase or decrease in the
orbital inclination i and the transit duration D. Only the transit depth shows a slight increase
which could be an indication of an increasing stellar activity. In general, system parameters obtained
by us were found to be in agreement with previous studies but are the most precise values to date.
