Precise studies on the Galactic bulge, globular cluster, Galactic halo and Galactic thick disk
require stellar models with alpha enhancement and various values of helium content. These models
are also important for extra-Galactic population synthesis studies. For this purpose, we complement
the existing PARSEC models, which are based on the solar partition of heavy elements, with alpha-enhanced
partitions. We collect detailed measurements on the metal mixture and helium abundance for the
two populations of 47 Tuc (NGC 104) from the literature, and calculate stellar tracks and isochrones
with these alpha-enhanced compositions. By fitting the precise color-magnitude diagram with
HST ACS/WFC data, from low main sequence till horizontal branch, we calibrate some free parameters
that are important for the evolution of low mass stars like the mixing at the bottom of the convective
envelope. This new calibration significantly improves the prediction of the RGB bump brightness.
Comparison with the observed RGB and HB luminosity functions also shows that the evolutionary lifetimes
are correctly predicted. As a further result of this calibration process, we derive the age, distance
modulus, reddening, and the red giant branch mass loss for 47 Tuc. We apply the new calibration and
alpha-enhanced mixtures of the two 47 Tuc populations ( [alpha/Fe] ~0.4 and 0.2) to other metallicities.
The new models reproduce the RGB bump observations much better than previous models. This new PARSEC
database, with the newly updated alpha-enhanced stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones,
will also be part of the new stellar products for Gaia.
