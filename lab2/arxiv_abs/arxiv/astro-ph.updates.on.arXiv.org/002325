We derive the minimum power of jets and their magnetic field strength based on their observed non-thermal
synchrotron emission. The correct form of this method takes into account both the internal energy
in the jet and the ion rest-mass energy associated with the bulk motion. The latter was neglected
in a number of papers, which instead adopted the well-known energy-content minimization method.
That method was developed for static sources, for which there is no bulk-motion component of the
energy. In the case of electron power-law spectra with index >2 in ion-electron jets, the rest-mass
component dominates. The minimization method for the jet power taking it into account was considered
in some other work, but only based on either an assumption of a constant total synchrotron flux or
a fixed range of the Lorentz factors. Instead, we base our method on an observed optically-thin synchrotron
spectrum. We find the minimum jet power is independent of its radius when the ion rest-mass power
dominates, which becomes the case below certain critical radius. This allows for robust minimum
power estimates. We also present results for the case with observed turnover frequency, at which
the source becomes optically thick. This method allows a determination of the source size, in addition
to the power and the magnetic field. We also point out that when the ion rest-mass power dominates,
the estimates of the minimum power lead to very different equipartition parameters than those based
on minimization of the energy content. The former and latter lead to approximate equipartition
between the internal energy in magnetic field and in particles including and excluding, respectively,
their rest mass energy.
