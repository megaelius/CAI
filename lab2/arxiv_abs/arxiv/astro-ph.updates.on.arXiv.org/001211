The origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters is still unknown and is the subject of a vibrant debate
both from the observational and theoretical point of view. In particular the amount and the nature
of non-thermal plasma and of the magnetic field energy density in clusters hosting radio halos is
still unclear. The aim of this paper is to derive an estimate of the pressure ratio X between the non-thermal
and thermal plasma in radio halo clusters that have combined radio, X-ray and SZ effect observations.
From the simultaneous P_{1.4}-L_X and P_{1.4}-Y_{SZ} correlations for a sample of clusters observed
with Planck, we derive a correlation between Y_{SZ} and L_X that we use to derive a value for X. This
is possible since the Compton parameter Y_{SZ} is proportional to the total plasma pressure in the
cluster (that we characterize as the sum of the thermal and non-thermal pressure) while the X-ray
luminosity L_X is proportional only to the thermal pressure of the intracluster plasma. Our results
indicate that the average (best fit) value of the pressure ratio in a self-similar cluster formation
model is X =0.55 \pm 0.05 in the case of an isothermal beta-model with beta=2/3 and a core radius r_c
= 0.3 R_{500} holding on average for the cluster sample. We also show that the theoretical prediction
for the Y_{SZ}-L_X correlation in this model has a slope that is steeper than the best fit value for
the available data. The agreement with the data can be recovered if the pressure ratio X decreases
with increasing X-ray luminosity as L_X^{-0.96}. We conclude that the available data on radio halo
clusters indicate a substantial amount of non-thermal pressure in cluster atmospheres whose value
must decrease with increasing X-ray luminosity, or increasing cluster mass (temperature). (abridged)
