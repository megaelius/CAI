Gravitational wave measurements will provide insight into the population of coalescing compact
binaries throughout the universe. We describe and demonstrate a flexible parametric method to
infer the event rate as a function of compact binary parameters, accounting for Poisson error and
selection biases. Using concrete synthetic data based on projections for LIGO and Virgo's O3 run,
we discuss how well GW measurements could constrain the mass and spin distribution of coalescing
neutron stars and black holes in the near future, within the context of several phenomenological
models described in this work. We demonstrate that only a few tens of events can enable astrophysically
significant constraints on the spin magnitude and orientation distribution of BHs in merging binaries.
We discuss how astrophysical priors or other measurements can inform the interpretation of future
measurements. Using publicly-available results, we estimate the event rate versus mass for binary
black holes. To connect to previously-published work, we provide estimates including reported
O2 BBH candidates, making several unwarranted but simplifying assumptions for the sensitivity
of the network and compleness of the reported set of events. Consistent with prior work, we find BHs
in binaries likely have low natal spin. With available results and a population favoring low spin,
we can't presently constrain the typical misalignments of the binary black hole population. All
of the tools described in this work are publicly available and ready-to-use to interpret real or
synthetic LIGO data, and to synthesize projected data from future observing runs.
