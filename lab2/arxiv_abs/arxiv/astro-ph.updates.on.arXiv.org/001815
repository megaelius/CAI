Spectral retrieval has been used to leverage features in emission spectra to constrain the atmospheric
composition and structure of transiting exoplanets. Most of the observed emission spectra consist
of broadband photometric observations of eclipses at a small number of wavelengths. We compare
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) of blackbody fits and spectral retrieval fits for the
43 planets with published eclipse measurements in multiple thermal wavebands, mostly obtained
with the Spitzer Space Telescope. In this under-constrained regime, uncertainties in eclipse
depth directly impact one's ability to constrain atmospheric properties. Spitzer has proven capable
of eclipse precisions better than 1E-4 when multiple eclipses are analyzed simultaneously, but
this feat has only been performed three times. It is harder to self-calibrate photometry when a single
occultation is reduced and analyzed in isolation; we find that such measurements have not passed
the test of repeatability. Single-eclipse measurements either have a systematic uncertainty
of sigma_syst = 4.5E-4, or their uncertainties have been underestimated by a factor of f_syst = 2.
If one accounts for this increased uncertainty, then the Bayesian evidence for spectral features
disappears: blackbodies have better BIC for all planets and the few planets that are poorly fit by
a blackbody are also poorly fit by spectral models. Claims of stratospheric inversions, high C/O
ratios, and disequilibrium chemistry based solely on photometry are premature. We recommend that
(1) observers be cautious of error estimates from self-calibration of small data sets, and (2) modelers
compare the Bayesian evidence for spectral models to that of simpler models such as blackbodies.
