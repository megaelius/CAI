Main sequence, solar-like stars (M < 1.5 Msun) have outer convective envelopes that are sufficiently
thick to affect significantly their overall structure. The radii of these stars, in particular,
are sensitive to the details of inefficient, super-adiabatic convection occurring in their outermost
layers. The standard treatment of convection in stellar evolution models, based on the Mixing-Length
Theory (MLT), provides only a very approximate description of convection in the super-adiabatic
regime. Moreover, it contains a free parameter, alpha_MLT, whose standard calibration is based
on the Sun, and is routinely applied to other stars ignoring the differences in their global parameters
(e.g., effective temperature, gravity, chemical composition) and previous evolutionary history.
In this paper, we present a calibration of alpha_MLT based on three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics
(3D RHD) simulations of convection. The value of alpha_MLT is adjusted to match the specific entropy
in the deep, adiabatic layers of the convective envelope to the corresponding value obtained from
the 3D RHD simulations, as a function of the position of the star in the (log g, log T_eff) plane and
its chemical composition. We have constructed a model of the present-day Sun using such entropy-based
calibration. We find that its past luminosity evolution is not affected by the entropy calibration.
The predicted solar radius, however, exceeds that of the standard model during the past several
billion years, resulting in a lower surface temperature. This illustrative calculation also demonstrates
the viability of the entropy approach for calibrating the radii of other late-type stars.
