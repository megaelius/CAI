The upcoming detection of gravitational waves by terrestrial interferometers will usher in the
era of gravitational-wave astronomy. This will be particularly true when space-based detectors
will come of age and measure the mass and spin of massive black holes with exquisite precision and
up to very high redshifts, thus allowing for better understanding of the symbiotic evolution of
black holes with galaxies, and for high-precision tests of General Relativity in strong-field,
highly-dynamical regimes. Such ambitious goals require that astrophysical environmental pollution
of gravitational-wave signals be constrained to negligible levels, so that neither detection
nor estimation of the source parameters are significantly affected. Here, we consider the main
sources for space-based detectors -the inspiral, merger and ringdown of massive black-hole binaries
and extreme mass-ratio inspirals- and account for various effects on their gravitational waveforms,
including electromagnetic fields, cosmological evolution, accretion disks, dark matter, ``firewalls''
and possible deviations from General Relativity. We discover that the black-hole quasinormal
modes are sharply different in the presence of matter than in vacuum, but the ringdown signal observed
by interferometers is typically unaffected. The effect of accretion disks and dark matter depends
critically on their geometry and density profile, but is negligible for most sources, except for
very few special extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Electromagnetic fields and cosmological effects
are always negligible. We finally explore the implications of our findings for proposed tests of
General Relativity with gravitational waves, and conclude that environmental effects will not
prevent the development of precision gravitational-wave astronomy.
