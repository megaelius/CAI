Here we explore the disk-jet connection in the broad-line radio quasar 4C+74.26, utilizing the
results of the multiwavelength monitoring of the source. The target is unique in that its radiative
output at radio wavelengths is dominated by a moderately-beamed nuclear jet, at optical frequencies
by the accretion disk, and in the hard X-ray range by the disk corona. Our analysis reveals a correlation
(local and global significance of 96\% and 98\%, respectively) between the optical and radio bands,
with the disk lagging behind the jet by $250 \pm 42$ days. We discuss the possible explanation for
this, speculating that the observed disk and the jet flux changes are generated by magnetic fluctuations
originating within the innermost parts of a truncated disk, and that the lag is related to a delayed
radiative response of the disk when compared with the propagation timescale of magnetic perturbations
along relativistic outflow. This scenario is supported by the re-analysis of the NuSTAR data, modelled
in terms of a relativistic reflection from the disk illuminated by the coronal emission, which returns
the inner disk radius $R_{\rm in}/R_{\rm ISCO} =35^{+40}_{-16}$. We discuss the global energetics
in the system, arguing that while the accretion proceeds at the Eddington rate, with the accretion-related
bolometric luminosity $L_{\rm bol} \sim 9 \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ $\sim 0.2 L_{\rm Edd}$,
the jet total kinetic energy $L_\textrm{j} \sim 4 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inferred from the
dynamical modelling of the giant radio lobes in the source, constitutes only a small fraction of
the available accretion power.
