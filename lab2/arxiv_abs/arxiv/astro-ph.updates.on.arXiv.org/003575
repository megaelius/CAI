Aims: The physics driving features such as breaks observed in galaxy surface brightness (SB) profiles
remains contentious. Here, we assess the importance of stellar radial motions in shaping their
characteristics. Methods: We use the simulated Milky Way-mass, cosmological discs, from the Ramses
Disc Environment Study (RaDES) to characterise the radial redistribution of stars in galaxies
displaying type I (pure exponentials), II (downbending), and III (upbending) SB profiles. We compare
radial profiles of the mass fractions and the velocity dispersions of different sub-populations
of stars according to their birth and current locations. Results: Radial redistribution of stars
is important in all galaxies regardless of their light profiles. Type II breaks seem to be a consequence
of the combined effects of outward-moving and accreted stars. The former produces shallower inner
profiles (lack of stars in the inner disc) and accumulate material around the break radius and beyond,
strengthening the break; the latter can weaken or even convert the break into a pure exponential.
Further accretion from satellites can concentrate material in the outermost parts, leading to
type III breaks that can coexist with type II breaks, but situated further out. Type III galaxies
would be the result of an important radial redistribution of material throughout the entire disc,
as well as a concentration of accreted material in the outskirts. In addition, type III galaxies
display the most efficient radial redistribution and the largest number of accreted stars, followed
by type I and II systems, suggesting that type I galaxies may be an intermediate case between types
II and III. In general, the velocity dispersion profiles of all galaxies tend to flatten or even ncrease
around the locations where the breaks are found. The age and metallicity profiles are also affected,
