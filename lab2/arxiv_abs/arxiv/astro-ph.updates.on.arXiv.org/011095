There is a well-known stellar parameter discrepancy for late K and M dwarfs, in that the observed
radii and temperatures are often respectively larger and cooler than predicted by theory by several
percent. In an on-going effort to elucidate this issue, we examine the double-lined Kepler eclipsing
binary star system KIC 8736245. We supplement the near-continuous 4-year Kepler light curve with
ground-based multicolor photometry from Mount Laguna Observatory and spectroscopy from the Hobby-Eberly
Telescope. The binary has an edge-on, circular 5.07 day orbit with stellar masses equal to $0.987\pm0.009$
and $0.782\pm0.009\,\text{M}_\odot$ and radii of $1.311 \pm 0.006$ and $0.804 \pm 0.004\,\text{R}_\odot$,
respectively, and an estimated age of 7-9 Gyr. We find that the stellar radii are consistent with
theoretical models within the uncertainties, whereas the temperature of the secondary star is
$\sim$6% cooler than predicted. An important aspect of this work is that the uncertainties derived
from a single epoch (individual night of observations) underestimates the overall system parameter
uncertainties due to the effect of the 1-4% fluctuations caused by stellar activity. Our error estimates
come from the spread in parameters measured at 8 epochs. From the periodicities in the light curve
and from the eclipse times, we measure candidate spin periods to be approximately 4.98 and 5.87 days
for the primary and secondary star. Surprisingly, these imply super- and sub-synchronous rotation
compared to the orbital period. Thus KIC 8736245 serves as an interesting case study for the exchange
of angular momentum and general stellar astrophysics as stars in binaries evolve off the main sequence.
