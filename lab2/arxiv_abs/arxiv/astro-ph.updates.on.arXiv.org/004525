We develop a Monte-Carlo code to compute the Compton scattered X-ray flux arising from a hot inner
flow which undergoes Lense-Thirring precession. The hot flow intercepts seed photons from an outer
truncated thin disk. A fraction of the Comptonized photons will illuminate back the disk and the
reflected/reprocessed photons will contribute to the observed spectrum. The total spectrum,
including disk thermal emission, hot flow Comptonization, and disk reflection, is modelled within
the framework of general relativity, taking light-bending and gravitational redshift into account.
The simulations are performed in the context of the Lense-Thirring precession model for the low-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations observed in X-ray flux of accreting black holes, so the inner flow
is assumed to precess, leading to periodic modulation of the emitted radiation. In this work, we
concentrate on the energy-dependent X-ray variability properties of the model and, in particular,
on the evolution of the variability during the spectral transition from hard to soft state, which
is implemented by the decrease of the truncation radius of the outer disk towards Innermost Stable
Circular Orbit (ISCO). It is found that, in the hard state where the Comptonizing flow is geometrically
thick, the disk thermal emission is not variable and the Comptonization is weakly variable with
the fractional variability amplitude of $\leq 10\%$; in the soft state where the Comptonizing flow
is cooled down and thus becomes geometrically thin, the disk emission varies with the variability
of $\sim$ a few percent, and the fractional variability of the Comptonization is highly variable,
increasing with photon energy. The fractional variability of the reflection increases with photon
energy, and the reflection emission for low spin is more variable than the one for high spin.
