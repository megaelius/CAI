We use the deep panchromatic dataset available in the GOODS-N field, spanning all the way from GALEX
ultra-violet to VLA radio continuum data, to select a star-forming galaxy sample at z~[0.5-4] and
robustly measure galaxy photometric redshifts, star formation rates, stellar masses and UV rest-frame
properties. We quantitatively explore, using mass-complete samples, the evolution of the star
formation activity and dust attenuation properties of star-forming galaxies up to z~4. Our main
results can be summarized as follows: i) we find that the slope of the SFR-M correlation is consistent
with being constant, and equal to ~0.8 at least up to z~1.5, while the normalization keeps increasing
to the highest redshift, z~4, we are able to explore; ii) for the first time in this work, we are able
to explore the FIR-radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming galaxies: the
correlation does not evolve up to z~4; iii) we confirm that galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for
UV dust attenuation in star-forming galaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated;
iv) strikingly, we find that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, the amount
of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 magnitudes over the redshift range [0.5-4] for a
fixed stellar mass, as opposed to a tenfold increase of star formation rate; v) this finding explains
the evolution of the SFR-Auv relation reported in literature: the same amount of star formation
is less attenuated at higher redshift because it is hosted in less massive, and less metal rich, galaxies;
vi) the correlation between dust attenuation and the UV spectral slope evolves in redshift, with
the median UV spectral slope of star-forming galaxies becoming bluer with redshift. By z~3, typical
UV slopes are inconsistent, given the measured dust attenuation, with the predictions of commonly
used empirical laws...
