Statistics of hierarchical systems containing three or more stars are continuously improving.
The Multiple Star Catalog (MSC) is currently the most comprehensive catalogue of multiple-star
systems and contains component masses, orbital periods, and additional information. The systems
in the MSC are interesting for several reasons, including the long-term dynamical evolution of
few-body systems. Although the secular evolution of triples and quadruples has been explored before,
a systematic study of the systems in the MSC including also quintuples and sextuples has not been
carried out. Here, we explore the main-sequence (MS) evolution of stars from the MSC based on approximately
2x10^5 secular dynamical integrations. We estimate statistical probabilities for strong interactions
during the MS such as tidal evolution and mass transfer, and the onset of dynamical instability.
Depending on the assumed model for the unknown orbital elements, we find that the fraction of noninteracting
systems is largest for triples (~0.9), and decreases to ~0.6-0.8 for sextuples. The fraction of
strong interactions increases from ~0.1 to ~0.2 from triples to sextuples, and the fraction of dynamically
unstable systems increases from ~0.001 to ~0.1-0.2. The larger fractions of strong interactions
and dynamical instability in systems with increasing multiplicity can be attributed to increasingly
complex secular evolution in these systems. Our results indicate that a significant fraction of
high-multiplicity systems interact or become dynamically unstable already during the MS, with
an increasing importance as the number of stars increases.
