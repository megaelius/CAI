The imaging sharpness of an X-ray telescope is chiefly determined by the optical quality of its focusing
optics, which in turn mostly depends on the shape accuracy and the surface finishing of the grazing-incidence
X-ray mirrors that compose the optical modules. To ensure the imaging performance during the mirror
manufacturing, a fundamental step is predicting the mirror point spread function (PSF) from the
metrology of its surface. Traditionally, the PSF computation in X-rays is assumed to be different
depending on whether the surface defects are classified as figure errors or roughness. [...] The
aim of this work is to overcome this limit by providing analytical formulae that are valid at any light
wavelength, for computing the PSF of an X-ray mirror shell from the measured longitudinal profiles
and the roughness power spectral density (PSD), without distinguishing spectral ranges with different
treatments. The method we adopted is based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle for computing the diffracted
intensity from measured or modeled profiles. In particular, we have simplified the computation
of the surface integral to only one dimension, owing to the grazing incidence that reduces the influence
of the azimuthal errors by orders of magnitude. The method can be extended to optical systems with
an arbitrary number of reflections - in particular the Wolter-I, which is frequently used in X-ray
astronomy - and can be used in both near- and far-field approximation. Finally, it accounts simultaneously
for profile, roughness, and aperture diffraction. We describe the formalism with which one can
self-consistently compute the PSF of grazing-incidence mirrors, [...] Finally, we validate this
by comparing the simulated PSF of a real Wolter-I mirror shell with the measured PSF in hard X-rays.
