We propose a revision of the system developed by L\'epine et al. (2007) for spectroscopic M subdwarf
classification. Based on an analysis of subdwarf spectra and templates from Savcheva et al. (2014),
we show thatthe CaH1 feature originally proposed by Gizis (1997) is important in selecting reliable
cool subdwarf spectra. This index should be used in combination with the [TiO5, CaH2+CaH3] relation
provided by L\'epine et al. (2007) to avoid misclassification results. In the new system, the dwarf-subdwarf
separators are first derived from a sample of more than 80,000 M dwarfs and a "labeled" subdwarf subsample,these
objects being all visually identified from their optical spectra. Based on these two samples, we
re-fit the initial [TiO5, CaH1] relation, and propose a new [CaOH, CaH1] relation supplementing
the [TiO5, CaH1] relation to reduce the impact of uncertainty in flux calibration on classification
accuracy. In addition, we recalibrate the $\zeta_{TiO/CaH}$ parameter defined in L\'epine et
al. (2007) to enable its successful application to LAMOST spectra. Using this new system, we select
candidates from LAMOST Data Release 4 and finally identify a set of 2791 new M subdwarf stars, covering
the spectral sequence from type M0 to M7. This sample contains a large number of objects located at
low Galactic latitudes, especially in the Galactic anti-center direction, expanding beyond previously
published halo- and thick disk-dominated samples. Besides, we detect magnetic activity in 141
objects. We present a catalog for this M subdwarf sample, including radial velocities, spectral
indices and errors, activity flags, with a compilation of external data (photometric and GAIA DR2
astrometric parameters). The catalog is provided on-line, and the spectra can be retrieved from
the LAMOST Data Release web portal.
