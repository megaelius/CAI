In this paper we compute corrections to the global Casimir effect of a massive scalar field around
a static mini black hole at zero and finite temperature due to the Rainbow's Gravity. For this we use
the analytical solutions for the scalar field with mass $m$ in the deformed Schwarzschild background.
The analysis is made by considering the limit for which the source mass, $M$, approaches zero, in
order to verify the effects of quantum gravity on the global Casimir effect in the final moments of
the evaporating black hole. Initially, we compute the corrected stable part of the Casimir energy
at zero temperature. At finite temperature we compute the corrected vacuum thermodynamic quantities
of the system: free energy, internal energy, entropy and heat capacity, including the high temperature
limits. We find a singular behavior for the Casimir energy at zero temperature as well as for all the
corresponding thermodynamic quantities when $m^2=\omega^2_P/\xi$ and this can be seen as the
limit of validity of the model. However the conclusions about the thermodynamic stability of the
vacuum are basically the same as in the uncorrected case. We also find that the remnant Casimir tension
over the event horizon is finite for any temperature and all parameter values. More importantly,
we show that the tension receives no corrections from Rainbow's Gravity for zero or finite temperature.
This points to the fact that such behavior may be an universal property of the black hole evaporation.
As a byproduct we correct the result of a recently published article about the subject, analysed
in the general relativity context, and find a positive remnant Casimir tension in the high temperature
limit, showing that this latter cannot "erase" the zero temperature remnant Casimir tension, as
concluded in that work. In fact the effect of high temperatures will be to double it.
