State of the art radial-velocity (RV) exoplanet searches are currently limited by RV signals arising
from stellar magnetic activity. We analyze solar observations acquired over a 3-year period during
the decline of Carrington Cycle 24 to test models of RV variation of Sun-like stars. A purpose-built
solar telescope at the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere
(HARPS-N) provides disk-integrated solar spectra, from which we extract RVs and $\log{R'_{\rm
HK}}$. The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) provides disk-resolved images of magnetic activity.
The Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) provides near-continuous solar photometry,
analogous to a Kepler light curve. We verify that the SORCE photometry and HARPS-N $\log{R'_{\rm
HK}}$ correlate strongly with the SDO-derived magnetic filling factor, while the HARPS-N RV variations
do not. To explain this discrepancy, we test existing models of RV variations. We estimate the contributions
of the suppression of convective blueshift and the rotational imbalance due to brightness inhomogeneities
to the observed HARPS-N RVs. We investigate the time variation of these contributions over several
rotation periods, and how these contributions depend on the area of active regions. We find that
magnetic active regions smaller than $60 \ \rm Mm^2$ do not significantly suppress convective blueshift.
Our area-dependent model reduces the amplitude of activity-induced RV variations by a factor of
two. The present study highlights the need to identify a proxy that correlates specifically with
large, bright magnetic regions on the surfaces of exoplanet-hosting stars.
