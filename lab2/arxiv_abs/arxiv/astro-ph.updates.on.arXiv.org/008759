A widely used method for parameterizing the outcomes of common envelopes (CEs) involves defining
an ejection efficiency, $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$, that represents the fraction of orbital
energy used to unbind the envelope as the orbit decays. Given $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$,
a prediction for the post-CE orbital separation is possible with knowledge of the energy required
to unbind the primary's envelope from its core. Unfortunately, placing observational constraints
on $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is challenging as it requires knowledge of the primary's structure
at the onset of the common envelope phase. Numerical simulations have also had difficulties reproducing
post-CE orbital configurations as they leave extended, but still bound, envelopes. Using detailed
stellar interior profiles, we calculate $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values for a matrix of
primary-companion mass pairs when the primary is at maximal extent in its evolution. We find that
the ejection efficiency is most sensitive to the properties of the surface-contact convective
region (SCCR). In this region, the convective transport timescales are often short compared to
orbital decay timescales, thereby allowing the star to effectively radiate orbital energy and
thus lower $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The inclusion of convection in numerical simulations
of CEs may aid ejection without the need for additional energy sources as the orbit must shrink substantially
further before the requisite energy can be tapped to drive ejection. Additionally, convection
leads to predicted post-CE orbital periods of less than a day in many cases, an observational result
that has been difficult to reproduce in population studies where $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$
is taken to be constant. Finally, we provide a simple method to calculate $\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{eff}}$
if the properties of the SCCR are known.
