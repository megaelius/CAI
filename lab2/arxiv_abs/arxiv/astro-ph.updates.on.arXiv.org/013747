Extragalactic planetary nebulae (PNe) are detectable through relatively strong nebulous [OIII]
emission and act as direct probes into the local stellar population. Because they have an apparently
universal invariant magnitude cut-off, PNe are also considered to be a remarkable standard candle
for distance estimation. Through detecting PNe within the galaxies, we aim to connect the relative
abundances of PNe to the properties of their host galaxy stellar population. By removing the stellar
background components from FCC 167 and FCC 219, we aim to produce PN luminosity functions (PNLF)
of these galaxies, and thereby also estimate the distance modulus to these two systems. Finally,
we test the reliability and robustness of our novel detection and analysis method. It detects unresolved
point sources by their [OIII] 5007{\AA} emission within regions that have previously been unexplored.
We model the [OIII] emissions in the spatial and spectral dimensions together, as afforded to us
by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), and we draw on data gathered as part of the Fornax3D
survey. For each source, we inspect the properties of the nebular emission lines to remove other
sources that might hinder the safe construction of the PNLF, such as supernova remnants and HII regions.
As a further step, we characterise any potential limitations and draw conclusions about the reliability
of our modelling approach through a set of simulations. By applying this novel detection and modelling
approach to integral field unit observations, we report for the distance estimates and luminosity-specific
PNe frequency values for the two galaxies. Furthermore, we include an overview of source contamination,
galaxy differences, and possible effects on the PNe populations in the dense stellar environments.
