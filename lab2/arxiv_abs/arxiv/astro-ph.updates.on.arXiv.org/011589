On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected the gravitational wave
(GW) signal S190814bv with a false alarm rate of 1 in $10^{25}$ years. The GW data indicated (with
$>$99\% probability) that the event had $M_1 \geq 5_\odot$ and $M_2 \leq 3 M_\odot$, suggesting
that it resulted from a neutron star--black hole (NSBH) merger (or potentially a low-mass binary
black hole merger). Due to the low false alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg$^2$ at 90\%),
S190814bv presented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an optical/near-infrared
counterpart to an NSBH merger. To search for potential counterparts, our collaboration (GROWTH)
performed real-time image subtractions on 6 nights of public Dark Energy Camera (DECam) $i$- and
$z$-band images that were acquired in the three weeks following the merger. The images covered $>$98\%
of the integrated probability area. Using a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically
undertook spectroscopy and imaging of potential counterpart candidates discovered in the DECam
data. Combining these data with a photometric redshift catalog that is $>$97\% complete in the volume
of interest, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to S190814bv. Here we present deep and
uniform photometric limits on the optical emission associated with the event. For the nearest consistent
GW distance, radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers constrain the ejecta mass of S190814bv
to be $M_\mathrm{ej} < 0.04$ $M_{\odot}$ at polar viewing angles, or $M_\mathrm{ej} < 0.03$ $M_{\odot}$
if the opacity is $\kappa < 2$ cm$^2$g$^{-1}$. Assuming a tidal deformability for the neutron star
compatible with GW170817 results, our limits would constrain the BH spin component aligned with
the orbital momentum to be $ \chi < 0.7$ for mass ratios $Q < 6$.
