The mean stellar alpha-to-iron abundance ratio ([$\alpha$/Fe]) of a galaxy is an indicator of galactic
star formation timescale. It is important for understanding the star formation history of early-type
galaxies (ETGs) as their star formation processes have basically stopped. Using the model templates
which are made by Vazdekis et al., we apply the pPXF based spectral fitting method to estimate the
[$\alpha$/Fe] of 196 high signal-to-noise ratio ETGs from the MaNGA survey. The velocity dispersions
within 1R$_e$ ($\sigma_{e}$) range from 27 to 270 km/s. We find a flat relation between the mean [$\alpha$/Fe]
within the 1R$_e^{maj}$ ellipses and log($\sigma_{e}$), even if limiting to the massive sample
with log($\sigma_{e}$/km s$^{-1}$)$>$1.9. However, the relation becomes positive after we exclude
the Mg$_1$ feature in our fits, which agrees with the results from the previous work with other stellar
population models, albeit with relatively large scatter. It indicates that the spectral fits with
Vazdekis models could give basically the consistent predictions of [$\alpha$/Fe] with previous
studies when the Mg$_b$ index is used, but do not work well at the Mg$_1$ band when their $\alpha$-enhanced
version is employed in the metal-rich regime. We suggest avoiding this rather wide index, which
covers 471\AA, as it might suffer from other effects such as flux-calibration issues. For reference,
we also measure the stellar population radial gradients within 1R$_e^{maj}$ ellipses. Due to the
low resolution of age estimations for old objects and the Mg$_1$ issue, the uncertainties of these
gradients cannot be neglected.
