Ultra-short period (USP) planets are a class of exoplanets with periods shorter than one day. The
origin of this sub-population of planets is still unclear, with different formation scenarios
highly dependent on the composition of the USP planets. A better understanding of this class of exoplanets
will, therefore, require an increase in the sample of such planets that have accurate and precise
masses and radii, which also includes estimates of the level of irradiation and information about
possible companions. Here we report a detailed characterization of a USP planet around the solar-type
star HD 80653 $\equiv$ EP 251279430 using the K2 light curve and 108 precise radial velocities obtained
with the HARPS-N spectrograph, installed on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. From the K2 C16 data,
we found one super-Earth planet ($R_{b}=1.613\pm0.071 R_{\oplus}$) transiting the star on a short-period
orbit ($P_{\rm b}=0.719573\pm0.000021$ d). From our radial velocity measurements, we constrained
the mass of HD 80653 b to $M_{b}=5.60\pm0.43 M_{\oplus}$. We also detected a clear long-term trend
in the radial velocity data. We derived the fundamental stellar parameters and determined a radius
of $R_{\star}=1.22\pm0.01 R_{\odot}$ and mass of $M_{\star}=1.18\pm0.04 M_{\odot}$, suggesting
that HD 80653, has an age of $2.7\pm1.2$ Gyr. The bulk density ($\rho_{b} = 7.4 \pm 1.1$ g cm$^{-3}$)
of the planet is consistent with an Earth-like composition of rock and iron with no thick atmosphere.
Our analysis of the K2 photometry also suggests hints of a shallow secondary eclipse with a depth
of 8.1$\pm$3.7 ppm. Flux variations along the orbital phase are consistent with zero. The most important
contribution might come from the day-side thermal emission from the surface of the planet at $T\sim3480$
K.
