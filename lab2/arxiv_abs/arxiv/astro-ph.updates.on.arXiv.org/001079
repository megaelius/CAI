Recent observations have shown that at least some close-in exoplanets maintain eccentric orbits
despite tidal circularization timescales that are typically shorter than stellar ages. We explore
gravitational interactions with a distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero
eccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar two-planet system subject
to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive interpretation of the resulting long-term
orbital evolution. We show that dissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity
ratios of the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own rate. Tidal damping
of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between periods of pericenter circulation and
libration, and the planetary system settles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly
aligned or anti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits decrease
very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid single-planet rate, and thus eccentric
orbits, even for close-in planets, can often survive much longer than the age of the system. Assuming
that an observed close-in planet on an elliptical orbit is apsidally-locked to a more distant, and
perhaps unseen companion, we provide a constraint on the mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity
of the companion. We find the observed two-planet system HAT-P-13 might be in just such an apsidally-locked
state, with parameters that obey our constraint well. We also survey close-in single planets, and
found that none provide compelling evidence for unseen companions. Instead, we suspect that (1)
orbits are circular, (2) tidal damping rates are slower than our assumption, or (3) a recent event
has excited these eccentricities. Our method should prove useful for interpreting the results
of current and future planet searches.
