Aims: Hydrogen deficient white dwarfs are characterized by very dense, fluid-like atmospheres
of complex physics and chemistry that are still poorly understood. The incomplete description
of these atmospheres by the models results in serious problems with the description of spectra of
these stars and subsequent difficulties in derivation of their surface parameters. Here, we address
the problem of infrared (IR) opacities in the atmospheres of cool white dwarfs by direct $ab$ $initio$
simulations of IR absorption of dense helium. Methods: We applied state-of-the-art density functional
theory-based quantum molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the time evolution of the induced
dipole moment. The IR absorption coefficients were obtained by the Fourier transform of the dipole
moment time autocorrelation function. Results: We found that a dipole moment is induced due to three-
and more-body simultaneous collisions between helium atoms in highly compressed helium. This
results in a significant IR absorption that is directly proportional to $\rm \rho_{\rm He}^3$,
where $\rho_{\rm He}$ is the density of helium. To our knowledge, this absorption mechanism has
never been measured or computed before and is therefore not accounted for in the current atmosphere
models. It should dominate the other collisionally induced absorptions (CIA), arising from $\rm
H-He$ and $\rm H_2-He$ pair collisions, and therefore shape the IR spectra of helium-dominated
and pure helium atmosphere cool white dwarfs for $\rm He/H>10^4$. Conclusions: Our work shows
that there exists an unaccounted IR absorption mechanism arising from the multi-collisions between
He atoms in the helium-rich atmospheres of cool white dwarfs, including pure helium atmospheres.
This absorption may be responsible for a yet unexplained frequency dependence of near- and mid-
IR spectra of helium-rich stars.
