Results. The PCA confirms the existence of the Gnevyshev gap (GG) for solar cycles at about 40% from
the start of the cycle. The temporal evolution of sunspot area data for even cycles shows that the
GG exists at least at the 95% confidence level for all sizes of sunspots. On the other hand, the GG is
shorter and statistically insignificant for the odd cycles of aerial sunspot data. Furthermore,
the analysis of sunspot area sizes for even and odd cycles of SC12-SC23 shows that the greatest difference
is at 4.2-4.6 years, where even cycles have a far smaller total area than odd cycles. The average area
of the individual sunspots of even cycles is also smaller in this interval. The statistical analysis
of the temporal evolution shows that northern sunspot groups maximise earlier than southern groups
for even cycles, but are concurrent for odd cycles. Furthermore, the temporal distributions of
odd cycles are slightly more leptokurtic than distributions of even cycles. The skewnesses are
0.37 and 0.49 and the kurtoses 2.79 and 2.94 for even and odd cycles, respectively. The correlation
coefficient between skewness and kurtosis for even cycles is 0.69, and for odd cycles, it is 0.90.
Conclusions. The separate PCAs for even and odd sunspot cycles show that odd cycles are more inhomogeneous
than even cycles, especially in GSN data. Even cycles, however, have two anomalous cycles: SC4 and
SC6. According to the analysis of the sunspot area size data, the GG is more distinct in even than odd
cycles. We also present another Waldmeier-type rule, that is, we find a correlation between skewness
and kurtosis of the sunspot group cycles.
