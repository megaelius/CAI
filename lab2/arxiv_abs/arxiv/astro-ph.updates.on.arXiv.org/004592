The first gravitational wave detections of mergers between black holes and neutron stars represent
a remarkable new regime of high-energy transient astrophysics. The signals observed with LIGO-Virgo
detectors come from mergers of extreme physical objects which are the end products of stellar evolution
within close binary systems. To better understand their origin and merger rates, we have performed
binary population syntheses at different metallicities using the new stellar grid based populations
synthesis code ComBinE. Starting from newborn pairs of stars, we follow their evolution including
mass loss, mass transfer and accretion, common envelopes and supernova explosions. We apply the
binding energies of common envelopes based on dense grids of detailed stellar structure models,
make use of improved investigations of the subsequent Case BB Roche-lobe overflow and scale supernova
kicks according to the stripping of the exploding stars. We demonstrate that all the double black
hole mergers, GW150914, LVT151012, GW151226, GW170104, GW170608 and GW170814, as well as the recently
reported double neutron star merger GW170817, are accounted for in our models in the appropriate
metallicity regime. Our binary interaction parameters are calibrated in particular to match the
accurately determined properties of Galactic double neutron star systems, and we discuss their
masses and types of supernova origin. Using our default values for the input physics parameters,
we find a double neutron star merger rate of about 3.0 Myr^-1 for Milky-Way equivalent galaxies.
Our absolute upper limit to the merger-rate density of double neutron star systems is R=400 yr^-1
Gpc^-3 in the local Universe (z=0).
