We observed Jupiter four times over a full rotation (10 hrs) with the upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA) between December 2013 and December 2014. Preliminary results at 4-17 GHz were
presented in de Pater et al. (2016); in the present paper we present the full data set at frequencies
between 3 and 37 GHz. Major findings are: (i) the radio-hot belt at 8.5--11$^\circ$N latitude, near
the interface between the North Equatorial Belt (NEB) and the Equatorial Zone (EZ) is prominent
at all frequencies (3--37 GHz). Its location coincides with the southern latitudes of the NEB (7--17$^{\circ}$
N). (ii) Longitude-smeared maps reveal belts and zones at all frequencies at latitudes $\lesssim
|20^\circ|$. The lowest brightness temperature is in the EZ near a latitude of 4$^\circ$N, and the
NEB has the highest brightness temperature near 11$^\circ$N. The bright part of the NEB increases
in latitudinal extent (spreads towards the north) with deceasing frequency, i.e., with depth into
the atmosphere. In longitude-resolved maps, several belts, in particular in the southern hemisphere,
are not continuous along the latitude line, but broken into small segments as if caused by an underlying
wave. (iii) Model fits to longitude-smeared spectra are obtained at each latitude. These show a
high NH$_3$ abundance (volume mixing ratio $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$) in the deep ($P>8-10$ bar) atmosphere,
decreasing at higher altitudes due to cloud formation (e.g., in zones), or dynamics in combination
with cloud condensation (belts). In the NEB ammonia gas is depleted down to at least the 20 bar level
with an abundance of $1.75 \times 10^{-4}$. (iv) Using the entire VLA dataset, we confirm that the
planet is extremely dynamic in the upper layers of the atmosphere, at $P<$2--3 bar, i.e., at the altitudes
where clouds form. [Abridged]
