We present new MUSE/VLT observations of a small globule in the Carina H II region that hosts the HH
900 jet+outflow system. Data were obtained with the GALACSI ground-layer adaptive optics system
in wide-field mode, providing spatially-resolved maps of diagnostic emission lines. These allow
us to measure the variation of the physical properties in the globule and jet+outflow system. We
find high temperatures ($T_e \approx 10^4$ K), modest extinction ($A_V \approx 2.5$ mag), and modest
electron densities ($n_e \approx 200$ cm$^{-3}$) in the ionized gas. Higher excitation lines trace
the ionized outflow; both the excitation and ionization in the outflow increase with distance from
the opaque globule. In contrast, lower excitation lines that are collisionally de-excited at densities
$\gtrsim 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ trace the highly collimated protostellar jet. Assuming the globule is
an isothermal sphere confined by the pressure of the ionization front, we compute a Bonnor-Ebert
mass of $\sim 3.7$ M$_{\odot}$. This is two orders of magnitude higher than previous mass estimates,
calling into question whether small globules like the Tadpole contribute to the bottom of the IMF.
Derived globule properties are consistent with a cloud that has been and/or will be compressed by
the ionization front on its surface. At the estimated globule photoevaporation rate of $\sim 5 \times
10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, the globule will be completely ablated in $\sim 7$ Myr. Stars that
form in globules like the Tadpole will emerge into the H II later and may help resolve some of the temporal
tension between disk survival and enrichment.
