The observations and simulations have revealed that large-scale magnetic field and outflows can
exist in the inner regions of an advection-dominated accretion disc where the resistive diffusion
may also be important. In the present paper, the roles of large-scale magnetic field and outflows
in the structure of resistive advection-dominated accretion discs are explored by assuming that
the accretion flow is radially self-similar. In the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation,
the results show that the angular velocity is always sub-Keplerian when both the outflow and the
large-scale magnetic field are taken into account. A stronger toroidal field component leads to
faster rotation, while the disc rotates with faster rate if the vertical field component is weaker.
The increase of magnetic diffusivity causes the infall velocity to be close to Keplerian velocity.
Although the previous studies in the ideal MHD approximation have shown that the disc temperature
decreases due to the vertical field component, we find that the effect of vertical field component
on the temperature of a resistive disc depends on the magnetic diffusivity. When the magnetic diffusivity
is high, the more efficient mechanism for decreasing the disc temperature can be the outflows, and
not the large-scale magnetic field. In such a limit of the magnetic diffusivity, the components
of the large-scale magnetic field enhance the gas temperature. The increase of temperature can
lead to heating and acceleration of the electrons and help us to explain the origin of phenomena such
as the flares in Sgr A*. On the other hand, the infall velocity in such a limit rises as the temperature
increases, and therefore the surface density falls to too low values. Any change in the density profile
can alter the structure and the emitted spectrum of disc.
