We report on a first census of Galactic black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) properties with the second
data release (DR2) of {\em Gaia}, focusing on dynamically confirmed and strong candidate black
hole transients. DR2 provides five-parameter astrometric solutions including position, parallax
and proper motion for 11 of a sample of 24 systems. Distance estimates are tested with parallax inversion
as well as Bayesian inference. We derive an empirically motivated characteristic scale length
of $L$=2.17$\pm$0.12 kpc for this BHXRB population to infer distances based upon an exponentially
decreasing space density prior. Geometric DR2 parallaxes provide new, independent distance estimates,
but the faintness of this population in quiescence results in relatively large fractional distance
uncertainties. Despite this, DR2 estimates generally agree with literature distances. The most
discrepant case is BW Cir, for which detailed studies of the donor star have suggested a distant location
at $\sim$25 kpc. A large DR2 measured parallax and relatively high proper motion instead prefer
significantly smaller distances, suggesting that the source may instead be amongst the nearest
of XRBs. However, both distances create problems for interpretation of the source, and follow-up
data are required to resolve its true nature. DR2 also provides a first distance estimate to one source,
MAXI J1820+070, and novel proper motion estimates for 7 sources. Peculiar velocities relative
to Galactic rotation exceed $\approx$50 km s$^{-1}$ for the bulk of the sample, with a median system
kinetic energy of peculiar motion of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{47}$erg. BW Cir could be a new high-velocity
BHXRB if its astrometry is confirmed. A putative anti-correlation between system kinetic energy
and black hole mass is found, though not yet constrained enough to distinguish BH formation channels.
