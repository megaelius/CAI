We study the spectroscopic evolution of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) later than 100 days after
maximum light. We present new data for Gaia16apd and SN2017egm, and analyse these with a larger sample
comprising 41 spectra of 12 events. The spectra become nebular within 2-4 $e$-folding times after
light curve peak, with the rate of spectroscopic evolution correlated to the light curve timescale.
Emission lines are identified with well-known transitions of oxygen, calcium, magnesium, sodium
and iron. SLSNe are differentiated from other Type Ic SNe by a prominent O I $\lambda$7774 line and
higher-ionisation states of oxygen. The iron-dominated region around 5000 \AA\ is more similar
to broad-lined SNe Ic than to normal SNe Ic. Principal Component Analysis shows that 5 `eigenspectra'
capture 75% of the variance, while a clustering analysis shows no clear evidence for multiple SLSN
sub-classes. Line velocities are 5000--8000 km/s, and show stratification of the ejecta. O I $\lambda$7774
likely arises in a dense inner region that also produces calcium emission, while [O I] $\lambda$6300
comes from further out until 300--400 days. The luminosities of O I $\lambda$7774 and Ca II suggest
significant clumping, in agreement with previous studies. Ratios of [Ca II]$\lambda$7300/[O
I]$\lambda$6300 favour progenitors with relatively massive helium cores, likely $\gtrsim 6$
M$_\odot$, though more modelling is required here. SLSNe with broad light curves show the strongest
[O I] $\lambda$6300, suggesting larger ejecta masses. We show how the inferred velocity, density
and ionisation structure point to a central power source.
