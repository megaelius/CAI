We report HST lightcurve observations of the New Horizons spacecraft encounter Kuiper Belt object
(KBO) (486958) 2014 MU69 acquired near opposition in July 2017. In order to plan the optimum flyby
sequence the New Horizons mission planners needed to learn as much as possible about the target in
advance of the encounter. Specifically, encounter timing could be adjusted to accommodate a highly
elongated, binary, or rapidly rotating target. HST astrometric (Porter et al. 2018) and stellar
occultation (Buie et al. 2018) observations constrained MU69's orbit and diameter (21-41 km for
an albedo of 0.15-0.04), respectively. Photometry from the astrometric dataset suggested a rotational
lightcurve amplitude of ge 0.3 mags, but they did not determine the period or provide shape information.
To that end we strategically spaced 24 HST orbits over 9 days to investigate rotation periods from
approximately 3-100 hours and to better constrain the lightcurve amplitude. Until New Horizons
detected MU69 in its optical navigation images in August 2018, this HST lightcurve campaign provided
the most accurate photometry to date. The mean variation in our data is 0.15 magnitudes which suggests
that MU69 is either nearly spherical (a:b axis ratio of 1:1.15), or its pole vector is pointed near
the line of sight to Earth; this interpretation does not preclude a near-contact binary or bi-lobed
object. However, image stacks do conclude that MU69 does not have a binary companion ge 2000km with
a sensitivity to 29th magnitude (an object a few km in size). Our data are not of sufficient signal
to noise to uniquely determine the period or amplitude so we do over analyze the data, however, they
did provide the necessary information for spacecraft planning. We report with confidence that
MU69 is not rapidly rotating AND highly elongated (which we define as a lightcurve amplitude ge 0.5
magnitude).
