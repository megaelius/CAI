Although highly successful on cosmological scales, Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models predict unobserved
over-dense `cusps' in dwarf galaxies and overestimate their formation rate. We consider an ultra-light
axion-like scalar boson which promises to reduce these observational discrepancies at galactic
scales. The model, known as Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), avoids cusps, suppresses small-scale power,
and delays galaxy formation via macroscopic quantum pressure. We compare the substructure and
density fluctuations of galactic dark matter haloes comprised of ultra-light axions to conventional
CDM results. Besides self-gravitating subhaloes, FDM includes non-virialized over-dense wavelets
formed by quantum interference patterns which are an efficient source of heating to galactic discs.
We find that, in the solar neighborhood, wavelet heating is sufficient to give the oldest disc stars
a velocity dispersion of $\sim 30 \: \mathrm{km} \: \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ within a Hubble time if energy
is not lost from the disc, the velocity dispersion increasing with stellar age as $\sigma_D \propto
t^{0.4}$ in agreement with observations. Furthermore, we calculate the radius-dependent velocity
dispersion and corresponding scale height caused by the heating of this dynamical substructure
in both CDM and FDM with the determination that these effects will produce a flaring that terminates
the Milky Way disc at $15 - 20 \: \mathrm{kpc}$. Although the source of thickened discs is not known,
the heating due to perturbations caused by dark substructure cannot exceed the total disc velocity
dispersion. Therefore, this work provides a lower bound on the FDM particle mass of $m_a > 0.6 \times
10^{-22} \mathrm{eV}$. Furthermore, FDM wavelets with this particle mass should be considered
a viable mechanism for producing the observed disc thickening with time.
