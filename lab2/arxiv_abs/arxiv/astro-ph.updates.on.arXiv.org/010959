Liquid water oceans are at the center of our search for life on exoplanets because water is a strict
requirement for life as we know it. However, oceans are dynamic habitats--and some oceans may be
better hosts for life than others. In Earth's ocean, circulation transports essential nutrients
such as P and controls the distribution and productivity of life. Of particular importance is upwelling
due to wind-driven divergence in surface layers, which returns essential nutrients that tend to
accumulate at depth via the biological pump back to the sunlit regions where life is concentrated.
Atmospheric buildup of biogenic gases like CH$_4$ that are produced in the subsurface ocean also
depends on upwelling. Ocean circulation is likely to impose constraints on the activity and atmospheric
expression of life in exo-oceans as well, but we lack an understanding of how ocean dynamics may differ
on other planets. We address this issue by using ROCKE-3D, a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM,
to investigate ocean dynamics on a diversity of habitable planets. Our results suggest that planets
that rotate slower and have higher surface pressure than Earth may be attractive targets for remote
life detection because upwelling is enhanced on these planets. Seasonal deepening of the mixed
layer on high obliquity planets may also enhance nutrient return from depth into the surface mixed
layer. Efficient nutrient recycling favors greater biological activity, more biosignature production,
and more detectable life. We also find that an absence of continents may be problematic for sustaining
a globally active, remotely detectable ocean biosphere due to limited nutrient fluxes from coastal
upwelling and continental weathering. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering
oceanographic phenomena for exoplanet life detection and motivate further contributions to the
emerging field of exo-oceanography.
