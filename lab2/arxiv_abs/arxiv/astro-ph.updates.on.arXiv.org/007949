Star formation in galaxies appears to be self-regulated by energetic feedback processes. Among
the most promising agents of feedback are cosmic rays (CRs), the relativistic ion population of
interstellar and intergalactic plasmas. In these environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless
and interact via collective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale
magnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical scales requires
a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic theory for CR transport in the self-confinement
picture, which includes CR diffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic
fields of Alfv\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes CRs to stream
along the magnetic field with the Alfv\'en velocity if resonant waves are sufficiently energetic.
However, numerical simulations struggle to capture this effect with current transport formalisms
and adopt regularization schemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving
an equation for the CR momentum density along the mean magnetic field and include a transport equation
for the Alfv\'en-wave energy. We account for energy exchange of CRs and Alfv\'en waves via the gyroresonant
instability and include other wave damping mechanisms. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate
that our new theory enables stable, self-regulated CR transport. The theory is coupled to magneto-hydrodynamics,
conserves the total energy and momentum, and correctly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport
formalisms in the steady-state flux limit. Because it is free of tunable parameters, it holds the
promise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation.
