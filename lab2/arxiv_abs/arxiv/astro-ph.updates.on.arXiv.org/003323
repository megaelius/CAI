If a significant fraction of the dark matter in the Universe is made of an ultra-light scalar field,
named fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with a mass $m_a$ of the order of $10^{-22}-10^{-21}$ eV, then its de
Broglie wavelength is large enough to impact the physics of large scale structure formation. In
particular, the associated cut-off in the linear matter power spectrum modifies the structure
of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the scales probed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of distant quasars.
We study this effect by making use of dedicated cosmological simulations which take into account
the hydrodynamics of the IGM. We explore heuristically the amplitude of quantum pressure for the
FDM masses considered here and conclude that quantum effects should not modify significantly the
non-linear evolution of matter density at the scales relevant to the measured Lyman-$\alpha$ flux
power, and for $m_a \geq 10^{-22}$ eV. We derive a scaling law between $m_a$ and the mass of the well-studied
thermal warm dark matter (WDM) model that is best adapted to the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, and
differs significantly from the one infered by a simple linear extrapolation. By comparing FDM simulations
with the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectra determined from the BOSS survey, and marginalizing
over relevant nuisance parameters, we exclude FDM masses in the range $10^{-22} \leq m_a < 2.3\times
10^{-21}$ eV at 95 % CL. Adding higher-resolution Lyman-$\alpha$ spectra extends the exclusion
range up to $2.9\times 10^{-21}$ eV. This provides a significant constraint on FDM models tailored
to solve the "small-scale problems" of $\Lambda$CDM.
