In this paper, we simulate Super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs) as the candles
to probe cosmology for the first time. SEAMBHs have been demonstrated to be able to provide a new tool
for estimating cosmological distance. Thus, we create a series of mock data sets of SEAMBHs, especially
in the high redshift region, to check their abilities to probe the cosmology. To fulfill the potential
of the SEAMBHs on the cosmology, we apply the simulated data to three projects. The first is the exploration
of their abilities to constrain the cosmological parameters, in which we combine different data
sets of current observations such as the cosmic microwave background from {\it Planck} and type
Ia supernovae from Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA). We find that the high redshift SEAMBHs can
help to break the degeneracies of the background cosmological parameters constrained by {\it Planck}
and JLA, thus giving much tighter constraints of the cosmological parameters. The second uses the
high redshift SEAMBHs as the complements of the low redshift JLA to constrain the early expansion
rate and the dark energy density evolution in the cold dark matter frame. Our results show that these
high redshift SEAMBHs are very powerful on constraining the early Hubble rate and the evolution
of the dark energy density; thus they can give us more information about the expansion history of
our Universe, which is also crucial for testing the $\Lambda$CDM model in the high redshift region.
Finally, we check the SEAMBH candles' abilities to reconstruct the equation of state of dark energy
at high redshift. In summary, our results show that the SEAMBHs, as the rare candles in the high redshift
region, can provide us a new and independent observation to probe cosmology in the future.
