Trees of fragmenting granules (TFG) and associated flows are suspected to playa major role in the
formation of the network in the quiet Sun. We investigate the counterparts, in terms of dynamics,
of surface structures detectable by high resolution observations in deeper layers up to 15 Mm, which
are only available from numerical simulations. The first aim is to demonstrate that TFG can be evidenced
either from surface intensitites, vertical (Vz), or Doppler (Vdop) velocities. The second is to
show that horizontal flows, which are derived from intensities or Vz/Vdop flows, are in good agreement,
and that this is the case for observations and numerical simulations. The third objective is to apply
this new Vz-based method to a 3D simulation to probe relationships between horizontal surface flows,
TFG, and deep vertical motions. The TFG were detected after oscillation filtering of intensities
or Vz/Vdop flows, using a segmentation and labelling technique. Surface horizontal flows were
derived from local correlation tracking (LCT) and from intensities or Vz/Vdop flows. These methods
were applied to Hinode observations, 2D surface results of a first simulation, and 3D Vz data of a
second simulation. We find that TFG and horizontal surface flows (provided by the LCT) can be detected
either from intensities or Vz/Vdop component, for high resolution observations and numerical
simulations. We apply this method to a 3D run providing the Vz component in depth. This reveals a close
relationship between surface TFG (5 Mm mesoscale) and vertical downflows 5 Mm below the surface.
We suggest that the dynamics of TFG form larger scales (the 15-20 Mm supergranulation) associated
with 15 Mm downflowing cells below the surface. The TFG and associated surface flows seem to be essential
to understanding the formation and evolution of the network at the meso and supergranular scale.
