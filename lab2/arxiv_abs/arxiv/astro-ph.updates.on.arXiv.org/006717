We derive cosmological constraints from the probability distribution function (PDF) of evolved
large-scale matter density fluctuations. We do this by splitting lines of sight by density based
on their count of tracer galaxies, and by measuring both gravitational shear around and counts-in-cells
in overdense and underdense lines of sight, in Dark Energy Survey (DES) First Year and Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) data. Our analysis uses a perturbation theory model (see companion paper Friedrich
at al.) and is validated using N-body simulation realizations and log-normal mocks. It allows us
to constrain cosmology, bias and stochasticity of galaxies w.r.t. matter density and, in addition,
the skewness of the matter density field. From a Bayesian model comparison, we find that the data
weakly prefer a connection of galaxies and matter that is stochastic beyond Poisson fluctuations
on <=20 arcmin angular smoothing scale. The two stochasticity models we fit yield DES constraints
on the matter density $\Omega_m=0.26^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $\Omega_m=0.28^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$
that are consistent with each other. These values also agree with the DES analysis of galaxy and shear
two-point functions (3x2pt) that only uses second moments of the PDF. Constraints on $\sigma_8$
are model dependent ($\sigma_8=0.97^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ and $0.80^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ for the two
stochasticity models), but consistent with each other and with the 3x2pt results if stochasticity
is at the low end of the posterior range. As an additional test of gravity, counts and lensing in cells
allow to compare the skewness $S_3$ of the matter density PDF to its LCDM prediction. We find no evidence
of excess skewness in any model or data set, with better than 25 per cent relative precision in the
skewness estimate from DES alone.
