CCAT-prime is a new 6 m crossed Dragone telescope designed to characterize the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) polarization and foregrounds, measure the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects of galaxy
clusters, map the [CII] emission intensity from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), and monitor accretion
luminosity over multi-year timescales of hundreds of protostars in the Milky Way. CCAT-prime will
make observations from a 5,600 m altitude site on Cerro Chajnantor in the Atacama Desert of northern
Chile. The novel optical design of the telescope combined with high surface accuracy ($<$10 $\mu$m)
mirrors and the exceptional atmospheric conditions of the site will enable sensitive broadband,
polarimetric, and spectroscopic surveys at sub-mm to mm wavelengths. Prime-Cam, the first light
instrument for CCAT-prime, consists of a 1.8 m diameter cryostat that can house seven individual
instrument modules. Each instrument module, optimized for a specific science goal, will use state-of-the-art
kinetic inductance detector (KID) arrays operated at $\sim$100 mK, and Fabry-Perot interferometers
(FPI) for the EoR science. Prime-Cam will be commissioned with staged deployments to populate the
seven instrument modules. The full instrument will consist of 60,000 polarimetric KIDs at a combination
of 220/280/350/410 GHz, 31,000 KIDS at 250/360 GHz coupled with FPIs, and 21,000 polarimetric KIDs
at 850 GHz. Prime-Cam is currently being built, and the CCAT-prime telescope is designed and under
construction by Vertex Antennentechnik GmbH to achieve first light in 2021. CCAT-prime is also
a potential telescope platform for the future CMB Stage-IV observations.
