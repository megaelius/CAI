It has been observed that low redshift early-type galaxies can be separated into slow and fast rotators
according to a proxy of specific stellar angular momentum, $\lambda_{R_e}$. Detailed studies
of a handful of nearby clusters have shown that slow rotators are generally found at the centres of
clusters where the number density is highest, whereas the fast rotators trace the trend followed
by early-type galaxies of increasing in number with local density. In this paper, we study the environmental
distribution of slow and fast rotators using the stellar kinematics of about 3900 galaxies from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey. For
galaxies in groups closer than $z=0.08$ that are not observed with MaNGA but satisfy the necessary
conditions for slow rotators, we visually assign slow/fast rotator classifications to obtain
a complete sample. Our final catalogue contains about 900 groups of five or more members. We observe
the kinematic morphology-density (kT-$\Sigma$) relation for each group and find an increasing
fraction of massive slow rotators with increasing number density. We provide evidence suggesting
that the observed lack of trends in angular momentum with environment at fixed stellar mass is partly
because the maximum density varies between clusters, and that the locations of massive slow rotators
are strongly correlated with peak densities in galaxy groups and clusters. We conclude that the
(projected) number density relative to the cluster peak is more fundamental than the absolute number
density in influencing the abundance of slow rotators. We find that the kT-$\Sigma$ relation does
exist at fixed stellar mass, and we rule out the hypothesis that the kT-$\Sigma$ relation is a result
of dynamical friction alone, instead arguing that massive slow rotators grow hierarchically in
tandem with their host clusters.
