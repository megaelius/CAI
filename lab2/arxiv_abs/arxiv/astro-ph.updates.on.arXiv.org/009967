We perform spatially resolved stellar population analysis for a sample of 69 early-type galaxies
(ETGs) from the CALIFA integral field spectroscopic survey, including 48 ellipticals and 21 S0's.
We generate and quantitatively characterize profiles of light-weighted mean stellar age and metallicity
within $\lesssim 2\text{R}_\text{eff}$, as a function of radius and stellar-mass surface density
$\mu_*$. We study in detail the dependence of profiles on galaxies' global properties, including
velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$, stellar mass, morphology. ETGs are universally characterized
by strong, negative metallicity gradients ($\sim -0.3\,\text{dex}$ per $\text{R}_\text{eff}$)
within $1\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$, which flatten out moving towards larger radii. A quasi-universal
local $\mu_*$-metallicity relation emerges, which displays a residual systematic dependence
on $\sigma_e$, whereby higher $\sigma_e$ implies higher metallicity at fixed $\mu_*$. Age profiles
are typically U-shaped, with minimum around $0.4\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$, asymptotic increase
to maximum ages beyond $\sim 1.5\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$, and an increase towards the centre. The
depth of the minimum and the central increase anti-correlate with $\sigma_e$. We qualitatively
interpret these observations in a two-phase scenario for the formation of ETGs. The region within
$1\,\text{R}_\text{eff}$ mainly results from the competing effects of dissipative collapse,
by which star formation proceeds outside-in and the negative metallicity gradient is established,
and of AGN feedback, resulting in an inside-out quenching that is more effective for larger $\sigma_e$
(due to the black-hole mass vs. $\sigma$ relation). The flatter stellar population profiles in
the outer regions likely result from the increasing contribution of accreted satellites, that
are quenched and low-metallicity.
