We present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic follow-up observations
of PTF11qcj, a type Ibn supernova discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory. Our observations
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array show that this event is the first radio-loud member of the
rare Ibn class: PTF11qcj reached a radio peak luminosity comparable to that of the famous gamma-ray-burst-associated
supernova 1998bw (L5GHz ~ 10^{29} erg/s/Hz). PTF11qcj is also detected in X-rays with the Chandra
observatory, and in the infrared band with Spitzer. Our multi-wavelength analysis probes the supernova
interaction with a Helium-rich circumstellar material. The radio observations suggest a progenitor
mass-loss rate of ~ 10^{-4} Msun/yr x (v_w/1000 km/s), and a velocity of ~(0.3-0.5)c for the fastest
moving ejecta (at about 10d after explosion). However, these estimates are derived assuming the
simplest model of supernova ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellar material, and could
be improved via modeling accounting for inhomogeneities in the medium and asphericity of the explosion.
The X-ray flux from PTF11qcj is compatible with the high-frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron
emission (within the large uncertainties). A light echo from pre-existing dust is in agreement
with our data. Our analysis of pre-explosion images from the Palomar Transient Factory suggests
that a precursor eruption of M_r ~ -13 mag may have occurred ~2.5 yr prior to the supernova explosion.
We conclude that PTF11qcj fits the expectations from the explosion of a Wolf-Rayet star of the WNE
class. Precursor eruptions may be a common feature during the final evolution of such stars.
