Aims. We present a multiwavelength study of the Be/X-ray binary system SAX J2103.5+4545 with the
goal of better characterizing the transient behaviour of this source. Methods. SAX J2103.5+4545
was observed by Swift-XRT four times in 2007 from April 25 to May 5, and during quiescence in 2012 August
31. In addition, this source has been monitored from the ground-based astronomical observatories
of El Teide (Tenerife, Spain), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) and Sierra Nevada (Granada,
Spain) since 2011 August, and from the TUBITAK National Observatory (Antalya, Turkey) since 2009
June. We have performed spectral and photometric temporal analyses in order to investigate the
different states exhibited by SAX J2103.5+4545. Results. In X-rays, an absorbed power law model
provided the best fit for all the XRT spectra. An iron-line feature at ~6.42 keV was present in all
the observations except for that taken during quiescence in 2012. The photon indexes are consistent
with previous studies of SAX J2103.5+4545 in high/low luminosity states. Pulsations were found
in all the XRT data from 2007 (2.839(2) mHz; MJD 54222.02), but not during quiescence. Both optical
outbursts in 2010 and 2012 lasted for about 8/9 months (as the one in 2007 probably did and the current
one in 2014 might do) and were most probably caused by mass ejection events from the Be star that eventually
fed the circumstellar disc. All of these outbursts started about 3 months before the triggering
of the X-ray activity, and about the same period before the maximum of the H_alpha line equivalent
width (in emission) was reached at only ~ -5 \AA. In this work we found that the global correlation
between the BV variability and the X-ray intensity was also observed at longer wavelengths in the
IR domain.
