The Chamaeleon molecular cloud complex is one of the nearest star-forming sites encompassing three
molecular clouds with a different star-formation history, from quiescent (Cha III) to actively
forming stars (Cha II), and reaching the end of star-formation (Cha I). To charactize its large-scale
structure, we derived column density and temperature maps using PACS and SPIRE observations from
the Herschel Gould Belt Survey, and applied several tools, such as filament tracing, power-spectra,
\Delta-variance, and probability distribution functions of column density (PDFs), to derive
physical properties. The column density maps reveal a different morphological appearance for
the three clouds, with a ridge-like structure for Cha I, a clump-dominated regime for Cha II, and
an intricate filamentary network for Cha III. The filament width is measured to be around 0.12\pm0.04
pc in the three clouds, and the filaments found to be gravitationally unstable in Cha I and II, but
mostly subcritical in Cha III. Faint filaments (striations) are prominent in Cha I showing a preferred
alignment with the large-scale magnetic field. The PDFs of all regions show a lognormal distribution
at low column densities. For higher densities, the PDF of Cha I shows a turnover indicative of an extended
higher density component, culminating with a power-law tail. Cha II shows a power-law tail with
a slope characteristic of gravity. The PDF of Cha III can be best fit by a single lognormal. The turbulence
properties of the three regions are found to be similar, pointing towards a scenario where the clouds
are impacted by large-scale processes. The magnetic field could possibly play an important role
for the star-formation efficiency in the Chamaeleon clouds if proven that it can effectively channel
material on Cha I, and possibly Cha II, but probably less efficiently on the quiescent Cha III cloud.
