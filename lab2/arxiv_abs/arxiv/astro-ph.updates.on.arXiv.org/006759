We study the flux-flux plots (FFPs) of the Seyfert galaxy SWIFT J2127.4+5654 which was observed
simultaneously by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The 0.7-2 keV FFPs show a non-linear behaviour, while
they are well fitted by a straight line, in the $\sim 2-40$ keV range. Without any additional modelling,
this result strongly suggests that neither absorption nor spectral slope variations can contribute
significantly to the observed variability above 2 keV (on time scales $\lesssim$5 days, at least).
The FFP method is capable of separating the variable and the constant X-ray spectral components
in this source. We found that the low-, average- and high-flux spectra of the variable components
are consistent with a power law varying in normalisation only plus a relativistic reflection component
varying simultaneously with the continuum. At low energies, we identify an additional variable
component, consistent with a neutral absorber with a variable covering fraction. We also detect
two spectral components whose fluxes remain constant over the duration of the observations. These
components can be well described by a blackbody emission of $kT_{\rm BB}\sim 0.18\, \rm keV$, dominating
at soft X-rays, and a reflection component from neutral material. The spectral model resulting
from the FFP analysis can fit well the energy spectra of the source. We suggest that a combined study
of FFPs and energy spectra in the case of X-ray bright and variable Seyferts can identify, unambiguously,
the various spectral components, and can lift the degeneracy that is often observed within different
models fitting equally well time-averaged spectra of these objects.
