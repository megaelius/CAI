A magnetohydrodynamic model that includes a complete electrical conductivity tensor is used to
estimate conditions for photospherically driven, linear, non-plane Alfvenic oscillations extending
from the photosphere to the lower corona to drive a chromospheric heating rate due to Pedersen current
dissipation that is comparable to the net chromospheric net radiative loss of $\sim 10^7$ ergs-cm$^{-2}$-sec$^{-1}$.
The heating rates due to electron current dissipation in the photosphere and corona are also computed.
The wave amplitudes are computed self-consistently as functions of an inhomogeneous background
(BG) atmosphere. The effects of the conductivity tensor are resolved numerically using a resolution
of 3.33 m. The oscillations drive a chromospheric heating flux $F_{Ch} \sim 10^7 - 10^8$ ergs-cm$^{-2}$-sec$^{-1}$
at frequencies $\nu \sim 10^2 - 10^3$ mHz for BG magnetic field strengths $B \gtrsim 700$ G and magnetic
field perturbation amplitudes $\sim 0.01 - 0.1$ $B$. The total resistive heating flux increases
with $\nu$. Most heating occurs in the photosphere. Thermalization of Poynting flux in the photosphere
due to electron current dissipation regulates the Poynting flux into the chromosphere, limiting
$F_{Ch}$. $F_{Ch}$ initially increases with $\nu$, reaches a maximum, and then decreases with
increasing $\nu$ due to increasing electron current dissipation in the photosphere. The resolution
needed to resolve the oscillations increases from $\sim 10$ m in the photosphere to $\sim 10$ km in
the upper chromosphere, and is proportional to $\nu^{-1/2}$. Estimates suggest that these oscillations
are normal modes of photospheric flux tubes with diameters $\sim 10-20$ km, excited by magnetic
reconnection in current sheets with thicknesses $\sim 0.1$ km.
