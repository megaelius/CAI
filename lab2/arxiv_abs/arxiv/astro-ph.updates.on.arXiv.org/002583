[Abridged] We report observations of the recently discovered, nearby late-M dwarf WISE J072003.20-084651.2.
Astrometric measurements obtained with TRAPPIST improve the distance measurement to 6.0$\pm$1.0
pc and confirm the low tangential velocity (3.5$\pm$0.6 km/s) reported by Scholz. Low-resolution
optical spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of M9.5 and prominent H$\alpha$ emission (<LH$\alpha$/Lbol>
= -4.68$\pm$0.06), but no evidence of subsolar metallicity or Li I absorption. Near-infrared spectroscopy
reveals subtle peculiarities indicating the presence of a T5 binary companion, and high-resolution
laser guide star adaptive optics imaging reveals a faint ($\Delta$H = 4.1) candidate source 0"14
(0.8 AU) from the primary. We measure a stable radial velocity of +83.8$\pm$0.3 km/s, indicative
of old disk kinematics and consistent with the angular separation of the possible companion. We
measure a projected rotational velocity of v sin i = 8.0$\pm$0.5 km/s, and find evidence of low-level
variability (~1.5%) in a 13-day TRAPPIST lightcurve, but cannot robustly constrain the rotational
period. We also observe episodic changes in brightness (1-2%) and occasional flare bursts (4-8%)
with a 0.8% duty cycle, and order-of-magnitude variations in H$\alpha$ line strength. Combined,
these observations reveal WISE J0720-0846 to be an old, very low-mass binary whose components straddle
the hydrogen burning minimum mass, and whose primary is a relatively rapid rotator and magnetically
active. It is one of only two known binaries among late M dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun, both harboring
a mid T-type brown dwarf companion. While this specific configuration is rare (1.4% probability),
roughly 25% of binary companions to late-type M dwarfs in the local population are likely low-temperature
T or Y brown dwarfs.
