We have conducted a survey of young single and multiple systems in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming
region with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), substantially improving both the spatial
resolution and sensitivity with which individual protoplanetary disks in these systems have been
observed. These ALMA observations can resolve binary separations as small as 25--30 AU and have
an average 3$\sigma$ detection level of 0.35 mJy, equivalent to a disk mass of $4 \times 10^{-5}$
M$_{\odot}$ for an M3 star. Our sample was constructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or
signs of accretion and have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher order multiple
systems observed, we detect $\lambda = 1.3$ mm continuum emission from one or more stars in all of
our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of Taurus, our 21 new detections increase the
fraction of millimeter-detected disks to over 75% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries,
and companions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the wealth of other information
available for these stars, this has allowed us to study the impact of multiplicity with a much larger
sample. While millimeter flux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies,
we find that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations of 30 to 4200 AU have
lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar mass than single stars. We also find that
for these systems, the circumstellar disk around the primary star does not dominate the total disk
mass in the system and contains on average 62% of the total mass.
