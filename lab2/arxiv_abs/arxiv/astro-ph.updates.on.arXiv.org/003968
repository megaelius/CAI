Due to the high stellar densities in young clusters, planetary systems formed in these environments
are likely to have experienced perturbations from encounters with other stars. We carry out direct
$N$-body simulations of multi-planet systems in star clusters to study the combined effects of
stellar encounters and internal planetary dynamics. These planetary systems eventually become
part of the Galactic field population the parental cluster dissolves, which is where most presently-known
exoplanets are observed. We show that perturbations induced by stellar encounters lead to distinct
signatures in the field planetary systems, most prominently, the excited orbital inclinations
and eccentricities. Planetary systems that form within the cluster's half-mass radius are more
prone to such perturbations. The orbital elements are most strongly excited in the outermost orbit,
but the effect propagates to the entire planetary system through secular evolution. Planet ejections
may occur long after a stellar encounter. The surviving planets in these reduced systems tend to
have, on average, higher inclinations and larger eccentricities compared to systems that were
perturbed less strongly. As soon as the parental star cluster dissolves, external perturbations
stop affecting the escaped planetary systems, and further evolution proceeds on a relaxation time
scale. The outer regions of these ejected planetary systems tend to relax so slowly that their state
carries the memory of their last strong encounter in the star cluster. Regardless of the stellar
density, we observe a robust anticorrelation between multiplicity and mean inclination/eccentricity.
We speculate that the "Kepler dichotomy" observed in field planetary systems is a natural consequence
of their early evolution in the parental cluster.
