Massive young stellar object (MYSOs) form during the collapse of high-mass pre-stellar cores,
where infalling molecular material is accreted through a centrifugally-balanced accretion disc
that is subject to efficient gravitational instabilities. In the resulting fragmented accretion
disc of the MYSO, gaseous clumps and low-mass stellar companions can form, which will influence
the future evolution of massive protostars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We perform dust
continuum radiative transfer calculations and compute synthetic images of disc structures modelled
by the gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of a forming MYSO, in order to investigate
the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observability of circumstellar gaseous
clumps and forming multiple systems. Both spiral arms and gaseous clumps located at ~a few 100 au
from the protostar can be resolved by interferometric ALMA Cycle 7 C43-8 and C43-10 observations
at band 6 (1.2 mm), using a maximal 0.015" beam angular resolution and at least 10-30 min exposure
time for sources at distances of 1-2 kpc. Our study shows that substructures are observable regardless
of their viewing geometry or can be inferred in the case of an edge-viewed disc. The observation probability
of the clumps increases with the gradually increasing efficiency of gravitational instability
at work as the disc evolves. As a consequence, large discs around MYSOs close to the zero-age-main-sequence
line exhibit more substructures than at the end of the gravitational collapse. Our results motivate
further observational campaigns devoted to the close surroundings of the massive protostars S255IR-NIRS3
and NGC 6334I-MM1, whose recent outbursts are a probable signature of disc fragmentation and accretion
variability.
