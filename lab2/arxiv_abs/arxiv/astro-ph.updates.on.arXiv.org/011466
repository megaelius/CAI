The formation of cosmic structure culminates with the assembly of galaxy clusters, a process quite
different from cluster to cluster. We present the study of the structure and dynamics of the Lyra
complex formed of the two clusters RXC J1825.3+3026 and CIZA J1824.1+3029, very recently studied
using both X-ray and radio data. This is the first analysis based on kinematics of member galaxies.
New spectroscopic data for 285 galaxies were acquired at the Italian Telescopio Nazionale Galileo
and used in combination with PanSTARRS photometry. The result of our member selection is a sample
of 198 galaxies. For RXCJ1825 and CIZAJ1824 we report the redshifts, z=0.0645 and z=0.0708, the
first estimates of velocity dispersion, sigmav=995 and 700 km/s, and dynamical mass, M200=1.1E15
and 4E14 Msun. The past assembly of RXCJ1825 is traced by the two dominant galaxies, both aligned
with the major axis of the galaxy distribution along the East-West direction, and by a minor North-East
substructure. We also detect a quite peculiar high velocity field in the South-West region of the
Lyra complex. This feature is likely related to a high velocity, very luminous galaxy, suggested
to be the central galaxy of a group in interaction with RXCJ1825 by very recent studies based on X-ray
and radio data. The redshift of the whole Lyra complex is z=0.067. Assuming that the redshift difference
between RXCJ1825 and CIZAJ1824 is due to the relative kinematics, the projected distance between
the cluster centers is 1.3 Mpc and the los velocity difference is 1750 km/s. A dynamical analysis
of the system shows that the two clusters are likely to be gravitationally bound, in a pre-merger
phase, with CIZAJ1824 in front of RXCJ1825 and going toward it. Our results corroborate a picture
where the Lyra region is the place of a very complex scenario of cluster assembly.
