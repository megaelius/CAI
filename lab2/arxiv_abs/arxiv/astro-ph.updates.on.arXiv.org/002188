We present data collected using the camera PISCES coupled with the Firt Light Adaptive Optics (FLAO)
mounted at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The images were collected using two natural guide
stars with an apparent magnitude of R<13 mag. During these observations the seeing was on average
~0.9". The AO performed very well: the images display a mean FWHM of 0.05 arcsec and of 0.06 arcsec
in the J- and in the Ks-band, respectively. The Strehl ratio on the quoted images reaches 13-30% (J)
and 50-65% (Ks), in the off and in the central pointings respectively. On the basis of this sample
we have reached a J-band limiting magnitude of ~22.5 mag and the deepest Ks-band limiting magnitude
ever obtained in a crowded stellar field: Ks~23 mag. J-band images display a complex change in the
shape of the PSF when moving at larger radial distances from the natural guide star. In particular,
the stellar images become more elongated in approaching the corners of the J-band images whereas
the Ks-band images are more uniform. We discuss in detail the strategy used to perform accurate and
deep photometry in these very challenging images. In particular we will focus our attention on the
use of an updated version of ROMAFOT based on asymmetric and analytical Point Spread Functions.
The quality of the photometry allowed us to properly identify a feature that clearly shows up in NIR
bands: the main sequence knee (MSK). The MSK is independent of the evolutionary age, therefore the
difference in magnitude with the canonical clock to constrain the cluster age, the main sequence
turn off (MSTO), provides an estimate of the absolute age of the cluster. The key advantage of this
new approach is that the error decreases by a factor of two when compared with the classical one. Combining
ground-based Ks with space F606W photometry, we estimate the absolute age of M15 to be 13.70+-0.80
Gyr.
