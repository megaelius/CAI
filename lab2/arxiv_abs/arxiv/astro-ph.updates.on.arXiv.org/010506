We present the next generation public exoplanet fitting software, EXOFASTv2. It is capable of fitting
an arbitrary number of planets, radial velocity data sets, astrometric data sets, and/or transits
observed with any combination of wavelengths. We model the star simultaneously in the fit and provide
several state-of-the-art ways to constrain its properties, including taking advantage of the
now-ubiquitous all-sky catalog photometry and Gaia parallaxes. EXOFASTv2 can model the star by
itself, too. Multi-planet systems are modeled self-consistently with the same underlying stellar
mass that defines their semi-major axes through Kepler's law and the planetary period. Transit
timing, duration, and depth variations can be modeled with a simple command line option. We explain
our methodology and rationale as well as provide an improved version of the core transit model that
is both 25\% faster and more accurate. We highlight several potential pitfalls in exoplanet modeling,
including the handling of eccentricity in transit-only fits, that the standard exoplanet convention
for $\omega$ uses a left-handed coordinate system, contrary to most modern textbooks, how to avoid
an important degeneracy when allowing negative companion masses, and a widely unappreciated,
potential 10-minute ambiguity in the reported transit times. EXOFASTv2 is available at https://github.com/jdeast/EXOFASTv2
. The code is written in IDL, and includes an executable that can be run freely and legally without
an IDL license or any knowledge of the language. Extensive documentation and tutorials are included
in the distribution for a variety of example fits. Advanced amateurs and undergrads have successfully
performed sophisticated global fits of complex planetary systems with EXOFASTv2. It is therefore
a powerful tool for education and outreach as well as the broader professional community.
