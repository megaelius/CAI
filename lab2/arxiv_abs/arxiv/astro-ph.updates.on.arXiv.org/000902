The data were obtained using two spectropolarimeters - Narval at the Bernard Lyot Telescope, Pic
du Midi, France, and ESPaDOnS at CFHT, Hawaii. Thirty-eight circularly-polarized spectra have
been collected in the period June 2010 - January 2012. The Least Square Deconvolution method was
applied for extracting high signal-to-noise ratio line profiles, from which we measure the surface-averaged
longitudinal magnetic field Bl. Chromospheric activity indicators CaII K, H_alpha, CaII IR (854.2
nm) and radial velocity were simultaneously measured and their variability was analysed together
with the behavior of Bl. The Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) inversion technique was employed for reconstruction
of the large-scale magnetic field and two magnetic maps of Beta Ceti are presented for two periods
(June 2010 - December 2010 and June 2011 - January 2012). Bl remains of positive polarity for the whole
observational period. The behavior of the line activity indicators is in good agreement with the
Bl variations. The two ZDI maps show a mainly axisymmetric and poloidal magnetic topology and a simple
surface magnetic field configuration dominated by a dipole. Little evolution is observed between
the two maps, in spite of a 1 yr interval between both subsets. We also use state-of-the-art stellar
evolution models to constrain the evolutionary status of Beta Ceti. We derive a mass of 3.5 M_sun
and propose that this star is already in the central-helium burning phase. Taking into account all
our results and the evolutionary status of the star, we suggest that dynamo action alone may not be
eficient enough to account for the high magnetic activity of Beta Ceti. As an alternate option, we
propose that it may be an Ap star descendant presently undergoing central helium-burning and still
exhibiting a remnant of the Ap star magnetic field.
