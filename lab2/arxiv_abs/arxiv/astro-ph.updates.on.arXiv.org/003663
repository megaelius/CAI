The heavy mass loss observed in evolved asymptotic giant branch stars is usually attributed to a
two-step process: atmospheric levitation by pulsation-induced shock waves, followed by radiative
acceleration of newly formed dust grains. Detailed wind models suggest that the outflows of M-type
AGB stars may be triggered by photon scattering on Fe-free silicates with grain sizes of about 0.1
- 1 $\mu$m. Due to the low grain temperature, these Fe-free silicates can condense close to the star,
but they do not produce the characteristic mid-IR features that are often observed in M-type AGB
stars. However, it is probable that the silicate grains are gradually enriched with Fe as they move
away from the star, to a degree where the grain temperature stays below the sublimation temperature,
but is high enough to produce emission features. We investigate whether differences in grain temperature
in the inner wind region, which are related to changes in the grain composition, can be detected with
current interferometric techniques, in order to put constraints on the wind mechanism. To investigate
this we use radial structures of the atmosphere and wind of an M-type AGB star, produced with the 1D
radiation-hydrodynamical code DARWIN. The spectral energy distribution is found to be a poor indicator
of different temperature profiles and therefore is not a good tool for distinguishing different
scenarios of changing grain composition. However, spatially resolved interferometric observations
have promising potential. They show signatures even for Fe-free silicates (found at 2-3 stellar
radii), in contrast to the spectral energy distribution. Observations with baselines that probe
spatial scales of about 4 stellar radii and beyond are suitable for tracing changes in grain composition,
since this is where effects of Fe enrichment should be found.
