The aim of this work is to investigate the characteristics of the young stellar population in the
spiral galaxy NGC 247. In particular, we focused our attention in its hierarchical clustering distributions
and the properties of the smallest groups. We used multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data from
three fields covering more than half of NGC 247 to select the young population. Then, through the
path linkage criterion (PLC), we found compact young star groups, and estimated their fundamental
parameters, such as their stellar densities, sizes, amount of members and luminosity function
(LF) slopes. We also performed a fractal analysis to determinate the clustering properties of this
population. We build a stellar density map and the corresponding dendrograms corresponding to
the galactic young population to detect large structures and draw their main characteristics.
We detected 339 young star groups, for which we computed a mean radius of $\sim$ 60 pc and a maximum
in the size distribution between 30 and 70 pc. We also obtained LF slopes with a bimodal distribution
showing peaks at $\sim$ 0.1 and $\sim$ 0.2. We identified several candidates to HII regions which
follow an excellent spatial correlation with the young groups found by the PLC. We observed that
the young population are hierarchically organized, where the smaller and denser structures are
within larger and less dense ones. We noticed that all these groups presented a fractal subclustering,
following the hierarchical distribution observed in the corresponding stellar density map. For
the large young structures observed in this map, we obtained a fractal dimension of $\sim$ 1.6-1.8
using the perimeter-area relation and the cumulative size distribution. These values are consistent
with a scenario of hierarchical star formation.
