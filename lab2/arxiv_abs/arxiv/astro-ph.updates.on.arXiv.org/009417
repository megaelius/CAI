We present the SCUBA-2 850 ${\mu}m$ component of JINGLE, the new JCMT large survey for dust and gas
in nearby galaxies, which with 193 galaxies is the largest targeted survey of nearby galaxies at
850 ${\mu}m$. We provide details of our SCUBA-2 data reduction pipeline, optimised for slightly
extended sources, and including a calibration model adjusted to match conventions used in other
far-infrared data. We measure total integrated fluxes for the entire JINGLE sample in 10 infrared/submillimetre
bands, including all WISE, Herschel-PACS, Herschel-SPIRE and SCUBA-2 850 ${\mu}m$ maps, statistically
accounting for the contamination by CO(J=3-2) in the 850 ${\mu}m$ band. Of our initial sample of
193 galaxies, 191 are detected at 250 ${\mu}m$ with a $\geq$ 5${\sigma}$ significance. In the SCUBA-2
850 ${\mu}m$ band we detect 126 galaxies with $\geq$ 3${\sigma}$ significance. The distribution
of the JINGLE galaxies in far-infrared/sub-millimetre colour-colour plots reveals that the sample
is not well fit by single modified-blackbody models that assume a single dust-emissivity index
$(\beta)$. Instead, our new 850 ${\mu}m$ data suggest either that a large fraction of our objects
require $\beta < 1.5$, or that a model allowing for an excess of sub-mm emission (e.g., a broken dust
emissivity law, or a very cold dust component 10 K) is required. We provide relations to convert far-infrared
colours to dust temperature and $\beta$ for JINGLE-like galaxies. For JINGLE the FIR colours correlate
more strongly with star-formation rate surface-density rather than the stellar surface-density,
suggesting heating of dust is greater due to younger rather than older stellar-populations, consistent
with the low proportion of early-type galaxies in the sample.
