Weakly collisional, magnetised plasmas characterised by anisotropic viscosity and conduction
are ubiquitous in galaxies, halos and the intracluster medium (ICM). Cosmic rays (CRs) play an important
role in these environments as well, by providing additional pressure and heating to the thermal
plasma. We carry out a linear stability analysis of weakly collisional plasmas with cosmic rays
using Braginskii MHD for the thermal gas. We assume that the CRs stream at the Alfv\'en speed, which
in a weakly collisional plasma depends on the pressure anisotropy ($\Delta p$) of the thermal plasma.
We find that this $\Delta p$-dependence introduces a phase shift between the CR-pressure and gas-density
fluctuations. This drives a fast-growing acoustic instability: CRs offset the damping of acoustic
waves by anisotropic viscosity and give rise to wave growth when the ratio of CR pressure to gas pressure
is $\gtrsim \alpha \beta^{-1/2}$, where $\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, and
$\alpha$, typically $\lesssim 1$, depends on other dimensionless parameters. In high-$\beta$
environments like the ICM, this condition is satisfied for small CR pressures. We speculate that
the instability studied here may contribute to the scattering of high-energy CRs and to the excitation
of sound waves in galaxy-halo, group and cluster plasmas, including the long-wavelength X-ray
fluctuations in \textit{Chandra} observations of the Perseus cluster. It may also be important
in the vicinity of shocks in dilute plasmas (e.g., cluster virial shocks or galactic wind termination
shocks), where the CR pressure is locally enhanced.
