The heliospheric magnetic field is of pivotal importance in solar and space physics. The field is
rooted in the Sun's photosphere, where it has been observed from ground- and space-based observatories
for over four decades. Global maps of the solar magnetic field based on full disk magnetograms are
commonly used as boundary conditions for coronal and solar wind models. Two primary observational
constraints on the models are (1) the open field regions in the model should approximately correspond
to coronal holes observed in emission, and (2) the magnitude of the open magnetic flux in the model
should match that inferred from in situ spacecraft measurements. In this study, we calculate both
MHD and PFSS solutions using fourteen different magnetic maps produced from five different types
of observatory magnetograms, for the time period surrounding July, 2010. We have found that for
all of the model/map combinations, models that have coronal hole areas close to observations underestimate
the interplanetary magnetic flux, or, conversely, for models to match the interplanetary flux,
the modeled open field regions are larger than coronal holes observed in EUV emission. In an alternative
approach, we estimate the open magnetic flux entirely from solar observations by combining automatically
detected coronal holes for Carrington rotation 2098 with observatory synoptic magnetic maps for
this time period. We show that this method also underestimates the interplanetary magnetic flux.
Our results imply that either typical observatory maps underestimate the Sun's magnetic flux,
or a significant portion of the open magnetic flux is not rooted in regions that are obviously dark
in EUV and X-ray emission.
