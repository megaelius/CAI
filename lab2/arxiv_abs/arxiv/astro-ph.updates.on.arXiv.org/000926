We have combined the semi-analytic galaxy formation model of Guo et al. (2011) with the particle-tagging
technique of Cooper et al. (2010) to predict galaxy surface brightness profiles in a representative
sample of ~1900 massive dark matter haloes (10^12--10^14 M_sol) from the Millennium II Lambda-CDM
N-body simulation. Here we present our method and basic results focusing on the outer regions of
galaxies, consisting of stars accreted in mergers. These simulations cover scales from the stellar
haloes of Milky Way-like galaxies to the 'cD envelopes' of groups and clusters, and resolve low surface
brightness substructure such as tidal streams. We find that the surface density of accreted stellar
mass around the central galaxies of dark matter haloes is well described by a Sersic profile, the
radial scale and amplitude of which vary systematically with halo mass (M_200). The total stellar
mass surface density profile breaks at the radius where accreted stars start to dominate over stars
formed in the galaxy itself. This break disappears with increasing M_200 because accreted stars
contribute more of the total mass of galaxies, and is less distinct when the same galaxies are averaged
in bins of stellar mass, because of scatter in the relation between M_star and M_200. To test our model
we have derived average stellar mass surface density profiles for massive galaxies at z~0.08 by
stacking SDSS images. Our model agrees well with these stacked profiles and with other data from
the literature, and makes predictions that can be more rigorously tested by future surveys that
extend the analysis of the outer structure of galaxies to fainter isophotes. We conclude that it
is likely that the outer structure of the spheroidal components of galaxies is largely determined
by collisionless merging during their hierarchical assembly
