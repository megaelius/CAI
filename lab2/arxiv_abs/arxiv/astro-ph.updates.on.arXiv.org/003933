We have studied the chemical enrichment history of the interstellar medium through an analysis
of the n-dimensional stellar abundances space. This work is a non-parametric analysis of the stellar
chemical abundance space. The main goal is to study the stars from their organization within this
abundance space. Within this space, we seek to find clusters (in a statistical sense), that is, stars
likely to share similar chemo-evolutionary history, using two methods: the hierarchical clustering
and the principal component analysis. We analysed some selected abundance surveys available in
the literature. For each sample, we labelled the group of stars according to its average abundance
curve. In all samples, we identify the existence of a main enrichment pattern of the stars, which
we call chemical enrichment flow. This flow is set by the structured and well defined mean rate at
which the abundances of the interstellar medium increase, resulting from the mixture of the material
ejected from the stars and stellar mass loss and interstellar medium gas. One of the main results
of our analysis is the identification of subgroups of stars with peculiar chemistry. These stars
are situated in regions outside of the enrichment flow in the abundance space. These peculiar stars
show a mismatch in the enrichment rate of a few elements, such as Mg, Si, Sc and V, when compared to the
mean enrichment rate of the other elements of the same stars. We believe the existence of these groups
of stars with peculiar chemistry may be related to the accretion of planetary material onto stellar
surfaces or may be due to production of the same chemical element by different nucleosynthetic sites.
