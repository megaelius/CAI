The first image of the black hole (BH) M87* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has the shape
of a crescent extending from the E to SWW position angles, while the observed direction of the large-scale
jet is NWW. Images based on numerical simulations of BH accretion flows suggest that on average the
projected BH spin axis should be oriented SSW. Alternatively, if the spin axis is matched with the
jet direction, emission from the SEE sector of the photon ring would be difficult to account for.
We explore highly simplified toy models for geometric distribution and kinematics of emitting
regions in the Kerr metric, and perform ray tracing to calculate the corresponding images. We strictly
assume that (1) the BH spin vector is fixed to the jet axis, (2) the emitting regions are stationary
and symmetric with respect to the BH spin, (3) the emissivities are isotropic in the local rest frames.
Emission from the crescent sector SSE - SWW can be readily explained in terms of an equatorial ring
with either circular or plunging geodesic flows, regardless of the value of BH spin. In the case of
plane-symmetric polar caps with plunging geodesic flows, the dominant image of the cap located
behind the BH is sensitive to the angular momentum of the emitter. Within the constraints of our model,
we have not found a viable explanation for the observed brightness of the SEE sector. The SEE 'hotspot'
might have been produced by a non-stationary localized perturbation in the inner accretion flow.
Alternatively, it could result from locally anisotropic synchrotron emissivities. Polarimetric
and multi-epoch results from the EHT will be essential to verify the theoretically expected alignment
of the BH spin with the large-scale jet.
