We present results for the short-term variability of Binary Trans-Neptunian Objects (BTNOs).
We performed CCD photometric observations using the 3.58 m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, the 1.5
m Sierra Nevada Observatory telescope, and the 1.23 m Centro Astronomico Hispano Aleman telescope
at Calar Alto Observatory. We present results based on five years of observations and report the
short-term variability of six BTNOs. Our sample contains three classical objects: 2003MW12, or
Varda, 2004SB60, or Salacia, and 2002 VT130; one detached disk object: 2007UK126; and two resonant
objects: 2007TY430 and 2000EB173, or Huya. For each target, possible rotational periods and/or
photometric amplitudes are reported. We also derived some physical properties from their lightcurves,
such as density, primary and secondary sizes, and albedo. We compiled and analyzed a vast lightcurve
database for Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) including centaurs to determine the lightcurve amplitude
and spin frequency distributions for the binary and non-binary populations. The mean rotational
periods, from the Maxwellian fits to the frequency distributions, are 8.63+/-0.52 h for the entire
sample, 8.37+/-0.58 h for the sample without the binary population, and 10.11+/-1.19 h for the binary
population alone. Because the centaurs are collisionally more evolved, their rotational periods
might not be so primordial. We computed a mean rotational period, from the Maxwellian fit, of 8.86+/-0.58
h for the sample without the centaur population, and of 8.64+/-0.67 h considering a sample without
the binary and the centaur populations. According to this analysis, regular TNOs spin faster than
binaries, which is compatible with the tidal interaction of the binaries. Finally, we examined
possible formation models for several systems studied in this work and by our team in previous papers.
