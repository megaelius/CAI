We determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity and individual abundances of a large sample of
evolved stars, with and without known planetary companions. Our methodology is based on the analysis
of high-resolution echelle spectra. The metallicity distributions show that giant stars hosting
planets are not preferentially metal-rich having similar abundance patterns to giant stars without
known planetary companions. We have found, however, a very strong relation between the metallicity
distribution and the stellar mass within this sample. We show that the less massive giant stars with
planets (M < 1.5 Msun) are not metal rich, but, the metallicity of the sample of massive (M >
1.5 Msun), young (age < 2 Gyr) giant stars with planets is higher than that of a similar sample of
stars without planets. Regarding other chemical elements, giant stars with and without planets
in the mass domain M < 1.5 Msun show similar abundance patterns. However, planet and non-planet
hosts with masses M > 1.5 Msun show differences in the abundances of some elements, specially
Na, Co, and Ni. In addition, we find the sample of subgiant stars with planets to be metal rich showing
similar metallicities to main-sequence planet hosts. The fact that giant planet hosts in the mass
domain M < 1.5 Msun do not show metal-enrichment is difficult to explain. Given that these stars
have similar stellar parameters to subgiants and main-sequence planet hosts, the lack of the metal-rich
signature in low-mass giants could be explained if originated from a pollution scenario in the main
sequence that gets erased as the star become fully convective. However, there is no physical reason
why it should play a role for giants with masses M < 1.5 Msun but is not observed for giants with M
> 1.5 Msun.
