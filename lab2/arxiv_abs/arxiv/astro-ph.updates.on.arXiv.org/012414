(Abridged) Low-luminosity, active star-forming blue compact galaxies (BCGs) are excellent laboratories
for investigating the process of star formation on galactic scales and probing the interplay between
massive stars and the surrounding interstellar (or intergalactic) medium. We investigated the
morphology, structure, and stellar content of the Blue Compact Galaxy Mrk 900, combining optical
integral field observations obtained with VIMOS at the VLT and deep broad-band photometry taken
at the 2.5 m NOT telescope. From the integral field data, we built continuum, emission, and diagnostic
line ratio maps and produced velocity and velocity dispersion maps. We also generated the integrated
spectrum of the major HII regions and the nuclear area to determine reliable physical parameters
and oxygen abundances. The broad-band data, tracing the galaxy up to radius 4 kpc, allowed us to investigate
the properties of the low surface brightness underlying stellar host. We disentangle two different
stellar components in Mrk 900: a young population, which resolves into individual stellar clusters
with ages ~5.5-6.6 Myr and extends about 1 kpc along the galaxy minor axis, is placed on top of a rather
red and regular shaped underlying stellar host, several Gyr old. We find evidence of a substantial
amount of dust and an inhomogeneous extinction pattern, with a dust lane crossing the central starburst.
Mrk 900 displays overall rotation, although distorted in the central, starburst regions; the dispersion
velocity map is highly inhomogeneous, with values increasing up to 60 kms$^{-1}$ at the periphery
of the SF regions, where we also find hints of the presence of shocks. Our observational results point
to an interaction or merger with a low-mass object or infalling gas as plausible trigger mechanisms
for the present starburst event.
