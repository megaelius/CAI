One of the main considerations in the ALMA Development Roadmap for the future of operations beyond
2030 is to at least double its on-sky instantaneous bandwidth capabilities. Thanks to the technological
innovations of the past two decades, we can now produce wider bandwidth receivers than were foreseen
at the time of the original ALMA specifications. In several cases, the band edges set by technology
at that time are also no longer relevant. In this memo, we look into the scientific advantages of beginning
with Band 2 when implementing such wideband technologies. The Band 2 receiver system will be the
last of the original ALMA bands, completing ALMA's coverage of the atmospheric windows from 35-950
GHz, and is not yet covered by any other ALMA receiver. New receiver designs covering and significantly
extending the original ALMA Band 2 frequency range (67-90 GHz) can now implement these technologies.
We explore the scientific and operational advantages of a receiver covering the full 67-116 GHz
atmospheric window. In addition to technological goals, the ALMA Development Roadmap provides
3 new key science drivers for ALMA, to probe: 1) the Origins of Galaxies, 2) the Origins of Chemical
Complexity, and 3) the Origins of Planets. In this memo, we describe how the wide RF Band 2 system can
help achieve these goals, enabling several high-profile science programmes to be executed uniquely
or more effectively than with separate systems, requiring an overall much lower array time and achieving
more consistent calibration accuracy: contiguous broad-band spectral surveys, measurements
of deuterated line ratios, and more generally fractionation studies, improved continuum measurements
(also necessary for reliable line flux measurements), simultaneous broad-band observations
of transient phenomena, and improved bandwidth for 3 mm very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
