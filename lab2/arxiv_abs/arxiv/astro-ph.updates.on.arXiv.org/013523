We report the first half-year monitoring of the new Galactic black hole candidate MAXI J1348-630,
discovered on 2019 January 26 with the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on-board MAXI. During the monitoring
period, the source exhibited two peaks, where the first peak flux (at T=14 day from the discovery
of T=0) was ~4 Crab (2-20 keV) and the second one (at T=132 day) was ~10 % of that. The source exhibited
distinct spectral transitions between the high/soft state and the low/hard state and an apparent
``q''-shape curve on the hardness-intensity diagram, both of which are well-known characteristics
of the black hole binaries. Compared to other bright black hole transients, MAXI J1348-630 is characterized
by its rather low disk-temperature (~0.75 keV at the maximum) and high peak flux in the high/soft
state. The low peak-temperature leads to a large innermost radius that is identified as the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the black hole. The black hole mass is estimated from the ISCO
as ~16 (D / 5kpc) Mo, where D is a distance to the source, assuming the face-on geometry of the accretion
disk and a non-spinning black hole. The black hole is considered even more massive if the disk is inclined
or the black hole is spinning. The source is in the direction of the Galactic Scutum-Centaurus arm
at ~4-8 kpc, of which distance is consistent with the observed hydrogen column density. These inferred
mass and distance values go with an empirical relationship between the peak luminosity (L_peak)
and the Eddington luminosity (L_Edd), as (L_peak)/(L_Edd)=0.2-0.4. We suggest that MAXI J1348-630
may host the most massive black hole among the known black hole binaries in our Galaxy.
