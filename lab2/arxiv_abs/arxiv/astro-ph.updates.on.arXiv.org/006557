Detection of the IceCube-170922A neutrino coincident with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056, the
first and only 3-sigma high-energy neutrino source association to date, offers a potential breakthrough
in our understanding of high-energy cosmic particles and blazar physics. We present a comprehensive
analysis of TXS 0506+056 during its flaring state, using newly collected Swift, NuSTAR, and X-shooter
data with Fermi observations and numerical models to constrain the blazar's particle acceleration
processes and multimessenger (electromagnetic and high-energy neutrino) emissions. Accounting
properly for electromagnetic cascades in the emission region, we find a physically-consistent
picture only within a hybrid leptonic scenario, with gamma-rays produced by external inverse-Compton
processes and high-energy neutrinos via a radiatively-subdominant hadronic component. We derive
robust constraints on the blazar's neutrino and cosmic-ray emissions and demonstrate that, because
of cascade effects, the 0.1-100keV emissions of TXS 0506+056 serve as a better probe of its hadronic
acceleration and high-energy neutrino production processes than its GeV-TeV emissions. If the
IceCube neutrino association holds, physical conditions in the TXS 0506+056 jet must be close to
optimal for high-energy neutrino production, and are not favorable for ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray
acceleration. Alternatively, the challenges we identify in generating a significant rate of IceCube
neutrino detections from TXS 0506+056 may disfavor single-zone models. In concert with continued
operations of the high-energy neutrino observatories, we advocate regular X-ray monitoring of
TXS 0506+056 and other blazars in order to test single-zone blazar emission models, clarify the
nature and extent of their hadronic acceleration processes, and carry out the most sensitive possible
search for additional multimessenger sources.
