Context: Although type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play a key role in astrophysics, the companions of
the exploding carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) are still not completely identified. It has been
suggested recently that a He-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN
Ia. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock compression in the CO
core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell might lead to the explosion of the whole
CO WD. However, so far, very few binary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger
scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia. Aims: We aim to systematically study the
Galactic birthrates and delay-time distributions of SNe Ia based on the merger scenario of a CO WD
and a He-rich WD. Methods: We performed a series of Monte Carlo BPS simulations to investigate the
properties of SNe Ia from the merging of a CO WD and a He-rich WD based on the Hurley rapid binary evolution
code. We also considered the influence of different metallicities on the final results. Results:
From our simulations, we found that no more than 15% of all SNe Ia stem from the merger scenario of a
CO WD and a He-rich WD, and their delay times range from ~110 Myr to the Hubble time. This scenario mainly
contributes to SN Ia explosions with intermediate and long delay times. The present work indicates
that the merger scenario of a CO WD and a He-rich WD can roughly reproduce the birthrates of SN 1991bg-like
events, and cover the range of their delay times. We also found that SN Ia birthrates from this scenario
would be higher for the cases with low metallicities.
