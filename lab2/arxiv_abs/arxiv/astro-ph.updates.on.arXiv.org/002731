We measure and quantify properties of galactic outflows and diffuse gas at $z \geq 1$ in cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. Our novel sub-resolution model, MUPPI, implements supernova feedback
using fully local gas properties, where the wind velocity and mass loading are not given as input.
We find the following trends at $z = 2$ by analysing central galaxies having a stellar mass higher
than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$. The outflow velocity and mass outflow rate ($\dot{M}_{\rm out}$) exhibit
positive correlations with galaxy mass and with the star formation rate (SFR). However, most of
the relations present a large scatter. The outflow mass loading factor ($\eta$) is between $0.2
- 10$. The comparison Effective model generates a constant outflow velocity, and a negative correlation
of $\eta$ with halo mass. The number fraction of galaxies where outflow is detected decreases at
lower redshifts, but remains more than $80 \%$ over $z = 1 - 5$. High SF activity at $z \sim 2 - 4$ drives
strong outflows, causing the positive and steep correlations of velocity and $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$
with SFR. The outflow velocity correlation with SFR becomes flatter at $z = 1$, and $\eta$ displays
a negative correlation with halo mass in massive galaxies. Our study demonstrates that both the
MUPPI and Effective models produce significant outflows at $\sim 1 / 10$ of the virial radius; at
the same time shows that the properties of outflows generated can be different from the input speed
and mass loading in the Effective model. Our MUPPI model, using local properties of gas in the sub-resolution
recipe, is able to develop galactic outflows whose properties correlate with global galaxy properties,
and consistent with observations.
