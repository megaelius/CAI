We consider the impact of Doppler noise models on the statistical robustness of the exoplanetary
radial-velocity fits. We show that the traditional model of the Doppler noise with an additive jitter
can generate large non-linearity effects, decreasing the reliability of the fit, especially in
the cases when a correleated Doppler noise is involved. We introduce a regularization of the additive
noise model that can gracefully eliminate its singularities together with the associated non-linearity
effects. We apply this approach to Doppler time-series data of several exoplanetary systems. It
demonstrates that our new regularized noise model yields orbital fits that have either increased
or at least the same statistical robustness, in comparison with the simple additive jitter. Various
statistical uncertainties in the parametric estimations are often reduced, while planet detection
significance is often increased. Concerning the 55 Cnc five-planet system, we show that its Doppler
data contain significant correlated ("red") noise. Its correlation timescale is in the range from
days to months, and its magnitude is much larger than the effect of the planetary N-body perturbations
in the radial velocity (these perturbations thus appear undetectable). Characteristics of the
red noise depend on the spectrograph/observatory, and also show a cyclic time variation in phase
with the public Ca II H & K and photometry measurements. We interpret this modulation as a hint
of the long-term activity cycle of 55 Cnc, similar to the Solar 11-year cycle. We estimate the 55 Cnc
activity period by $12.6\pm^{2.5}_{1.0}$ yrs, with the nearest minimum presumably expected in
2014 or 2015.
