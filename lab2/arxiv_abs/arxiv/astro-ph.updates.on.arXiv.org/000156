Recent studies have shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between galaxies and dark matter
is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial radii of galaxy halos, independent of the details
of how galaxies populate dark matter halos. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark
matter clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering. We present
new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy
samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We generalise the approach
of Baldauf et al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 Mpc/h for lensing and clustering
measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient differs from unity. We
derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and
35088 galaxies with mean redshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy
bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations.
When we vary both \sigma_8 and \Omega_m (and marginalise over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat LCDM
model, the best-constrained quantity is \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05 (1-sigma,
stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors have comparable contributions, and we fixed
n_s=0.96 and h=0.7. These strong constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method
is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some ways
less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a prominent role in future
weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with WMAP7 CMB data, constraints on \sigma_8, \Omega_m,
H_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu} become 30--80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data
break several parameter degeneracies.
