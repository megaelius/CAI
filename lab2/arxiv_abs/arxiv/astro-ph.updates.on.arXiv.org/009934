We present a sample of galaxies with the Dark Energy Survey (DES) photometry that replicates the
properties of the BOSS CMASS sample. The CMASS galaxy sample has been well characterized by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collaboration and was used to obtain the most powerful redshift-space
galaxy clustering measurements to date. A joint analysis of redshift-space distortions (such
as those probed by CMASS from SDSS) and a galaxy-galaxy lensing measurement for an equivalent sample
from DES can provide powerful cosmological constraints. Unfortunately, the DES and SDSS-BOSS
footprints have only minimal overlap, primarily on the celestial equator near the SDSS Stripe 82
region. Using this overlap, we build a robust Bayesian model to select CMASS-like galaxies in the
remainder of the DES footprint. The newly defined DES-CMASS (DMASS) sample consists of 117,293
effective galaxies covering $1,244 {\rm deg}^2$. Through various validation tests, we show that
the DMASS sample selected by this model matches well with the BOSS CMASS sample, specifically in
the South Galactic cap (SGC) region that includes Stripe 82. Combining measurements of the angular
correlation function and the clustering-z distribution of DMASS, we constrain the difference
in mean galaxy bias and mean redshift between the BOSS CMASS and DMASS samples to be $\Delta b = 0.010^{+0.045}_{-0.052}$
and $\Delta z = \left( 3.46^{+5.48}_{-5.55} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ for the SGC portion of CMASS,
and $\Delta b = 0.044^{+0.044}_{-0.043} $ and $\Delta z= ( 3.51^{+4.93}_{-5.91}) \times 10^{-3}$
for the full CMASS sample. These values indicate that the mean bias of galaxies and mean redshift
in the DMASS sample is consistent with both CMASS samples within $1\sigma$.
