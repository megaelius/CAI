Measuring the anisotropy of the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays provides important
information on the propagation mechanisms and the identification of their sources. In fact, the
flux of cosmic rays is thought to be dependent on the arrival direction only due to the presence of
nearby cosmic ray sources or particular magnetic-field structures. Recently, the observation
of unexpected excesses at TeV energy down to angular scale as narrow as $\sim10\deg$ raised the possibility
that the problem of the origin of galactic cosmic rays may be addressed by studying the anisotropy.
The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full-coverage EAS array, sensitive to cosmic rays with energy threshold
of a few hundred GeV. Searching for small-size deviations from the isotropy, the ARGO-YBJ collaboration
explored the declination region $\delta\sim-20^{\circ}\div 80^{\circ}$, making use of about
3.7$\cdot10^{11}$ events collected from November 2007 to May 2012. In this paper the detection
of different significant (up to 13 standard deviations) medium-scale anisotropy regions in the
arrival directions of CRs is reported. The observation was performed with unprecedented detail.
The relative excess intensity with respect to the isotropic flux extends up to 10$^{-3}$. The maximum
excess occurs for proton energies of 10-20 TeV, suggesting the presence of unknown features of the
magnetic fields the charged cosmic rays propagate through, or some contribution of nearby sources
never considered so far. The observation of new weaker few-degree excesses throughout the sky region
$195^{\circ}\leq$ \ra $\leq 290^{\circ}$ is reported for the first time.
