With the halo catalog from the Millennium Simulation, we analyze the weak-lensing measured density
profiles for clusters of galaxies, paying attention to the determination of the concentration-mass
(c-M) relation which can be biased by the center offset, selection effect and shape noise from intrinsic
ellipticities of background galaxies. Several different methods to locate the center of a cluster
from weak-lensing effects alone are explored. We find that, for intermediate redshift clusters,
the highest peak from our newly proposed two-scale smoothing method applied to the reconstructed
convergence field, first with a smoothing scale of 2 arcmin and then 0.5 arcmin, corresponds the
best to the true center. Assuming the parameterized Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, we fit
the reduced tangential shear signals around different centers identified differently. It is shown
that for the ensemble median values, a center offset larger than one scale radius $r_s$ can bias the
derived mass and concentration significantly lower than the true values especially for low mass
halos. However, the existence of noise can compensate the offset effect and reduce the systematic
bias although the scatters of mass and concentration get considerably larger. Statistically,
the bias effect of center offset on the c-M relation is insignificant if an appropriate center finding
method is adopted. On the other hand, noise from intrinsic ellipticities can bias the c-M relation
derived from a sample of weak-lensing analyzed clusters if a simple $\chi^2$ fitting method is used.
To account for the scatters and covariance between $c$ and $M$ properly, we apply a Bayesian method
to improve the statistical analysis of the c-M relation. It is shown that this new method allows us
to derive the c-M relation with significantly reduced biases.
