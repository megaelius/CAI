The nature of dark matter is one of the most thrilling riddles for both cosmology and particle physics
nowadays. While in the typical models the dark sector is composed only by weakly interacting massive
particles, an arguably more natural scenario would include a whole set of gauge interactions which
are invisible for the standard model but that are in contact with the dark matter. We present a method
to constrain the number of massless gauge bosons and other relativistic particles that might be
present in the dark sector using current and future cosmic microwave background data, and provide
upper bounds on the size of the dark sector. We use the fact that the dark matter abundance depends
on the strength of the interactions with both sectors, which allows one to relate the freeze-out
temperature of the dark matter with the temperature of {this cosmic background of dark gauge bosons}.
This relation can then be used to calculate how sizable is the impact of the relativistic dark sector
in the number of degrees of freedom of the early Universe, providing an interesting and testable
connection between cosmological data and direct/indirect detection experiments. The recent
Planck data, in combination with other cosmic microwave background experiments and baryonic acoustic
oscillations data, constrains the number of relativistic dark gauge bosons, when the freeze-out
temperature of the dark matter is larger than the top mass, to be N \lesssim 14 for the simplest scenarios,
while those limits are slightly relaxed for the combination with the Hubble constant measurements
to N \lesssim 20. Future releases of Planck data are expected to reduce the uncertainty by approximately
a factor 3, what will reduce significantly the parameter space of allowed models.
