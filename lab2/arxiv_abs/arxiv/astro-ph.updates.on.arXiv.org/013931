In this paper, we extend the source detection in the GOODS-ALMA field (69 arcmin$^2$, rms sensitivity
$\sigma$ $\simeq$ 0.18 mJy.beam$^{-1}$), to deeper levels than presented in Franco et al. (2018).
Using positional information at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m (from Spitzer-IRAC), we explore the presence
of galaxies detected at 1.1 mm with ALMA below our original blind detection limit of 4.8-$\sigma$
at which the number of spurious sources starts to dominate over that of real sources. In this Supplementary
Catalog, we find a total of 16 galaxies, including 2 galaxies with no counterpart in HST images (also
known as optically-dark galaxies) down to a 5$\sigma$ limiting depth of H = 28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W).
This brings the total sample of GOODS-ALMA 1.1 mm sources to 35 galaxies. Galaxies in the new sample
cover a wider dynamic range in redshift ($z$ = 0.65 - 4.73), are on average twice as large (1.3 vs 0.65
kpc) and and have lower stellar mass (M$_{\star}^{\rm SC}$ = 7.6$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$ vs
M$_{\star}^{\rm MC}$ = 1.2$\times$10$^{11}$M$_\odot$). Although exhibiting larger physical
sizes, these galaxies have still far-infrared sizes significantly more compact than inferred
from their optical emission. We show that the astrometry of the HST image does not only suffer from
a global astrometric shift, as already discussed in previous papers, but also from local shifts.
These distortions were artificially introduced in the process of building the mosaic of the GOODS-South
HST image. By comparing the positions of almost 400 galaxies detected by HST, Pan-STARRS and ALMA,
we create a distortion map which can be used to correct for these astrometric issues.
