The central region of a circumstellar disk is difficult to resolve in global numerical simulations
of collapsing cloud cores, but its effect on the evolution of the entire disk can be significant.
We use numerical hydrodynamics simulations to model the long-term evolution of self-gravitating
and viscous circumstellar disks in the thin-disk limit. Simulations start from the gravitational
collapse of prestellar cores of 0.5--1.0~$M_\odot$ and both gaseous and dusty subsystems were
considered, including a model for dust growth. The inner unresolved 1.0 au of the disk is replaced
with a central "smart" cell (CSC) -- a simplified model that simulates physical processes that may
occur in this region. We found that the mass transport rate through the CSC has an appreciable effect
on the evolution of the entire disk. Models with slow mass transport form more massive and warmer
disks and they are more susceptible to gravitational instability and fragmentation, including
a newly identified episodic mode of disk fragmentation in the T Tauri phase of disk evolution. Models
with slow mass transport through the CSC feature episodic accretion and luminosity bursts in the
early evolution, while models with fast transport are characterized by a steadily declining accretion
rate with low-amplitude flickering. Dust grows to a larger, decimeter size in the slow transport
models and efficiently drifts in the CSC, where it accumulates reaching the limit when streaming
instability becomes operational. We argue that gravitational instability, together with streaming
instability likely operating in the inner disk regions, constitute two concurrent planet-forming
mechanisms, which may explain the observed diversity of exoplanetary orbits (Abridged).
