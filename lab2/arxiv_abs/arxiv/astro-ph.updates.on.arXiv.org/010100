High-energy radiation caused by exoplanetary space weather events from planet-hosting stars
can play a crucial role in conditions promoting or destroying habitability in addition to the conventional
factors. In this paper, we present the first quantitative impact evaluation system of stellar flares
on the habitability factors with an emphasis on the impact of Stellar Proton Events. We derive the
maximum flare energy from stellar starspot sizes and examine the impacts of flare associated ionizing
radiation on CO$_2$, H$_2$, N$_2$+O$_2$ --rich atmospheres of a number of well-characterized
terrestrial type exoplanets. Our simulations based on the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code
System [PHITS] suggest that the estimated ground level dose for each planet in the case of terrestrial-level
atmospheric pressure (1 bar) for each exoplanet does not exceed the critical dose for complex (multi-cellular)
life to persist, even for the planetary surface of Proxima Centauri b, Ross-128 b and TRAPPIST-1
e. However, when we take into account the effects of the possible maximum flares from those host stars,
the estimated dose reaches fatal levels at the terrestrial lowest atmospheric depth on TRAPPIST-1
e and Ross-128 b. Large fluxes of coronal XUV radiation from active stars induces high atmospheric
escape rates from close-in exoplanets suggesting that the atmospheric depth can be substantially
smaller than that on the Earth. In a scenario with the atmospheric thickness of 1/10 of Earth's, the
radiation dose from close-in planets including Proxima Centauri b and TRAPPIST-1 e reach near fatal
dose levels with annual frequency of flare occurrence from their hoststars.
