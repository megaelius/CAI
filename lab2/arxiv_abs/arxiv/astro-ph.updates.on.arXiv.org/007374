As we enter a golden age for studies of internal kinematics and dynamics of Galactic globular clusters
(GCs), it is timely to assess the performance of modelling techniques in recovering the mass, mass
profile, and other dynamical properties of GCs. Here, we compare different mass-modelling techniques
(distribution-function (DF)-based models, Jeans models, and a grid of N-body models) by applying
them to mock observations from a star-by-star N-body simulation of the GC M 4 by Heggie. The mocks
mimic existing and anticipated data for GCs: surface brightness or number density profiles, local
stellar mass functions, line-of-sight velocities, and Hubble Space Telescope- and Gaia-like
proper motions. We discuss the successes and limitations of the methods. We find that multimass
DF-based models, Jeans, and N-body models provide more accurate mass profiles compared to single-mass
DF-based models. We highlight complications in fitting the kinematics in the outskirts due to energetically
unbound stars associated with the cluster ("potential escapers", not captured by truncated DF
models nor by N-body models of clusters in isolation), which can be avoided with DF-based models
including potential escapers, or with Jeans models. We discuss ways to account for mass segregation.
For example, three-component DF-based models with freedom in their mass function are a simple alternative
to avoid the biases of single-mass models (which systematically underestimate the total mass,
half-mass radius, and central density), while more realistic multimass DF-based models with freedom
in the remnant content represent a promising avenue to infer the total mass and the mass function
of remnants.
