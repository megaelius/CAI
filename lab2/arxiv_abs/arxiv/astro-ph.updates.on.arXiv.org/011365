We present the discovery of PS18kh, a tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered at the center of SDSS
J075654.53+341543.6 ($d\simeq322$ Mpc) by the Pan-STARRS Survey for Transients. Our dataset
includes pre-discovery survey data from Pan-STARRS, the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae
(ASAS-SN), and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) as well as high-cadence,
multi-wavelength follow-up data from ground-based telescopes and Swift, spanning from 56 days
before peak light until 75 days after. The optical/UV emission from PS18kh is well-fit as a blackbody
with temperatures ranging from $T\simeq12000$ K to $T\simeq25000$ K and it peaked at a luminosity
of $L\simeq8.8\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. PS18kh radiated $E=(3.45\pm0.22)\times10^{50}$
ergs over the period of observation, with $(1.42\pm0.20)\times10^{50}$ ergs being released during
the rise to peak. Spectra of PS18kh show a changing, boxy/double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission feature,
which becomes more prominent over time. We use models of non-axisymmetric accretion disks to describe
the profile of the H$\alpha$ line and its evolution. We find that at early times the high accretion
rate leads the disk to emit a wind which modifies the shape of the line profile and makes it bell-shaped.
At late times, the wind becomes optically thin, allowing the non-axisymmetric perturbations to
show up in the line profile. The line-emitting portion of the disk extends from $r_{\rm in}\sim60r_{\rm
g}$ to an outer radius of $r_{\rm out}\sim1400r_{\rm g}$ and the perturbations can be represented
either as an eccentricity in the outer rings of the disk or as a spiral arm in the inner disk.
