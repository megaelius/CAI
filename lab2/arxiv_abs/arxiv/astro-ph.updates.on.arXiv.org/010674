We present detections of the CO(4-3) and [C I] 609 $\mu$m spectral lines, as well as the dust continuum
at 480.5 GHz (rest-frame), in 3C 368, a Fanaroff-Riley class II (FR-II) galaxy at redshift (z) 1.131.
3C 368 has a large stellar mass, ~ 3.6 x 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$, and is undergoing an episode of vigorous
star formation, at a rate of ~ 350 M$_\odot$/yr, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, with
radio-emitting lobes extended over ~ 73 kpc. Our observations allow us to inventory the molecular-gas
reservoirs in 3C 368 by applying three independent methods: (1) using the CO(4-3)-line luminosity,
excitation state of the gas, and an $\alpha_{CO}$ conversion factor, (2) scaling from the [C I]-line
luminosity, and (3) adopting a gas-to-dust conversion factor. We also present gas-phase metallicity
estimates in this source, both using far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines together with radio
free-free continuum emission and independently employing the optical [O III] 5007 A and [O II] 3727
A lines (R$_{23}$ method). Both methods agree on a sub-solar gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.3 Z$_\odot$.
Intriguingly, comparing the molecular-gas mass estimated using this sub-solar metallicity,
M$_{gas}$ ~ 6.4 x 10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$, to dust-mass estimates from multi-component spectral energy
distribution (SED) modeling, M$_{dust}$ ~ 1.4 x 10$^8$ M$_\odot$, yields a gas-to-dust ratio within
~ 15% of the accepted value for a metallicity of 0.3 Z$_\odot$. The derived gas-mass puts 3C 368 on
par with other galaxies at z ~ 1 in terms of specific star-formation rate and gas fraction. However,
it does not explain how a galaxy can amass such a large stellar population while maintaining such
a low gas-phase metallicity. Perhaps 3C 368 has recently undergone a merger, accreting pristine
molecular gas from an external source.
