Context: Cygnus X-1 is a black hole X-ray binary system in which the black hole captures and accretes
gas from the strong stellar wind emitted by its supergiant O9.7 companion star. The irradiation
of the supergiant star essentially determines the flow properties of the stellar wind and the X-ray
luminosity from the system. The results of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of wind-fed
X-ray binary systems reported in recent work reveal that the ionizing feedback of the X-ray irradiation
leads to the existence of two stable states with either a soft or a hard spectrum. Aims: We discuss
the observed radiation of Cygnus X-1 in the soft and hard state in the context of mass flow in the corona
and disk, as predicted by the recent application of a condensation model. Methods: The rates of gas
condensation from the corona to the disk for Cygnus X-1 are determined, and the spectra of the hard
and soft radiation are computed. The theoretical results are compared with the MAXI observations
of Cygnus X-1 from 2009 to 2018. In particular, we evaluate the hardness-intensity diagrams (HIDs)
for its ten episodes of soft and hard states which show that Cygnus X-1 is distinct in its spectral
changes as compared to those found in the HIDs of low-mass X-ray binaries. Results: The theoretically
derived values of photon counts and hardness are in approximate agreement with the observed data
in the HID. However, the scatter in the diagram is not reproduced. Improved agreement could result
from variations in the viscosity associated with clumping in the stellar wind and corresponding
changes of the magnetic fields in the disk. The observed dipping events in the hard state may also
contribute to the scatter and to a harder spectrum than predicted by the model.
