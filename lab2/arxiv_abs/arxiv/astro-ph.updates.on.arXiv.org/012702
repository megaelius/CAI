Context. Stellar spin-down is the result of a complex process involving rotation, dynamo, wind
and magnetism. Multi-wavelength surveys of solar-like stars have revealed the likely existence
of relationships between their rotation, X-ray luminosity, mass-losses and magnetism. Those
impose strong constraints on the corona and wind of cool stars. Aims. We aim to provide power-law
prescriptions of the mass-loss of stars, of their magnetic field, and of their base coronal density
and temperature that are compatible with their observationally-constrained spin-down. Methods.
We link the magnetic field and the mass-loss rate from a wind torque formulation in agreement with
the distribution of stellar rotation periods in open clusters and the Skumanich law. Given a wind
model and an expression of the X-ray luminosity from radiative losses, we constrain the coronal
properties by assuming different physical scenarii linking closed loops to coronal holes. Results.
We find that the magnetic field and the mass loss are involved in a one-to-one correspondence constrained
from spin-down considerations. We show that a magnetic field depending on both the Rossby number
and the stellar mass is required to keep a consistent spin-down model. The estimates of the magnetic
field and the mass-loss rate obtained from our formalism are consistent with statistical studies
as well as individual observations and give new leads to constrain the magnetic field-rotation
relation. The set of scaling-laws we derived can be broadly applied to cool stars from the PMS to the
end of the MS, and allow for a stellar wind modelling consistent with all the observational constraints
available to date.
