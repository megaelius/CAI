The Kepler data show that habitable small planets orbiting Red Dwarf stars (RDs) are abundant, and
hence might be promising targets to look at for biomarkers and life. Planets orbiting within the
Habitable Zone of RDs are close enough to be tidally locked. Some recent works have cast doubt on the
ability of planets orbiting RDs to support life. In contrast, it is shown that temperatures suitable
for liquid water and even for organic molecules may exist on tidally locked planets of RDs for a wide
range of atmospheres. We chart the surface temperature distribution as a function of the irradiation,
greenhouse factor and heat circulation. The habitability boundaries and their dependence on the
atmospheric properties are derived. Extending our previous analyses of tidally locked planets,
we find that tidally locked as well as synchronous (not completely locked) planets of RDs and K-type
stars may support life, for a wider range of orbital distance and atmospheric conditions than previously
thought. In particular, it is argued that life clement environments may be possible on tidally locked
and synchronously orbiting planets of RDs and K-type stars, with conditions supporting Oxygenic
Photosynthesis, which on Earth was a key to Complex life. Different climate projections and the
biological significance of tidal locking on putative complex life are reviewed. We show that when
the effect of continuous radiation is taken into account, the Photo-synthetically Active Radiation
(PAR) available on tidally locked planets, even of RDs, could produce a high Potential Plant Productivity,
in analogy to mid-summer growth at high latitudes on Earth. Awaiting the findings of TESS and JWST,
we discuss the implications of the above arguments to the detection of biomarkers such as liquid
water and oxygen, as well as to the abundance of biotic planets and life.
