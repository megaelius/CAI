Understanding the formation and evolution of early-type, spheroid-dominated galaxies is an open
question within the context of the hierarchical clustering scenario, particularly, in low-density
environments. Our goal is to study the main structural, dynamical, and stellar population properties
and assembly histories of field spheroid-dominated galaxies formed in a LCDM scenario to assess
to what extend they are consistent with observations. We selected spheroid-dominated systems
from a LCDM simulation that includes star formation, chemical evolution and Supernova feedback.
A sample of 18 field systems with Mstar <= 6x10^10 Msun that are dominated by the spheroid component.
For this sample we estimate the fundamental relations of ellipticals and then compared with current
observations. The simulated spheroid galaxies have sizes in good agreement with observations.
The bulges follow a Sersic law with Sersic indexes that correlate with the bulge-to-total mass ratios.
The structural-dynamical properties of the simulated galaxies are consistent with observed Faber-Jackson,
Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher relations. However, the simulated galaxies are bluer and
with higher star formation rates than observed isolated early-type galaxies. The archaeological
mass growth histories show a slightly delayed formation and more prominent inside-out growth mode
than observational inferences based on the fossil record method. The main structural and dynamical
properties of the simulated spheroid-dominated galaxies are consistent with observations. This
is remarkable since none of them has been tuned to be reproduced. However, the simulated galaxies
are blue and star-forming, and with later stellar mass growth histories as compared to observational
inferences. This is mainly due to the persistence of extended discs in the simulations. Abridged
