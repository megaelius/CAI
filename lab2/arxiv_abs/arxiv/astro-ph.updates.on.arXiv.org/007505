We numerically study magnetic reconnection on different spatial scales and at different heights
in the weakly ionized plasma of the low solar atmosphere (around $300-800$~km above the solar surface)
within a reactive 2.5 D multi-fluid plasma-neutral model. We consider a strongly magnetized plasma
($\beta \sim 6\% $) evolving from a force-free magnetic configuration and perturbed to initialize
formation of a reconnection current sheet. On large scales, the resulting current sheets are observed
to undergo a secondary 'plasmoid' instability. A series of simulations at different scales demonstrate
a cascading current sheet formation process that terminates for current sheets with width of ~2m
and length of $\sim100$~m, corresponding to the critical current sheet aspect ratio of $\sim50$.
We also observe that the plasmoid instability is the primary physical mechanism accelerating the
magnetic reconnection in this plasma parameter regime. After plasmoid instabilities appear,
the reconnection rate sharply increases to a value of $\sim$ 0.035, observed to be independent of
the Lundquist number. These characteristics are very similar to magnetic reconnection in fully
ionized plasmas. In this low $\beta$ guide field reconnection regime, both the recombination and
collisionless effects are observed to have a small contribution to the reconnection rate. The simulations
show that it is difficult to heat the dense weakly ionized photospheric plasmas to above $2\times10^4$~K
during the magnetic reconnection process. However, the plasmas in the low solar chromosphere can
be heated above $3\times10^4$~K with reconnection magnetic fields of $500$~G or stronger.
