We present results from a new set of 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of rotating
iron core collapse. We assume octant symmetry and focus on axisymmetric collapse, bounce, the early
postbounce evolution, and the associated gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino signals. We employ
a finite-temperature nuclear equation of state, parameterized electron capture in the collapse
phase, and a multi-species neutrino leakage scheme after bounce. The latter captures the important
effects of deleptonization, neutrino cooling and heating and enables approximate predictions
for the neutrino luminosities in the early evolution after core bounce. We consider 12-solar-mass
and 40-solar-mass presupernova models and systematically study the effects of (i) rotation, (ii)
progenitor structure, and (iii) postbounce neutrino leakage on dynamics, GW, and, neutrino signals.
We demonstrate, that the GW signal of rapidly rotating core collapse is practically independent
of progenitor mass and precollapse structure. Moreover, we show that the effects of neutrino leakage
on the GW signal are strong only in nonrotating or slowly rotating models in which GW emission is not
dominated by inner core dynamics. In rapidly rotating cores, core bounce of the centrifugally-deformed
inner core excites the fundamental quadrupole pulsation mode of the nascent protoneutron star.
The ensuing global oscillations (f~700-800 Hz) lead to pronounced oscillations in the GW signal
and correlated strong variations in the rising luminosities of antineutrino and heavy-lepton
neutrinos. We find these features in cores that collapse to protoneutron stars with spin periods
<~ 2.5 ms and rotational energies sufficient to drive hyper-energetic core-collapse supernova
explosions. Hence, joint GW + neutrino observations of a core collapse event could deliver strong
evidence for or against rapid core rotation. [abridged]
