Although the new era of high precision cosmology of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
improves our knowledge to understand the infant as well as the presentday Universe, it also leads
us to question the main assumption of the exact isotropy of the CMB. There are two pieces of observational
evidence that hint towards there being no exact isotropy. These are first the existence of small
anisotropy deviations from isotropy of the CMB radiation and second, the presence of large angle
anomalies, although the existence of these anomalies is currently a huge matter of debate. These
hints are particularly important since isotropy is one of the two main postulates of the Copernican
principle on which the FRW models are built. This almost isotropic CMB radiation implies that the
universe is almost a FRW universe, as is proved by previous studies. Assuming the matter component
forms the deviations from isotropy in the CMB density fluctuations when matter and radiation decouples,
we here attempt to find possible constraints on the FRW type scale and Hubble parameter by using the
Bianchi type I (BI) anisotropic model which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard FRW. To
obtain constraints on such an anisotropic model, we derive average and late-time shear values that
come from the anisotropy upper limits of the recent Planck data based on a model independent shear
parameter of Maartens et al. (1995a,b) and from the theoretical consistency relation. These constraints
lead us to obtain a BI model which becomes an almost-FRW model in time, and which is consistent with
the latest observational data of the CMB.
