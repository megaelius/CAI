L1157-B1 is the brightest shocked region of the large-scale molecular outflow, considered the
prototype of chemically rich outflows, being the ideal laboratory to study how shocks affect the
molecular gas. Several deuterated molecules have been previously detected with the IRAM 30m, most
of them formed on grain mantles and then released into the gas phase due to the shock. We aim to observationally
investigate the role of the different chemical processes at work that lead to formation the of DCN
and test the predictions of the chemical models for its formation. We performed high-angular resolution
observations with NOEMA of the DCN(2-1) and H13CN(2-1) lines to compute the deuterated fraction,
Dfrac(HCN). We detected emission of DCN(2-1) and H13CN(2-1) arising from L1157-B1 shock. Dfrac(HCN)
is ~4x10$^{-3}$ and given the uncertainties, we did not find significant variations across the
bow-shock. Contrary to HDCO, whose emission delineates the region of impact between the jet and
the ambient material, DCN is more widespread and not limited to the impact region. This is consistent
with the idea that gas-phase chemistry is playing a major role in the deuteration of HCN in the head
of the bow-shock, where HDCO is undetected as it is a product of grain-surface chemistry. The spectra
of DCN and H13CN match the spectral signature of the outflow cavity walls, suggesting that their
emission result from shocked gas. The analysis of the time dependent gas-grain chemical model UCL-CHEM
coupled with a C-type shock model shows that the observed Dfrac(HCN) is reached during the post-shock
phase, matching the dynamical timescale of the shock. Our results indicate that the presence of
DCN in L1157-B1 is a combination of gas-phase chemistry that produces the widespread DCN emission,
dominating in the head of the bow-shock, and sputtering from grain mantles toward the jet impact
region.
