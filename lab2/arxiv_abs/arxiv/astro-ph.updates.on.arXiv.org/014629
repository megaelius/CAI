Gravitational waves astronomy has opened a new opportunity to study the Universe. Full exploitation
of this window can especially be provided by combining data coming from gravitational waves experiments
with luminous tracers of the Large Scale Structure, like galaxies. In this work we investigate the
cross-correlation signal between gravitational waves resolved events, as detected by the Einstein
Telescope, and actively star-forming galaxies. The galaxies distribution is computed through
their UV and IR luminosity functions and the gravitational waves events, assumed to be of stellar
origin, are self-consistently computed from the aforementioned galaxies distribution. We provide
a state-of-the-art treatment both on the astrophysical side, keeping into account the impact of
the star formation and chemical evolution histories of galaxies, and in computing the cross-correlation
signal, for which we include lensing and relativistic effects. We find that, given enough gravitational
waves events and for some Star Formation Rate cuts, the cross-correlation signal that would be measured
is sufficiently strong to overcome the noise and provide a clear signal. We suggest a possible application
of this methodology, which consists in the possibility of distinguishing between different astrophysical
scenarios and eventually test theoretical models. We consider a proof-of-concept case in which
a metallicity dependence on the compact objects merger efficiency can be discriminated against
a reference case with no metallicity dependence. When considering galaxies with a Star Formation
Rate $\psi > 10 \: M_{\odot} /\rm{yr}$, a Signal-to-Noise ratio around a value of 2-4 is gained after
a decade of observation time, depending on the observed fraction of the sky. This formalism can be
exploited as an astrophysical probe and could potentially allow to test and compare different astrophysical
scenarios.
