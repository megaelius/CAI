We take advantage of a semi-analytic model with a state-of-art implementation of the formation
of the intra-cluster light (ICL) run on a set of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the
mass distribution of the ICL in galaxy groups and clusters, at different redshifts. Motivated by
recent observational results, we assume the ICL to follow a NFW profile with a different concentration,
linked to that of the dark matter by the relation $c_{ICL}=\gamma c_{DM}$, where the parameter $\gamma$
is set to reproduce the observed relation between the stellar mass in the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG) and ICL in the innermost 100 kpc and the virial mass ($M^*_{100}-M_{vir}$), at $z=0$. The model
is then tested against several theoretical and observational results, from the present time to
$z\sim1.5$. Our analysis shows that the fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL within the innermost
100 kpc is an increasing function of redshift, parameter $\gamma$, and a decreasing function of
the halo mass. The value of $\gamma$ required to match the observed $M^*_{100}-M_{vir}$ is $\gamma=3$
at $z=0$, but there are hints that it might be a function of redshift and halo mass. This result indicates
that the distribution of the ICL is more concentrated than the dark matter one, but less concentrated
than previously found by \cite{pillepich18} with the IllustrisTNG simulation. Moreover, the
distance between the distributions of ICL and dark matter are strongly dependent on the concentration
and mass of the halo, being higher for low concentrated and more massive haloes. We suggest that a
modified version of the NFW is a good description of the distribution of the diffuse light in groups
and clusters, which makes the ICL a reliable tracer of the dark matter, in good agreement with recent
observational findings.
