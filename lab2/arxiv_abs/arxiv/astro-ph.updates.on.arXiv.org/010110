Motivated by both ground- and space-based detections of the sodium doublet in the transmission
spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres, we revisit the theory and interpretation of sodium lines
in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), where collisions are not efficient enough to maintain
a Boltzmann distribution for the excited and ground states of the sodium atom. We consider non-Boltzmann
distributions that account for the ineffectiveness of collisions. We analyze the sodium doublet
in transmission spectra measured at low (HAT-P-1b, HAT-P-12b, HD 189733b, WASP-6b, WASP-17b and
WASP-39b) and high (WASP-49b) spectral resolutions. Nested-sampling retrievals performed on
low-resolution optical/visible transmission spectra are unable to break the normalization degeneracy
if the spectral continuum is associated with Rayleigh scattering by small cloud particles. Using
mock retrievals, we demonstrate that un-normalized ground-based, high-resolution spectra centered
on the sodium doublet alone are unable to precisely inform us about the pressure levels probed by
the transit chord and hence to identify the region (i.e., thermosphere, exosphere) of the atmosphere
being probed. Retrievals performed on the HARPS transmission spectrum of WASP-49b support this
conclusion. Generally, we are unable to distinguish between LTE versus NLTE interpretations of
the sodium doublet based on the computed Bayesian evidence with the implication that LTE interpretations
tend to under-estimate the temperature probed by the transit chord. With the current low-resolution
data, the sodium line shapes are consistent with Voigt profiles without the need for sub-Lorentzian
wings. The retrieved sodium abundances are consistent with being sub-solar to solar.
