We present an overview of the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS) for radio pulsars and fast
transients. The survey uses the high-band antennas of the LOFAR Superterp, the dense inner part
of the LOFAR core, to survey the northern sky (dec > 0 deg) at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz.
A total of 219 tied-array beams (coherent summation of station signals, covering 12 square degrees),
as well as three incoherent beams (covering 67 square degrees) are formed in each survey pointing.
For each ofthe 222 beams, total intensity is recorded at 491.52 us time resolution. Each observation
integrates for 1 hr and covers 2592 channels from 119 to 151 MHz. This instrumental setup allows LOTAAS
to reach a detection threshold of 1 to 5 mJy for periodic emission. Thus far, the LOTAAS survey has
resulted in the discovery of 73 radio pulsars. Among these are two mildly recycled binary millisecond
pulsars (P = 13 and 33 ms), as well as the slowest-spinning radio pulsar currently known (P = 23.5 s).
The survey has thus far detected 311 known pulsars, with spin periods ranging from 4 ms to 5.0 s and
dispersion measures from 3.0 to 217 pc/cc. Known pulsars are detected at flux densities consistent
with literature values. We find that the LOTAAS pulsar discoveries have, on average, longer spin
periods than the known pulsar population. This may reflect different selection biases between
LOTAAS and previous surveys, though it is also possible that slower-spinning pulsars preferentially
have steeper radio spectra. LOTAAS is the deepest all-sky pulsar survey using a digital aperture
array; we discuss some of the lessons learned that can inform the approach for similar surveys using
future radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array.
