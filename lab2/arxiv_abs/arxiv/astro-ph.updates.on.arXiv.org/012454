Radio waves are strongly scattered in the solar wind, so that their apparent sources seem to be considerably
larger and shifted than the actual ones. Since the scattering depends on the spectrum of density
turbulence, better understanding of the radio wave propagation provides indirect information
on the relative density fluctuations $\epsilon=\langle\delta n\rangle/\langle n\rangle$ at
the effective turbulence scale length. Here, we have analyzed 30 type III bursts detected by Parker
Solar Probe (PSP). For the first time, we have retrieved type III burst decay times $\tau_{\rm{d}}$
between 1 MHz and 10 MHz thanks to an unparalleled temporal resolution of PSP. We observed a significant
deviation in a power-law slope for frequencies above 1 MHz when compared to previous measurements
below 1 MHz by the twin-spacecraft Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission.
We note that altitudes of radio bursts generated at 1 MHz roughly coincide with an expected location
of the Alfv\'{e}n point, where the solar wind becomes super-Alfv\'{e}nic. By comparing PSP observations
and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict relative density fluctuations $\epsilon$ at the effective
turbulence scale length at radial distances between 2.5$R_\odot$ and 14$R_\odot$ to range from
$0.22$ and $0.09$. Finally, we calculated relative density fluctuations $\epsilon$ measured
in situ by PSP at a radial distance from the Sun of $35.7$~$R_\odot$ during the perihelion \#1, and
the perihelion \#2 to be $0.07$ and $0.06$, respectively. It is in a very good agreement with previous
STEREO predictions ($\epsilon=0.06-0.07$) obtained by remote measurements of radio sources
generated at this radial distance.
