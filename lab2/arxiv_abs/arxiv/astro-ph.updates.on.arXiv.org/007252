The dusty regolith covering the surfaces of asteroids and planetary satellites differs in size,
shape, and composition from terrestrial soil particles and is subject to very different environmental
conditions. Experimental studies of the response of planetary regolith in the relevant environmental
conditions are thus necessary to facilitate future Solar System exploration activities. We combined
the results and provided new data analysis elements for a series of impact experiments into simulated
planetary regolith in low-gravity conditions using two experimental setups: the Physics of Regolith
Impacts in Microgravity Experiment (PRIME) and the COLLisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE).
Results of these experimental campaigns found that there is a significant change in the regolith
behavior with the gravity environment. In a 10-2g environment (Lunar g levels), only embedding
of the impactor was observed and ejecta production was produced for most impacts at > 20 cm/s. Once
at microgravity levels (<10-4g), the lowest impact energies also produced impactor rebound. In
these microgravity conditions, ejecta started to be produced for impacts at > 10 cm/s. The measured
ejecta speeds were lower than the ones measured at reduced-gravity levels, but the ejected masses
were higher. The mean ejecta velocity shows a power-law dependence on the impact energy with an index
of ~0.7. When projectile rebound occurred, we observed that its coefficients of restitution on
the bed of regolith simulant decrease by a factor of 10 with increasing impact speeds from ~5 cm/s
up to 100 cm/s. We could also observe an increased cohesion between the JSC-1 grains compared to the
quartz sand targets.
