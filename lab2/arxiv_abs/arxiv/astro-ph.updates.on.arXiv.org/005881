In this paper, we provide a physical model for the origin of variations in the shapes and bump strengths
of dust attenuation laws in galaxies by combining a large suite of cosmological "zoom-in" galaxy
formation simulations with 3D Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer calculations. We model galaxies
over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass, ranging from Milky Way like systems through massive galaxies
at high-redshift. Critically, for these calculations we employ a constant underlying dust extinction
law in all cases, and examine how the role of geometry and radiative transfer effects impact the resultant
attenuation curves. Our main results follow. Despite our usage of a constant dust extinction curve,
we find dramatic variations in the derived attenuation laws. The slopes of normalized attenuation
laws depend primarily on the complexities of star-dust geometry. Increasing fractions of unobscured
young stars flatten normalized curves, while increasing fractions of unobscured old stars steepen
curves. Similar to the slopes of our model attenuation laws, we find dramatic variation in the 2175
Angstrom ultraviolet (UV) bump strength, including a subset of curves with little to no bump. These
bump strengths are primarily influenced by the fraction of unobscured O and B stars in our model,
with the impact of scattered light having only a secondary effect. Taken together, these results
lead to a natural relationship between the attenuation curve slope and 2175 Angstrom bump strength.
Finally, we apply these results to a 25 Mpc/h box cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in order
to model the expected dispersion in attenuation laws at integer redshifts from z=0-6. A significant
dispersion is expected at low redshifts, and decreases toward z=6. We provide tabulated results
for the best fit median attenuation curve at all redshifts.
