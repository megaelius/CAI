We present a catalog of stellar properties for a large sample of 6676 evolved stars with APOGEE spectroscopic
parameters and \textit{Kepler} asteroseismic data analyzed using five independent techniques.
Our data includes evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the
spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach
for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar
parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic
parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed
by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated
corrections to the large frequency spacing ($\Delta \nu$) scaling relation, and we calibrate the
zero point of the frequency of maximum power ($\nu_{\rm max}$) relation to be consistent with masses
and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines
are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted random errors,
but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion.
This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population
studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent
with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars
of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level respectively
for RC stars.
