Aims: We aim to characterize the orbital and atmospheric properties of PDS 70 b, which was first identified
on May 2015 in the course of the SHINE survey with SPHERE, the extreme adaptive-optics instrument
at the VLT. Methods: We obtained new deep SPHERE/IRDIS imaging and SPHERE/IFS spectroscopic observations
of PDS 70 b. The astrometric baseline now covers 6 years which allows us to perform an orbital analysis.
For the first time, we present spectrophotometry of the young planet which covers almost the entire
near-infrared range (0.96 to 3.8 micrometer). We use different atmospheric models covering a large
parameter space in temperature, log(g), chemical composition, and cloud properties to characterize
the properties of the atmosphere of PDS 70 b. Results: PDS 70 b is most likely orbiting the star on a
circular and disk coplanar orbit at ~22 au inside the gap of the disk. We find a range of models that
can describe the spectrophotometric data reasonably well in the temperature range between 1000-1600
K and log(g) no larger than 3.5 dex. The planet radius covers a relatively large range between 1.4
and 3.7 R_jupiter with the larger radii being higher than expected from planet evolution models
for the age of the planet of 5.4 Myr. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive dataset on
the orbital motion of PDS 70 b, indicating a circular orbit and a motion coplanar with the disk. The
first detailed spectral energy distribution of PDS 70 b indicates a temperature typical for young
giant planets. The detailed atmospheric analysis indicates that a circumplanetary disk may contribute
to the total planet flux.
