Binary neutron star mergers are important to understand stellar evolution, the chemical enrichment
of the universe via the r-process, the physics of short gamma-ray bursts, gravitational waves and
pulsars. The rates at which these coalescences happen is uncertain, but it can be constrained in
different ways. One of those is to search for the optical transients produced at the moment of the
merging, called a kilonova, in ongoing SN searches. However, until now, only theoretical models
for kilonovae light curve were available to estimate their rates. The recent kilonova discovery
AT~2017gfo/DLT17ck gives us the opportunity to constrain the rate of kilonovae using the light
curve of a real event. We constrain the rate of binary neutron star mergers using the DLT40 Supernova
search, and the native AT~2017gfo/DLT17ck light curve obtained with the same telescope and software
system. Excluding AT~2017gfo/DLT17ck due to visibility issues, which was only discovered thanks
to the aLIGO/aVirgo trigger, no other similar transients detected during 13 months of daily cadence
observations of $\sim$ 2200 nearby ($<$40 Mpc) galaxies. We find that the rate of BNS mergers is lower
than 0.47 - 0.55 kilonovae per 100 years per $10^{10}$ $L_{B_{\odot}}$ (depending on the adopted
extinction distribution). In volume, this translates to $<0.99\times 10^{-4}\,_{-0.15}^{+0.19},\rm{Mpc^{-3}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$(SNe
Ia-like extinction distribution), consistent with previous BNS coalescence rates. Based on our
rate limit, and the sensitivity of aLIGO/aVirgo during O2, it is very unlikely that kilonova events
are lurking in old pointed galaxy SN search datasets.
