High resolution transit spectroscopy has proven to be a reliable technique for the characterization
of the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres. Taking advantage of the broad spectral coverage
of the CARMENES spectrograph, we initiated a survey aimed at characterizing a broad range of planetary
systems. Here, we report our observations of three transits of \tplanet with CARMENES in search
of \het\ absorption. On one of the nights, the He~{\sc i} region was heavily contaminated by OH$^-$
telluric emission and, thus, it was not useful for our purposes. The remaining two nights had a very
different signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) due to weather. They both indicate the presence of \het\
absorption in the transmission spectrum of \tplanet, although a statistically valid detection
can only be claimed for the night with higher S/N. For that night, we retrieved a 1.5$\pm$0.3\% absorption
depth, translating into a $R_p(\lambda)/R_p = 1.15\pm 0.14$ at this wavelength. Spectro-photometric
light curves for this same night also indicate the presence of extra absorption during the planetary
transit with a consistent absorption depth. The \het\ absorption is modeled in detail using a radiative
transfer code, and the results of our modeling efforts are compared to the observations. We find
that the mass-loss rate, \mlr, is confined to a range of 3\,$\times\,10^{10}$\,\gs\ for $T$ = 6000\,K
to 10\,$\times\,10^{10}$\,\gs\ for $T$ = 9000\,K. We discuss the physical mechanisms and implications
of the He~{\sc i} detection in \tplanet and put it in context as compared to similar detections and
non-detections in other Neptune-size planets. We also present improved stellar and planetary
parameter determinations based on our visible and near-infrared observations.
