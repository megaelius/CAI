This 3rd paper in the CHANG-ES series shows the first results from our regular data taken with the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). The edge-on galaxy, UGC 10288, has been observed in the B,
C, and D configurations at L-band (1.5 GHz) and in the C and D configurations at C-band (6 GHz) in all
polarization products. We show the first spatially resolved images in these bands,the first polarization
images, and the first composed image at an intermediate frequency (4.1 GHz) which has been formed
from a combination of all data sets. A surprising new result is the presence of a strong, polarized,
double-lobed extragalactic radio source ({\it CHANG-ES A}) almost immediately behind the galaxy
and perpendicular to its disk. The core of {\it CHANG-ES A} has an optical counterpart at a photometric
redshift of $z_{phot}\,=\,0.39$; the southern radio lobe is behind the disk of UGC 10288 and the
northern lobe is behind the halo region. This background `probe' has allowed us to do a preliminary
Faraday Rotation analysis of the foreground galaxy, putting limits on the regular magnetic field
and electron density in the halo of UGC 10288 in regions in which there is no direct detection of a radio
continuum halo. We have revised the flux densities of the two sources individually as well as the
star formation rate (SFR) for UGC 10288. UGC 10288 would have fallen well below the CHANG-ES flux
density cutoff, had it been considered without the brighter contribution of the background source.
UGC 10288 shows discrete high-latitude radio continuum features, but it does not have a {\it global}
radio continuum halo. The total minimum magnetic field strength at a sample position in the arc is
$\sim$ 10 $\mu$G. Thus, this galaxy still appears to be able to form substantial high latitude, localized
features in spite of its relatively low SFR.
