Several circumbinary planets have recently been discovered. The orbit of a planet around a binary
stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The effects that radiation from the host stars
may have on the planet atmospheres must be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary
system, these stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high stellar activity
and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are stronger than for exoplanets around single
stars, and cause a faster evaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar
radiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the survival of these
planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for the photons that are easily absorbed
by a planet atmosphere that is mainly composed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition
is expected to absorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to evaluate
the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the (nondetectable) EUV part of the
spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets in a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation
that may cause a total loss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars will
be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These systems will be difficult
to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still, planets may orbit around binary systems of low
mass stars for wider orbits. Currently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected
by thermal photoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The distribution
of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much longer periods than the average
of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of strong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary
planets.
