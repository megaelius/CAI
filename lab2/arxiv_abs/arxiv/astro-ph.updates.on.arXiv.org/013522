Blazars are radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets oriented towards the
observer's line-of-sight. Based on their optical spectra, blazars may be classified as flat-spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQs) or BL Lacs. FSRQs are more luminous blazars with both narrow and broad emission
and absorption lines, while BL Lacs are less luminous and featureless. Recent studies show that
blazars dominate (93%) the already-identified EGRET sources (142), suggesting that among the
unidentified sources (129) there could still be faint blazars. Due to the presence of a strong non-thermal
component inside their jets, blazars are found to display a weaker depression at 4000 {\AA} (K4000<0.4).
In this study, we aimed at determining the K4000 break for a selected sample among the potential blazar
candidates from unidentified EGRET sources to confirm their blazar nature. We used two blazar candidates,
3EGJ1800-0146 and 3EGJ1709-0817 associated with radio counterparts, J1802-0207 and J1713-0817,
respectively. Their optical counterparts were obtained through spectroscopic observations
using Robert Stobie spectrograph (RSS) at the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) in South
Africa. The observed Ca II H & K lines depression at 4000 {\AA} in spectra of these sources show a shallow
depression, K4000=0.35+-0.02 and 0.24+-0.01, respectively, suggesting that these sources are
blazar candidates. Moreover, the redshifts z=0.165 and 0.26 measured in their spectra confirm
the extragalactic nature of these sources. Keywords: line: identification, radiation mechanisms:
