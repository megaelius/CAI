This paper provides an overview of the PACS photometer flux calibration concept, in particular
for the principal observation mode, the scan map. The absolute flux calibration is tied to the photospheric
models of five fiducial stellar standards (alpha Boo, alpha Cet, alpha Tau, beta And, gamma Dra).
The data processing steps to arrive at a consistent and homogeneous calibration are outlined. In
the current state the relative photometric accuracy is around 2% in all bands. Starting from the
present calibration status, the characterization and correction for instrumental effects affecting
the relative calibration accuracy is described and an outlook for the final achievable calibration
numbers is given. After including all the correction for the instrumental effects, the relative
photometric calibration accuracy (repeatability) will be as good as 0.5% in the blue and green band
and 2% in the red band. This excellent calibration starts to reveal possible inconsistencies between
the models of the K-type and the M-type stellar calibrators. The absolute calibration accuracy
is therefore mainly limited by the 5% uncertainty of the celestial standard models in all three bands.
The PACS bolometer response was extremely stable over the entire Herschel mission and a single,
time-independent response calibration file is sufficient for the processing and calibration
of the science observations. The dedicated measurements of the internal calibration sources were
needed only to characterize secondary effects. No aging effects of the bolometer or the filters
have been found. Also, we found no signs of filter leaks. The PACS photometric system is very well
characterized with a constant energy spectrum nu*Fnu = lambda*Flambda = const as a reference. Colour
corrections for a wide range of sources SEDs are determined and tabulated.
