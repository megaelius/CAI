Information of small-diameter sources is extracted from the Sino-German 6cm polarisation survey
of the Galactic plane carried out with the Urumqi 25-m telescope. We performed two-dimensional
elliptical Gaussian fits to the 6cm maps to obtain a list of sources with total-intensity and polarised
flux densities. The source list contains 3832 sources with a fitted diameter smaller than 16 arcmin
and a peak flux density exceeding 30 mJy, so about 5 times the rms noise, of the total-intensity data.
The cumulative source count indicates completeness for flux densities exceeding about 60 mJy.
We identify 125 linearly polarised sources at 6cm with a peak polarisation flux density greater
than 10 mJy, so about 3 times the rms noise, of the polarised-intensity data. Despite lacking compact
steep spectrum sources, the 6cm catalogue lists about 20 percent more sources than the Effelsberg
21cm source catalogue at the same angular resolution and for the same area. Most of the faint 6cm sources
must have a flat spectrum and are either HII regions or extragalactic. When compared with the Green
Bank 6cm (GB6) catalogue, we obtain higher flux densities for a number of extended sources with complex
structures. Polarised 6cm sources density are uniformly distributed in Galactic latitude. Their
number density decreases towards the inner Galaxy. More than 80 percent of the polarised sources
are most likely extragalactic. With a few exceptions, the sources have a higher percentage polarisation
at 6cm than at 21cm. Depolarisation seems to occur mostly within the sources with a minor contribution
from the Galactic foreground emission.
