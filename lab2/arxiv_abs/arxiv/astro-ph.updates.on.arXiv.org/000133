The potential role of magnetic fields and cosmic ray propagation for feedback processes in the early
Universe can be probed by studies of local starburst counterparts with an equivalent star-formation
rate. Archival data from the WSRT was reduced and a new calibration technique introduced to reach
the high dynamic ranges needed for the complex source morphology of M82. This data was combined with
archival VLA data, yielding total power maps at 3cm, 6cm, 22cm and 92cm. The data shows a confinement
of the emission at wavelengths of 3/6cm to the core region and a largely extended halo reaching up
to 4kpc away from the galaxy midplane at wavelengths of 22/92cm up to a sensitivity limit of 90muJy
and 1.8mJy respectively. The results are used to calculate the magnetic field strength in the core
region to 98muG and to 24muG in the halo regions. From the observation of free-free losses the filling
factor of the ionised medium could be estimated to 2%. We find that the radio emission from the core
region is dominated by very dense HII-regions and supernova remnants, while the surrounding medium
is filled with hot X-ray and neutral gas. Cosmic rays radiating at frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz
are suffering from high synchrotron and inverse Compton losses in the core region and are not able
to reach the halo. Even the cosmic rays radiating at longer wavelengths are only able to build up the
observed kpc sized halo, when several starbursting periods are assumed where the photon field density
varies by an order of magnitude. These findings together with the strong correlation between Halpha,
PAH+, and our radio continuum data suggests a magnetic field which is frozen into the ionised medium
and driven out of the galaxy kinematically.
