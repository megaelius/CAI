The Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) is a blind narrow-band H$\alpha$+[NII]
imaging survey carried out with MegaCam at the CFHT. During pilot observations we have observed
NGC 4330, an intermediate mass, edge-on star forming spiral currently falling into the core of the
Virgo cluster. New deep observations revealed a low surface brightness 10 kpc tail exhibiting a
peculiar filamentary structure. The filaments are remarkably parallel one another and clearly
indicate the direction of motion of the galaxy in the Virgo potential. Motivated by the detection
of these features, indicating ongoing gas stripping, we collected literature photometry in 15
bands from the far-UV to the far-IR and deep optical long slit spectroscopy using the FORS2 instrument
at the ESO Very Large Telescope. Using a newly developed Monte Carlo code that jointly fits spectroscopy
and photometry, we reconstructed the star formation histories in apertures along the major axis
of the galaxy. Our results have been validated against the output of CIGALE, a fitting code which
has been previously used for similar studies. We found a clear outside-in gradient with radius of
the time when the quenching event started: the outermost radii have been stripped 500 Myr ago, while
the stripping has reached the inner 5 kpc from the center in the last 100 Myr. Regions at even smaller
radii are currently still forming stars fueled by the presence of HI and H2 gas. When compared to statistical
studies of the quenching timescales in the local Universe we find that ram pressure stripping of
the cold gas is an effective mechanism to reduce the transformation times for galaxies falling into
massive clusters. Future systematic studies of all the active galaxies observed by VESTIGE in the
Virgo cluster will extend these results to a robust statistical framework.
