We present an inference of the nuclear symmetry energy magnitude $J$, the slope $L$ and the curvature
$K_{\rm sym}$ by combining neutron skin data on Ca, Pb and Sn isotopes and our best theoretical information
about pure neutron matter (PNM). A Bayesian framework is used to consistently incorporate prior
knowledge of the PNM equation of state from chiral effective field theory calculations. Neutron
skins are modeled in a Hartree-Fock approach using an extended Skyrme energy-density functional
which allows for independent variation of $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$ without affecting the symmetric
nuclear matter equation of state. We discuss the choice of neutron skin data sets, and combining
errors in quadrature we obtain 95\% credible values of $J=31.3\substack{+4.2 \\ -5.9}$ MeV, $L=40\substack{+34
\\ -26}$ MeV and $K_{\tau} = L - 6K_{\rm sym}= -444\substack{+100 \\ -84}$ MeV using uninformative
priors in $J$, $L$ and $K_{\rm sym}$, and $J=31.9\substack{+1.3 \\ -1.3}$ MeV, $L=37\substack{+9
\\ -8}$ MeV and $K_{\tau} = -480\substack{+25 \\ -26}$ MeV using PNM priors. The correlations between
symmetry energy parameters induced by neutron skin data is discussed and compared with the droplet
model. Neutron skin data alone is shown to place limits on the symmetry energy parameters as stringent
as those obtained from chiral effective field theory alone, and when combined the 95\% credible
intervals are reduced by a factor of 4-5. Ahead of new measurements of lead and calcium neutron skins
from parity-violating electron scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab and Mainz Superconducting
Accelerator, we make predictions based on existing data on neutron skins of tin for the neutron skins
of calcium and lead of 0.166$\pm$0.008 fm and $0.169 \pm 0.014$ fm respectively, using uninformative
priors, and 0.167$\pm$0.008 fm and $0.172 \pm 0.015$ fm respectively, using PNM priors.
