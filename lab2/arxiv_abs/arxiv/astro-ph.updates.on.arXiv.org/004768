We present a linear clustering model of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies at large
scales that is used to measure the cosmic star formation rate density up to redshift 6, the effective
bias of the CIB and the mass of dark-matter halos hosting dusty star-forming galaxies. This is achieved
using the Planck CIB auto- and cross-power spectra (between different frequencies) and CIBxCMB
lensing cross-spectra measurements, as well as external constraints (e.g. on the CIB mean brightness).
We recovered an obscured star formation history which agrees well with the values derived from infrared
deep surveys and we confirm that the obscured star formation dominates the unobscured one up to at
least z=4. The obscured and unobscured star formation rate densities are compatible at $1\sigma$
at z=5. We also determined the evolution of the effective bias of the galaxies emitting the CIB and
found a rapid increase from $\sim$0.8 at z$=$0 to $\sim$8 at z$=$4. At 2$<$z$<$4, this effective
bias is similar to that of galaxies at the knee of the mass functions and submillimeter galaxies.
This effective bias is the weighted average of the true bias with the corresponding emissivity of
the galaxies. The halo mass corresponding to this bias is thus not exactly the mass contributing
the most to the star formation density. Correcting for this, we obtained a value of log(M$_h$/M$_{\odot}$)=12.77$_{-0.125}^{+0.128}$
for the mass of the typical dark matter halo contributing to the CIB at z=2. Finally, we also computed
using a Fisher matrix analysis how the uncertainties on the cosmological parameters affect the
recovered CIB model parameters and find that the effect is negligible.
