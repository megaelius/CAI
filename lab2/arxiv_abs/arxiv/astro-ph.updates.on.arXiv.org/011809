The isotopic ratio of nitrogen measured in primitive Solar System bodies shows a broad range of values,
the origin of which remains unknown. One key question is whether these isotopic reservoirs of nitrogen
predate the comet formation stage or are posterior to it. Another central question is elucidating
the processes that can produce the observed variations in the 14N/15N isotopic ratio. Disks that
orbit pre-main-sequence stars provide unique opportunities for observing the chemical content
of analogs of the protosolar nebula and therefore for building a comprehensive scenario for the
origin of nitrogen in the Solar System and in planet-forming disks. We present spectrally and spatially
resolved observations of the hyperfine structure of the 4-3 rotational transition of HCN and its
main isotopologs H13CN and HC15N in the disk orbiting the 8 Myr old TTauri star TW Hya. The spatially
averaged HCN/H13CN and HCN/HC15N abundance ratios are 86+/-4 and 223+/-21, respectively. The
latter value is significantly lower than the CN:C15N ratio 323+/-30 in this disk and thus provides
the first evidence that two isotopic reservoirs of nitrogen are present in a disk at the stage of giant
planet and comet formation. Furthermore, we find clear evidence for an increase in the ratio of HCN
to HC15N with radius. The ratio in the outer disk is 339+/-28, in excellent agreement with direct
measurements in the local interstellar medium, and with the bulk nitrogen isotopic ratio predicted
from galactic evolution calculations. In the comet formation region at r=20 au, the ratio is a factor
~3 lower, 121+/-11. This radial increase qualitatively agrees with the scenario in which selective
photodissociation of N 2 is the dominant fractionation process. However, our isotopic ratios and
kinetic temperature of the HCN-emitting layers quantitatively disagree with models of nitrogen
chemistry in disks.
