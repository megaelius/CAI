We present LOFAR $120-168$ MHz images of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 1240 that hosts double
radio relics. In combination with the GMRT $595-629$ MHz and VLA $2-4$ GHz data, we characterised
the spectral and polarimetric properties of the radio emission. The spectral indices for the relics
steepen from their outer edges towards the cluster centre and the electric field vectors are approximately
perpendicular to the major axes of the relics. The results are consistent with the picture that these
relics trace large-scale shocks propagating outwards during the merger. Assuming diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA), we obtain shock Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M}=2.4$ and $2.3$ for the northern
and southern shocks, respectively. For $\mathcal{M}\lesssim3$ shocks, a pre-existing population
of mildly relativistic electrons is required to explain the brightness of the relics due to the high
($>10$ per cent) particle acceleration efficiency required. However, for $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim4$
shocks the required efficiency is $\gtrsim1\%$ and $\gtrsim0.5\%$, respectively, which is low
enough for shock acceleration directly from the thermal pool. We used the fractional polarization
to constrain the viewing angle to $\geqslant(53\pm3)^\circ$ and $\geqslant(39\pm5)^\circ$
for the northern and southern shocks, respectively. We found no evidence for diffuse emission in
the cluster central region. If the halo spans the entire region between the relics ($\sim1.8\,\text{Mpc}$)
our upper limit on the power is $P_\text{1.4 GHz}=(1.4\pm0.6)\times10^{23}\,\text{W}\text{Hz}^{-1}$
which is approximately equal to the anticipated flux from a cluster of this mass. However, if the
halo is smaller than this, our constraints on the power imply that the halo is underluminous.
