The Simons Observatory (SO) will make precision temperature and polarization measurements of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) over angular scales between 1 arcminute and tens of degrees
using over 60,000 detectors and sampling frequencies between 27 and 270 GHz. SO will consist of a
six-meter-aperture telescope coupled to over 30,000 detectors and an array of half-meter aperture
refractive cameras, coupled to an additional 30,000+ detectors. The unique combination of large
and small apertures in a single CMB observatory will allow us to sample a wide range of angular scales
over a common survey area while providing an important stepping stone towards the realization of
CMB-Stage IV. CMB-Stage IV is a proposed project that will combine and expand on existing facilities
in Chile and Antarctica to reach the ~500,000 detectors required for CMB-Stage IV's science objectives.
SO and CMB-Stage IV will measure fundamental cosmological parameters of our universe, constrain
primordial fluctuations, find high redshift clusters via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, constrain
properties of neutrinos, and trace the density and velocity of the matter in the universe over cosmic
time. The complex set of technical and science requirements for SO has led to innovative instrumentation
solutions which we will discuss. For instance, the SO large aperture telescope will couple to a cryogenic
receiver that is 2.4 m in diameter and 2.4 m long. We will give an overview of the drivers for and designs
of the SO telescopes and cameras as well as the current status of the project. We will also discuss
the current status of CMB-Stage IV and important next steps in the project's development.
