This paper presents a new theory of the dynamical tides of celestial bodies. It is founded on a Newtonian
creep instead of the classical delaying approach of the standard viscoelastic theories and the
results of the theory derive mainly from the solution of a non-homogeneous ordinary differential
equation. Lags appear in the solution but as quantities determined from the solution of the equation
and are not arbitrary external quantities plugged in an elastic model. The resulting lags of the
tide components are increasing functions of their frequencies (as in Darwin's theory), but not
small quantities. The amplitudes of the tide components depend on the viscosity of the body and on
their frequencies; they are not constants. The resulting stationary rotations (pseudo-synchronous)
have an excess velocity roughly proportional to $6ne^2/(\chi^2+1/\chi^2)$ ($\chi$ is the mean-motion
in units of one critical frequency - the relaxation factor - inversely proportional to the viscosity)
instead of the exact $6ne^2$ of standard theories. The dissipation in the pseudo-synchronous solution
is inversely proportional to $(\chi+1/\chi)$. In the inviscid limit it is roughly proportional
to the frequency (as in standard theories), but that behavior is inverted when the viscosity is high
and the tide frequency larger than the critical frequency. For free rotating bodies, the dissipation
is given by the same law, but now $\chi$ is the frequency of the semi-diurnal tide in units of the critical
frequency. This approach fails to reproduce the actual tidal lags on Earth. In this case, to reconcile
theory and observations, we need to assume the existence of an elastic tide superposed to the creeping
tide. The theory is applied to several Solar System and extrasolar bodies and currently available
data are used to estimate the relaxation factor $\gamma$ (i.e. the critical frequency) of these
bodies.
