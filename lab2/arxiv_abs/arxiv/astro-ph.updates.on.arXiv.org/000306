Constraints on the main cosmological parameters using CMB or large scale structure data are usually
based on power-law assumption of the primordial power spectrum (PPS). However, in the absence of
a preferred model for the early universe, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameter
estimates are strongly prejudiced by the assumed power-law form of PPS. In this paper, for the first
time, we perform cosmological parameter estimation allowing the free form of the primordial spectrum.
This is in fact the most general approach to estimate cosmological parameters without assuming
any particular form for the primordial spectrum. We use direct reconstruction of the PPS for any
point in the cosmological parameter space using recently modified Richardson-Lucy algorithm
however other alternative reconstruction methods could be used for this purpose as well. We use
WMAP 9 year data in our analysis considering CMB lensing effect and we report, for the first time,
that the flat spatial universe with no cosmological constant is ruled out by more than 4\sigma confidence
limit without assuming any particular form of the primordial spectrum. This would be probably the
most robust indication towards dark energy using CMB data alone. Our results on the estimated cosmological
parameters show that higher values of baryonic and matter density and lower value of Hubble parameter
(in comparison to the estimated values by assuming power-law PPS) is preferred by the data. However,
the estimated cosmological parameters by assuming free form of the PPS have overlap at 1\sigma confidence
level with the estimated values assuming power-law form of PPS.
