Numerical simulations play a key important role in modern cosmology. Examples are plenty including
the cosmic web - large scale structure of the distribution of galaxies in space - which was first observed
in N-body simulations and later discovered in observations. The cuspy dark matter halo profiles,
the overabundance of satellites, the Too-Big-Too-Fail problem are other examples of theoretical
predictions that have a dramatic impact on recent developments in cosmology and galaxy formation.
Large observational surveys such as e.g. SDSS, Euclid, and LSST are intimately connected with extensive
cosmological simulations that provide statistical errors and tests for systematics. Accurate
predictions for baryonic acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions from high-resolution
and large-volume cosmological simulations are required for interpretation of these large-scale
galaxy/qso surveys. However, most of the results from extensive computer simulations, that would
be greatly beneficial if publicly available, are still in hands of few research groups. Even when
the simulation data is available, sharing vast amounts of data can be overwhelming. We argue that
there is an effective and simple path to expand the data access and dissemination of numerous results
from different cosmological models. Here we demonstrate that public access can be effectively
provided with relatively modest resources. Among different results, we release for the astronomical
community terabytes of raw data of th popular Bolshoi and MultiDark simulations. We also provide
numerous results that are focused on mimicking observational data and galaxy surveys for major
projects. Skies and Universes is a community effort: data are produced and shared by many research
groups. We offer to other cosmologists and astronomers to host their data products in the skiesanduniverses.org
space.
