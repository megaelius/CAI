The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect and the X-ray emission offer separate and highly complementary
probes of the thermodynamics of the intracluster medium. We present JoXSZ, the first publicly available
code designed to jointly fit SZ and X-ray data coming from various instruments to derive the thermodynamic
profiles of galaxy clusters. JoXSZ follows a fully Bayesian forward-modelling approach, accounts
for the SZ calibration uncertainty and X-ray background level systematic. It improves upon most
state-of-the-art, and not publicly available, analyses because it adopts the correct Poisson-Gauss
expression for the joint likelihood, makes full use of the information contained in the observations,
even in the case of missing values within the datasets, has a more inclusive error budget, and adopts
a consistent temperature across the various parts of the code, allowing for differences between
X-ray and SZ gas mass weighted temperatures when required by the user. JoXSZ accounts for beam smearing
and data analysis transfer function, accounts for the temperature and metallicity dependencies
of the SZ and X-ray conversion factors, adopts flexible parametrization for the thermodynamic
profiles, and on user request allows either adopting or relaxing the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium (HE). When HE holds, JoXSZ uses a physical (positive) prior on the radial derivative
of the enclosed mass and derives the mass profile and overdensity radii $r_\Delta$. For these reasons,
JoXSZ goes beyond simple SZ and electron density fits. We illustrate the use of JoXSZ by combining
Chandra and NIKA data on the high-redshift cluster CL J1226.9+3332. The code is written in Python,
it is fully documented and the users are free to customize their analysis in accordance with their
needs and requirements. JoXSZ is publicly available on GitHub.
