We study the implementation of mechanical feedback from supernovae (SNe) and stellar mass loss
in galaxy simulations, within the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We present
the FIRE-2 algorithm for coupling mechanical feedback, which can be applied to any hydrodynamics
method (e.g. fixed-grid, moving-mesh, and mesh-less methods), and black hole as well as stellar
feedback. This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and avoids
imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We show that it is critical to incorporate both
momentum and thermal energy of mechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe
cooling radii when they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SN explosions,
we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution, reproduces converged solutions
in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common 'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic'
(particle-kicking) schemes in the literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass
resolution >100 solar masses, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged solution.
In galaxy-formation simulations, this divergence leads to orders-of-magnitude differences
in galaxy properties, unless those models are adjusted in a resolution-dependent way. We show that
all models that individually time-resolve SNe converge to the FIRE-2 solution at sufficiently
high resolution. However, in both idealized single-SN simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation
simulations, the FIRE-2 algorithm converges much faster than other sub-grid models without re-tuning
parameters.
