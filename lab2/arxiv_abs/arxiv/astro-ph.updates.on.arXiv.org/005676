Secondary eclipse observations of several of the hottest hot Jupiters show featureless, blackbody-like
spectra or molecular emission features, which are consistent with thermal inversions being present
in those atmospheres. Theory predicts a transition between warmer atmospheres with thermal inversions
and cooler atmospheres without inversions, but the exact transition point is unknown. In order
to further investigate this issue, we observed two secondary eclipses of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 instrument and combined these data with previous Spitzer
and Kepler secondary eclipse observations. The HST and Spitzer data can be well fit by a blackbody
with $T=2692 \pm 14$ K, and the Kepler data point constrains the geometric albedo to $A_{g}=0.077
\pm 0.006$. We modeled these data with a 3D GCM and 1D self-consistent forward models. The 1D models
indicate that the atmosphere has a thermal inversion, weak heat redistribution, and water dissociation
that limits the range of pressures probed. This result suggests that WFC3 observations of HAT-P-7b
and possibly some other ultra-hot Jupiters appear blackbody-like because they probe a region near
the tropopause where the atmospheric temperature changes slowly with pressure. Additionally,
the 1D models constrain the atmospheric metallicity ($[\text{M/H}]=-0.87^{+0.38}_{-0.34}$)
and the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O $<1$ at 99 % confidence). The solar composition 3D GCM matches
the Spitzer data but generally underpredicts the flux in the WFC3 bandpass and cannot reproduce
its featureless shape. This discrepancy could be explained by high atmospheric drag or nightside
clouds, and may be better understood through further observation with the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST).
