The distribution of Ly$\alpha$ emission is an presently accessible method for studying the state
of the intergalactic medium (IGM) into the reionization era. We carried out deep spectroscopic
observations in order to search for Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies with photometric redshifts
$z$ = 5.5 - 8.3 selected from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey
(CANDELS). Utilizing data from the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph, we explore a wavelength coverage
of Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z$ ~ 5 - 7 with four nights of spectroscopic observations for 118 galaxies,
detecting five emission lines with ~ 5$\sigma$ significance: three in the GOODS-N and two in the
GOODS-S field. We constrain the equivalent width (EW) distribution of Ly$\alpha$ emission by comparing
the number of detected objects with the expected number constructed from detailed simulations
of mock emission lines that account for the observational conditions (e.g., exposure time, wavelength
coverage, and sky emission) and galaxy photometric redshift probability distribution functions.
The Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution is well described by an exponential form, $\text{dN/dEW}\propto
\text{exp(-EW/}W_0)$, characterized by the $e$-folding scale ($W_0$) of ~ 60 - 100$\AA$ at 0.3
< $z$ < 6. By contrast, our measure of the Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution at 6.0 < $z$ < 7.0 rejects a Ly$\alpha$
EW distribution with $W_0$ > 36.4$\AA$ (125.3$\AA$) at 1$\sigma$ (2$\sigma$) significance. This
provides additional evidence that the EW distribution of Ly$\alpha$ declines at $z$ > 6, suggesting
an increasing fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM at that epoch.
