Future instruments need efficient coronagraphs over large spectral ranges to enable broadband
imaging or spectral characterization of exoplanets 1e8 fainter than their star. Several solutions
were proposed. Pupil apodizers can attenuate the star intensity by a 1e10 factor but they transmit
a few percents of the planet light only. Cascades of phase/amplitude masks can both attenuate the
starlight and transmit most of the planet light but the number of optics to align is not a practical
solution for an instrument. Finally, vector phase masks can be used to detect faint sources close
to bright stars but they require the use of high quality circular polarizers and as for the previous
solution, this leads to a complex instrument with numerous optics to align and stabilize. We propose
simple coronagraphs that need one scalar phase mask and one binary Lyot stop only providing high
transmission for the planet light (>50%) and high attenuation of the starlight over a large spectral
bandpass (~30%) and a 360 degree field-of-view. From mathematical considerations, we find a family
of 2D-phase masks optimized for an unobscured pupil. One mask is an azimuthal wrapped vortex phase
ramp. We probe its coronagraphic performance using numerical simulations and laboratory tests.
From numerical simulations, we predict the wrapped vortex can attenuate the peak of the star image
by a factor of 1e4 over a 29% bandpass and 1e5 over a 18% bandpass with transmission of more than 50%
of the planet flux at ~4 lambda/D. We confirm these predictions in laboratory in visible light between
550nm and 870nm. We also obtain laboratory dark hole images in which exoplanets with fluxes that
are 3e-8 times the host star flux could be detected at 3sigma. Taking advantage of a new technology
for etching continuous 2D-functions, new type of masks can be easily manufactured opening new possibilities
for broadband coronagraphy.
