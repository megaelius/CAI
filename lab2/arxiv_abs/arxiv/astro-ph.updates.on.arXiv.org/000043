We study the impact of Early Dark Energy fluctuations in the linear and non-linear regimes of structure
formation. In these models the energy density of dark energy is non-negligible at high redshifts
and the fluctuations in the dark energy component can have the same order of magnitude of dark matter
fluctuations. Since two basic approximations usually taken in the standard scenario of quintessence
models, that both dark energy density during the matter dominated period and dark energy fluctuations
on small scales are negligible, are not valid in such models, we first study approximate analytical
solutions for dark matter and dark energy perturbations in the linear regime. This study is helpful
to find consistent initial conditions for the system of equations and to analytically understand
the effects of Early Dark Energy and its fluctuations, which are also verified numerically. In the
linear regime we compute the matter growth and variation of the gravitational potential associated
with the Integrated Sachs-Wolf effect, showing that these observables present important modifications
due to Early Dark Energy fluctuations, though making them more similar to $\Lambda$CDM model. We
also make use of the Spherical Collapse model to study the influence of Early Dark Energy fluctuations
in the nonlinear regime of structure formation, especially on $\delta_c$ parameter, and their
contribution to the halo mass, which we show can be of the order of 10%. We finally compute how the number
density of halos is modified in comparison to $\Lambda$CDM model and address the problem of how to
correct the mass function in order to take into account the contribution of clustered dark energy.
We conclude that the inhomogeneous Early Dark Energy models are more similar to $\Lambda$CDM model
than its homogeneous counterparts.
