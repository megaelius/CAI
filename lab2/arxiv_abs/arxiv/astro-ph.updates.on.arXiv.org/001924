The caustic technique of mass estimation of galaxy clusters relies on the assumption of spherical
symmetry, which is not always a valid assumption. Here we demonstrate the effect of spatial anisotropy
of galaxy clusters on the inferred caustic mass profiles by considering particle data from dark
matter N-body simulations. We find a factor of ~3 discrepancy between major and minor axis mass estimates
in ellipsoidal clusters within the virial radius Rv, and up to ~5 within 3 Rv. We also find filaments
to influence caustic mass estimates at a comparable magnitude. By stacking halos to align their
principal axes we find that a line of sight along the major axis overestimates the caustic mass of
galaxy clusters, as well as a line of sight along the minor axis underestimates it. The mass discrepancy
between the major and minor axis is a factor of 2.47, 2.97 and 3.95 at 1, 2 and 3 Rv for virial masses Mv
= [1,2] x 10^{14} Msun/h, and $(30-35)\%$ larger for Mv > 2 x 10^{14} Msun/h. Furthermore, the
caustic mass is overestimated on average (biased high) by 2%, 6% and 11% for the low mass bin and 11%,
15% and 21% for the high mass bin at 1, 2 and 3 Rv compared to the idealized spherical case. By stacking
halos to instead align their largest associated filament we find a mass overestimation with line
of sight nearly along the filament, and an underestimation with line of sight orthogonal to the filament.
For the low mass bin we find a factor of 2.04, 2.94 and 3.94 discrepancy within 1, 2 and 3 Rv between line
of sight along and across the filament, and a (24-54)% smaller discrepancy for the high mass bin.
We provide useful tables which can be used to estimate mass discrepancy when cluster orientation
is known, and make the stacked particle data used in our analysis available online for download.
