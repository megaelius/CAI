Citizen science refers to scientific research conducted or participated by non-professional
scientists (such as hobbyists or members from the general public). Citizen astronomy is a classic
example of citizen science. Citizen astronomers has benefited from technological advancements
in the recent decades as they fill the scientific gaps left by professional astronomers, in the areas
such as time domain observations, visual classification and data mining. Chinese citizen astronomers
have made a visible contribution in the discoveries of new objects; however, comparing to their
counterparts in the western world, they appear to be less interested in researches that do not involve
making new discovery, such as visual classification, long-term monitoring of objects, and data
mining. From a questionnaire survey that aimed to investigate the motivation of Chinese citizen
astronomers, we find that this population is predominantly male ($92\%$) who mostly reside in economically
developed provinces. A large fraction ($69\%$) of the respondents are students and young professionals
younger than the age of 25, which differs significantly from the occupation and age distribution
of typical Chinese Internet users as well as the user distribution of large international citizen
science projects such as the Galaxy Zoo. This suggests that youth generation in China is more willing
to participate citizen astronomy research than average generation. Additionally, we find that
interests in astronomy, desire to learn new knowledges, have a fun experience and meet new friends
in the community are all important driving factors for Chinese citizen astronomers to participate
research. This also differs from their counterparts in western countries. (full abstract in PDF)
