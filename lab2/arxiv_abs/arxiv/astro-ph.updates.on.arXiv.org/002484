We use the "Evolution and assembly of galaxies and their environment" (EAGLE) cosmological simulation
to investigate the effect of baryons on the density profiles of rich galaxy clusters. We focus on
the six most massive EAGLE clusters ($M_{200} > 10^{14}M_\odot$) which can be compared with
a recent analysis of seven real clusters by Newman et al. The central brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) in EAGLE have steep stellar density profiles, $\rho_*(r) \propto r^{-3}$. Stars dominate
the mass density for $r < 10~{\rm kpc}$, and, as a result, the total mass density profiles are steeper
than the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. However, the dark matter halo itself closely follows
the NFW form at all resolved radii ($r\gtrsim3.0~{\rm kpc}$). The \eagle BCGs have similar surface
brightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles as the BCGs observed by Newmanet al.
The central slopes of the total mass profiles are also consistent with the observed clusters. However,
after subtracting the contribution of the stars to the central density, Newman et al. find significantly
shallower slopes than NFW, in contradiction with the EAGLE results. We discuss possible reasons
for this discrepancy, such as differences in the mass of the simulated and observed clusters or orientation
biases in the observed sample. We conclude that an inconsistency between the kinematical model
adopted by Newman et al. for their BCGs, which assumes isotropic stellar orbits, and the kinematical
structure of the EAGLE BCGs, in which the orbital stellar anisotropy varies with radius and tends
to be radially biased, could explain at least part of the discrepancy.
