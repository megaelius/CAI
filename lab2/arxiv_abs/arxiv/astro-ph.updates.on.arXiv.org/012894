The Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is in an advanced stage of disruption but still
hosts its nuclear star cluster (NSC), M54, at its center. In this paper, we present a detailed kinematic
characterization of the three stellar populations present in M54: young metal-rich (YMR); intermediate-age
metal-rich (IMR); and old metal-poor (OMP), based on the spectra of $\sim6500$ individual M54 member
stars extracted from a large MUSE/VLT dataset. We find that the OMP population is slightly flattened
with a low amount of rotation ($\sim0.8$ km s$^{-1}$) and with a velocity dispersion that follows
a Plummer profile. The YMR population displays a high amount of rotation ($\sim5$ km s$^{-1}$) and
a high degree of flattening, with a lower and flat velocity dispersion profile. The IMR population
shows a high but flat velocity dispersion profile, with some degree of rotation ($\sim2$ km s$^{-1}$).
We complement our MUSE data with information from \textit{Gaia DR2} and confirm that the stars from
the OMP and YMR populations are comoving in 3D space, suggesting that they are dynamically bound.
While dynamical evolutionary effects (e.g. energy equipartition) are able to explain the differences
in velocity dispersion between the stellar populations, the strong differences in rotation indicate
different formation paths for the populations, as supported by an $N$-body simulation tailored
to emulate the YMR-OMP system. This study provides additional evidence for the M54 formation scenario
proposed in our previous work, where this NSC formed via GC accretion (OMP) and in situ formation
from gas accretion in a rotationally supported disc (YMR).
