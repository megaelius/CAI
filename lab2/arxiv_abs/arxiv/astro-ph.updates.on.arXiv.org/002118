Future arcminute resolution polarization data from ground-based Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) observations can be used to estimate the contribution to the temperature power spectrum from
the primary anisotropies and to uncover the signature of reionization near $\ell=1500$ in the small
angular-scale temperature measurements. Our projections are based on combining expected small-scale
E-mode polarization measurements from Advanced ACTPol in the range $300<\ell<3000$ with
simulated temperature data from the full Planck mission in the low and intermediate $\ell$ region,
$2<\ell<2000$. We show that the six basic cosmological parameters determined from this
combination of data will predict the underlying primordial temperature spectrum at high multipoles
to better than $1\%$ accuracy. Assuming an efficient cleaning from multi-frequency channels of
most foregrounds in the temperature data, we investigate the sensitivity to the only residual secondary
component, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) term. The CMB polarization is used to break
degeneracies between primordial and secondary terms present in temperature and, in effect, to
remove from the temperature data all but the residual kSZ term. We estimate a $15 \sigma$ detection
of the diffuse homogeneous kSZ signal from expected AdvACT temperature data at $\ell>1500$,
leading to a measurement of the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, at $1\%$
precision. Alternatively, by exploring the reionization signal encoded in the patchy kSZ measurements,
we bound the time and duration of the reionization with $\sigma(z_{\rm re})=1.1$ and $\sigma(\Delta
z_{\rm re})=0.2$. We find that these constraints degrade rapidly with large beam sizes, which highlights
the importance of arcminute-scale resolution for future CMB surveys.
