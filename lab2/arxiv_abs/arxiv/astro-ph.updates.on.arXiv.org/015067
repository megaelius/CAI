Jets often have a helical structure containing both hot and cooler, denser than the corona, ejected
plasma. Different mechanisms are proposed to trigger jets by magnetic reconnection between the
emergence of magnetic flux and environment, or induced by twisted photospheric motions bringing
the system to instability. Multi-wavelength observations of a twisted jet observed with SDO/AIA
and IRIS was selected to understand how the twist was injected in the jet because fortunately, IRIS
slit was just crossing the reconnection site. We follow the magnetic history of the active region
based on the analysis of HMI vector magnetic field computed with the UNNOFIT code. This AR is the result
of the collapse of two emerging magnetic fluxes (EMF) overlaid by AFS well-observed with AIA, IRIS,
and NVST in H-alpha. In the magnetic field maps, we evidenced the pattern of a long sigmoidal flux
rope (FR) along the polarity inversion line between the two EMFs which is the site of the reconnection.
Before the jet, there was an extension of the FR, and a part of it was detached and formed a small bipole
with a bald patch (BP) region which dynamically became an X-current sheet over the dome of one EMF
where the reconnection took place. At the time of the reconnection, the Mg II spectra exhibited a
strong extension of the blue wing which is decreasing over a distance of 10 Mm (from -300 km/s to a few
km/s). This is the signature of the transfer of the twist to the jet. Comparison with numerical magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) simulations confirmed the existence of the long FR. We conjecture that there is a transfer
of twist to the jet during the extension of the FR to the reconnection site without FR eruption. The
reconnection would start in the low atmosphere in the BP reconnection region and extend at an X-point
along the current sheet formed above.
