The CARMENES survey is searching for Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs using the radial velocity
method. Studying the stellar activity of the target stars is important to avoid false planet detections
and to improve our understanding of the atmospheres of late-type stars. In this work we present measurements
of activity indicators at visible and near-infrared wavelengths for 331 M dwarfs observed with
CARMENES. Our aim is to identify the activity indicators that are most sensitive and easiest to measure,
and the correlations among these indicators. We also wish to characterise their variability. Using
a spectral subtraction technique, we measured pseudo-equivalent widths of the He I D3, H$\alpha$,
He I $\lambda$10833 {\AA}, and Pa$\beta$ lines, the Na I D doublet, and the Ca II infrared triplet,
which have a chromospheric component in active M dwarfs. In addition, we measured an index of the
strength of two TiO and two VO bands, which are formed in the photosphere. We also searched for periodicities
in these activity indicators for all sample stars using generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms.
We find that the most slowly rotating stars of each spectral subtype have the strongest H$\alpha$
absorption. H$\alpha$ is correlated most strongly with He I D3, whereas Na I D and the Ca II infrared
triplet are also correlated with H$\alpha$. He I $\lambda$10833 {\AA} and Pa$\beta$ show no clear
correlations with the other indicators. The TiO bands show an activity effect that does not appear
in the VO bands. We find that the relative variations of H$\alpha$ and He I D3 are smaller for stars
with higher activity levels, while this anti-correlation is weaker for Na I D and the Ca II infrared
triplet, and is absent for He I $\lambda$10833 {\AA} and Pa$\beta$. Periodic variation with the
rotation period most commonly appears in the TiO bands, H$\alpha$, and in the Ca II infrared triplet.
