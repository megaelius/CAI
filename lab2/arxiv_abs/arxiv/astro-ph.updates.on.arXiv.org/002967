(Original) Recent high-resolution spectra of the Type Ia SN 2006X have revealed the presence of
time-variable and blueshifted Na I D features, interpreted by Patat et al. as originating in circumstellar
material within the progenitor system. The variation seen in SN 2006X induces relatively large
changes in the total Na I D equivalent width ($\Delta\rm{EW}\approx 0.5$ \r{A} in just over two weeks),
that would be detectable at lower resolutions. We have used a large data set comprising 2400 low-resolution
spectra of 450 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the CfA Supernova Program to search for variable
Na I D features. Out of the 31 SNe Ia (including SN 2006X) in which we could have detected similar EW
variations, only one other (SN 1999cl) shows variable Na I D features, with an even larger change
over a similar ~10-day timescale ($\Delta\rm{EW} = 1.66 \pm 0.21$ \r{A}). Interestingly, both
SN 1999cl and SN 2006X are the two most highly-reddened objects in our sample, raising the possibility
that the variability is connected to dusty environments. (Erratum) The large variation in the Na
I D equivalent width observed in SN 1999cl results in fact from a measurement error. Our new measurements
show that the EW variation is significantly lower, at $0.43 \pm 0.14$ \r{A}. While the EW variation
remains statistically significant (3.1$\sigma$ different from zero), it is now below the detection
threshold of 0.5 \r{A} derived from the Monte Carlo simulations published in the original paper.
As a result, SN 1999cl should no longer be considered as an object displaying variable Na I D lines
in our study. The fraction of SNe Ia in our sample displaying Na I D lines thus goes from $\sim$6% (2/31)
in the original study to $\sim$3% (1/31) in the revised analysis, SN 2006X being the only SN Ia in our
sample with variable Na I D lines.
