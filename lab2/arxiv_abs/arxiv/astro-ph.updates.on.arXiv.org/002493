Over the past decade, the Secret Lives of Cepheids (SLiC) program has been carried out at Villanova
University to study aspects and behaviors of classical Cepheids that are still not well-understood.
In this, the first of several planned papers on program Cepheids, we report the current results for
delta Cep, the Cepheid prototype. Ongoing photometry has been obtained to search for changes in
the pulsation period, light curve morphology and amplitude. Combining our photometry with the
times of maximum light compilation by Berdnikov 2000 returns a small period change of dP/dt ~ -0.1006
+/- 0.0002 sec yr^-1. There is also evidence for a gradual light amplitude increase of ~0.011-mag
(V-band) and ~0.012-mag (B-band) per decade over the last ~50 years. In addition, HST-COS UV spectrophotometry
and XMM-Newton X-ray data were carried out to investigate the high-temperature plasmas present
above the Cepheid photospheres. In total, from the five visits (eight exposures) with XMM-Newton,
delta Cep is found to be a soft X-ray source (Lx [0.3--2 keV] ~ 4.5-13x10^28 erg sec^-1) with peak flux
at kT = 0.6-0.9 keV. The X-ray activity is found to vary, possibly in phase with the stellar pulsations.
From 2010-2013, nine observations of delta Cep were carried out with HST-COS. The UV emissions are
also variable, and well-phased with the stellar pulsations. Maximum UV line emissions occur near,
or slightly before, maximum optical light, varying by as much as twenty times. This variability
shows that pulsation-induced shock-heating plays a significant role in Cepheid atmospheres,
possibly in addition to a quiescent, magnetic heating. The results of this study show Cepheid atmospheres
to be rather complex and dynamic.
