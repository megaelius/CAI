The first opportunity to detect indications for life outside the Solar System may be provided already
within the next decade with upcoming missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the
European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and/or the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet
Large-survey (ARIEL) mission, searching for atmospheric biosignatures on planets in the habitable
zone of cool K- and M-stars. Nevertheless, their harsh stellar radiation and particle environment
could lead to photochemical loss of atmospheric biosignatures. We aim to study the influence of
cosmic rays on exoplanetary atmospheric biosignatures and the radiation environment considering
feedbacks between energetic particle precipitation, climate, atmospheric ionization, neutral
and ion chemistry, and secondary particle generation. We describe newly-combined state-of-the-art
modeling tools to study the impact of the radiation and particle environment on atmospheric particle
interaction, the influence on the atmospheric chemistry, and the climate-chemistry coupling
in a self-consistent model suite. To this end, models like the Atmospheric Radiation Interaction
Simulator (AtRIS), the Exoplanetary Terrestrial Ion Chemistry model (ExoTIC), and the updated
coupled climate-chemistry model are combined. Amongst others, we model the atmospheric response
during quiescent solar periods and during a strong solar energetic particle event as well as the
scenario-dependent terrestrial transit spectra, as seen by the NIR-Spec infrared spectrometer
onboard the JWST. We find that the comparatively weak solar event drastically increases the spectral
signal of HNO$_3$, while significantly suppressing the spectral feature of ozone. Because of the
slow recovery after such events, the latter indicates that ozone might not be a good biomarker for
planets orbiting stars with high flaring rates.
