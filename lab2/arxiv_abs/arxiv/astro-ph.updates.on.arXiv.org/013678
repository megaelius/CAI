In this work we shall study the late-time behavior of $k$-Essence $f(R)$ gravity without scalar
potential, in the presence of matter and radiation perfect fluids. We quantify the late-time study
by using the statefinder function $Y_H(z)=\frac{\rho_{DE}}{\rho_m^{(0)}}$, which is a function
of the redshift and of the Hubble rate. By appropriately rewriting the Friedmann equation in terms
of the redshift and of the function $Y_H(z)$, we numerically solve it using appropriate initial
conditions, and we critically examine the effects of the $k$-Essence higher order kinetic terms.
As we demonstrate, the effect of the higher order scalar field kinetic terms on the late-time dynamics
is radical, since the dark energy oscillations are absent, and in addition, the cosmological physical
quantities are compatible with the latest Planck data and also the model is almost indistinguishable
from the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model. This is in contrast to the standard $f(R)$ gravity case,
where the oscillations are present. Furthermore, by choosing a different set of values of two of
the free parameters of the model, and specifically the coefficient of the higher order kinetic term
and of the exponent of $R^{\delta}$ appearing in the $f(R)$ action, we demonstrate that it is possible
to obtain $\rho_{DE}<0$ for redshifts $z\sim 2-3.8$, which complies phenomenologically with,
and seems to explain, the observational data for the same redshifts, and also to obtain a viable cosmological
evolution at $z\sim 0$, at least when the dark energy equation of state parameter and the dark energy
density parameters are considered.
