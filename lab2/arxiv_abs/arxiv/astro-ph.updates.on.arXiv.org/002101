For 61 transiting hot Jupiters, the projection of the angle between the orbital plane and the stellar
equator (called the spin-orbit angle) has been measured. For about half of them, a significant misalignment
is detected, and retrograde planets have been observed. This challenges scenarios of the formation
of hot Jupiters. In order to better constrain formation models, we relate the distribution of the
real spin-orbit angle $\Psi$ to the projected one $\beta$. Then, a comparison with the observations
is relevant. We analyse the geometry of the problem to link analytically the projected angle $\beta$
to the real spin-orbit angle $\Psi$. The distribution of $\Psi$ expected in various models is taken
from the literature, or derived with a simplified model and Monte-Carlo simulations in the case
of the disk-torquing mechanism. An easy formula to compute the probability density function (PDF)
of $\beta$ knowing the PDF of $\Psi$ is provided. All models tested here look compatible with the
observed distribution beyond 40 degrees, which is so far poorly constrained by only 18 observations.
But only the disk-torquing mechanism can account for the excess of aligned hot Jupiters, provided
that the torquing is not always efficient. This is the case if the exciting binaries have semi-major
axes as large as 10000 AU. Based on comparison with the set of observations available today, scattering
models and the Kozai cycle with tidal friction models can not be solely responsible for the production
of all hot Jupiters. Conversely, the presently observed distribution of the spin-orbit angles
is compatible with most hot Jupiters having been transported by smooth migration inside a proto-planetary
disk, itself possibly torqued by a companion.
