Radio AGNs with intermediate radio powers are capable of driving multi-phase outflows in galaxy
bulges, and are also more common than their high-radio-power counterparts. In-depth characterisation
of the typical host galaxies and likely triggering mechanisms for this population is therefore
required in order to better understand the role of radio AGN feedback in galaxy evolution. Here,
we use deep optical imaging data to study the detailed host morphologies of a complete sample of 30
local radio AGNs with high-excitation optical emission (HERG) spectra and intermediate radio
powers (z $<$ 0.1; 22.5 $<$ log(L$_{\rm 1.4GHz}$) $<$ 24.0 WHz$^{-1}$). The fraction of hosts with
morphological signatures of mergers and interactions is greatly reduced compared to the 2 Jy radio-powerful
galaxies (log(L$_{\rm 1.4GHz}$) $>$ 25.0 WHz$^{-1}$) with strong optical emission lines: 53 $\pm$
9 per cent and 94 $\pm$ 4 per cent, respectively. In addition, the most radio-powerful half of the
sample has a higher frequency of morphological disturbance than the least radio-powerful half
(67 $\pm$ 12 per cent and 40 $\pm$ 13 per cent, respectively), including the eight most highly-disturbed
galaxies. This suggests that the importance of triggering nuclear activity in HERGs through mergers
and interactions reduces with radio power. Both visual inspection and detailed light profile modelling
reveal a mixed population of early-type and late-type morphologies, contrary to the massive elliptical
galaxy hosts of radio-powerful AGNs. The prevalence of late-type hosts could suggest that triggering
via secular, disk-based processes has increased importance for HERGs with lower radio powers (e.g.
disk instabilities, large scale bars).
