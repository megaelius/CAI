We present the UNIT $N$-body cosmological simulations project, designed to provide precise predictions
for nonlinear statistics of the galaxy distribution. We focus on characterizing statistics relevant
to emission line and luminous red galaxies in the current and upcoming generation of galaxy surveys.
We use a suite of precise particle mesh simulations (FastPM) as well as with full $N$-body calculations
with a mass resolution of $\sim 1.2\times10^9\,h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$ to investigate the recently
suggested technique of Angulo & Pontzen 2016 to suppress the variance of cosmological simulations
We study redshift space distortions, cosmic voids, higher order statistics from $z=2$ down to $z=0$.
We find that both two- and three-point statistics are unbiased. Over the scales of interest for baryon
acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, we find that the variance is greatly reduced
in the two-point statistics and in the cross correlation between halos and cosmic voids, but is not
reduced significantly for the three-point statistics. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the
two-point correlation function for a galaxy survey with effective volume of 20 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$
is improved by about a factor of 40, indicating that two pairs of simulations with a volume of 1 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$
lead to the equivalent variance of $\sim$150 such simulations. The $N$-body simulations presented
here thus provide an effective survey volume of about seven times the effective survey volume of
DESI or Euclid. The data from this project, including dark matter fields, halo catalogues, and their
clustering statistics, are publicly available at this http URL
