We present X-ray spectra spanning 18 years of evolution for SN\,1996cr, one of the five nearest SNe
detected in the modern era. {\it Chandra} HETG exposures in 2000, 2004, and 2009 allow us to resolve
spectrally the velocity profiles of Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe emission lines and monitor their evolution
as tracers of the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction. To explain the diversity of X-ray
line profiles, we explore several possible geometrical models. Based on the highest signal-to-noise
2009 epoch, we find that a polar geometry with two distinct opening angle configurations and internal
obscuration can successfully reproduce all of the observed line profiles. The best fit model consists
of two plasma components: (1) a mildly absorbed (2$\times$10$^{21}$\,cm$^{-2}$), cooler ($\approx$2\,keV)
with high Ne, Mg, Si, and S abundances associated with a wide polar interaction region (half-opening
angle $\approx$58$^{\circ}$); (2) a moderately absorbed (2$\times$10$^{22}$\,cm$^{-2}$),
hotter (>~20\,keV) plasma with high Fe abundances and strong internal obscuration associated
with a narrow polar interaction region (half-opening angle $\approx$20$^{\circ}$). We extend
this model to seven further epochs with lower signal-to-noise ratio and/or lower spectral-resolution
between 2000-2018, yielding several interesting trends in absorption, flux, geometry and expansion
velocity. We argue that the hotter and colder components are associated with reflected and forward
shocks, respectively, at least at later epochs. We discuss the physical implications of our results
and plausible explosion scenarios to understand the X-ray data of SN\,1996cr.
