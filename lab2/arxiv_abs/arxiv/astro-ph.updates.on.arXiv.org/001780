We present new accurate measurements of the physical properties of a statistically significant
sample of 103 galaxies at z~2 using near-infrared spectroscopy taken as part of the 3D-HST survey.
We derive redshifts, metallicities and star formation rates (SFRs) from the [OII], [OIII] and Hbeta
nebular emission lines and exploit the multi-wavelength photometry available in CANDELS to measure
stellar masses. We find the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) derived from our data to have the same
trend as previous determinations in the range 0<z<3, with lower mass galaxies having lower
metallicities. However we find an offset in the relation compared to the previous determination
of the z~2 MZR by Erb et al. 2006b, who measure metallicities using the [NII]/Halpha ratio, with metallicities
lower at a given mass. Incorporating our SFR information we find that our galaxies are offset from
the Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR) by ~0.3 dex. We investigate the photoionization conditions
and find that our galaxies are consistent with the elevated ionization parameter previously reported
in high-redshift galaxies. Using the BPT diagram we argue that, if this is the case, metallicity
indicators based on [NII] and Halpha may not be consistent with the ones obtained via oxygen lines
and Hbeta. Using a recent determination of the theoretical evolution of the star forming sequence
in the BPT diagram we convert our measured [OIII]/Hbeta line ratios to [NII]/Halpha ratios. From
the [NII]/Halpha ratio we infer systematically higher metallicities in better agreement with
the FMR. Our results thus suggest the evolution of the FMR previously reported at z~2-3 may be an artifact
of the differential evolution in metallicity indicators, and caution against using locally calibrated
metallicity relations at high redshift which do not account for evolution in the physical conditions
of star-forming regions.
