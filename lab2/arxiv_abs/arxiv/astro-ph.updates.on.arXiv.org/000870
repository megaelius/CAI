Simulations of galaxy clusters have a difficult time reproducing the radial gas-property gradients
and red central galaxies observed to exist in the cores of galaxy clusters. Thermal conduction has
been suggested as a mechanism that can help bring simulations of cluster cores into better alignment
with observations by stabilizing the feedback processes that regulate gas cooling, but this idea
has not yet been well tested with cosmological numerical simulations. Here we present cosmological
simulations of ten galaxy clusters performed with five different levels of isotropic Spitzer conduction,
which alters both the cores and outskirts of clusters, but not dramatically. In the cores, conduction
flattens central temperature gradients, making them nearly isothermal and slightly lowering
the central density but failing to prevent a cooling catastrophe there. Conduction has little effect
on temperature gradients outside of cluster cores because outward conductive heat flow tends to
inflate the outer parts of the intracluster medium (ICM) instead of raising its temperature. In
general, conduction tends reduce temperature inhomogeneity in the ICM, but our simulations indicate
that those homogenizing effects would be extremely difficult to observe in ~5 keV clusters. Outside
the virial radius, our conduction implementation lowers the gas densities and temperatures because
it reduces the Mach numbers of accretion shocks. We conclude that despite the numerous small ways
in which conduction alters the structure of galaxy clusters, none of these effects are significant
enough to make the efficiency of conduction easily measurable unless its effects are more pronounced
in clusters hotter than those we have simulated.
