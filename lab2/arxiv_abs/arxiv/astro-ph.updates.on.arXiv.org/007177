We present the observation and analysis of newly discovered coherent structures in the L1688 region
of Ophiuchus and the B18 region of Taurus. Using data from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS; Friesen
et al. 2017), we identify regions of high density and near-constant, almost-thermal, velocity
dispersion. Eighteen coherent structures are revealed, twelve in L1688 and six in B18, each of which
shows a sharp "transition to coherence" in velocity dispersion around its periphery. The identification
of these structures provides a chance to study the coherent structures in molecular clouds statistically.
The identified coherent structures have a typical radius of 0.04 pc and a typical mass of 0.4 Msun,
generally smaller than previously known coherent cores identified by Goodman et al. (1998), Caselli
et al. (2002), and Pineda et al. (2010). We call these structures "droplets." We find that unlike
previously known coherent cores, these structures are not virially bound by self-gravity and are
instead predominantly confined by ambient pressure. The droplets have density profiles shallower
than a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and they have a velocity (VLSR) distribution consistent with
the dense gas motions traced by NH3 emission. These results point to a potential formation mechanism
through pressure compression and turbulent processes in the dense gas. We present a comparison
with magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and we speculate on the relationship of droplets with larger,
gravitationally bound coherent cores, as well as on the role that droplets and other coherent structures
play in the star formation process.
