The Stellar Observation Network Group (SONG) is an initiative to build a worldwide network of 1m
telescopes with highprecision radial-velocity spectrographs. Here we analyse the first radial-velocity
time series of a red-giant star measured by the SONG telescope at Tenerife. The asteroseismic results
demonstrate a major increase in the achievable precision of the parameters for redgiant stars obtainable
from ground-based observations. Reliable tests of the validity of these results are needed, however,
before the accuracy of the parameters can be trusted. We analyse the first SONG time series for the
star 46 LMi, which has a precise parallax and an angular diameter measured from interferometry,
and therefore a good determination of the stellar radius. We use asteroseismic scaling relations
to obtain an accurate mass, and modelling to determine the age. A 55-day time series of high-resolution,
high S/N spectra were obtained with the first SONG telescope. We derive the asteroseismic parameters
by analysing the power spectrum. To give a best guess on the large separation of modes in the power
spectrum, we have applied a new method which uses the scaling of Kepler red-giant stars to 46 LMi.
Several methods have been applied: classical estimates, seismic methods using the observed time
series, and model calculations to derive the fundamental parameters of 46 LMi. Parameters determined
using the different methods are consistent within the uncertainties. We find the following values
for the mass M (scaling), radius R (classical), age (modelling), and surface gravity (combining
mass and radius): M = 1.09 +- 0.04Msun, R = 7.95 +- 0.11 Rsun, age t = 8.2 +- 1.9Gy, and log g = 2.674 +- 0.013.
