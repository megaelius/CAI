We study the direct gas-phase oxygen abundance using the well-detected auroral [OIII]4363 line
in the stacked spectra of a sample of local analogs of high-redshift galaxies. These local analogs
share the same location as $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich
diagram. This type of analog has the same ionized interstellar medium (ISM) properties as high-redshift
galaxies. We establish empirical metallicity calibrations between the direct gas-phase oxygen
abundances ($7.8<12+\log(\rm{O/H})<8.4$) and the N2/O3N2 indices in our local analogs. We find
significant systematic offsets between the metallicity calibrations for our local analogs of
high-redshift galaxies and those derived from the local HII regions and a sample of local reference
galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The N2 and O3N2 metallicities will be
underestimated by 0.05-0.1~dex relative to our calibration if one simply applies the local metallicity
calibration in previous studies to high-redshift galaxies. Local metallicity calibrations also
cause discrepancies of metallicity measurements in high-redshift galaxies using the N2 and O3N2
indicators. In contrast, our new calibrations produce consistent metallicities between these
two indicators. We also derive metallicity calibrations for R23, O32, log([OIII]/H\beta), and
log([NeIII]/[OII]) indices in our local analogs, which show significant offset compared to those
in the SDSS reference galaxies. By comparing with MAPPINGS photoionization models, the different
empirical metallicity calibration relations in the local analogs and the SDSS reference galaxies
can be shown to be primarily due to the change of ionized ISM conditions.
