The vertical halo scale height is a crucial parameter to understand the transport of cosmic-ray
electrons (CRE) and their energy loss mechanisms in spiral galaxies. Until now, the radio scale
height could only be determined for a few edge-on galaxies because of missing sensitivity at high
resolution. We developed a sophisticated method for the scale height determination of edge-on
galaxies. With this we determined the scale heights and radial scale lengths for a sample of 13 galaxies
from the CHANG-ES radio continuum survey in two frequency bands. The sample average value for the
radio scale heights of the halo are 1.1 +/- 0.3kpc in C-band and 1.4 +/- 0.7kpc in L-band. From the frequency
dependence analysis of the halo scale heights we found that the wind velocities (estimated using
the adiabatic loss time) are above the escape velocity. We found that the halo scale heights increase
linearly with the radio diameters. In order to exclude the diameter dependence, we defined a normalized
scale height which is quite similar for all sample galaxies at both frequency bands and does not depend
on the star formation rate or the magnetic field strength. However, the normalized scale height
shows a tight anticorrelation with the mass surface density. The sample galaxies with smaller scale
lengths are more spherical in the radio emission, while those with larger scale lengths are flatter.
The radio scale height depends mainly on the radio diameter of the galaxy. The sample galaxies are
consistent with an escape-dominated radio halo with convective cosmic ray propagation, indicating
that galactic winds are a widespread phenomenon in spiral galaxies. While a higher star formation
rate or star formation surface density does not lead to a higher wind velocity, we deceleration of
CRE outflow, e.g. a lowering of the wind velocity from the galactic disk.
