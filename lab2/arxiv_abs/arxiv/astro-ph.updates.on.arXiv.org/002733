Recently an increasing number of studies were devoted to measure the abundances of neutron-capture
elements heavier than iron in stars belonging to Galactic Open Clusters (OCs). OCs span a sizeable
range in metallicity -0.6<[Fe/H]<+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar
to disk stars of the same age. A different pattern is observed for heavy elements. A large scatter
is observed for Ba, with most OCs showing [Ba/Fe] and [Ba/La] overabundant with respect to the Sun.
The origin of this overabundance is not clearly understood. With the goal of providing new observational
insights we determined radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of
27 giant stars members of five OCs: Cr 110, Cr 261, NGC 2477, NGC 2506 and NGC 5822. We used high-resolution
spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph at ESO Paranal. We perform a detailed spectroscopic
analysis of these stars to measure the abundance of up to 22 elements per star. We study the dependence
of element abundance on metallicity and age with unprecedented detail, complementing our analysis
with data culled from the literature. We confirm the trend of Ba overabundance in OCs, and show its
large dispersion for clusters younger than ~4 Gyr. Finally, the implications of our results for
stellar nucleosynthesis are discussed. We show in this work that the Ba enrichment compared to other
neutron-capture elements in OCs cannot be explained by the contributions from the slow neutron-capture
process and the rapid neutron-capture process. Instead, we argue that this anomalous signature
can be explained by assuming an additional contribution by the intermediate neutron-capture process.
