Previous simulations predicted the activity-induced radial-velocity (RV) variations of M dwarfs
to range from $\sim1$ cm/s to $\sim1$ km/s, depending on various stellar and activity parameters.
We investigate the observed relations between RVs, stellar activity, and stellar parameters of
M dwarfs by analyzing CARMENES high-resolution visual-channel spectra ($0.5$$-$$1$$\mu$m),
which were taken within the CARMENES RV planet survey during its first $20$ months of operation.
During this time, $287$ of the CARMENES-sample stars were observed at least five times. From each
spectrum we derived a relative RV and a measure of chromospheric H$\alpha$ emission. In addition,
we estimated the chromatic index (CRX) of each spectrum, which is a measure of the RV wavelength dependence.
Despite having a median number of only $11$ measurements per star, we show that the RV variations
of the stars with RV scatter of $>10$ m/s and a projected rotation velocity $v \sin{i}>2$ km/s are
caused mainly by activity. We name these stars `active RV-loud stars' and find their occurrence
to increase with spectral type: from $\sim3\%$ for early-type M dwarfs (M$0.0$$-$$2.5$V) through
$\sim30\%$ for mid-type M dwarfs (M$3.0$$-$$5.5$V) to $>50\%$ for late-type M dwarfs (M$6.0$$-$$9.0$V).
Their RV-scatter amplitude is found to be correlated mainly with $v \sin{i}$. For about half of the
stars, we also find a linear RV$-$CRX anticorrelation, which indicates that their activity-induced
RV scatter is lower at longer wavelengths. For most of them we can exclude a linear correlation between
RV and H$\alpha$ emission. Our results are in agreement with simulated activity-induced RV variations
in M dwarfs. The RV variations of most active RV-loud M dwarfs are likely to be caused by dark spots
on their surfaces, which move in and out of view as the stars rotate.
