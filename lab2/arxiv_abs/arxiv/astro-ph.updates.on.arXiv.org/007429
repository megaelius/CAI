We use the EAGLE simulations to study the connection between the quenching timescale, $\tau_{\rm
Q}$, and the physical mechanisms that transform star-forming galaxies into passive galaxies.
By quantifying $\tau_{\rm Q}$ in two complementary ways - as the time over which (i) galaxies traverse
the green valley on the colour-mass diagram, or (ii) leave the main sequence of star formation and
subsequently arrive on the passive cloud in specific star formation rate (SSFR)-mass space - we
find that the $\tau_{\rm Q}$ distribution of high-mass centrals, low-mass centrals and satellites
are divergent. In the low stellar mass regime where $M_{\star}<10^{9.6}M_{\odot}$, centrals
exhibit systematically longer quenching timescales than satellites ($\approx 4$Gyr compared
to $\approx 2$Gyr). Satellites with low stellar mass relative to their halo mass cause this disparity,
with ram pressure stripping quenching these galaxies rapidly. Low mass centrals are quenched as
a result of stellar feedback, associated with long $\tau_{\rm Q}\gtrsim 3$Gyr. At intermediate
stellar masses where $10^{9.7}\,\rm M_{\odot}<M_{\star}<10^{10.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, $\tau_{\rm
Q}$ are the longest for both centrals and satellites, particularly for galaxies living in groups
with other gas-rich galaxies. At $M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10.3}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, galaxy merger
counts and black hole activity increase steeply for all galaxies. Quenching timescales for centrals
and satellites decrease with stellar mass in this regime to $\tau_{\rm Q}\lesssim2$Gyr. In anticipation
of new intermediate redshift observational galaxy surveys, we analyse the passive and star-forming
fractions of galaxies across redshift, and find that the $\tau_{\rm Q}$ peak at intermediate stellar
masses is responsible for a peak (inflection point) in the fraction of green valley central (satellite)
galaxies at $z\approx 0.5-0.7$.
