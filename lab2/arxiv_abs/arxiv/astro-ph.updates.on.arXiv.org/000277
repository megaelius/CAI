We investigate how radiative feedback from the first stars affects the assembly of the first dwarf
galaxies. We perform cosmological zoomed SPH simulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling inside a
halo of virial mass 10^9 solar at z = 10. The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling
of primordial gas and the conversion of the gas into metal-free stars. To quantify the radiative
feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit both molecular hydrogen dissociating and
hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation with a simulation in which stars emit only dissociating radiation,
and with a simulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and -ionization exert a strong
negative feedback on the assembly of the simulated galaxy. Gas condensation is strongly impeded,
and star formation is strongly suppressed in comparison with the simulation in which stars remain
dark. The feedback on the gas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihalo
progenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from the singular isothermal
density profile characterizing the dark matter distribution in the absence of radiative feedback.
The evolution of gas densities, star formation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes
insensitive to the inclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihalo assembly,
and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation once the minihalo turns into an
atomically cooling galaxy. The formation of an extended disk inside the dwarf galaxy is a robust
outcome not affected by the inclusion of radiation. We estimate that dwarf galaxies such as simulated
here will be among the faintest galaxies the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will detect. Our
conclusions are subject to our neglect of feedback from supernovae and chemical enrichment as well
as to cosmic variance. [abridged]
