We present the detection of fullerenes C_60 and C_70 in gas of the star-forming region IC 348 of the
Perseus molecular cloud. Mid-IR vibrational transitions of C_60 and C_70 in emission are found
in Spitzer IRS spectra of individual stars (LRLL 1, 2, 58), in the averaged spectrum of three other
cluster stars (LRLL 21, 31 and 67) and in gas spectra obtained at four interstellar locations distributed
across the IC 348 region. Fullerene bands appear widely distributed in the interstellar medium
of this star-forming region with higher strength in the lines of sight of stars at the core of the cluster.
An estimate of fullerene abundances in the intervening gas is provided adopting literature values
for the average intensity of the UV radiation field in the cluster. Emission features consistent
with the three most intense bands of the C_60^+ and with one of C_60^- are also found in the spectra,
if ascribed to these ionized species it would imply ionization fractions at 20 and 10 %, respectively.
All the stars under consideration host protoplanetary disks, however the available data lack the
spatial resolution required to disentangle the presence of fullerenes in the disks. If fullerene
abundances in the cloud were representative of IC 348 protoplanetary disks, C_60, the most abundant
of the two species, could host \sim 0.1 % of the total available carbon in the disks. This shall encourage
dedicated searches in young disks with upcoming facilities as JWST. Fullerenes provide a reservoir
of pentagonal and hexagonal carbon rings which could be important as building blocks of prebiotic
molecules. Accretion of these robust molecules in early phases of planet formation may contribute
to the formation of complex organic molecules in young planets.
