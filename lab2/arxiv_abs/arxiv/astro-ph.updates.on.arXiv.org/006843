Many asteroids are rubble piles with irregular shapes. While the irregular shapes of large asteroids
may be attributed to collisional events, those of small asteroids may result from not only impact
events but also rotationally induced failure, a long-term consequence of small torques caused
by, for example, solar radiation pressure. A better understanding of shape deformation induced
by such small torques will allow us to give constraints on the evolution process of an asteroid and
its structure. However, no quantitative study has been reported to provide the relationship between
an asteroid's shape and its failure mode due to its fast rotation. Here, we use a finite element model
(FEM) technique to analyze the failure modes and conditions of 24 asteroids with diameters less
than 30 - 40 km, which were observed at high resolution by ground radar or asteroid exploration missions.
Assuming that the material distribution is uniform, we investigate how these asteroids fail structurally
at different spin rates. Our FEM simulations describe the detailed deformation mode of each irregularly
shaped asteroid at fast spin. The failed regions depend on the original shape. Spheroidal objects
structurally fail from the interior, while elongated objects experience structural failure on
planes perpendicular to the minimum moment of inertia axes in the middle of their structure. Contact
binary objects have structural failure across their most sensitive cross sections. We further
investigate if our FEM analysis is consistent with earlier works that theoretically explored a
uniformly rotating triaxial ellipsoid. The results show that global shape variations may significantly
change the failure condition of an asteroid. Our work suggests that it is critical to take into account
the actual shapes of asteroids to explore their failure modes in detail.
