We wish to perform a statistical study of the location and motion of individual 22 GHz water maser
cloudlets, characterized by sizes that are within a few au, with respect to the radio thermal emission
from young stellar objects (YSO). For this purpose, we have been carrying out the Protostellar Outflows
at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey of a sample (38) of high-mass YSOs. The water maser positions
and three-dimensional (3D) velocities were determined through Very Long Baseline Array observations
with accuracies of a few milliarcsec (mas) and a few km/s, respectively. The position of the ionized
core of the protostellar wind, marking the YSO, was determined through sensitive continuum Jansky
Very Large Array observations with a typical error of 20 mas. The statistic of the separation of the
water masers from the radio continuum shows that 84% of the masers are found within 1000 au from the
YSO and 45% of them are within 200 au. Therefore, we can conclude that the 22 GHz water masers are a reliable
proxy for the YSO position. The distribution of maser luminosity is strongly peaked towards low
values, indicating that about half of the maser population is still undetected with the current
Very Long Baseline Interferometry detection thresholds of 50-100 mJy/beam. Next-generation,
sensitive radio interferometers will exploit these weak masers for an improved sampling of the
velocity and magnetic fields around the YSOs. The average direction of the water maser proper motions
provides a statistically-significant estimate for the orientation of the jet emitted by the YSO:
55% of the maser proper motions are directed on the sky within an angle of 30 deg from the jet axis. Finally,
we show that our measurements of 3D maser velocities statistically support models in which water
maser emission arises from planar shocks with propagation direction close to the plane of the sky.
