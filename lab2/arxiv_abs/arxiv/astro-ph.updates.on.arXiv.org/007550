We present an atmospheric transmission spectrum for the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b, measured
using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
Across the 0.47-1 micron wavelength range, the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to
- and in some spectroscopic channels exceeding - that previously measured at near-infrared wavelengths
(1.15-1.65 micron). Wavelength-dependent variations in the opacity rule out a gray cloud deck
at a confidence level of 3.8-sigma and may instead be explained by VO spectral bands. We find a cloud-free
model assuming chemical equilibrium for a temperature of 1500K and metal enrichment of 10-30x solar
matches these data well. Using a free-chemistry retrieval analysis, we estimate a VO abundance
of -6.6(-0.3,+0.2) dex. We find no evidence for TiO and place a 3-sigma upper limit of -7.9 dex on its
abundance, suggesting TiO may have condensed from the gas phase at the day-night limb. The opacity
rises steeply at the shortest wavelengths, increasing by approximately five pressure scale heights
from 0.47 to 0.3 micron in wavelength. If this feature is caused by Rayleigh scattering due to uniformly-distributed
aerosols, it would imply an unphysically high temperature of 6810+/-1530K. One alternative explanation
for the short-wavelength rise is absorption due to SH (mercapto radical), which has been predicted
as an important product of non-equilibrium chemistry in hot Jupiter atmospheres. Irrespective
of the identity of the NUV absorber, it likely captures a significant amount of incident stellar
radiation at low pressures, thus playing a significant role in the overall energy budget, thermal
structure, and circulation of the atmosphere.
