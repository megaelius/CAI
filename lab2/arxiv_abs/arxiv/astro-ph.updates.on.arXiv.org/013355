Very-high-energy (VHE) emission is usually interpreted in the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC)
scenario, and expected from the low-redshift and high-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as
GRB 180720B and GRB 190114C. Recently, VHE emission was detected by the H.E.S.S. telescopes from
one of the closest burst GRB 190829A which was associated with the supernova (SN) 2019oyw. In this
paper, we present a temporal and spectral analysis from optical bands to Fermi-LAT energy range
over multiple observational periods beginning just after the BAT trigger time and extending for
almost three months. We show that the X-ray and optical observations are consistent with synchrotron
forward-shock emission evolving between the characteristic and cooling spectral breaks during
the early and late afterglow in a uniform-density medium. Modeling the light curves together with
its spectral energy distribution, it is shown that the outflow expands with an initial bulk Lorentz
factor of $\Gamma\sim 30$, which is high for a low-luminosity GRBs and low for a high-luminosity
GRBs. The values of the initial bulk Lorentz factor and the isotropic equivalent energy suggest
that GRB 190829A is classified as an intermediate-luminosity burst and consequently, it becomes
the first burst of this class in being detected in the VHE gamma-ray band by an imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescope, and, in turn, the first event without being simultaneously observed by the
Fermi-LAT instrument. Analyzing the intermediate-luminosity bursts with $z\lesssim 0.2$ such
as GRB 130702A, we show that bursts with intermediate luminosity are potential candidates to be
detected in very-high energies.
