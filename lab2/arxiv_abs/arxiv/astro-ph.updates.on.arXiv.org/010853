We investigate the impact of time-resolved `gradual' stellar feedback processes in high redshift
dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Here `gradual' feedback refers to individual stellar feedback events
which deposit energy over a period of time. We conduct high resolution hydrodynamical simulations
of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with halo masses of 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ - 10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$, based
on z = 6 progenitors of the Milky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We also include a novel feedback
prescription for individual massive stars, which includes stellar winds and a HMXB (High Mass X-ray
Binary) phase, on top of supernovae. We find the mass of gas unbound across a 1 Gyr starburst is uniformly
lowered if gradual feedback mechanisms are included across the range of metallicities, halo concentration
parameters and galaxy masses studied here. Furthermore, we find including gradual feedback in
the smallest galaxies delays the unbinding of the majority of the gas and facilitates the production
of `chimneys' in the dense shell surrounding the feedback generated hot, pressurised `superbubble'.
These `chimneys' vent hot gas from the galaxy interior, lowering the temperature of the central
10 kpc of the gaseous halo. Additionally, we find radiative cooling has little effect on the energetics
of simulations that include a short, violent starburst compared with those that have a longer, less
concentrated starburst. Finally, we investigate the relative impact of HMXB feedback and stellar
winds on our results, finding the ubiquity of stellar winds throughout each starburst makes them
a defining factor in the final state of the interstellar medium.
