Isolated Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies have evolved most or all of their life unaffected by interactions
with the large LG spirals and therefore offer the opportunity to learn about the intrinsic characteristics
of this class of objects. Here we explore the internal kinematic and metallicity properties of one
of the three isolated LG dwarf spheroidal galaxies, i.e. the Tucana dSph. This is an intriguing system,
as it has been found in the literature to have an internal rotation of up to 16 km/s, a much higher velocity
dispersion than other dSphs of similar luminosity, and a possible exception to the too-big-too-fail
problem. We present results for a new VLT/FORS2 spectroscopic dataset in the CaII triplet region
for 50 candidate red giant branch stars in the direction of Tucana, which yielded line-of-sight
velocity and metallicity ([Fe/H]) measurements of 39 effective members. This doubles the number
of Tucana's stars with such measurements. In addition, we re-reduce and include in our analysis
the other two spectroscopic datasets presented in the literature, the VLT/FORS2 sample by Fraternali
et al. (2009) and the VLT/FLAMES one by Gregory et al. (2019). We measure a systemic velocity of $180.0\pm1.3$
km/s, consistently across the various datasets analyzed, and find that a dispersion-only model
is moderately favored over models accounting also for internal rotation. Our best estimate of the
internal velocity dispersion is $6.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ km/s, much smaller than the values reported
in the literature and in line with similarly luminous dSphs; this is consistent with Tucana not being
an exception to the too-big-to-fail problem, nor living in a dark matter halo much more massive than
those of its siblings. As for the metallicity properties, we do not find anything unusual; there
are hints of the presence of a [Fe/H] gradient but more data are needed to pin its presence down.
