The presence of a massive close-in planet with an orbital period of a few days or less around a low-mass
star can possibly results in a strong variation of the properties of the central star. Indeed, star-planet
tidal interactions generate exchanges of angular momentum that can results in tidal spin-up. This
effect could then lead to gyrochronological ages biased towards younger ages. Aims. This article
provides the community with TATOO, a standalone tool based on tidal-chronology, to estimate the
age of a massive close-in planetary system by only using its observed properties: mass of the planet
and the star, stellar rotational and planetary orbital periods. I used the numerical code described
in Gallet et al. (2018) to create a large multi-parametric grid of synthetic star-planet systems
evolution, and 3D interpolation method to provide a fairly precise age estimate, using tidal-chronology
technique, of any given planetary systems composed of at least of one massive close-in planet. About
half of the planetary systems investigated in this work are subject to tidal spin-up bias. I pointed
out that this bias linearly scales with the ratio between rotation to orbital period, making this
quantity a useful proxy to rapidly investigate the need to use tidal-chronology. Moreover, while
being model dependent, TATOO can also be used even if no rotational departure is present. In that
case, it gives results in agreement with the classical gyrochronological analysis. TATOO is a useful
tool specifically designed for massive close-in planetary systems that can also be used as a classical
gyrochronological tool. For now it is the only publicly available software to estimate the age of
massive close-in planetary systems subject to tidal spin-up. In that sense, tidal-chronology
can be seen as a first order correction of the impact of tidal interaction on gyrochronology.
