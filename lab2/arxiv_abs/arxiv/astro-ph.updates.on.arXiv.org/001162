Spectra of astronomical targets acquired from ground-based instruments are affected by the atmospheric
transmission. The authors and their institutes are developing a web-based service, TAPAS (Transmissions
of the AtmosPhere for AStromomical data). This service, freely available, is developed and maintained
within the atmospheric ETHER data center. TAPAS computes the atmospheric transmission in the line-of-sight
to the target indicated by the user. The user files a request indicating the time, ground location,
and either the equatorial coordinates of the target or the Zenith Angle of the line-of sight (LOS).
The actual atmospheric profile (temperature, pressure, humidity, ozone content) at that time
and place is retrieved from the ETHER atmospheric data base (from a combination of ECMWF meteorological
field and other informations), and the atmospheric transmission is computed from LBLRTM software
and HITRAN data base for a number of gases: O2, H2O, O3, CO2, and Rayleigh extinction. The first purpose
of TAPAS output is to allow identification of observed spectral features as being from atmospheric
or astrophysical origin. The returned transmission may also serve for characterizing the spectrometer
in wavelength scale and Instrument Line Spectral Function (ILSF) by comparing one observed spectrum
of an atmospheric feature to the transmission. Finally, the TOA (Top Of Atmosphere) spectrum may
be obtained either by division of the observed spectrum by the computed transmission or other techniques
developed on purpose. The obtention of transmissions for individual species allows more potentialities
and better adjustments to the data. In this paper, we describe briefly the mechanism of computation
of the atmospheric transmissions, and we show some results for O2 and H2O atmospheric absorption.
