Ray-tracing is a central tool for constructing mock observations of compact object emission and
for comparing physical emission models with observations. We present Arcmancer, a publicly available
general ray-tracing and tensor algebra library, written in C++ and providing a Python interface.
Arcmancer supports Riemannian and semi-Riemannian spaces of any dimension and metric, and has
novel features such as support for multiple simultaneous coordinate charts, embedded geometric
shapes, local coordinate systems and automatic parallel propagation. The Arcmancer interface
is extensively documented and user-friendly. While these capabilities make the library well suited
for a large variety of problems in numerical geometry, the main focus of this paper is in general relativistic
polarized radiative transfer. The accuracy of the code is demonstrated in several code tests and
in a comparison with GRTRANS, an existing ray-tracing code. We then use the library in several scenarios
as a way to showcase the wide applicability of the code. We study a thin variable-geometry accretion
disk model, and find that polarization carries information of the inner disk opening angle. Next,
we study rotating neutron stars and determine that to obtain polarized light curves at better than
$\sim1\%$ level of accuracy, the rotation needs to be taken into account both in the space-time metric
as well as in the shape of the star. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures of an accreting
black hole lensed by an orbiting black hole. We find that these systems exhibit a characteristic
asymmetric twin-peak profile both in flux and polarization properties.
