We present the analysis of the rest-frame optical-to-UV spectrum of APM 08279+5255, a well-known
lensed broad absorption line (BAL) quasar at $z = 3.911$. The spectroscopic data are taken with the
optical DOLoRes and near-IR NICS instruments at TNG, and include the previously unexplored range
between C III] $\lambda$1910 and [O III] $\lambda\lambda$4959,5007. We investigate the possible
presence of multiple BALs by computing "balnicity" and absorption indexes (i.e. BI, BI$_0$ and
AI) for the transitions Si IV $\lambda$1400, C IV $\lambda$1549, Al III $\lambda$1860 and Mg II $\lambda$2800.
No clear evidence for the presence of absorption features is found in addition to the already known,
prominent BAL associated to C IV, which supports a high-ionization BAL classification for APM 08279+5255.
We also study the properties of the [O III], H$\beta$ and Mg II emission lines. We find that [O III]
is intrinsically weak ($F_{\rm [OIII]}/F_{\rm H\beta} \lesssim 0.04$), as it is typically found
in luminous quasars with a strongly blueshifted C IV emission line ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$ for APM
08279+5255). We compute the single-epoch black hole mass based on Mg II and H$\beta$ broad emission
lines, finding $M_{\rm BH} = (2 \div 3) \times 10^{10}\mu^{-1}$ M$_\odot$, with the magnification
factor $\mu$ that can vary between 4 and 100 according to CO and rest-frame UV-to-mid-IR imaging
respectively. Using a Mg II equivalent width (EW)-to-Eddington ratio relation, the EW$_{\rm MgII}
\sim 27$ \AA\ measured for APM 08279+5255 translates into an Eddington ratio of $\sim$0.4, which
is more consistent with $\mu=4$. This magnification factor also provides a value of $M_{\rm BH}$
that is consistent with recent reverberation-mapping measurements derived from C IV and Si IV.
