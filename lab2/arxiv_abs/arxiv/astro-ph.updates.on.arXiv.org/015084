In this study we overview recent advances with prediction of solar activity using as a proxy solar
background magnetic field and detection of grand solar cycles of about 400 years separated by grand
solar minima (GSMs).The previous GSM known as the Maunder minimum was recorded from 1645 to 1715.
The terrestrial temperature during Maunder Minimum was reduced by up to 1.0C that led to freezing
rivers, cold winters and summers. The modern GSM started in 2020 and will last for three solar cycles
until 2053. During this GSM two processes will affect the input of solar radiation: a decrease of
solar activity and an increase in total solar irradiance because of solar inertial motion (SIM).
For evaluation of the latter this study uses daily ephemeris of the Sun-Earth (SE) distances in two
millennia from 600 to 2600 showing significant decreases of SE distances in the first 6 months of
a year by 0.005 au in 600 to 1600 and by more than 0.01 au in 1600 to 2600 with consequent increases of
SE distances in the second halves of a year. Although, these increases are not fully symmetric in
the second millennium (1600 to 2600), during which the longest SE distances are gradually shifted
from 21 June to 15 July in 2600 while the shortest ones from 21 December to 15 January. These distance
variations impose significant increases of solar irradiance in the first six months of each year
in the two millennia, which are not fully offset by the solar radiation decreases in the last six months
in millennium 1600 to 2600. This misbalance creates an annual surplus of solar radiation to be processed
by the terrestrial atmosphere and ocean environments that can lead to an increase of terrestrial
temperature. We estimate that decrease of solar activity during GSM combined with its increase
imposed by SIM will lead to a reduction of terrestrial temperature during the modern GSM to the levels
of 1700.
