Important clues on the formation and evolution of planetary systems can be inferred from the stellar
obliquity $\psi$. We study the distribution of obliquities using published data from two databases:
the California-Kepler Survey and the TEPCat Catalog of Rossiter-MacLaughlin (RM) measurements,
from which we extract, respectively, 275 and 118 planet-hosting stars. We infer a "best fit" obliquity
distribution, assumed to have the form of a Fisher distribution in $\psi$, with a single parameter
$\kappa$. Small $\kappa$ corresponds to nearly isotropic distributions, while a large value implies
that $\psi$ is distributed narrowly around zero. Our findings are: (1) The distribution of $\psi$
in Kepler systems is narrower than found by previous studies and consistent with $\kappa$~15 (mean
obliquity $\langle\psi\rangle\sim19^\circ$ and standard deviation of $\sigma_\psi\sim10^\circ$).
(2) The value of $\kappa$ in Kepler systems does not depend, at a statistically significant level,
on planet multiplicity, stellar multiplicity or stellar age; on the other hand, metal rich hosts,
small planet hosts and long-period planet hosts tend to be more oblique than the general sample (at
a ~2.5-sigma significance level). (3) The obliquity of hot Jupiter systems with RM observations
is consistent with $\kappa$~2, more broadly distributed than the general Kepler population. (4)
A separation of hot Jupiters in the RM sample into cooler (Teff<6250K) and hotter (Teff>6250K) systems
results in two distributions with $\kappa_{cooler}$~4 and $\kappa_{hotter}$~1 (4-sigma significance),
both more oblique than the Kepler sample. We hypothesize that the total mass in planets, or the total
orbital angular momentum, is behind the increasing obliquity with metallicity and planet radius,
and that the period dependence could be due to primordial disk alignment rather than tidal realignment
of the host's spin.
