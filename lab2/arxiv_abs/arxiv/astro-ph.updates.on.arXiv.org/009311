We study the frequency and dimensions of inner and outer rings in the local Universe as a function
of disk parameters and the amplitude of non-axisymmetries. We use the 1320 not-highly inclined
disk galaxies ($i<65^{\circ}$) from the S$^4$G survey. The ring fraction increases with bar Fourier
density amplitude: this can be interpreted as evidence for the role of bars in ring formation. The
sizes of inner rings are positively correlated with bar strength: this can be linked to the radial
displacement of the 1/4 ultra-harmonic resonance while the bar grows and the pattern speed decreases.
The ring intrinsic ellipticity is weakly controlled by the non-axisymmetric perturbation strength:
this relation is not as strong as expected from simulations, especially when we include the dark
matter halo in the force calculation. The ratio of outer-to-inner ring semi-major axes is uncorrelated
with bar strength: this questions the manifold origin of rings. In addition, we confirm that i) approximately
$\sim 1/3$ and $\sim 1/4$ of the non-barred galaxies in the S$^4$G host inner and outer rings, respectively;
ii) on average, the sizes and shapes of rings are roughly the same for barred and non-barred galaxies;
and iii) the fraction of inner (outer) rings is a factor of $1.2-1.4$ ($1.65-1.9$) larger in barred
galaxies than in their non-barred counterparts. Finally, we apply unsupervised machine learning
(Self-Organizing Maps, SOMs) to show that, among early-type galaxies, ringed or barred galaxies
cannot be univocally distinguished based on 20 internal and external fundamental parameters.
We confirm, with the aid of SOMs, that rings are mainly hosted by red, massive, gas-deficient, dark-matter
poor, and centrally concentrated galaxies. We conclude that the present-day coupling between
rings and bars is not as robust as predicted by numerical models (Abridged).
