The Yarkovsky (orbital drift) and YORP (spin state change) effects play important roles in the dynamical
and physical evolution of asteroids. Thermophysical modelling of these observed effects, and
of thermal-infrared observations, allows a detailed physical characterisation of an individual
asteroid to be performed. We perform a detailed physical characterisation of near-Earth asteroid
(1620) Geographos, a potential meteor stream source and former spacecraft target, using the same
techniques as previously used in Rozitis et al. (2013) for (1862) Apollo. We use the advanced thermophysical
model (ATPM) on published light-curve, radar, and thermal-infrared observations to constrain
the thermophysical properties of Geographos. The derived properties are used to make detailed
predictions of the Yarkovsky orbital drift and YORP rotational acceleration, which are then compared
against published measurements to determine Geographos's bulk density. We find that Geographos
has a thermal inertia of 340 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a roughness fraction of >50%, and a bulk
density of 2100 +550/-450 kg m-3 when using the light-curve-derived shape model with the radar-derived
maximum equatorial diameter of 5.04 +/- 0.07 km. It is also found that the radar observations had
overestimated the z-axis in Geographos's shape model because of their near-equatorial view. This
results in a poor fit to the thermal-infrared observations if its effective diameter is kept fixed
in the model fitting. The thermal inertia derived for Geographos is slightly higher than the typical
values for a near-Earth asteroid of its size, and its derived bulk density suggests a rubble-pile
interior structure. Large uncertainties in shape model z-axes are likely to explain why radar and
thermal-infrared observations sometimes give inconsistent diameter determinations for other
asteroids.
