Super-Luminous Supernovae (SLSNe) are rare events defined as being significantly more luminous
than normal core-collapse and thermonuclear explosions. The nature of the extra powering source
needed to achieve such luminosities is still unclear. Discoveries in the local Universe (i.e. $z<0.1$)
are scarce, but afford dense multi-wavelength observations. Additional low-redshift objects
are therefore extremely valuable. We present early-time observations of the type I SLSN ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz.
These data are used to characterise the event and compare to literature SLSNe and spectral models.
Host galaxy properties are also analysed. Optical and near-IR photometry and spectroscopy are
analysed. Early-time ATLAS photometry is used to constrain the rising light curve. We identify
a number of spectral features in optical-wavelength spectra and track their time evolution. Finally,
we use archival host galaxy photometry together with HII region spectra to constrain the host environment.
ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz is found to be a type I SLSN in a galaxy at a redshift of 0.0267 (111 Mpc), making
it the lowest-redshift event discovered to date. Strong CII lines are identified in the spectra.
Spectral models produced by exploding a Wolf-Rayet progenitor and injecting a magnetar power source
are shown to be qualitatively similar to ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz, contrary to most SLSNe-I that
display weak/non-existent CII lines. ASASSN-18km/SN~2018bsz displays a long, slowly rising,
red 'plateau' of $>$26 days, before a steeper, faster rise to maximum. The host has an absolute magnitude
of --19.8 mag ($r$), a mass of M$_{*}$ = 1.5$^{+0.08}_{-0.33}$ $\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ ,
and a star formation rate of = 0.50$^{+2.22}_{-0.19}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A nearby HII region
has an oxygen abundance (O3N2) of 8.31$\pm$0.01 dex.
