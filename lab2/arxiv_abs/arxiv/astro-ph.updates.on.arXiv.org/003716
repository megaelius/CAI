The observational census of trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes greater than ~250 AU
exhibits unexpected orbital structure that is most readily attributed to gravitational perturbations
induced by a yet-undetected, massive planet. Although the capacity of this planet to (i) reproduce
the observed clustering of distant orbits in physical space, (ii) facilitate dynamical detachment
of their perihelia from Neptune, and (iii) excite a population of long-period centaurs to extreme
inclinations is well established through numerical experiments, a coherent theoretical description
of the dynamical mechanisms responsible for these effects remains elusive. In this work, we characterize
the dynamical processes at play, from semi-analytic grounds. We begin by considering a purely secular
model of orbital evolution induced by Planet Nine, and show that it is at odds with the ensuing stability
of distant objects. Instead, the long-term survival of the clustered population of long-period
KBOs is enabled by a web of mean-motion resonances driven by Planet Nine. Then, by taking a compact-form
approach to perturbation theory, we show that it is the secular dynamics embedded within these resonances
that regulates the orbital confinement and perihelion detachment of distant Kuiper belt objects.
Finally, we demonstrate that the onset of large-amplitude oscillations of orbital inclinations
is accomplished through capture of low-inclination objects into a high-order secular resonance
and identify the specific harmonic that drives the evolution. In light of the developed qualitative
understanding of the governing dynamics, we offer an updated interpretation of the current observational
dataset within the broader theoretical framework of the Planet Nine hypothesis.
