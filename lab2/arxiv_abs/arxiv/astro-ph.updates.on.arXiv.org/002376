The high spatial and time resolution data obtained with SDO/AIA for the sunspot in active region
NOAA 11131 on 08 December 2010 were analysed with the time-distance plot technique and the pixelised
wavelet filtering method. Oscillations in the 3 min band dominate in the umbra. The integrated spectrum
of umbral oscillations contains distinct narrowband peaks at 1.9 min, 2.3 min, and 2.8 min. The power
significantly varies in time, forming distinct oscillation trains. The oscillation power distribution
over the sunspot in the horizontal plane reveals that the enhancements of the oscillation amplitude,
or wave fronts, have a distinct structure consisting of an evolving two-armed spiral and a stationary
circular patch at the spiral origin, situated near the umbra centre. This structure is seen from
the temperature minimum to the corona. In time, the spiral rotates anti-clockwise. The wave front
spirality is most pronounced during the maximum amplitude phases of the oscillations. In the low-amplitude
phases the spiral breaks into arc-shaped patches. The 2D cross-correlation function shows that
the oscillations at higher atmospheric levels occur later than at lower layers. The phase speed
is estimated to be about 100 km/s. The fine spectral analysis shows that the central patch corresponds
to the high-frequency oscillations, while the spiral arms highlight the lower-frequency oscillations
in the 3-min band. The vertical and horizontal radial structure of the oscillations is consistent
with the model that interprets umbral oscillations as slow magnetoacoustic waves filtered by the
atmospheric temperature non-uniformity in the presence of the magnetic field inclination from
the vertical. The mechanism for the polar-angle structure of the oscillations, in particular the
spirality of the wave fronts, needs to be revealed.
