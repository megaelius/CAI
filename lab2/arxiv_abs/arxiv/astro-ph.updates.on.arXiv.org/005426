We present a sample of 329 low to intermediate redshift ($0.05 < z < 0.3$) brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) in X-ray selected clusters from the SPectroscopic IDentification of eRosita Sources (SPIDERS)
survey, a spectroscopic survey within Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV (SDSS-IV). We define our BCGs
by simultaneous consideration of legacy X-ray data from ROSAT, maximum likelihood outputs from
an optical cluster-finder algorithm and visual inspection. Using SDSS imaging data, we fit S\'ersic
profiles to our BCGs in three bands (\textit{g}, \textit{r}, \textit{i}) with \textsc{SIGMA},
a \textsc{GALFIT}-based software wrapper. We examine the reliability of our fits by running our
pipeline on ${\sim}10^{4}$ psf-convolved model profiles injected into 8 random cluster fields,
we then use the results of this analysis to create a robust subsample of 198 BCGs. We outline three
cluster properties of interest: overall cluster X-ray luminosity ($L_{X}$), cluster richness
as estimated by \textsc{redMaPPer} ($ \lambda $) and cluster halo mass ($M_{200}$), which is estimated
via velocity dispersion. In general, there are significant correlations with BCG stellar mass
between all three environmental properties, but no significant trends arise with either S\'ersic
index or effective radius. There is no major environmental dependence on the strength of the relation
between effective radius and BCG stellar mass. Stellar mass therefore arises as the most important
factor governing BCG morphology. Our results indicate that our sample consists of a large number
of relaxed, mature clusters containing broadly homogeneous BCGs up to $z \sim 0.3$, suggesting
that there is little evidence for much ongoing structural evolution for BCGs in these systems.
