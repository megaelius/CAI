One candidate-model for heating the solar corona is magnetic reconnection that embodies Ohmic
dissipation of current sheets. When numerous small-scaled magnetic reconnection occur, then
it is possible to heat the corona. Due to the limitations of current instrumentation, nanoflares
cannot be resolved. But their importance is evaluated via statistics by finding the power-law index
of the energy distribution. This method is however biased due to technical and physical reasons.
We aim to overcome limitations imposed by observations and statistical analysis. This way, we will
identify, and study the small scale impulsive events. We employ a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
(3D-MHD) simulation using the \bifrost code. We also employ a new technique to identify the evolution
of 3D Joule heating events in the corona. Then, we derive parameters describing the heating events
in these locations. We report on the identification of heating events. We obtain the distribution
of duration, released energy, and volume. We also find weak power-law correlation between these
parameters. In addition, we extract information about geometrical parameters of 2D slices of 3D
events, and about the evolution of resolved Joule heating compared to the total Joule heating and
the magnetic energy in the corona. Even though the energy power index is less than 2, when classifying
the energy release into three categories regarding with respect to the energy release (pico-, nano-,
and micro-events), we find that nano-events release $82 \ \%$ of the resolved energy. This fraction
corresponds to an energy flux larger than the one needed to heat the corona. It seems that the most
popular population is the one containing short-lived, with small spatial extend events.
