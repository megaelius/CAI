We present a review of a broad selection of nuclear matter equations of state (EOSs) applicable in
core-collapse supernova studies. The large variety of nuclear matter properties, such as the symmetry
energy, which are covered by these EOSs leads to distinct outcomes in supernova simulations. Many
of the currently used EOS models can be ruled out by nuclear experiments, nuclear many-body calculations,
and observations of neutron stars. In particular the two classical supernova EOS describe neutron
matter poorly. Nevertheless, we explore their impact in supernova simulations since they are commonly
used in astrophysics. They serve as extremely soft and stiff representative nuclear models. The
corresponding supernova simulations represent two extreme cases, e.g., with respect to the protoneutron
star (PNS) compactness and shock evolution. Moreover, in multi-dimensional supernova simulations
EOS differences have a strong effect on the explosion dynamics. Because of the extreme behaviors
of the classical supernova EOSs we also include DD2, a relativistic mean field EOS with density-dependent
couplings, which is in satisfactory agreement with many current nuclear and observational constraints.
This is the first time that DD2 is applied to supernova simulations and compared with the classical
supernova EOS. We find that the overall behaviour of the latter EOS in supernova simulations lies
in between the two extreme classical EOSs. As pointed out in previous studies, we confirm the impact
of the symmetry energy on the electron fraction. Furthermore, we find that the symmetry energy becomes
less important during the post bounce evolution, where conversely the symmetric part of the EOS
becomes increasingly dominating, which is related to the high temperatures obtained. Moreover,
we study the possible impact of quark matter at high densities and light nuclear clusters at low and
intermediate dens
