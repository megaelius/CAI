We present the results of a dust reverberation survey for 17 nearby Seyfert 1 galaxies, which provides
the largest homogeneous data collection for the radius of the innermost dust torus. A delayed response
of the K-band light curve after the V-band light curve was found for all targets, and 49 measurements
of lag times between the flux variation of the dust emission in the K band and that of the optical continuum
emission in the V band were obtained. The lag times strongly correlated with the optical luminosity
in the luminosity range of M_V=-16 to -22 mag, and the regression analysis was performed to obtain
the correlation log $\Delta t$ (days) = -2.11 -0.2 M_V assuming $\Delta t \propto L^{0.5}$, which
was theoretically expected. We discuss the possible origins of the intrinsic scatter of the dust
lag-luminosity correlation, which was estimated to be about 0.13 dex, and we find that the difference
of internal extinction and delayed response of changes in lag times to the flux variations could
have partly contributed to intrinsic scatter. However, we could not detect any systematic change
of the correlation with the subclass of the Seyfert type or the Eddington ratio. Finally, we compare
the dust reverberation radius with the near-infrared interferometric radius of the dust torus
and the reverberation radius of broad Balmer emission lines. The interferometric radius in the
K band was found to be systematically larger than the dust reverberation radius in the same band by
about a factor of two, which could be interpreted by the difference between the flux-weighted radius
and the response-weighted radius of the innermost dust torus. The reverberation radius of the broad
Balmer emission lines was found to be systematically smaller than the dust reverberation radius
by about a factor of 4-5, which strongly supports the unified scheme of the Seyfert type of active
galactic nuclei. (Abridged)
