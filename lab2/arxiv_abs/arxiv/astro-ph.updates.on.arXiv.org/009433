KOI-3278 is a self-lensing stellar binary consisting of a white-dwarf secondary orbiting a Sun-like
primary star. Kruse and Agol (2014) noticed small periodic brightenings every 88.18 days in the
Kepler photometry and interpreted these as the result of microlensing by a white dwarf with about
63$\%$ of the mass of the Sun. We obtained two sets of spectra for the primary that allowed us to derive
three sets of spectroscopic values for its effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity
for the first time using SPC, John Brewer's analysis, and SpecMatch. Using these stellar parameters,
we updated the Kruse and Agol (2014) microlensing model. Using Brewer's analysis, this resulted
in a revised mass for the white dwarf of $0.539^{+0.022}_{-0.020}$ $M_\odot$. The spectra, obtained
with the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on Keck and with the Tillinghast Reflector
Echelle Spectrograph (TRES) at the Whipple Observatory, also allowed us to determine radial velocities
and derive orbital solutions. A dynamical MCMC model of the combined velocities yielded a mass for
the white dwarf of $0.5122^{+0.0057}_{-0.0058}$ $M_\odot$, using Brewer's stellar estimates.
Thus we have two independent estimates for the mass of the white dwarf. The second relies entirely
on Newtonian physics, while the first requires Einstein's General Relativity. We then present
a joint Einsteinian microlensing and Newtonian radial velocity model for KOI-3278, which yielded
a mass for the white dwarf of $0.5250^{+0.0082}_{-0.0089}$ $M_\odot$, using Brewer's stellar
estimates. This joint model does not rely on any white dwarf models or assumptions on the white dwarf
mass-radius relation. We discuss the benefits of a joint model of self-lensing binaries, and how
future studies of these systems can provide insight into the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs.
