The CMB $B$-mode polarisation signal -- both the primordial gravitational wave signature and the
signal sourced by lensing -- is subject to many contaminants from systematic effects. Of particular
concern are systematics that result in mixing of signals of different ``spin'', particularly leakage
from the much larger spin-0 intensity signal to the spin-2 polarisation signal. We present a general
formalism, which can be applied to arbitrary focal plane setups, that characterises signals in
terms of their spin. We provide general expressions to describe how spin-coupled signals observed
by the detectors manifest at map-level, in the harmonic domain, and in the power spectra, focusing
on the polarisation spectra -- the signals of interest for upcoming CMB surveys. We demonstrate
the presence of a previously unidentified cross-term between the systematic and the intrinsic
sky signal in the power spectrum, which in some cases can be the dominant source of contamination.
The formalism is not restricted to intensity to polarisation leakage but provides a complete elucidation
of all leakage including polarisation mixing, and applies to both full and partial (masked) sky
surveys, thus covering space-based, balloon-borne, and ground-based experiments. Using a pair-differenced
setup, we demonstrate the formalism by using it to completely characterise the effects of differential
gain and pointing systematics, incorporating both intensity leakage and polarisation mixing.
We validate our results with full time ordered data simulations. Finally, we show in an Appendix
that an extension of simple binning map-making to include additional spin information is capable
of removing spin-coupled systematics during the map-making process.
