Enhanced emission from the dense gas tracer HCN (relative to HCO$^+ $) has been proposed as a signature
of active galactic nuclei (AGN). In a previous single-dish millimeter line survey we identified
galaxies with HCN/HCO$ ^+ $ (1-0) intensity ratios consistent with those of many AGN but whose mid-infrared
spectral diagnostics are consistent with little to no ( $\lesssim15\% $) contribution of an AGN
to the bolometric luminosity. To search for putative heavily obscured AGN, we present and analyze
\nustar hard X-ray (3-79 keV) observations of four such galaxies from the Great Observatories All-sky
LIRG Survey. We find no X-ray evidence for AGN in three of the systems and place strong upper limits
on the energetic contribution of any heavily obscured ($N _{\rm H}>10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN to their
bolometric luminosity. The X-ray flux upper limits are presently an order of magnitude below what
XDR-driven chemistry model predict are necessary to drive HCN enhancements. In a fourth system
we find a hard X-ray excess consistent with the presence of an AGN, but contributing only $\sim3\%$
of the bolometric luminosity. It is also unclear if the AGN is spatially associated with the HCN enhancement.
We further explore the relationship between HCN/HCO$^+$ (for several $\mathrm{J}_\mathrm{upper}$
levels) and $L_\mathrm{AGN}/L_\mathrm{IR}$ for a larger sample of systems in the literature.
We find no evidence for correlations between the line ratios and the AGN fraction derived from X-rays,
indicating that HCN/HCO$^+$ intensity ratios are not driven by the energetic dominance of AGN,
nor are they reliable indicators of whether SMBH accretion is ongoing.
