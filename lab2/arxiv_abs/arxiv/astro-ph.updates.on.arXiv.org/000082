Red-giant stars are an incredible source of information for testing models of stellar evolution,
as asteroseismology has opened up a window into their interiors. Such insights are a direct result
of the unprecedented data from space missions Kepler and CoRoT as well as recent theoretical advances.
Eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects, and when coupled with asteroseismology,
binaries would provide two independent methods to obtain masses and radii and exciting opportunities
to develop highly constrained stellar models. The possibility of discovering pulsating red giants
in eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially offer very robust
characterization of these systems. Hitherto, only 1 case has been discovered with Kepler. We cross-correlated
the detected red-giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs from Kepler data to find candidate systems.
Light-curve modeling and mean asteroseismic properties are combined to yield measurements of
periods, masses, radii, temperatures, eclipse timing variations, core rotation rates, and red-giant
evolutionary state. After elimination of false positives, out of the 70 systems common to the red-giant
and eclipsing-binary catalogs we find 13 new strong candidates that are pulsating red giants in
eclipsing binaries, and 10 more that are pulsating red giants in hierarchical triple systems. The
systems span a range of orbital eccentricities, periods, and spectral types for the red-giant companion.
One case even suggests a system composed of two red-giants. The discovery of pulsating red giants
in multiple systems provides exciting test beds for precise astrophysical modeling, and follow-up
spectroscopic observations of the candidate systems are encouraged.
