We present results from compressible Cartesian convection simulations with and without imposed
shear. In the former case the dynamo is expected to be of $\alpha^2\varOmega$ type which is generally
expected to be relevant for the Sun, whereas the latter case refers to $\alpha^2$ dynamos which are
more likely to occur in more rapidly rotating stars whose differential rotation is small. We perform
a parameter study where the shear flow and the rotational influence are varied to probe the relative
importance of both types of dynamos. Oscillatory solutions are preferred both in the kinematic
and saturated regimes when the negative ratio of shear to rotation rates, $q\equiv -S/\varOmega$,
is between 1.5 and 2, i.e., when shear and rotation are of comparable strengths. Other regions of
oscillatory solutions are found with small values of $q$, i.e., when shear is weak in comparison
to rotation, and in the regime of large negative $q$s, when shear is very strong in comparison to rotation.
However, exceptions to these rules also appear so that for a given ratio of shear to rotation, solutions
are non-oscillatory for small and large shear, but oscillatory in the intermediate range. Changing
the boundary conditions from vertical field to perfect conductor ones changes the dynamo mode from
oscillatory to quasi-steady. Furthermore, in many cases an oscillatory solution exists only in
the kinematic regime whereas in the nonlinear stage the mean fields are stationary. However, the
cases with rotation and no shear are always oscillatory in the parameter range studied here and the
dynamo mode does not depend on the magnetic boundary conditions. The strengths of total and large-scale
components of the magnetic field in the saturated state, however, are sensitive to the chosen boundary
conditions.
