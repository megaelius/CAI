We have utilized high-resolution optical Hubble Space Telescope images and deep, ground-based
near-infrared images to examine the host-galaxies of 37 active galactic nuclei with reverberation-based
black hole masses. Using two-dimensional image decompositions, we have separated the host galaxy
from the bright central AGN, allowing a re-examination of the MBH-Lbulge and MBH-Lgalaxy relationships
and the MBH-Mbulge and MBH-Mstars relationships using V-H color to constrain the stellar mass-to-light
ratio. We find clear correlations for all of these scaling relationships, and the best-fit correlations
are generally in good agreement with the sample of early-type galaxies with MBH from dynamical modeling
and the sample of megamasers. We also find good agreement with the expectations from the Illustris
simulations, although the agreement with other simulations is less clear because of the different
black hole mass ranges that are probed. MBH-Lbulge is found to have the least scatter, and is therefore
the best predictor of MBH among the relationships examined here. Large photometric surveys that
rely on automated analysis and forego bulge-to-disk decompositions will achieve more accurate
MBH predictions if they rely on MBH-Mstars rather than MBH-Lgalaxy. Finally, we have examined MBH/Mstars
and find a clear trend with black hole mass but not galaxy mass. This same trend is also exhibited by
galaxies with MBH from dynamical modeling and megamaser galaxies, as well as simulated galaxies
from Illustris, rising from ~0.01% at 10^6 Msun to ~1.0% at 10^10 Msun. This scaling should be taken
into account when comparing galaxy samples that are not matched in MBH.
