The gas motions in the intracluster medium (ICM) are governed by stratified turbulence. Stratified
turbulence is fundamentally different from Kolmogorov (isotropic, homogeneous) turbulence;
kinetic energy not only cascades from large to small scales, but it is also converted into buoyancy
potential energy. To understand the density and velocity fluctuations in the ICM, we conduct high-resolution
($1024^2\times 1536$ grid points) hydrodynamical simulations of subsonic turbulence (with rms
Mach number $\mathcal{M}\approx 0.25$) and different levels of stratification, quantified by
the Richardson number $\mathrm{Ri}$, from $\mathrm{Ri}=0$ (no stratification) to $\mathrm{Ri}=13$
(strong stratification). We quantify the density, pressure and velocity fields for varying stratification
because observational studies often use surface brightness fluctuations to infer the turbulent
gas velocities of the ICM. We find that the standard deviation of the logarithmic density fluctuations
($\sigma_s$), where $s=\ln(\rho/\left<\rho(z)\right>)$, increases with $\mathrm{Ri}$. For
weakly stratified subsonic turbulence ($\mathrm{Ri}\lesssim10$, $\mathcal{M}<1$), we derive
a new $\sigma_s$--$\mathcal{M}$--$\mathrm{Ri}$ relation, $\sigma_s^2=\ln(1+b^2\mathcal{M}^4+0.09\mathcal{M}^2\mathrm{Ri}H_P/H_S)$,
where $b=1/3$--$1$ is the turbulence driving parameter, and $H_P$ and $H_S$ are the pressure and
entropy scale heights respectively. We further find that the power spectrum of density fluctuations,
$P(\rho_k/\left<\rho\right>)$, increases in magnitude with increasing $\mathrm{Ri}$, whereas
the velocity power spectrum is invariant. Thus, the ratio between density and velocity power spectra
strongly depends on $\mathrm{Ri}$. Pressure fluctuations, on the other hand, are independent
of stratification and only depend on $\mathcal{M}$.
