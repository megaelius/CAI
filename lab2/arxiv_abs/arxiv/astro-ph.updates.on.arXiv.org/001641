We investigate the relation between 1D atmosphere models that rely on the mixing length theory and
models based on full 3D radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) calculations to describe convection in the
envelopes of late-type stars. The adiabatic entropy value of the deep convection zone, s_bot, and
the entropy jump, {\Delta}s, determined from the 3D RHD models, are matched with the mixing length
parameter, {\alpha}_MLT, from 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models with identical microphysics
(opacities and equation-of-state). We also derive the mass mixing length, {\alpha}_m, and the
vertical correlation length of the vertical velocity, C[v_z,v_z], directly from the 3D hydrodynamical
simulations of stellar subsurface convection. The calibrated mixing length parameter for the
Sun is {\alpha}_MLT (s_bot) = 1.98. For different stellar parameters, {\alpha}_MLT varies systematically
in the range of 1.7 - 2.4. In particular, {\alpha}_MLT decreases towards higher effective temperature,
lower surface gravity and higher metallicity. We find equivalent results for {\alpha}_MLT ({\Delta}s).
Also, we find a tight correlation between the mixing length parameter and the inverse entropy jump.
We derive an analytical expression from the hydrodynamic mean field equations that motivates the
relation to the mass mixing length, {\alpha}_m, and find that it exhibits qualitatively a similar
variation with stellar parameter (between 1.6 and 2.4) with a solar value of {\alpha}_m = 1.83. The
vertical correlation length scaled with the pressure scale height yields for the Sun 1.71, but displays
only a small systematic variation with stellar parameters, the correlation length slightly increasing
with Teff. We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar parameters that can be used to
replace a constant value. Within any convective envelope, {\alpha}_m and related quantities vary
a lot.
