To study the dynamical evolution of trans-equatorial loops (TELs) using imaging and spectroscopy.
We have used the images recorded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic Magnetic
Imager on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and spectroscopic observations taken from the
Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on-board Hinode. The data from AIA 193 {\AA} channel
show that TELs are formed between AR 12230 and a newly emerging AR 12234 and evolved during December
10-14, 2014. The xt-plots for December 12, 2014 obtained using AIA 193 {\AA} data reveal signatures
of inflow and outflow towards an X-region. High cadence AIA images also show recurrent intensity
enhancements in close proximity to the X-region (P2), which is observed to have higher intensities
for spectral lines formed at log T[K] =6.20 and voids at other higher temperatures. The electron
densities and temperatures in the X-region (and P2) are maintained steadily at log N_e =8.5-8.7
/cc and log T[K] =6.20, respectively. Doppler velocities in the X-region show predominant redshifts
by about 5-8 km/s when closer to the disk centre but blueshifts (along with some zero-velocity pixels)
when away from the centre. The Full-Width-Half-Maxima (FWHM) maps reveal non-thermal velocities
of about 27-30 km/s for Fe XII, Fe XIII and Fe XV lines. However, the brightest pixels have non-thermal
velocities of about 62 km/s for Fe XII and Fe XIII lines. On the contrary, the dark X-region for Fe XV
line have the highest non-thermal velocity (roughly 115 km/s). We conclude that the TELs are formed
due to magnetic reconnection. We further note that the TELs themselves undergo magnetic reconnection
leading to reformation of loops of individual ARs. Moreover, this study, for the first time, provides
measurements of plasma parameters in X-regions thereby providing essential constraints for theoretical
studies.
