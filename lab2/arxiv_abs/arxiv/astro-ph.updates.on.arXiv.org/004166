The frequencies and phases of emission from extra-solar sources measured by Earth-bound observers
are modulated by the motions of the observer with respect to the source, and through relativistic
effects. These modulations depend critically on the source's sky-location. Precise knowledge
of the modulations are required to coherently track the source's phase over long observations,
for example, in pulsar timing, or searches for continuous gravitational waves. The modulations
can be modelled as sky-location and time dependent time delays that convert arrival times at the
observer to the inertial frame of the source, which can often be the solar system barycentre (SSB).
We study the use of Reduced Order Modelling for speeding up the calculation of this time delay for
any sky-location. We find that the time delay model can be decomposed into just four basis vectors,
and with these the delay for any sky-location can be reconstructed to sub-nanosecond accuracy.
When compared to standard routines for time delay calculation in gravitational wave searches,
using the reduced basis can lead to speed-ups of 30 times. We have also studied components of time
delays for sources in binary systems. Assuming eccentricities $< 0.25$ we can reconstruct the delays
to within 100s of nanoseconds, with best case speed-ups of a factor of 10, or factors of two when interpolating
the basis for different orbital periods or time stamps. In long-duration phase-coherent searches
for sources with sky-position uncertainties, or binary parameter uncertainties, these speed-ups
could allow enhancements in their scopes without large additional computational burdens.
