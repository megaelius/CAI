We introduce a new version of the Integrated Software in Testing General Relativity (ISiTGR) which
is a patch to the software CAMB and CosmoMC. ISiTGR is intended to test deviations from GR at cosmological
scales using cosmological data sets. While doing so, it allows for various extensions to the standard
flat $\Lambda$CDM model. In this new release, we have support for the following: 1) dynamical dark
energy parametrizations with a constant or time-dependent equation of state; 2) a consistent implementation
of anisotropic shear to model massive neutrinos throughout the full formalism; 3) multiple commonly-used
parametrizations of modified growth (MG) parameters; 4) functional, binned and hybrid time- and
scale-dependencies for all MG parameters; 5) spatially flat or curved backgrounds. ISiTGR is designed
to allow cosmological analyses to take full advantage of ongoing and future surveys to test simultaneously
or separately various extensions to the standard model. We describe here the formalism and its implementation
in the CMB code, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and the 3x2 point statistics. Next, we
apply ISiTGR to current data sets from Planck-2018, Planck-2015, Dark Energy Survey YR1 release,
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Redshift Space Distortions (BAO/RSD) from the BOSS Data
Release 12, the 6DF Galaxy Survey and the SDSS Data Release 7 Main Galaxy Sample, and Supernova from
the Pantheon compilation, joint SNLS/SDSS data analysis and the Hubble Space Telescope. We derive
constraints on MG parameters for various combinations of the five features above and find that GR
is consistent with current data sets in all cases. The code is made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/mishakb/ISiTGR}.
