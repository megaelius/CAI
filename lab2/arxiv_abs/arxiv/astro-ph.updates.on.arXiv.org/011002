Context. We have compiled a catalogue of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN) with reliable
distances and positions obtained from Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) astrometry. Distances derived
from parallaxes allow us to analyse the galactic distribution and estimate other parameters such
as sizes, kinematical ages, bolometric magnitudes, and luminosities. Aims. Our objective is to
analyse the information regarding distances together with other available literature data about
photometric properties, nebular kinematics, and stellar effective temperatures to throw new
light on this rapid and rather unknown evolutionary phase. We seek to understand how Gaia distances
compare with other indirect methods commonly used and, in particular, with those derived from non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) models; how many planetary nebulae (PNe) populate the Galaxy;
and how are they spatially distributed. We also aim to comprehend their intrinsic luminosities,
range of physical sizes of the nebulae; how to derive the values for their kinematical ages; and whether
those ages are compatible with those derived from evolutionary models. Methods. We considered
all PNe listed in catalogues from different authors and in Hong Kong/AAO/Strasbourg/H{\alpha}(HASH)
database. By X-matching their positions with Gaia DR2 astrometry we were able to identify 1571 objects
in Gaia second archive, for which we assumed distances calculated upon a Bayesian statistical approach.
From those objects, we selected a sample of PNe with good quality parallax measurements and distance
derivations, we which refer to as our Golden Astrometry PNe sample (GAPN), and obtained literature
values of their apparent sizes, radial and expansion velocities, visual magnitudes, interstellar
reddening, and effective temperatures.
