Characterization of the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets relies on accurate measurements
of the extent of the optically thick area of the planet at multiple wavelengths with a precision $\lesssim$100
parts per million (ppm). Next-generation instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
are expected to achieve $\sim$10 ppm precision for several tens of targets. A similar precision
can be obtained in modelling only if other astrophysical effects, including the stellar limb-darkening,
are accounted for properly. In this paper, we explore the limits on precision due to the mathematical
formulas currently adopted to approximate the stellar limb-darkening, and to the use of limb-darkening
coefficients obtained either from stellar-atmosphere models or empirically. We propose a new
limb-darkening law with two coefficients, `power-2', which outperforms other two-coefficient
laws adopted in the literature in most cases, and particularly for cool stars. Empirical limb-darkening
based on two-coefficient formulas can be significantly biased, even if the light-curve residuals
are nearly photon-noise limited. We demonstrate an optimal strategy to fitting for the four-coefficients
limb-darkening in the visible, using prior information on the exoplanet orbital parameters to
break some of the degeneracies that otherwise would prevent the convergence of the fit. Infrared
observations taken with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide accurate measurements
of the exoplanet orbital parameters with unprecedented precision, which can be used as priors to
improve the stellar limb-darkening characterization, and therefore the inferred exoplanet parameters,
from observations in the visible, such as those taken with Kepler/K2, JWST, other past and future
instruments.
