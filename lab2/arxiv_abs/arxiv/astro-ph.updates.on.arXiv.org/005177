In support of the National Acadamies' Exoplanet Science Strategy, this whitepaper outlines key
technology challenges for studying the diversity of worlds in the Galaxy and in searching for habitable
planets. Observations of habitable planets outside of our solar system require technologies enabling
the measurement of (1) spectral signatures of gases in their atmospheres, some of which may be of
biological origin, and (2) planetary mass. Technology gaps must be closed in many areas. In some
cases, performance requirements are 1-2 orders of magnitude from the current state-of-the-art.
Thes technology gaps are in the areas of: starlight suppression (for reflection or emission spectroscopy;
coronagraphs or starshades, contrast stability, detector sensitivity, collecting area, spectroscopic
sensitivity, radial stellar motion sensitivity, and tangential stellar motion sensitivity.
The technologies advancing to close these gaps are identified through the NASA Exoplanet Exploration
Program's (ExEP's) annual Technology Selection and Prioritization Process in collaboration
with the larger exoplanet science and technology communities. Details can be found in the annual
ExEP Technology Plan Appendix. Looking towards the more distant future, the size of a desired single-aperture
space telescope, even when folded, may exceed current launch capabilities, suggesting the study
of in-space assembly approaches. Additionally, mid-infrared spectral observations of candidate
habitable worlds may be needed to rule out false positives observed at shorter wavelengths and add
supportive evidence. Consequently, single aperture telescopes may prove impractically large
and space interferometry may be needed, as identified in NASA's 30 year roadmap Enduring Quests,
