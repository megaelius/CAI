Ring-like distributions of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser spots at milliarcsecond scales represent
a family of molecular structures of unknown origin associated with high-mass young stellar objects
(HMYSOs). We aim to study G23.657-00.127, which has a nearly circular ring of the 6.7 GHz methanol
masers, and is the most suitable target to test hypotheses on the origin of the maser rings. The European
Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN) was used at three epochs spanning 10.3 yr to derive
the spatio-kinematical structure of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission in the target. The maser
cloudlets, lying in a nearly symmetric ring, expand mainly in the radial direction with a mean velocity
of 3.2 km s$^{-1}$. There is an indication that the radial component of the velocity increases with
cloudlet's distance from the ring centre. The tangential component does not show any clear evidence
for rotation of the cloudlets or any relationship with distance from the ring centre. The blue-shifted
masers may hint at an anticlockwise rotation of cloudlets in the southern part of the ring. The nearly
circular structure of the ring clearly persisted for more than 10 yr. Interferometric data demonstrated
that about one quarter of cloudlets show significant variability in their brightness, although
the overall spectrum was non-variable in single-dish studies. Taking into account the three-dimensional
motion of the maser cloudlets and their spatial distribution along a small ring, we speculate about
two possible scenarios where the methanol masers trace either a spherical outflow arising from
an (almost) edge-on disc, or a wide angle wind at the base of a protostellar jet. The latter is associated
with near- and mid-infrared emission detected towards the ring. High angular resolution images
of complementary (thermal) tracers are needed to interpret the environment of methanol masers.
