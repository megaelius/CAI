We study the characteristics of a narrow band type Ia supernova survey through simulations based
on the upcoming Javalambre Physics of the accelerating universe Astrophysical Survey (J-PAS).
This unique survey has the capabilities of obtaining distances, redshifts, and the SN type from
a single experiment thereby circumventing the challenges faced by the resource-intensive spectroscopic
follow-up observations. We analyse the flux measurements signal-to-noise ratio and bias, the
supernova typing performance, the ability to recover light curve parameters given by the SALT2
model, the photometric redshift precision from type Ia supernova light curves and the effects of
systematic errors on the data. We show that such a survey is not only feasible but may yield large type
Ia supernova samples (up to 250 supernovae at $z<0.5$ per month of search) with low core collapse
contamination ($\sim 1.5$ per cent), good precision on the SALT2 parameters (average $\sigma_{m_B}=0.063$,
$\sigma_{x_1}=0.47$ and $\sigma_c=0.040$) and on the distance modulus (average $\sigma_{\mu}=0.16$,
assuming an intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}=0.14$), with identified systematic uncertainties
$\sigma_{\mathrm{sys}}\lesssim 0.10 \sigma_{\mathrm{stat}}$. Moreover, the filters are narrow
enough to detect most spectral features and obtain excellent photometric redshift precision of
$\sigma_z=0.005$, apart from $\sim$ 2 per cent of outliers. We also present a few strategies for
optimising the survey's outcome. Together with the detailed host galaxy information, narrow band
surveys can be very valuable for the study of supernova rates, spectral feature relations, intrinsic
colour variations and correlations between supernova and host galaxy properties, all of which
are important information for supernova cosmological applications.
