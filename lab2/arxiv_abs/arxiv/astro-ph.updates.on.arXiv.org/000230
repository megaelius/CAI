The IMACS Cluster Building Survey (ICBS) provides spectra of ~2200 galaxies 0.31<z<0.54
in 5 rich clusters (R <= 5 Mpc) and the field. Infalling, dynamically cold groups with tens of members
account for approximately half of the supercluster population, contributing to a growth in cluster
mass of ~100% by today. The ICBS spectra distinguish non-starforming (PAS) and poststarburst (PSB)
from starforming galaxies -- continuously starforming (CSF) or starbursts, (SBH or SBO), identified
by anomalously strong H-delta absorption or [O II] emission. For the infalling cluster groups and
similar field groups, we find a correlation between PAS+PSB fraction and group mass, indicating
substantial "preprocessing" through quenching mechanisms that can turn starforming galaxies
into passive galaxies without the unique environment of rich clusters. SBH + SBO starburst galaxies
are common, and they maintain an approximately constant ratio (SBH+SBO)/CSF ~ 25% in all environments
-- from field, to groups, to rich clusters. Similarly, while PSB galaxies strongly favor denser
environments, PSB/PAS ~ 10-20% for all environments. This result, and their timescale tau <
500 Myr, indicates that starbursts are not signatures of a quenching mechanism that produces the
majority of passive galaxies. We suggest instead that starbursts and poststarbursts signal minor
mergers and accretions, in starforming and passive galaxies, respectively, and that the principal
mechanisms for producing passive systems are (1) early major mergers, for elliptical galaxies,
and (2) later, less violent processes -- such as starvation and tidal stripping, for S0 galaxies.
