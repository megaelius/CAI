Variations and spatial distributions of bright and dark material on dwarf planet Ceres play a key
role for the understanding of the processes that have led to its present surface composition. We
define limits for bright and dark material in order to distinguish them consistently, based on the
reflectance with respect to the average surface using Dawn Framing Camera data. A systematic classification
of four types of bright material is presented based on their spectral properties, composition,
spatial distribution, and association with specific geomorphological features. We found obvious
correlations of reflectance with spectral shape (slopes) and age; however, this is not unique throughout
the bright spots. Although impact features show generally more extreme reflectance variations,
several areas can only be understood in terms of inhomogeneous distribution of composition as inferred
from Dawn Visible and Infrared Spectrometer data. Additional materials with anomalous composition
and spectral properties are rare. The identification of the origin of the dark, and particularly
the darkest, material remains to be explored. The spectral properties and the morphology of the
dark sites suggest an endogenic origin, but it is not clear whether they are more or less primitive
surficial exposures or excavated sub-surface but localized material. The reflectance, spectral
properties, inferred composition, and geologic context collectively suggest that the bright
and dark materials tend to gradually change towards the average surface over time. This could be
because of multiple processes, i.e., impact gardening/space weathering, and lateral mixing,
including thermal and aqueous alteration, accompanied with changes in composition and physical
properties such as grain size, surface temperature, porosity (compaction).
