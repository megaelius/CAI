We analyze a 900-ks stacked Chandra/HETG spectrum of NGC 3783 in the context of magnetically-driven
accretion-disk wind models in an effort to provide tight constraints on the global conditions of
the underlying absorbers. Motivated by the earlier measurements of its absorption measure distribution
(AMD) indicating X-ray-absorbing ionic columns that decrease slowly with decreasing ionization
parameter, we employ 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk-wind models to describe the global outflow.
We compute its photoionization structure along with the wind kinematic properties allowing us
to further calculate in a self-consistent fashion the shapes of the major X-ray absorption lines.
With the wind radial density profile determined by the AMD, the profiles of the ensemble of the observed
absorption features are determined by the two global parameters of the MHD wind; i.e. disk inclination
\theta_obs and wind density normalization n_o. Considering the most significant absorption features
in the (~1.8A-20A) range, we show that the MHD-wind is best described by n(r)~6.9e11(r/ro)^-1.15
[cm^-3] and \theta_obs=44deg. We argue that winds launched by X-ray heating, radiation pressure
or even MHD winds but with steeper radial density profiles are strongly disfavored by data. Considering
the properties of Fe K band absorption features (i.e. Fe xxv and Fe xxvi), while typically prominent
in the AGN X-ray spectra, they appear to be weak in NGC 3783. For the specific parameters of our model
obtained by fitting the AMD and the rest of absorption features, these features are found to be weak
in agreement with observation.
