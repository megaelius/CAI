The increasing number of newly detected exoplanets at short orbital periods raises questions about
their formation and migration histories. A particular puzzle that requires explanation arises
from one of the key results of the Kepler mission, namely the increase in the planetary occurrence
rate with orbital period up to 10 days for F, G, K and M stars. We investigate the conditions for planet
formation and migration near the dust sublimation front in protostellar disks around young Sun-like
stars. For this analysis we use iterative 2D radiation hydrostatic disk models which include irradiation
by the star, and dust sublimation and deposition depending on the local temperature and vapor pressure.
We perform a parameter study by varying the magnetized turbulence onset temperature, the accretion
stress, the dust mass fraction, and the mass accretion rate. Our models feature a gas-only inner
disk, a silicate sublimation front and dust rim starting at around 0.08 au, an ionization transition
zone with a corresponding density jump, and a pressure maximum which acts as a pebble trap at around
0.12 au. Migration torque maps show Earth- and super-Earth-mass planets halt in our model disks
at orbital periods ranging from 10 to 22 days. Such periods are in good agreement with both the inferred
location of the innermost planets in multiplanetary systems, and the break in planet occurrence
rates from the Kepler sample at 10 days. In particular, models with small grains depleted produce
a trap located at a 10-day orbital period, while models with a higher abundance of small grains present
a trap at around a 17-day orbital period. The snow line lies at 1.6 au, near where the occurrence rate
of the giant planets peaks. We conclude that the dust sublimation zone is crucial for forming close-in
planets, especially when considering tightly packed super-Earth systems.
