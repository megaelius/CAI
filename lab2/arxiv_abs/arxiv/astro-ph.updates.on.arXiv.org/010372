We present the first simulations of the tidal disruption of stars with realistic structures and
compositions by massive black holes (BHs). We build stars in the stellar evolution code MESA and
simulate their disruption in the 3D adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code FLASH, using an extended
Helmholtz equation of state and tracking 49 elements. We study the disruption of a $1 M_\odot$ star
and $3 M_\odot$ star at zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), middle-age, and terminal-age main sequence
(TAMS). The maximum BH mass for tidal disruption increases by a factor of $\sim$2 from stellar radius
changes due to main sequence evolution; this is equivalent to the change in maximum BH mass from varying
BH spin from 0 to 0.75. The shape of the resulting mass fallback rate curves is different from the results
for polytropes of Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz (2013). The peak timescale $t_{\rm peak}$ increases
with stellar age, while the peak fallback rate $\dot M_{\rm peak}$ decreases with age, and these
effects diminish with increasing impact parameter $\beta$. For a $\beta=1$ disruption of a $1 M_\odot$
star by a $10^6 M_\odot$ BH, from ZAMS to TAMS, $t_{\rm peak}$ increases from 30 days to 54 days, while
$\dot M_{\rm peak}$ decreases from $0.66~M_\odot$/yr to $0.14~M_\odot$/yr. We find that compositional
anomalies in nitrogen, helium, and carbon can occur before the peak of the mass fallback rate for
disruptions of main sequence stars, which is in contrast to predictions from the "frozen-in" model.
More massive stars can show stronger abundance anomalies at earlier times, meaning that compositional
constraints can be key in determining the mass of the disrupted star. The abundance anomalies predicted
by these simulations provide a natural explanation for the spectral features and varying line strengths
observed in tidal disruption events.
