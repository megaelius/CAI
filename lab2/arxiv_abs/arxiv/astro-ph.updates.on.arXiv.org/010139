The Planck satellite has detected cluster candidates via the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but
the optical follow-up required to confirm these candidates is still incomplete, especially at
high redshifts and for SZ detections at low significance. In this work we present our analysis of
optical observations obtained for 32 Planck cluster candidates using ACAM on the 4.2-m William
Herschel Telescope. These cluster candidates were preselected using SDSS, WISE, and Pan-STARRS
images to likely represent distant clusters at redshifts $z \gtrsim 0.7$. We obtain photometric
redshift and richness estimates for all of the cluster candidates from a red-sequence analysis
of $r$-, $i$-, and $z$-band imaging data. In addition, long-slit observations allow us to measure
the redshifts of a subset of the clusters spectroscopically. The optical richness is often lower
than expected from the inferred SZ mass when compared to scaling relations previously calibrated
at low redshifts. This likely indicates the impact of Eddington bias and projection effects or noise-induced
detections, especially at low SZ-significance. Thus, optical follow-up not only provides redshift
measurements, but also an important independent verification method. We find that 18 (7) of the
candidates at redshifts $z > 0.5$ ($z > 0.8$) are at least half as rich as expected from scaling relations,
thereby clearly confirming these candidates as massive clusters. While the complex selection
function of our sample due to our preselection hampers its use for cosmological studies, we do provide
a validation of massive high-redshift clusters particularly suitable for further astrophysical
investigations.
