NGC 6558 is a bulge globular cluster with a blue horizontal branch (BHB), combined with a metallicity
of [Fe/H]~-1.0. It is similar to HP 1 and NGC 6522, which could be among the oldest objects in the Galaxy.
Element abundances in these clusters could reveal the nature of the first supernovae. We aim to carry
out detailed spectroscopic analysis for four red giants of NGC 6558, in order to derive the abundances
of the light elements C, N, O, Na, Al, the alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and the heavy elements Y, Ba,
and Eu. High-resolution spectra of four stars with FLAMES-UVES@VLT UT2-Kueyen were analysed.
Spectroscopic parameter-derivation was based on excitation and ionization equilibrium of FeI
and FeII. This analysis results in a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.17+-0.10 for NGC 6558. We find the
expected alpha-element enhancements in O and Mg with [O/Fe]=+0.40, [Mg/Fe]=+0.33, and low enhancements
in Si and Ca. Ti has a moderate enhancement of [Ti/Fe]=+0.22. The r-element Eu appears very enhanced
with a mean value of [Eu/Fe]=+0.63. Ba appears to have a solar abundance ratio relative to Fe. NGC
6558 shows an abundance pattern that could be typical of the oldest inner bulge globular clusters,
together with the pattern in the similar clusters NGC 6522 and HP 1. They show low abundances of the
odd-Z elements Na and Al, and of the explosive nucleosynthesis alpha-elements Si, Ca, and Ti. The
hydrostatic burning alpha-elements O and Mg are normally enhanced as expected in old stars enriched
with yields from core-collapse supernovae, and the iron-peak elements Mn, Cu, Zn show low abundances,
which is expected for Mn and Cu, but not for Zn. Finally, the cluster trio NGC 6558, NGC 6522, and HP
1 show similar abundance patterns.
