The forthcoming generation of galaxy redshift surveys will sample the large-scale structure of
the Universe over unprecedented volumes with high-density tracers. This advancement will make
robust measurements of three-point clustering statistics possible. In preparation for this improvement,
we investigate how several methodological choices can influence inferences based on the bispectrum
about galaxy bias and shot noise. We first measure the real-space bispectrum of dark-matter haloes
extracted from 298 N-body simulations covering a volume of approximately $1000 h^{-3} \mathrm{Gpc}^3$.
We then fit a series of theoretical models based on tree-level perturbation theory to the numerical
data. To achieve this, we estimate the covariance matrix of the measurement errors by using 10,000
mock catalogues generated with the Pinocchio code. We study how the model constraints are influenced
by the binning strategy for the bispectrum configurations and by the form of the likelihood function.
We also use Bayesian model-selection techniques to single out the optimal theoretical description
of our data. We find that a three-parameter bias model combined with Poissonian shot noise is necessary
to model the halo bispectrum up to scales of $k_\mathrm{max}\lesssim 0.08 h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
although fitting formulae that relate the bias parameters can be helpful to reduce the freedom of
the model without compromising accuracy. Our data clearly disfavour local Eulerian and local Lagrangian
bias models and do not require corrections to Poissonian shot noise. We anticipate that model-selection
diagnostics will be particularly useful to extend the analysis to smaller scales as, in this case,
the number of model parameters will grow significantly large.
