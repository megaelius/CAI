We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)
at 870um to probe the surface density of star-formation in z~2 galaxies and study the different physical
properties between galaxies within and well above the star-formation main sequence of galaxies.
This sample of eight star-forming galaxies selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in
the GOODS-South field is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey
of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field. ALMA reveals dense concentrations of dusty star-formation close
to the center of stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes:
(i) galaxies well above the SFR-M* main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions, and (ii) a sub-population
of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation
with depletion timescales typical of local starbursts of 150 Myr. In both starburst populations,
the far infrared and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates
estimated using UV-optical-NIR data alone underestimate the total star formation rate. In the
starbursts above the main sequence, gas fractions are enhanced as compared to the main sequence.
This may be explained by the infall of circum-galactic matter, hence by an enhanced conversion of
total gas into stars. Starbursts "hidden" in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions
of our sample and could represent the late-stage phase of the merger of gas-rich galaxies, for which
high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations suggest that mergers only increase the star formation
rate by moderate factors. Active galactic nuclei are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts,
suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus
triggers star formation.
