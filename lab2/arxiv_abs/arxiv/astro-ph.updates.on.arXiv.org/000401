We simulate the multi-phase interstellar medium randomly heated and stirred by supernovae, with
gravity, differential rotation and other parameters of the solar neighbourhood. Here we describe
in detail both numerical and physical aspects of the model, including injection of thermal and kinetic
energy by SN explosions, radiative cooling, photoelectric heating and various transport processes.
With 3D domain extending 1 kpc^2 horizontally and 2 kpc vertically, the model routinely spans gas
number densities 10^-5 - 10^2 cm^-3, temperatures 10-10^8 K, local velocities up to 10^3 km s^-1
(with Mach number up to 25). The thermal structure of the modelled ISM is classified by inspection
of the joint probability density of the gas number density and temperature. We confirm that most
of the complexity can be captured in terms of just three phases, separated by temperature borderlines
at about 10^3 K and 5x10^5 K. The probability distribution of gas density within each phase is approximately
lognormal. We clarify the connection between the fractional volume of a phase and its various proxies,
and derive an exact relation between the fractional volume and the filling factors defined in terms
of the volume and probabilistic averages. These results are discussed in both observational and
computational contexts. The correlation scale of the random flows is calculated from the velocity
autocorrelation function; it is of order 100 pc and tends to grow with distance from the mid-plane.
We use two distinct parameterizations of radiative cooling to show that the multi-phase structure
of the gas is robust, as it does not depend significantly on this choice.
