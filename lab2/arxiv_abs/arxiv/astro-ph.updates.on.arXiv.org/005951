We present high-sensitivity ($\sigma_I\sim0.2-0.5$ mJy, $\sigma_{QU}\sim0.05$ mJy), high-resolution
(0.12-0.2 arcsec) observations of polarized 872 $\mu$m dust emission from the young multiple system
VLA 1623 in $\rho$ Ophiuchus and the protostar L1527 in Taurus. We detect the circumstellar material
of VLA 1623A, the extended Keplerian disk surrounding VLA 1623A which we call VLA 1623CBdisk, VLA
1623B, VLA 1623W, and L1527 strongly in the polarized emission, at the $\sim1-3\%$ level. We spatially
resolve VLA 1623A into two sources, VLA 1623Aa and VLA 1623Ab, separated by $\sim30$ au and located
within a cavity of radius $\sim50$ au within the circumbinary Keplerian disk, as well as the edge-on
disk of VLA 1623W. The polarization angle of the emission is uniform across each protostellar source
and nearly coincides with each disk's minor axis. The offsets between the minor axis and the polarization
angle are not uniformly distributed at the $P\lesssim2\times10^{-4}$ level. The circumbinary
disk surrounding VLA 1623Aab is azimuthally symmetrically polarized. Each compact source's emission
is partially optically thick ($\tau\gtrsim1$) at 872 $\mu$m, complicating interpretations of
polarization involving aligned grains. We find evidence against alignment by radiative flux in
each source, particularly in the edge-on VLA 1623W and L1527. We detect astrometric offsets between
the polarized emission and the total intensity in VLA 1623Aa, VLA 1623Ab, and VLA 1623B, as predicted
if self-scattering in the optically thick limit operates. We conclude that self-scattering is
likely responsible for disk-scale polarization at 872 $\mu$m in these systems.
