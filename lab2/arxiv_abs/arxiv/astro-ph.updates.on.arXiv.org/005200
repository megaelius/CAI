The effects of finite amplitudes on the transverse oscillations of a quiescent prominence represented
by a magnetic rope are investigated in terms of the model proposed by Kolotkov et al. 2016. We consider
a weakly nonlinear case governed by a quadratic nonlinearity, and also analyse the fully nonlinear
equations of motion. We treat the prominence as a massive line current located above the photosphere
and interacting with the magnetised dipped environment via the Lorentz force. In this concept the
magnetic dip is produced by two external current sources located at the photosphere. Finite amplitude
horizontal and vertical oscillations are found to be strongly coupled between each other. The coupling
is more efficient for larger amplitudes and smaller attack angles between the direction of the driver
and the horizontal axis. Spatial structure of oscillations is represented by Lissajous-like curves
with the limit cycle of a hourglass shape, appearing in the resonant case, when the frequency of the
vertical mode is twice the horizontal mode frequency. A metastable equilibrium of the prominence
is revealed, which is stable for small amplitude displacements, and becomes horizontally unstable,
when the amplitude exceeds a threshold value. The maximum oscillation amplitudes are also analytically
derived and analysed. Typical oscillation periods are determined by the oscillation amplitude,
prominence current, its mass and position above the photosphere, and the parameters of the magnetic
dip. The main new effects of the finite amplitude are the coupling of the horizontally and vertically
polarised transverse oscillations (i.e. the lack of a simple, elliptically polarised regime)
and the presence of metastable equilibria of prominences.
