The mass and structural assembly of galaxies is a matter of intense debate. Current theoretical
models predict the existence of a linear relationship between galaxy size ($R_e$) and the host dark
matter halo virial radius ($R_h$).\\ By making use of semi-empirical models compared to the size
distributions of central galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we provide robust constraints
on the normalization and scatter of the $R_e-R_h$ relation. We explore the parameter space of models
in which the $R_e-R_h$ relation is mediated by either the spin parameter or the concentration of
the host halo, or a simple constant the nature of which is in principle unknown. We find that the data
require extremely tight relations for both early-type and late-type galaxies (ETGs,LTGs), especially
for more massive galaxies. These constraints challenge models based solely on angular momentum
conservation, which predict significantly wider distributions of galaxy sizes and no trend with
stellar mass, if taken at face value. We discuss physically-motivated alterations to the original
models that bring the predictions into better agreement with the data. We argue that the measured
tight size distributions of SDSS disk galaxies can be reproduced by semi-empirical models in which
the $R_e-R_h$ connection is mediated by the \emph{stellar} specific angular momenta $j_{star}.$
We find that current cosmological models of galaxy formation broadly agree with our constraints
for LTGs, and justify the strong link between $R_e$ and $j_{star}$ that we propose, however the tightness
of the $R_e-R_h$ relation found in such ab-initio theoretical models for ETGs is in tension with
our semi-empirical findings.
