The formation and evolution of stars depends on various physical aspects of stellar matter, including
the equation of state (EOS) and transport properties. Although often dismissed as `ideal gas-like'
and therefore simple, states occurring in stellar matter are dense plasmas, and the EOS has not been
established precisely. EOS constructed using multi-physics approaches found necessary for laboratory
studies of warm dense matter give significant variations in stellar regimes, and vary from the EOS
commonly used in simulations of the formation and evolution of stars. We have investigated the sensitivity
of such simulations to variations in the EOS, for sun-like and low-mass stars, and found a strong
sensitivity of the lifetime of the Sun and of the lower luminosity limit for red dwarfs. We also found
a significant sensitivity in the lower mass limit for red dwarfs. Simulations of this type are also
used for other purposes in astrophysics, including the interpretation of absolute magnitude as
mass, the conversion of inferred mass distribution to the initial mass function using predicted
lifetimes, simulations of star formation from nebulae, simulations of galactic evolution, and
the baryon census used to bound the exotic contribution to dark matter. Although many of the sensitivities
of stellar physics to the EOS are large, some of the inferred astrophysical quantities are also constrained
by independent measurements, although the constraints may be indirect and non-trivial. However,
it may be possible to use such measurements to constrain the EOS more than presently possible by established
plasma theory.
