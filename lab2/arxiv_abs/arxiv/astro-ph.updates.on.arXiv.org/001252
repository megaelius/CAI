Extraction of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to percent level accuracy is challenging
and demands an understanding of many potential systematic to an accuracy well below 1 per cent, in
order ensure that they do not combine significantly when compared to statistical error of the BAO
measurement. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
SDSS Data Release Eleven (DR11) reaches a distance measurement with $\sim 1\%$ statistical error
and this prompts an extensive search for all possible sub-percent level systematic errors which
could be safely ignored previously. In this paper, we analyze the potential systematics in BAO fitting
methodology using mocks and data from BOSS DR10 and DR11. We demonstrate the robustness of the fiducial
multipole fitting methodology to be at $0.1\%-0.2\%$ level with a wide range of tests in mock galaxy
catalogs pre- and post-reconstruction. We also find the DR10 and DR11 data from BOSS to be robust
against changes in methodology at similar level. This systematic error budget is incorporated
into the the error budget of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR10 and DR11 BAO measurements.
Of the wide range of changes we have investigated, we find that when fitting pre-reconstructed data
or mocks, the following changes have the largest effect on the best fit values of distance measurements
both parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight: (a) Changes in non-linear correlation function
template; (b) Changes in fitting range of the correlation function; (c) Changes to the non-linear
damping model parameters. The priors applied do not matter in the estimates of the fitted errors
as long as we restrict ourselves to physically meaningful fitting regions.[abridged]
