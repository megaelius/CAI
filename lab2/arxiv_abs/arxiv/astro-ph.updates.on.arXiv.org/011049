We search the five CANDELS fields (COSMOS, EGS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South and UDS) for passively
evolving a.k.a. "red and dead" massive galaxies in the first 2 Gyr after the Big Bang, integrating
and updating the work on GOODS-South presented in our previous paper. We perform SED-fitting on
photometric data, with top-hat star-formation histories to model an early and abrupt quenching,
and using a probabilistic approach to select only robust candidates. Using libraries without (with)
spectral lines emission, starting from a total of more than 20,000 $z>3$ sources we end up with 102
(40) candidates, including one at $z=6.7$. This implies a minimal number density of $1.73 \pm 0.17
\times 10^{-5}$ ($6.69 \pm 1.08 \times 10^{-6}$) Mpc$^{-3}$ for $3<z<5$; applying a correction
factor to account for incompleteness yields $2.30 \pm 0.20 \times 10^{-5}$. We compare these values
with those from five recent hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, finding a reasonable agreement
at $z<4$; tensions arise at earlier epochs. Finally, we use the star-formation histories from the
best-fit models to estimate the contribution of the high-redshift passive galaxies to the global
Star Formation Rate Density during their phase of activity, finding that they account for $\sim5-10\%$
of the total star formation at $3<z<8$, despite being only $\sim0.5\%$ of the total in number. The
resulting picture is that early and strong star formation activity, building massive galaxies
on short timescales and followed by a quick and abrupt quenching, is a rare but crucial phenomenon
in the early Universe: the evolution of the cosmos must be heavily influenced by the short but powerful
activity of these pristine monsters.
