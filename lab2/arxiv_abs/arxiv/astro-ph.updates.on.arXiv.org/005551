Pulsating extremely low-mass pre-white dwarf stars (pre-ELMV), with masses between ~0.15 Msun
and ~0.30 Msun, constitute a new class of variable stars showing g- and possibly p-mode pulsations
with periods between 320 and 6000 s, while main sequence delta Scuti stars, with masses between 1.2-2.5
Msun, pulsate in low-order g and p modes with periods in the range [700-28800] s. Interestingly enough,
the instability strips of pre-ELM white dwarf and delta Scuti stars nearly overlap in the Teff vs.
log g diagram, leading to a degeneracy when spectroscopy is the only tool to classify the stars and
pulsation periods only are considered. We employ adiabatic and non-adiabatic pulsation for models
of pre-ELM and delta Scuti stars, and compare their pulsation periods, period spacings and rates
of period change. We found substantial differences in the periods spacing of delta Scuti and pre-ELM
white dwarf models. Even when the same period range is observed, the modes have distinctive signature
in the period spacing and period difference values. For instance, the mean period difference of
p- modes of consecutive radial orders for delta Scuti model are at least four times longer than the
mean period spacing for the pre-ELM white dwarf model in the period range [2000 - 4600] s. In addition,
the rate of period change is two orders of magnitudes larger for the pre-ELM white dwarfs compared
to delta Scuti stars. In addition, we also report the discovery of a new variable star, SDSSJ075738.94+144827.50,
located in the region of the Teff vs. log g diagram where these two kind of stars coexist. The characteristic
spacing between modes of consecutive radial orders (p as well as g modes) and the large differences
found in the rates of period change for delta Scuti and pre-ELM white dwarf stars suggest that asteroseismology
can be employed to discriminate between these two groups of variable stars.
