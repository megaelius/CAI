We present a study of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the Virgo Cluster based on deep imaging from
the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). Applying a new definition for the UDG class based
on galaxy scaling relations, we define samples of 44 and 26 UDGs using expansive and restrictive
selection criteria, respectively. Our UDG sample includes objects that are significantly fainter
than previously known UDGs: i.e., more than half are fainter than $\langle\mu\rangle_e \sim27.5$
mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The UDGs in Virgo's core region show some evidence for being structurally distinct
from "normal" dwarf galaxies, but this separation disappears when considering the full sample
of galaxies throughout the cluster. UDGs are more centrally concentrated in their spatial distribution
than other Virgo galaxies of similar luminosity, while their morphologies demonstrate that at
least some UDGs owe their diffuse nature to physical processes---such as tidal interactions or
low-mass mergers---that are at play within the cluster environment. The globular cluster (GC)
systems of Virgo UDGs have a wide range in specific frequency ($S_N$), with a higher mean $S_N$ than
"normal" Virgo dwarfs, but a lower mean $S_N$ than Coma UDGs at fixed luminosity. Their GCs are predominantly
blue, with a small contribution from red clusters in the more massive UDGs. The combined GC luminosity
function is consistent with those observed in dwarf galaxies, showing no evidence of being anomalously
luminous. The diversity in their morphologies and their GC properties suggests no single process
has given rise to all objects within the UDG class. Based on the available evidence, we conclude that
UDGs are simply those systems that occupy the extended tails of the galaxy size and surface brightness
distributions.
