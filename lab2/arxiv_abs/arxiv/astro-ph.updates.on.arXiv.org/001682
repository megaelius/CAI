We present a spectral and timing analysis of the black hole candidate MAXI J1543-564 during its 2011
outburst. As shown in previous work, the source follows the standard evolution of a black hole outburst.
During the rising phase of the outburst we detect an abrupt change in timing behavior associated
with the occurrence of a type-B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). This QPO and the simultaneously
detected radio emission mark the transition between hard and soft intermediate state. We fit power
spectra from the rising phase of the outburst using the recently proposed model propfluc. This assumes
a truncated disc / hot inner flow geometry, with mass accretion rate fluctuations propagating through
a precessing inner flow. We link the propfluc physical parameters to the phenomenological multi-Lorentzian
fit parameters. The physical parameter dominating the QPO frequency is the truncation radius,
while broad band noise characteristics are also influenced by the radial surface density and emissivity
profiles of the flow. In the outburst rise we found that the truncation radius decreases from $r_o
\sim 24$ to $10 R_g$, and the surface density increases faster than the mass accretion rate, as previously
reported for XTE J1550-564. Two soft intermediate state observations could not be fitted with propfluc,
and we suggest that they are coincident with the ejection of material from the inner regions of the
flow in a jet or accretion of these regions into the BH horizon, explaining the drop in QPO frequency
and suppression of broad band variability preferentially at high energy bands coincident with
a radio flare.
