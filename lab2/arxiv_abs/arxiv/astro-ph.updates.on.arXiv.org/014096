Our understanding of the evolved, rapidly rotating, magnetically active, and apparently single
FK Comae stars is significantly hindered by their extreme rarity: only two stars in addition to FK
Com itself are currently considered to be members of this class. Recently, a sample of more than 20
candidate FK Comae type stars was identified within the context of the \emph{Kepler-Swift} Active
Galaxies and Stars (KSwAGS) survey. We present an analysis of high-resolution Stokes $V$ observations
obtained using ESPaDOnS@CFHT for 8 of these candidates. We found that none of these targets can be
considered members of the FK Comae class based primarily on their inferred rotational velocities
and on the detection of spectroscopic binary companions. However, 2 targets show evidence of magnetic
activity and have anomalously high projected rotational velocities ($v\sin{i}$) relative to
typical values associated with stars of similar evolutionary states. EPIC 210426551 has a $v\sin{i}=209\,{\rm
km\,s}^{-1}$, an estimated mass of $1.07\,M_\odot$, and, based in part on its derived metallicity
of ${\rm [M/H]}=-0.4$, it is either an evolved main sequence (MS) star or a pre-MS star. KIC 7732964
has a mass of $0.84\,M_\odot$, lies near the base of the red giant branch, and exhibits a $v\sin{i}=23\,{\rm
km\,s}^{-1}$. We find that these two objects have similar characteristics to FK Com (albeit less
extreme) and that their rapid rotation may be inconsistent with that predicted for a single star
evolutionary history. Additional observations are necessary in order to better constrain their
evolutionary states and whether they have short-period binary companions.
