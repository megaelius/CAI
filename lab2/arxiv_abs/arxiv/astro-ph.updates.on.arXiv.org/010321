Neutron star mergers are unique laboratories of accretion, ejection, and r-process nucleosynthesis.
We used 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the role of the post-merger
magnetic geometry in the evolution of merger remnant discs around stationary Kerr black holes.
Our simulations fully capture mass accretion, ejection, and jet production, owing to their exceptionally
long duration exceeding $4$ s. Poloidal post-merger magnetic field configurations produce jets
with energies $E_\mathrm{jet} \sim (4{-}30)\times10^{50}$ erg, isotropic equivalent energies
$E_\mathrm{iso}\sim(4{-}20)\times10^{52}$ erg, opening angles $\theta_\mathrm{jet}\sim6{-}13^\circ$,
and durations $t_j\lesssim1$ s. Accompanying the production of jets is the ejection of $f_\mathrm{ej}\sim30{-}40\%$
of the post-merger disc mass, continuing out to times $> 1$ s. We discover that a more natural, purely
toroidal post-merger magnetic field geometry generates large-scale poloidal magnetic flux of
alternating polarity and striped jets. The first stripe, of $E_\mathrm{jet}\simeq2\times10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}$,
$E_\mathrm{iso}\sim10^{51}$ erg, $\theta_\mathrm{jet}\sim3.5{-}5^\circ$, and $t_j\sim0.1$
s, is followed by $\gtrsim4$ s of striped jet activity with $f_\mathrm{ej}\simeq27\%$. The dissipation
of such stripes could power the short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) prompt emission. Our simulated jet
energies and durations span the range of sGRBs. We find that although the blue kilonova component
is initially hidden from view by the red component, it expands faster, outruns the red component,
and becomes visible to off-axis observers. In comparison to GW 170817/GRB 170817A, our simulations
under-predict the mass of the blue relative to red component by a factor of few. Including the dynamical
ejecta and neutrino absorption may reduce this tension.
