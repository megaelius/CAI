Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the extended solar corona is a powerful tool for measuring the properties
of protons, electrons, and heavy ions in the accelerating solar wind. The large coronal holes that
expand up from the north and south poles at solar minimum are low-density collisionless regions
in which it is possible to detect departures from one-fluid thermal equilibrium. An accurate characterization
of these departures is helpful in identifying the kinetic processes ultimately responsible for
coronal heating. In this paper, Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) measurements of
the H I Lyman alpha line are analyzed to constrain values for the solar wind speed, electron density,
electron temperature, proton temperature (parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field)
and Alfven-wave amplitude. The analysis procedure involves creating a large randomized ensemble
of empirical models, simulating their Lyman alpha profiles, and building posterior probability
distributions for only the models that agree with the UVCS data. The resulting temperatures do not
exhibit a great deal of radial variation between heliocentric distances of 1.4 and 4 solar radii.
Typical values for the electron, parallel proton, and perpendicular proton temperatures are 1.2,
1.8, and 1.9 MK, respectively. Resulting values for the "nonthermal" Alfven wave amplitude show
evidence for weak dissipation, with a total energy-loss rate that agrees well with an independently
derived total heating rate for the protons and electrons. The moderate Alfven-wave amplitudes
appear to resolve some tension in the literature between competing claims of both higher (undamped)
and lower (heavily damped) values.
