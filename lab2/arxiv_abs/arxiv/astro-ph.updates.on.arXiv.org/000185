Lithium is a fundamental element for studying the mixing mechanisms acting in the stellar interiors,
for understanding the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The study
of Li in stars of open clusters (hereafter OC) allows a detailed comparison with stellar evolutionary
models and permits us to trace its galactic evolution. The OC NGC 2243 is particularly interesting
because of its low metallicity ([Fe/H]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$ dex). We measure the iron and lithium abundance
in stars of the metal-poor OC NGC 2243. The first aim is to determine whether the Li dip extends to such
low metallicities, the second is to compare the results of our Li analysis in this OC with those present
in 47 Tuc, a globular cluster of similar metallicity. We performed a detailed analysis of high-resolution
spectra obtained with the multi-object facility FLAMES at the ESO VLT 8.2m telescope. Lithium abundance
was derived through line equivalent widths and the OSMARCS atmosphere models. We determine a Li
dip center of 1.06 $M_\odot$, which is much smaller than that observed in solar metallicity and metal-rich
clusters. This finding confirms and strengthens the conclusion that the mass of the stars in the
Li dip strongly depends on stellar metallicity. The mean Li abundance of the cluster is $\log n{\rm
(Li)}=2.70$ dex, which is substantially higher than that observed in 47 Tuc. We estimated an iron
abundance of [Fe/H]=$-0.54 \pm0.10$ dex for NGC 2243, which is similar (within the errors) to previous
findings. The [$ \alpha$/Fe] content ranges from $0.00\pm0.14$ for Ca to $0.20\pm0.22$ for Ti,
which is low when compared to thick disk stars and to Pop II stars, but compatible with thin disk objects.
We found a mean radial velocity of 61.9 $\pm$ 0.8 \kms for the cluster.
