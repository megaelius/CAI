The formation and evolution of double neutron stars (DNS) have traditionally been studied using
binary population synthesis. In this work, we take an alternative approach by focusing only on the
second supernova (SN) forming the DNS and the subsequent orbital decay and merger due to gravitational
wave radiation. Using analytic and numerical methods, we explore how different NS natal kick velocity
distributions, pre-SN orbital separations, and progenitor He-star masses affect the post-SN
orbital periods, eccentricities, merger times, systemic velocities, and distances traveled
by the system before merging. Comparison with the set of 17 known DNSs in the Milky Way shows that DNSs
have pre-SN orbital separations ranging between 1 and 44 $R_{\odot}$. Those DNSs with pre-SN separations
$\sim$1 $R_{\odot}$ have merger time distributions that peak $\sim$10-100 Myr after formation,
regardless of the kick velocity received by the NS. These DNSs are typically formed with systemic
velocities $\sim$10$^2$ km s$^{-1}$ and may travel $\sim$1-10 kpc before merging. Depending on
progenitor mass of the second-born NS, the short merger time can account for the $r$-process enrichment
observed in compact stellar systems such as ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. For Milky Way-mass galaxies
only DNSs with the tightest pre-SN orbits and large kick velocities ($\gtrsim$10$^2$ km s$^{-1}$)
can escape. However, those DNSs that do escape may travel as far as $\sim$Mpc before merging, which
as previous studies have pointed out has implications for identifying the host galaxies to short
gamma ray bursts and gravitational wave events.
