We present a kinematic study of a sample of 298 planetary nebulas (PNs) in the outer halo of the central
Virgo galaxy M87 (NGC~4486). The line-of-sight velocities of these PNs are used to identify sub-components,
to measure the angular momentum content of the smooth M87 halo, and to constrain the orbital distribution
of the stars at these large radii. We find that the surface density profile of the ICPNS at $100\, \mathrm{kpc}$
radii has a shallow logarithmic slope, $-\alpha_{\rm ICL}\simeq -0.8$, dominating the light at
the largest radii. The angular momentum-related $\lambda_{\mathrm{R}}$ profile for the smooth
halo remains in the slow rotator regime, out to 135 kpc average ellipse radius. The velocity dispersione
profile is measured to decrease sharply to $\sigma_{\mathrm{halo}} \sim 100\, \mathrm{kms}^{-1}$
at $R_{\rm avg}=135$ kpc. Such a steeply decline of the velocity dispersion and the surface density
profile of the smooth halo can be reconciled with the circular velocity curve inferred from assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot X-ray gas if the orbit distribution of the smooth M87 halo changes
strongly from approximately isotropic within $R_{\rm avg}\sim 60$ kpc to very radially anisotropic
at the largest distances probed. The extended LOSVD of the PNs in the M87 halo allows the identification
of several subcomponents: the ICPNs, the "crown" accretion event, and the smooth M87 halo. In galaxies
like M87, the presence of these sub-components needs to be taken into account to avoid systematic
biases in estimating the total enclosed mass. The dynamical structure inferred from the velocity
dispersion profile indicates that the smooth halo of M87 steepens beyond $R_{\rm avg}=60$ kpc and
becomes strongly radially anisotropic, and that the velocity dispersion profile is consistent
with the X-ray circular velocity curve at these radii without non-thermal pressure effects.
