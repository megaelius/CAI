The cosmological exploitation of modern photometric galaxy surveys requires both accurate (unbiased)
and precise (narrow) redshift probability distributions derived from broadband photometry.
Existing methodologies do not meet those requirements. Standard template fitting delivers interpretable
models and errors, but lacks flexibility to learn inaccuracies in the observed photometry or the
spectral templates. Machine learning addresses those issues, but requires representative training
data, and the resulting models and uncertainties cannot be interpreted in the context of a physical
model or outside of the training data. We present a hierarchical modeling approach simultaneously
addressing the issues of flexibility, interpretability, and generalization. It combines template
fitting with flexible (machine learning-like) models to correct the spectral templates, model
their redshift distributions, and recalibrate the photometric observations. By optimizing the
full posterior distribution of the model and solving for its (thousands of) parameters, one can
perform a global statistical calibration of the data and the SED model. We apply this approach to
the public Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data, and show that it provides more accurate
and compact redshift posterior distributions than existing methods, as well as insights into residual
photometric and SED systematics. The model is causal, makes predictions for future data (e.g.,
additional photometric bandpasses), and its internal parameters and components are interpretable.
This approach does not formally require the training data to be complete or representative; in principle
it can even work in regimes in which few or no spectroscopic redshifts are available.
