A new class of exoplanets has emerged: the ultra hot Jupiters, the hottest close-in gas giants. Most
of them have weaker than expected spectral features in the $1.1-1.7\mu m$ bandpass probed by HST/WFC3
but stronger spectral features at longer wavelengths probed by Spitzer. This led previous authors
to puzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of these planets.
Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation, ionization, H$^-$ opacity and
clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral properties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special
focus on WASP-121b. We expand our findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through
analytical quantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of spectral
features. We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are ionized in
the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes H$_{\rm 2}$O, TiO, VO, and H$_{\rm
2}$ but not CO, which has a stronger molecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the
dissociation significantly weakens the spectral features from water while the $4.5\mu m$ CO feature
remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further weakened by H$^-$ continuum
opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before reaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude
variations of the chemical composition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall,
molecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of strong spectral feature
of water in the $1-2\mu m$ bandpass observed in most ultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however,
our model does not provide a satisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with
WASP-33b and Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot Jupiters in need
of a more thorough understanding.
