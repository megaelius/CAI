The 2012 explosion of SN2009ip raises questions about our understanding of the late stages of massive
star evolution. Here we present a comprehensive study of SN2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s).
High-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations from the GeV to the radio band obtained
from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including the VLA, Swift, Fermi, HST and XMM)
constrain SN2009ip to be a low energy (E~ 10^50 erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 Msun) and likely asymmetric
explosion in a complex medium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. Most
of the energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a dense shell of material located
at 5x10^14 cm with M~0.1 Msun, ejected by the precursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion.
We interpret the NIR excess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material located further
out (R>4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected with documented mass loss episodes
in the previous years. Our modeling predicts bright neutrino emission associated with the shock
break-out if the cosmic ray energy is comparable to the radiated energy. We connect this phenomenology
with the explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, that later interacted
with material deposited in the surroundings by previous eruptions. Future observations will reveal
if the luminous blue variable (LBV) progenitor star survived. Irrespective of whether the explosion
was terminal, SN2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodic mass-loss,
the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.
