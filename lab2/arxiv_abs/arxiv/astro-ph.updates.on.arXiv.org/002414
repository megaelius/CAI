In asteroseismology an important diagnostic of the evolutionary status of a star is the small frequency
separation which is sensitive to the gradient of the mean molecular weight in the stellar interior.
It is thus interesting to discuss the classical age-activity relations in terms of this quantity.
Moreover, as the photospheric magnetic field tends to suppress the amplitudes of acoustic oscillations,
it is important to quantify the importance of this effect by considering various activity indicators.
We propose a new class of age-activity relations that connects the Mt. Wilson $S$ index and the average
scatter in the light curve with the small frequency separation and the amplitude of the p-mode oscillations.
We used a Bayesian inference to compute the posterior probability of various empirical laws for
a sample of 19 solar-like active stars observed by the Kepler telescope. We demonstrate the presence
of a clear correlation between the Mt. Wilson $S$ index and the relative age of the stars as indicated
by the small frequency separation, as well as an anti-correlation between the $S$ index and the oscillation
amplitudes. We argue that the average activity level of the stars shows a stronger correlation with
the small frequency separation than with the absolute age that is often considered in the literature.
The phenomenological laws discovered in this paper have the potential to become new important diagnostics
to link stellar evolution theory with the dynamics of global magnetic fields. In particular we argue
that the relation between the Mt. Wilson $S$ index and the oscillation amplitudes is in good agreement
with the findings of direct numerical simulations of magneto-convection.
