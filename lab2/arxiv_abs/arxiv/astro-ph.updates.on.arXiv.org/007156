We run a suite of dissipative N-body simulations to determine which regions of phase space for smooth
disk migration are consistent with the GJ876 system, an M-dwarf hosting three planets orbiting
in a chaotic 4:2:1 Laplace resonance. We adopt adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods which are
commonly used in hydrodynamical simulations to efficiently explore the parameter space defined
by the semi-major axis and eccentricity damping timescales. We find that there is a large region
of phase space which produces systems in the chaotic Laplace resonance and a smaller region consistent
with the observed eccentricities and libration amplitudes for the resonant angles. Under the assumptions
of Type I migration for the outer planet, we translate these damping timescales into constraints
on the protoplanetary disk surface density and thickness. When we strongly (weakly) damp the eccentricities
of the inner two Laplace planets, these timescales correspond to disk surface densities around
ten thousand (a few hundred) grams per square centimeter and disk aspect ratios between 1-10%. Additionally,
smooth migration produces systems with a range of chaotic timescales, from decades and centuries
to upwards of thousands of years. In agreement with previous studies, the less chaotic regions of
phase space coincide with the system being in a low energy double apsidal corotation resonance.
Our detailed modeling of multi-planetary systems coupled with our AMR exploration method enhances
our ability to map out the parameter space of planet formation models, and is well suited to study
other resonant chain systems such as Trappist-1, Kepler-60, and others.
