Recent advances in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations have expanded and improved
our understanding of the dynamics of black-hole accretion disks. However, current simulations
do not capture the thermodynamics of electrons in the low density accreting plasma. This poses a
significant challenge in predicting accretion flow images and spectra from first principles.
Because of this, simplified emission models have often been used, with widely different configurations
(e.g., disk- versus jet-dominated emission), and were able to account for the observed spectral
properties of accreting black-holes. Exploring the large parameter space introduced by such models,
however, requires significant computational power that exceeds conventional computational
facilities. In this paper, we use GRay, a fast GPU-based ray-tracing algorithm, on the GPU cluster
El Gato, to compute images and spectra for a set of six general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations with different magnetic field configurations and black-hole spins. We also employ
two different parametric models for the plasma thermodynamics in each of the simulations. We show
that, if only the spectral properties of Sgr A* are used, all twelve models tested here can fit the
spectra equally well. However, when combined with the measurement of the image size of the emission
using the Event Horizon Telescope, current observations rule out all models with strong funnel
emission, because the funnels are typically very extended. Our study shows that images of accretion
flows with horizon-scale resolution offer a powerful tool in understanding accretion flows around
black-holes and their thermodynamic properties.
