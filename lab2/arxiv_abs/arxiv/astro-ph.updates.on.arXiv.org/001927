We study the detailed properties of the radial metallicity gradient in the stellar disk of our Galaxy
to constrain its chemical and structural evolution. For this purpose we select and analyze $\sim$
18,500 disk stars taken from two datasets, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the High-Accuracy
Radial velocity Planetary Searcher (HARPS). On these surveys we examine the metallicity gradient,
$\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta R_{\rm g}$, along the guiding-center radii, $R_{\rm g}$, of stars and
its dependence on the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, to infer the original metallicity distribution of
the gas disk from which those stars formed and its time evolution. In both sample sources, the thick-disk
candidate stars characterized by high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios ([$\alpha$/Fe] $>$ 0.3 in SDSS,
[$\alpha$/Fe] $>$ 0.2 in HARPS) are found to show a positive $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta R_{\rm
g}$, whereas the thin-disk candidate stars characterized by lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios show a
negative one. Furthermore, we find that the relatively young thin-disk population characterized
by much lower [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios ([$\alpha$/Fe] $<$ 0.2 in SDSS, [$\alpha$/Fe] $<$ 0.1
in HARPS) shows notably a flattening $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta R_{\rm g}$ with decreasing [$\alpha$/Fe],
in contrast to the old one with higher [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios ([$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim$ 0.2 in SDSS, [$\alpha$/Fe]
$\sim$ 0.1 in HARPS). The possible implication for early disk evolution is discussed, in the context
of galaxy formation accompanying the rapid infall of primordial gas on the inner disk region, which
can generate a positive metallicity gradient, and the subsequent chemical evolution of the disk,
which results in a flattening effect of a metallicity gradient at later epochs.
