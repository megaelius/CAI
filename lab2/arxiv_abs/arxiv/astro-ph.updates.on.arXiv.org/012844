We aim to further investigate the fragmentation of star-forming filaments in the X-shape Nebula
of the California MC, so as to better understand the exact role of filaments in the early stages of
star formation. We applied getsources and getfilaments extraction methods to the multi-wavelength
images observed with Herschel. The properties of the filaments and cores were determined from such
an analysis. A map of $\rm ^{13}CO (2-1)$ emission from the SMT 10m telescope was also used to constrain
the dynamical state of the filaments. We selected 10 filaments with elongation factors $E >4$ and
column density contrasts $C>0.5$ from the filamentary network identified with getfilaments.
All 10 filaments have roughly the same deconvolved FWHM width, with a median value $0.12\pm 0.03$
pc, independently of their column densities ranging from $< 10^{21}\, {\rm cm}^{-2}$ to $>10^{22}\,
{\rm cm}^{-2}$. Two star-forming filaments stand out based on the Herschel data: Filaments~8 and
10 harbor quasi-periodic chains of dense cores with a typical projected core spacing of $\sim$ 0.15
pc. These two filamentary structures have supercritical line masses and are not static. Filament~8
exhibits a prominent transverse velocity gradient, suggesting that it is accreting gas from the
parent cloud gas reservoir. The estimated mass accretion rate is $\sim 40\pm10\ M_\odot \ \rm Myr^{-1}\
pc^{-1}$. Filament~10 includes two embedded protostars with outflows and is likely at a later evolutionary
stage than filament~8. Our findings support the notion that dense molecular filaments play a crucial
role in the star formation process. We suggest that accretion onto the two star-forming filaments,
as well as geometrical bending, explains why the observed core spacing along them is significantly
shorter than the canonical separation of $\sim \,$4 times the filament width predicted by classical
cylinder fragmentation theory.
