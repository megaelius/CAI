We present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps of projected mass density obtained
from gravitational lensing shear. We use data from the 154 deg2 covered by the Canada France Hawaii
Telescope Lensing Survey. Our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientific
value of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementary approach to the study of
the dark universe with gravitational lensing. We show that mass maps contain unique cosmological
information beyond that of traditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. Using a series
of numerical simulations, we first show that gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable
probe of the projected matter distribution of large scale structure. We validate our analysis by
quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statistical estimators. The same process is
then applied to the CFHTLenS data. It is found that the statistical properties of the projected mass
are fully consistent with the cosmological analysis performed on the shear signal discussed in
CFHTLenS companion papers. The maps also lead to a significant measurement of the third order moment
of the projected mass in agreement with analytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the
fourth order moment. Tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for the
statistical estimators we used. A new approach for the comparison of the reconstructed mass map
to that predicted from the galaxy distribution reveals the existence of giant voids in the dark matter
maps as large as 3 degrees on the sky. Our analysis shows that lensing mass maps not only is consistent
with the results obtained by the traditional shear approach, but also enable new analysis techniques
such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of the projected dark matter distribution.
