The post-merger product of the first binary neutron star merger event detected in gravitational
waves, GW170817, depends on neutron star equation of state (EoS) and is not well determined. We generally
discuss the constraints one may pose on the maximum mass of a non-spinning neutron star, $M_{\rm
TOV}$, based on the observations and some EoS-independent universal relations of rapidly-spinning
neutron stars. If the merger product is a black hole after a brief hypermassive neutron star (HMNS)
phase, we derive $M_{\rm TOV} < 2.09^{+0.06}_{-0.04} M_{\odot} (2.09^{+0.11}_{-0.09}M_{\odot})$
at the 1$\sigma$ (2$\sigma$) level. The cases for a massive neutron star (MNS), either a supra-massive
neutron star (SMNS) or even a stable neutron star (SNS), are also allowed by the data. We derive $2.09^{+0.06}_{-0.04}
M_{\odot} (2.09^{+0.11}_{-0.09} M_{\odot}) \leq M_{\rm TOV}< 2.43^{+0.06}_{-0.04} M_{\odot}
(2.43^{+0.10}_{-0.08} M_{\odot})$ for the SMNS case and $M_{\rm TOV} \geq 2.43^{+0.06}_{-0.04}M_{\odot}
(2.43^{+0.10}_{-0.08} M_{\odot})$ for the SNS case, at the $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence
level. In the MNS cases, we also discuss the constraints on the neutron star parameters (the dipolar
magnetic field strength at the surface $B_p$ and the ellipticity $\epsilon$) that affect the spindown
history, by considering different MNS survival times, e.g. 300 s, 1 d, and 155 d after the merger,
as suggested by various observational arguments. We find that once an SMNS is formed, without violating
the EM observational constraints, there always exist a set of ($B_p, \epsilon$) parameters that
allow the SMNS to survive for 300s, 1 d, 155 d, or even longer.
