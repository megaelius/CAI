We report the statistical physical properties of the C$^{18}$O($J=1-0$) clumps present in a prominent
cluster-forming region, Cygnus X, using the dataset obtained by the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope.
This survey covers 9 deg$^2$ of the north and south regions of Cygnus X, and totally 174 C$^{18}$O
clumps are identified using the dendrogram method. Assuming a distance of 1.4 kpc, these clumps
have radii of 0.2-1 pc, velocity dispersions of $<2.2~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$, gas masses of 30-3000
$M_\odot$, and H$_2$ densities of (0.2-5.5)$\times10^4~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. We confirm that
the C$^{18}$O clumps in the north region have a higher H$_2$ density than those in the south region,
supporting the existence of a difference in the evolution stages, consistent with the star formation
activity of these regions. The difference in the clump properties of the star-forming and starless
clumps is also confirmed by the radius, velocity dispersion, gas mass, and H$_2$ density. The average
virial ratio of 0.3 supports that these clumps are gravitationally bound. The C$^{18}$O clump mass
function shows two spectral index components, $\alpha=-1.4$ in 55-140 $M_\odot$ and $\alpha=-2.1$
in $>140~M_\odot$, which are consistent with the low- and intermediate-mass parts of the Kroupa's
initial mass function. The spectral index in the star-forming clumps in $>140~M_\odot$ is consistent
with that of the starless clumps in 55-140 $M_\odot$, suggesting that the latter will evolve into
star-forming clumps while retaining the gas accretion. Assuming a typical star formation efficiency
of molecular clumps (10%), about ten C$^{18}$O clumps having a gas mass of $>10^3~M_\odot$ will
evolve into open clusters containing one or more OB stars.
