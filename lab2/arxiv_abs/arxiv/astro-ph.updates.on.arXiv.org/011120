We present an analysis of the kinematic properties of stellar populations in the Galactic halo,
making use of over 100,000 main sequence turnoff (MSTO) stars observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
After dividing the Galactic halo into an inner-halo region (IHR) and outer-halo region (OHR), based
on the spatial variation of carbon-to-iron ratios in the sample, we find that stars in the OHR exhibit
a clear retrograde motion of $-$49 $\pm$ 4 km s$^{-1}$ and a more spherical distribution of stellar
orbits, while stars in the IHR have zero net rotation ($-$3 $\pm$ 1 km s$^{-1}$) with a much more radially
biased distribution of stellar orbits. Furthermore, we classify the carbon-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars among the MSTO sample in each halo component into CEMP-no and CEMP-$s$ sub-classes,
based on their absolute carbon abundances, $A$(C), and examine the spatial distributions and kinematics
associated with each sub-class. The CEMP-no stars are the majority sub-class of CEMP stars in the
OHR ($\sim$ 65%), and the minority sub-class in the IHR ($\sim$ 44%), similar to the results of several
previous analyses. The CEMP-no stars in each halo region exhibit slightly higher counter-rotation
than the CEMP-$s$ stars, but within statistical errors. The CEMP-no stars also show a more spherical
distribution of orbits than the CEMP-$s$ stars in each halo region. These distinct characteristics
provide strong evidence that numerous low-mass satellite galaxies (similar to the ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies) have donated stars to the OHR, while more-massive dwarf galaxies provided the dominant
contribution to the IHR.
