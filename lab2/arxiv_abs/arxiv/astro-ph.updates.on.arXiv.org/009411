CO is thought to be the main reservoir of volatile carbon in protoplanetary disks, and thus the primary
initial source of carbon in the atmospheres of forming giant planets. However, recent observations
of protoplanetary disks point towards low volatile carbon abundances in many systems, including
at radii interior to the CO snowline. One potential explanation is that gas phase carbon is chemically
reprocessed into less volatile species, which are frozen on dust grain surfaces as ice. This mechanism
has the potential to change the primordial C/H ratio in the gas. However, current observations primarily
probe the upper layers of the disk. It is not clear if the low volatile carbon abundances extend to
the midplane, where planets form. We have run a grid of 198 chemical models, exploring how the chemical
reprocessing of CO depends on disk mass, dust grain size distribution, temperature, cosmic ray
and X-ray ionization rate, and initial water abundance. Building on our previous work focusing
on the warm molecular layer, here we analyze the results for our grid of models in the disk midplane
at 12 au. We find that either an ISM level cosmic ray ionization rate or the presence of UV photons due
to a low dust surface density are needed to chemically reduce the midplane CO gas abundance by at least
an order of magnitude within 1 Myr. In the majority of our models CO does not undergo substantial reprocessing
by in situ chemistry and there is little change in the gas phase C/H and C/O ratios over the lifetime
of the typical disk. However, in the small sub-set of disks where the disk midplane is subject to a
source of ionization or photolysis, the gas phase C/O ratio increases by up to nearly 9 orders of magnitude
due to conversion of CO into volatile hydrocarbons.
