The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many
decades. In this short review, we briefly summarize theories for the origin of cosmic acceleration
and the observational methods being used to test these theories. We then discuss the current observational
state of the field, with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO), Type Ia supernovae (SN), direct measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$),
and measurements of galaxy and matter clustering. Assuming a flat universe and dark energy with
a constant equation-of-state parameter $w = P/\rho$, the combination of Planck CMB temperature
anisotropies, WMAP CMB polarization, the Union2.1 SN compilation, and a compilation of BAO measurements
yields $w = -1.10^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$, consistent with a cosmological constant ($w=-1$). However,
with these constraints the cosmological constant model predicts a value of $H_0$ that is lower than
several of the leading recent estimates, and it predicts a parameter combination $\sigma_8(\Omega_m)^{0.5}$
that is higher than many estimates from weak gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters, and redshift-space
distortions. Individually these tensions are only significant at the ~$2\sigma$ level, but they
arise in multiple data sets with independent statistics and distinct sources of systematic uncertainty.
The tensions are stronger with Planck CMB data than they were with WMAP because of the smaller statistical
errors and the higher central value of $\Omega_m.$ With the improved measurements expected from
the next generation of data sets, these tensions may diminish, or they may sharpen in a way that points
towards a more complete physical understanding of cosmic acceleration.
