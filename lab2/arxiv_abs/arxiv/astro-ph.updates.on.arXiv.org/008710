In order to identify the rapidly-fading, optical transient counterparts of gravitational wave
(GW) sources, an efficient follow-up strategy is required. Since most ground-based optical observatories
aimed at following-up GW sources have a telescope with a small field-of-view (FOV) as compared to
the GW sky error region, we focus on a search strategy that involves dividing the GW patch into tiles
of the same area as the telescope FOV to strategically image the entire patch. We present an improvement
over the optimal telescope-scheduling algorithm outlined in Rana et al. (2016), by combining the
tiling and galaxy-targeted search strategies, and factoring the effects of the source airmass
and telescope slew, along with setting constraints, into the scheduling algorithm in order to increase
the chances of identifying the GW counterpart. We propose two separate algorithms: the airmass-weighted
algorithm, a specific solution to the Hungarian algorithm that maximizes probability acquired,
while minimizing the image airmass, and the slew-optimization algorithm that minimizes the overall
slew angle covered between images for the given probability acquired by the optimal telescope-scheduling
algorithm in Rana et al. (2016). Using the observatory site of the GROWTH-India telescope as an example,
we generate 100s of skymaps to test the performance of our algorithms. Our results indicate that
slew-optimization can reduce the cumulative slew angle in the observing schedule by 100s of degrees,
saving several of minutes of observing time without the loss of tiles and probability. Further,
we demonstrate that as compared to the greedy algorithm, the airmass-weighted algorithm can acquire
up to 20 % more probability and 30 sq. deg. more in areal coverage for skymaps of all sizes and configurations.
