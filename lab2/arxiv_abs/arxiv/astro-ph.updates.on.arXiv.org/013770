Past X-ray observations of the nearby luminous quasar PDS 456 (at $z=0.184$) have revealed a wide
angle accretion disk wind (Nardini et al. 2015), with an outflow velocity of $\sim-0.25c$, as observed
through observations of its blue-shifted iron K-shell absorption line profile. Here we present
three new XMM-Newton observations of PDS 456; one in September 2018 where the quasar was bright and
featureless, and two in September 2019, 22 days apart, occurring when the quasar was five times fainter
and where strong blue-shifted lines from the wind were present. During the second September 2019
observation, three broad ($\sigma=3000$ km s$^{-1}$) absorption lines were resolved in the high
resolution RGS spectrum, which are identified with blue-shifted OVIII Ly$\alpha$, NeIX He$\alpha$
and NeX Ly$\alpha$. The outflow velocity of this soft X-ray absorber was found to be $v/c=-0.258\pm0.003$,
fully consistent with iron K absorber with $v/c=-0.261\pm0.007$. The ionization parameter and
column density of the soft X-ray component ($\log\xi=3.4$, $N_{\rm H}=2\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$)
outflow was lower by about two orders of magnitude, when compared to the high ionization wind at iron
K ($\log\xi=5$, $N_{\rm H}=7\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). Substantial variability was seen in
the soft X-ray absorber between the 2019 observations, declining from $N_{\rm H}=10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$
to $N_{\rm H}=10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ over 20 days, while the iron K component was remarkably stable.
We conclude that the soft X-ray wind may originate from an inhomogeneous wind streamline passing
across the line of sight and which due to its lower ionization, is located further from the black hole,
on parsec scales, than the innermost disk wind.
