Observations of star-forming regions by the current and upcoming generation of submillimeter
polarimeters will shed new light on the evolution of magnetic fields over the cloud-to-core size
scales involved in the early stages of the star formation process. Recent wide-area and high-sensitivity
polarization observations have drawn attention to the challenges of modeling magnetic field structure
of star forming regions, due to variations in dust polarization properties in the interstellar
medium. However, these observations also for the first time provide sufficient information to
begin to break the degeneracy between polarization efficiency variations and depolarization
due to magnetic field sub-beam structure, and thus to accurately infer magnetic field properties
in the star-forming interstellar medium. In this article we discuss submillimeter and far-infrared
polarization observations of star-forming regions made with single-dish instruments. We summarize
past, present and forthcoming single-dish instrumentation, and discuss techniques which have
been developed or proposed to interpret polarization observations, both in order to infer the morphology
and strength of the magnetic field, and in order to determine the environments in which dust polarization
observations reliably trace the magnetic field. We review recent polarimetric observations of
molecular clouds, filaments, and starless and protostellar cores, and discuss how the application
of the full range of modern analysis techniques to recent observations will advance our understanding
of the role played by the magnetic field in the early stages of star formation.
