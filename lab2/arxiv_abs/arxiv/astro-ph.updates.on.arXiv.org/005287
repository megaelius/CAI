A theoretical framework for emission originating from rapidly rotating oblate compact objects
is described in detail. By using a Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we show how the special relativistic
rotational effects such as aberration of angles, Doppler boosting, and time dilatation naturally
emerge from the general relativistic treatment of rotating compact objects. We use the Butterworth-Ipser
metric expanded up to the second order in rotation and hence include effects of light bending, frame-dragging,
and quadrupole deviations to our geodesic calculations. We also give detailed descriptions of
the numerical algorithms used and provide an open source implementation of the numerical framework
called bender. As an application, we study spectral line profiles (i.e., smearing kernels) from
rapidly rotating oblate neutron stars. We find that in this metric description the second order
quadrupole effects are not strong enough to produce narrow observable features in the spectral
energy distribution for almost any physically realistic parameter combination, and hence, actually
detecting them is unlikely. The full width at tenth-maximum and full width at half-maximum of the
rotation smearing kernels are also reported for all viewing angles. These can be then used to quantitatively
estimate the effects of rotational smearing on the observed spectra. We also calculate accurate
pulse profiles and observer skymaps of emission from hot spots on rapidly rotating accreting millisecond
pulsars. These allow us to quantify the strength of the pulse fractions one expects to observe from
typical fast spinning millisecond pulsars.
