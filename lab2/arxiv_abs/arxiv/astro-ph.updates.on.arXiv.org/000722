We present the results of optical spectroscopic follow-up of 125 candidate main sequence OB stars
in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that were originally identified in the S3MC infrared imaging
survey as showing an excess of emission at 24 um indicative of warm dust, such as that associated with
a transitional or debris disks. We use these long-slit spectra to investigate the origin of the 24
um emission and the nature of these stars. A possible explanation for the observed 24 um excess, that
these are emission line stars with dusty excretion disks, is disproven for the majority of our sources.
We find that 88 of these objects are normal stars without line emission, with spectral types mostly
ranging from late-O to early-B; luminosity classes a sub-set of our sample indicate that most are
main-sequence stars. We further identify 17 emission-line stars, 7 possible emission-line stars,
and 5 other stars with forbidden-line emission. We discover a new O6 Iaf star; it exhibits strong
HeII 4686 A emission but relatively weak NIII 4640 A emission that we attribute to the lower nitrogen
abundance in the SMC. Two other objects are identified with planetary nebulae, one with a young stellar
object, and two with X-ray binaries. To shed additional light on the nature of the observed 24 um excess
we use optical and infrared photometry to estimate the dust properties of the objects with normal
O and B star spectra and compare these properties to those of a sample of hot spots in the Galactic interstellar
medium (ISM). We find that the dust properties of the dusty OB star sample resemble the properties
of the Galactic sample of hot spots. Some may be runaway systems with bow-shocks resulting from a
large velocity difference between star and ISM. We further investigate the nature of these dusty
OB stars in a companion paper presenting mid-infrared spectroscopy and additional imaging.
