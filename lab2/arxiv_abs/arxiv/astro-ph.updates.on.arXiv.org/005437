We characterise the oxygen abundance radial distribution of a sample of 102 spiral galaxies observed
with VLT/MUSE using the O3N2 calibrator. The high spatial resolution of the data allows us to detect
14345 HII regions with the same image quality as with photometric data, avoiding any dilution effect.
We develop a new methodology to automatically fit the abundance radial profiles, finding that 55
galaxies of the sample exhibit a single negative gradient. The remaining 47 galaxies also display,
as well as this negative trend, either an inner drop in the abundances (21), an outer flattening (10)
or both (16), which suggests that these features are a common property of disc galaxies. The presence
and depth of the inner drop depends on the stellar mass of the galaxies with the most massive systems
presenting the deepest abundance drops, while there is no such dependence for the outer flattening.
We find that the inner drop appears always around $\rm 0.5\,r_e$, while the position of the outer
flattening varies over a wide range of galactocentric distances. Regarding the main negative gradient,
we find a characteristic slope of $\alpha_{O/H} = -\,0.10\pm0.03\,\rm{dex}/r_e$. This slope
is independent of the presence of bars and the density of the environment. However, when inner drops
or outer flattenings are detected, slightly steeper gradients are observed. This suggests that
radial motions might play an important role in shaping the abundance profiles. We define a new normalisation
scale ($r_{O/H}$) for the radial profiles based on the characteristic abundance gradient, with
which all the galaxies show a similar position for the inner drop ($\sim0.5\,r_{O/H}$) and the outer
flattening ($\sim1.5\,r_{O/H}$).Finally, we find no significant dependence of the dispersion
around the negative gradient with any galaxy property, with values compatible with the uncertainties
of the derived abundances.
