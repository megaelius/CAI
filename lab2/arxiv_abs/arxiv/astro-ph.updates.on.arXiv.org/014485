The Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) is a next-generation survey of
neutral hydrogen (HI) in the Local Universe. It uses the widefield, high-resolution capability
of the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), a radio interferometer consisting
of 36 x 12-m dishes equipped with Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs), located in an extremely radio-quiet
zone in Western Australia. WALLABY aims to survey three-quarters of the sky (-90 degr < Dec < +30 degr)
to a redshift of z < 0.26, and generate spectral line image cubes at ~30 arcsec resolution and ~1.6
mJy/beam per 4 km/s channel sensitivity. ASKAP's instantaneous field of view at 1.4 GHz, delivered
by the PAF's 36 beams, is about 30 sq deg. At an integrated signal-to-noise ratio of five, WALLABY
is expected to detect over half a million galaxies with a mean redshift of z ~ 0.05 (~200 Mpc). The scientific
goals of WALLABY include: (a) a census of gas-rich galaxies in the vicinity of the Local Group; (b)
a study of the HI properties of galaxies, groups and clusters, in particular the influence of the
environment on galaxy evolution; and (c) the refinement of cosmological parameters using the spatial
and redshift distribution of low-bias gas-rich galaxies. For context we provide an overview of
previous large-scale HI surveys. Combined with existing and new multi-wavelength sky surveys,
WALLABY will enable an exciting new generation of panchromatic studies of the Local Universe. -
First results from the WALLABY pilot survey are revealed, with initial data products publicly available
in the CSIRO ASKAP Science Data Archive (CASDA).
