The observed anti-correlation between the central dark matter (DM) densities of the bright Milky
Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and their orbital pericenter distances poses a potential
signature of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). In this work we investigate this possibility
by analysing the range of SIDM scattering cross section per unit mass, $\sigma/m_{\chi}$, able
to explain such anti-correlation. We simulate the orbital evolution of dSphs subhaloes around
the MW assuming an analytical form for the gravitational potential, adopting the proper motions
from the Gaia mission and including a consistent characterization of gravitational tidal stripping.
The evolution of the subhaloes density profile is modelled using the gravothermal fluid formalism,
where DM particle collisions induce thermal conduction that depends on $\sigma/m_{\chi}$. We
find that models of dSphs, such as Carina and Fornax, reproduce the observed central DM densities
with fixed $\sigma/m_{\chi}$ ranging between $30$ and $50$ cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$, whereas other dSphs
prefer larger values ranging between $70$ and $100$ cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$. These cross sections correlate
with the average collision velocity of DM particles within each subhalo's core, so that systems
modelled with large cross sections have lower collision velocities. We fit the cross section-velocity
correlation with a SIDM particle model, where a DM particle of mass $m_{\chi}=0.648\pm 0.154$ GeV
interacts under the exchange of a light mediator of mass $m_{\phi}=0.636\pm 0.055$ MeV, with the
self-interactions being described by a Yukawa potential. The outcome is a cross section-velocity
relation that explains the diverse DM profiles of MW dSph satellites and is consistent with observational
constraints on larger scales.
