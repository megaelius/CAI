The seven approximately Earth-sized transiting planets in the \object{TRAPPIST-1} system provide
a unique opportunity to explore habitable zone and non-habitable zone small planets within the
same system. Its habitable zone exoplanets -- due to their favorable transit depths -- are also worlds
for which atmospheric transmission spectroscopy is within reach with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) and with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We present here an independent reduction and
analysis of two \textit{HST} Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-infrared transit spectroscopy datasets
for six planets (b through g). Utilizing our physically-motivated detector charge trap correction
and a custom cosmic ray correction routine, we confirm the general shape of the transmission spectra
presented by \textbf{\citet{deWit2016, deWit2018}}. Our data reduction approach leads to a 25\%
increase in the usable data and reduces the risk of confusing astrophysical brightness variations
(e.g., flares) with instrumental systematics. No prominent absorption features are detected
in any individual planet's transmission spectra; by contrast, the combined spectrum of the planets
shows a suggestive decrease around 1.4\,$\micron$ similar to an inverted water absorption feature.
Including transit depths from \textit{K2}, the SPECULOOS-South Observatory, and \textit{Spitzer},
we find that the complete transmission spectrum is fully consistent with stellar contamination
owing to the transit light source effect. These spectra demonstrate how stellar contamination
can overwhelm planetary absorption features in low-resolution exoplanet transit spectra obtained
by \textit{HST} and \textit{JWST} and also highlight the challenges in combining multi epoch observations
for planets around rapidly rotating spotted stars.
