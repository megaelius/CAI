In the last decade, it has been well-established that baryonic processes play a crucial role in the
evolution dark matter (DM) haloes. Nevertheless, the details of this intricate coevolution are
still not fully understood. In this work we aim at investigating the effects of baryons on the DM haloes
structure, focusing on the correlation between the presence and importance of stellar discs and
the halo shapes. We study the properties of a subsample of DM haloes from Fenix and {\sc eagle} cosmological
simulations, hosting well-resolved galaxies. We inspect the central regions of haloes in the mass
range $[10.9-992.3] \times 10^{10} \ \rm M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, comparing the hydrodynamic runs
and their dark matter only (DMo) counterparts. Our results indicate that baryons have a significant
impact on the shape of the inner halo, mainly within $\sim$ 20 percent of the virial radius. As reported
before haloes found to be more spherical when hosting baryons. While the impact of baryons depends
on the mass of the haloes, we also find a trend with morphology which suggests that the way baryons
are assembled is also relevant in agreement with previous works. Our findings also indicate that
disc galaxies preferentially form in haloes whose DMo counterparts were originally more spherical
and with stronger velocity anisotropy. The presence of baryons alter the orbital structure of the
DM particles of the haloes, which show a decrease in the DM velocity anisotropy, towards more tangentially
biased DM orbits. This relative decrease is weaker in the case of disc-dominated galaxies. Our results
point out to a cosmological connection between the final morphology of galaxies and the intrinsic
properties of their DM haloes, which gets reinforce by the growth of the discs.
