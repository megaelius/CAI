Astrometry, the measurement of positions and motions of the stars, is one of the oldest disciplines
in Astronomy, extending back at least as far as Hipparchus' discovery of the precession of Earth's
axes in 190 BCE by comparing his catalog with those of his predecessors. Astrometry is fundamental
to Astronomy, and critical to many aspects of Astrophysics and Geodesy. In order to understand our
planet's and solar system's context within their surroundings, we must be able to to define, quantify,
study, refine, and maintain an inertial frame of reference relative to which all positions and motions
can be unambiguously and self-consistently described. It is only by using this inertial reference
frame that we are able to disentangle our observations of the motions of celestial objects from our
own complex path around our star, and its path through the galaxy, and the local group. Every aspect
of each area outlined in the call for scientific frontiers in astronomy in the era of the 2020-2030
timeframe will depend on the quality of the inertial reference frame. In this white paper, we propose
support for development of radio Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) capabilities, including
the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), a radio astronomy observatory that will not only support
development of a next generation reference frame of unprecedented accuracy, but that will also
serve as a highly capable astronomical instrument in its own right. Much like its predecessors,
the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and other VLBI telescopes, the proposed ngVLA will provide the
foundation for the next three decades for the fundamental reference frame, benefitting astronomy,
astrophysics, and geodesy alike.
