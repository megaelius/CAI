We investigate a relation between surface densities (at a $\sim 1$kpc scale) of star formation rate
(SFR) and stellar mass ($M_{*}$) namely spatially resolved star formation main sequence (SFMS)
at $z\sim 0$ and $z\sim 1$ of massive ($\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})>10.5$) face-on disc galaxies and
examine the evolution of the relation with cosmic time. The spatially resolved SFMS of $z\sim 0$
galaxies is discussed in a companion paper. For $z\sim 1$ sample, we use 8 bands imaging dataset from
CANDELS and 3D-HST which provides a rest-frame FUV-NIR SED for galaxies at $0.8\lesssim z \lesssim
1.8$. We perform a pixel-to-pixel SED fitting to derive the spatially resolved SFR and $M_{*}$ distributions
in a galaxy. We find a linear spatially resolved SFMS in the $z\sim 1$ galaxies that lie within $\pm
0.3$ dex from the global SFMS, while a "flattening" at high $\Sigma_{*}$ end is found in the spatially
resolved SFMS of the galaxies that lie below $-0.3$ dex from the global SFMS. The "flattening" trend
is consistent with a decline of the sSFR radial profile (sSFR$(r)$) in the central region of the corresponding
galaxies. Comparison with the spatially resolved SFMS in the $z\sim 0$ galaxies shows smaller difference
in the sSFR at low $\Sigma_{*}$ ($\sim 0.4$ dex at $\log(\Sigma_{*}[M_{\odot} \text{kpc}^{-2}])=7.0$)
than that at high $\Sigma_{*}$ ($\sim 1.5$ dex at $\log(\Sigma_{*}[M_{\odot} \text{kpc}^{-2}])=8.5$).
This trend is consistent with the evolution of the sSFR$(r)$ radial profile, which shows a faster
decrease in the central region than in the outskirt, agrees with the inside-out quenching scenario.
We then derive an empirical model for the evolution of the $\Sigma_{*}(r)$, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}(r)$
and sSFR$(r)$ radial profiles. Based on the empirical model, we estimate the radial profile of the
quenching timescale and reproduce the observed spatially resolved SFMS at $z\sim 1$ and $z\sim
0$.
