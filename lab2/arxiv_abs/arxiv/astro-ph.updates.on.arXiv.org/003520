Lyman-a (Lya) is, intrinsically, the strongest nebular emission line in actively star-forming
galaxies (SFGs), but its resonant nature and uncertain escape fraction limit its applicability.
The structure, size, and morphology may be key to understand the escape of Lya photons and the nature
of Lya emitters (LAEs). We investigate the rest-frame UV morphologies of a large sample of ~4000
LAEs from z~2 to z~6, selected in a uniform way with 16 different narrow- and medium-bands over the
full COSMOS field (SC4K, Santos et al. in prep). From the magnitudes that we measure from UV stacks,
we find that these galaxies are populating the faint end of the UV luminosity function. We find also
that LAEs have roughly the same morphology from z~2 to z~6. The median size (re~1 kpc), ellipticities
(slightly elongated with b/a~0.45), S\'ersic index (disk-like with n<2), and light concentration
(comparable to that of disk or irregular galaxies, with C~2.7) show little to no evolution. LAEs
with the highest equivalent widths (EW) are the smallest/most compact (re~0.8 kpc, compared to
re~1.5 kpc for the lower EW LAEs). In a scenario where galaxies with a high Lya escape fraction are
more frequent in compact objects, these results are a natural consequence of the small sizes of LAEs.
When compared to other SFGs, LAEs are found to be smaller at all redshifts. The difference between
the two populations changing with redshift, from a factor of ~1 at z>5 to SFGs being a factor of ~2-4
larger than LAEs for z<2. This means that at the highest redshifts, where typical sizes approach
those of LAEs, the fraction of galaxies showing Lya in emission should be much higher, consistent
with observations.
