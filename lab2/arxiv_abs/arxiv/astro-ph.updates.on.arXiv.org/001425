(Abridged for arXiv)We investigate the properties of halos, galaxies and blackholes to z=0 in the
high resolution hydrodynamical simulation MassiveBlack-II (MBII) which evolves a LCDM cosmology
in a comoving volume Vbox=100(Mpc/h)^3. MBII is the highest resolution simulation of this size
which includes a self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion and associated
feedback. We provide a simulation browser web application which enables interactive search and
tagging of halos, subhalos and their properties and publicly release our galaxy catalogs. Our analysis
of the halo mass function (MF) in MBII reveals that baryons have strong effects, with changes in the
halo abundance of 20-35% below the knee of the MF (Mhalo < 10^13.2 Msun/h at z=0) when compared
to fits based on dark matter only simulations. We provide a fitting function for the halo MF out to
redshift z=11 and discuss how the onset of non-universality in the MF limits the accuracy of our fit.
We study the halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular the evolution
and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonable agreement with observational
data. The shape of the cosmic spectral energy distribution predicted by MBII is consistent with
observations, but lower in amplitude. The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) function is broadly
consistent with observations at z>=2. At z<2, the population of passive low mass (for M*<10^9
Msun) galaxies in MBII makes the GSMF too steep compared to observations whereas at the high mass
end (M*>10^11 Msun) galaxies hosting bright AGNs make significant contributions to the GSMF.
The quasar bolometric luminosity function is also largely consistent with observations. We note
however that more efficient AGN feedback (beyond simple thermal coupling used here) is likely necessary
for the largest, rarest objects/clusters at low redshifts.
