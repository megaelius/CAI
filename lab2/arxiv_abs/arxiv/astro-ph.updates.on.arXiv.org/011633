In this study we investigate 179 radio-IR galaxies drawn from a sample of spectroscopically-confirmed
galaxies that are detected in radio and mid-infrared (MIR) in the redshift range of $0.55 \leq z \leq
1.30$ in the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. We
constrain the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) contribution in the total IR luminosity (f$_{\text{AGN}}$),
and estimate the AGN luminosity (L$_{\text{AGN}}$) and the star formation rate (SFR) using the
CIGALE Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting routine. Based on the f$_{\text{AGN}}$ and
radio luminosity, radio-IR galaxies are split into: galaxies that host either high or low f$_{\text{AGN}}$
AGN (high-/low-f$_{\text{AGN}}$), and star forming galaxies with little to no AGN activity (SFGs).
We study the colour, stellar mass, radio luminosity, L$_{\text{AGN}}$ and SFR properties of the
three radio-IR sub-samples, comparing to a spec-IR sample drawn from spectroscopically-confirmed
galaxies that are also detected in MIR. No significant difference between radio luminosity of these
sub-samples was found, which could be due to the combined contribution of radio emission from AGN
and star formation. We find a positive relationship between L$_{\text{AGN}}$and specific SFR
(sSFR) for both AGN sub-samples, strongly suggesting a co-evolution scenario of AGN and SF in these
galaxies. A toy model is designed to demonstrate this co-evolution scenario, where we find that,
in almost all cases, a rapid quenching timescale is required, which we argue is a signature of AGN
quenching. The environmental preference for intermediate/infall regions of clusters/groups
remains across the co-evolution scenario, which suggests that galaxies might be in an orbital motion
around the cluster/group during the scenario.
