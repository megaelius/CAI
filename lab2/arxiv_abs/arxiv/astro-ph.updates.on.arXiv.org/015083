We conduct a rigorous examination of the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse by drawing on the synthesis
of new observational data and three different modeling techniques. Our observational results
include the release of new, processed photometric measurements collected with the space-based
SMEI instrument prior to Betelgeuse's recent, unprecedented dimming event. Our theoretical predictions
include self-consistent results from multi-timescale evolutionary, oscillatory, and hydrodynamic
simulations conducted with the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software
suite. Significant outcomes of our modeling efforts include a precise prediction for the star's
radius: $750^{+62}_{-30}\,R_{\odot}$. In concert with additional constraints, this allows
us to derive a new, independent distance estimate of $165^ {+16}_{-8}$\,pc and a parallax of $\pi=6.06^{+0.31}_{-0.52}$\,mas,
in good agreement with \textit{Hipparcos} but less so with recent radio measurements. Seismic
results from both perturbed hydrostatic and evolving hydrodynamic simulations constrain the
period and driving mechanisms of Betelgeuse's dominant periodicities in new ways. Our analyses
converge to the conclusion that Betelgeuse's $388$ day period is the result of pulsation in the fundamental
mode, driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism. Grid-based hydrodynamic modeling reveals that the behavior
of the oscillating envelope is mass-dependent, and likewise suggests that the non-linear pulsation
excitation time could serve as a mass constraint. Our results corroborate recent conclusions that
Betelgeuse is the outcome of a past merger. We place it definitively in the core helium-burning phase
near the base of the red supergiant branch, and we report a present-day mass of $16.5$--$19 ~M_{\odot}$---slightly
lower than typical literature values.
