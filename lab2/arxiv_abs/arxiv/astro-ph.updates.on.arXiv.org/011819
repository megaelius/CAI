We use the first release of the SDSS/MaStar stellar library comprising 8646 high S/N spectra to calculate
integrated spectra of stellar population models. The spectra cover the wavelength range 0.36-1.03
micron and share the same spectral resolution (R=1800) and flux calibration as the SDSS-IV/MaNGA
galaxy data. The parameter space covered by the stellar spectra collected thus far allows the calculation
of models with chemical composition -2 <= [Z/H] <= + 0.35 and ages larger than ~200 Myr. These ranges
will be extended as MaStar collects further data. We are able to include spectra for dwarf Main Sequence
(MS) stars close to the core H-burning limit of 0.1 Msun, as well as the contribution of cold and metal-rich
giants, which manifest themselves with strong absorption bands between 7000 and 10,000 Angstrom.
These features will be important for modelling the spectra of massive galaxies. Other novelties
include better coverage of the HR diagram at low metallicity, where we can calculate models as young
as 500 Myr. We fully include the Blue Horizontal Branch phase. We present models adopting two sets
of stellar parameters (T_eff, logg, [Z/H]). In a novel approach, the reliability of stellar parameters
is tested 'on the fly' using the stellar population models themselves. We test the age and metallicity
scale of the new models with Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds GCs with independently measured age
and chemical composition. We find that the new MaStar-based models are able to recover ages and metallicities
remarkably well, with systematics as low as a few per cent for calibration sets with homogeneously
derived ages and metallicities. We also fit a MaNGA galaxy spectrum, finding that the new models
gain fitting residuals of the order of a few per cent comparable to the state-of-art models, but now
over a wider wavelength range. The models are available at www.icg.port.ac.uk/mastar.
