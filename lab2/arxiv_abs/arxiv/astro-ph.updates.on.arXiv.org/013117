Tiny meteoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere and inducing meteor showers have long been thought
to originate partly from cometary dust. Together with other dust particles, they form a huge cloud
around the Sun, the zodiacal cloud. From our previous studies of the zodiacal light, as well as other
independent methods (dynamical studies, infrared observations, data related to Earth's environment),
it is now established that a significant fraction of dust particles entering the Earth's atmosphere
comes from Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). This paper relies on our understanding of key properties
of the zodiacal cloud and of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, extensively studied by the Rosetta
mission to a JFC. The interpretation, through numerical and experimental simulations of zodiacal
light local polarimetric phase curves, has recently allowed us to establish that interplanetary
dust is rich in absorbing organics and consists of fluffy particles. The ground-truth provided
by Rosetta presently establishes that the cometary dust particles are rich in organic compounds
and consist of quite fluffy and irregular aggregates. Our aims are as follows: (1) to make links,
back in time, between peculiar micrometeorites, tiny meteoroids, interplanetary dust particles,
cometary dust particles, and the early evolution of the Solar System, and (2) to show how detailed
studies of such meteoroids and of cometary dust particles can improve the interpretation of observations
of dust in protoplanetary and debris disks. Future modeling of dust in such disks should favor irregular
porous particles instead of more conventional compact spherical particles.
