The realistic simulation of variable star populations is fundamental to determine the selection
function and contamination in existing and upcoming multi-epoch surveys. We present \ellisa,
a simulator that produces an ensemble of mock light curves for a population of eclipsing binaries
obtained from physical and orbital parameters consistent with different galactic populations,
and which considers user-supplied time sampling and photometric errors to represent any given
survey. We carried out a search for eclipsing binaries in the QUEST low-galactic latitude catalogue
of variable stars, spanning an area of 476 sq. deg at $-25^\circ \la b \la 30^\circ$ and $190^ \circ
\leqslant l \leqslant 230^ \circ$ towards the galactic anti-centre, and use \ellisa~to characterise
the completeness of the resulting catalogue in terms of amplitudes and periods of variation as well
as eclipsing binary type. The resulting catalogue consists of $1,125$ eclipsing binaries, out
of which $179$, $60$ and $886$ are EA, EB and EW types respectively. We estimate, on average, $30\%$
completeness in the period range $0.25 \la P/d \la 1$ for EB+EW binaries and $15\%$ completeness
for EA binaries with periods $2 \la P/d \la 10$, being the time sampling the primary factor determining
the completeness of each type of eclipsing binary. This is one of few eclipsing binary catalogues
reported with an estimate of the selection function. Mock eclipsing binary light curve libraries
produced with \ellisa~can be used to estimate the selection function and optimise eclipsing binary
searches in upcoming multi-epoch surveys such as Gaia, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid
Response System, the Zwicky Transient Factory or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.
