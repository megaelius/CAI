We present new deep imaging of the central regions of the remote globular cluster NGC 2419, obtained
with the F343N and F336W filters of HST/WFC3. The new data are combined with archival imaging to constrain
nitrogen and helium abundance variations within the cluster. We find a clearly bimodal distribution
of the nitrogen-sensitive F336W-F343N colours of red giants, from which we estimate that about
55% of the giants belong to a population with about normal (field-like) nitrogen abundances (P1),
while the remaining 45% belong to a nitrogen-rich population (P2). On average, the P2 stars are more
He-rich than the P1 stars, with an estimated mean difference of Delta Y = 0.05, but the P2 stars exhibit
a significant spread in He content and some may reach Delta Y = 0.13. A smaller He spread may be present
also for the P1 stars. Additionally, stars with spectroscopically determined low [Mg/Fe] ratios
([Mg/Fe]<0) are generally associated with P2. We find the P2 stars to be slightly more centrally
concentrated in NGC 2419 with a projected half-number radius of about 10% less than for the P1 stars,
but the difference is not highly significant (p=0.05). We find evidence of rotation for the P1 stars,
whereas the results are inconclusive for the P2 stars, which are consistent with no rotation as well
as the same average rotation found for the P1 stars. Because of the long relaxation time scale of NGC
2419, the radial trends and kinematic properties of the populations are expected to be relatively
unaffected by dynamical evolution. Hence, they provide constraints on formation scenarios for
multiple populations, which must account not only for the presence of He spreads within sub-populations
identified via CNO variations, but also for the relatively modest differences in the spatial distributions
and kinematics of the populations.
