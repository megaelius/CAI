We present near-IR spectroscopic observations of the central sources in 17 circumstellar shells
from a sample of more than 400 "bubbles" discovered in the Spitzer/MIPSGAL 24um survey of the Galactic
plane and in the Cyg-X region. To identify these shells, we have obtained J, H, and K band spectra with
a resolution ~2600 of the stars at their centers. We observed 14 MIPSGAL bubbles (MBs), WR149, and
2 objects in the Cyg-X region (WR138a and BD+43 3710), our sample being about 2.5 mag fainter in K band
than previous studies of the central sources of MBs. We use spectroscopic diagnostics and spectral
libraries to constrain the natures of our targets. We find five late type giants. The equivalent
widths of their CO 2.29um features allow us to determine their spectral types and hence derive extinction
along the line of sight, distance, and physical size of the shells. We also find twelve early type
stars, in nine MBs and the 3 comparison objects. We find that the subtype inferred from the near-IR
for WR138a (WN9h) and WR149 (WN5h) agrees with that derived from optical observations. A careful
analysis of the literature and the environment of BD+43 3710 allows us to rule out the carbon star
nature previously suggested. Our spectrum suggests that it is a B5I star. At the centers of the nine
MBs, we find a candidate [WC5-6], a candidate O5-6V star, a B0 supergiant, a B/A type giant, and five
LBV candidates. We report the detections of emission lines arising from two shells with typical
extents (~10") in agreement with those in the mid-IR. We summarize the findings on the natures of
the MBs since their discovery, with 30% of them now known. Most MBs with central sources detected
in the near- to mid-IR have been identified and are red and blue (super)giants, or stars evolving
toward these phases including a handful of newly discovered Wolf-Rayet stars and a significant
number of LBV candidates.
