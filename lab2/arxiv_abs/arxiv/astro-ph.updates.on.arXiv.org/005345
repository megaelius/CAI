We use 'mock' interferometric HI measurements and a conventional tilted-ring modelling procedure
to estimate rotation curves of dwarf galaxy discs from the APOSTLE suite of {\Lambda}CDM cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. The modelling yields a large diversity of rotation curves for an individual
galaxy, depending on the line-of-sight orientation. The diversity is driven by non-circular motions
in the gas; in particular, by strong bisymmetric fluctuations in the azimuthal velocities that
the tilted-ring model is ill-suited to account for and that are difficult to detect in model residuals.
Large under-estimates of the circular velocity can result when the kinematic major axis coincides
with the minima of the fluctuation pattern, mimicking the presence of kiloparsec-scale 'cores',
when none are actually present. The thickness of APOSTLE discs accentuates the effect, as slowly-rotating
extraplanar gas systematically reduces the average line-of-sight speeds in the inner regions.
APOSTLE dwarf galaxies compare favourably with observations in terms of the mass, size and kinematics
of their HI discs, although the amplitude of their non-circular motions appears somewhat larger
than in quiescent discs from the THINGS and LITTLE THINGS surveys. Non-circular motions provide
a compelling explanation for the large apparent cores observed in galaxies such as DDO 47 and DDO
87, where such motions are clearly present and might have negatively affected estimates of the inner
circular velocities. We argue that non-circular motions might help reconcile the inner rotation
cuves of disc galaxies with the 'cusps' expected in cold dark matter-dominated galaxies.
