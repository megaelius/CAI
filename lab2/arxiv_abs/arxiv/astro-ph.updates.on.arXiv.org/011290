Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are an important product of solar activity. They are connected
to solar active regions and flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), EUV waves, shocks, Type II and
III radio emissions, and X-ray bursts. These phenomena are major probes of the partition of energy
in solar eruptions, as well as for the organization, dynamics, and relaxation of coronal and interplanetary
magnetic fields. Many of these phenomena cause terrestrial space weather, posing multiple hazards
for humans and their technology from space to the ground. Since particular flares, shocks, CMEs,
and EUV waves produce SEP events but others do not, since propagation effects from the low corona
to 1 AU appear important for some events but not others, and since Type II and III radio emissions and
X-ray bursts are sometimes produced by energetic particles leaving these acceleration sites,
it is necessary to study the whole system with a multi-frequency and multi-instrument perspective
that combines both in-situ and remote observations with detailed modelling of phenomena. This
article demonstrates this comprehensive approach, and shows its necessity, by analysing a trio
of unusual and striking solar eruptions, radio and X-ray bursts, and SEP events that occurred on
4 November 2015. These events show both strong similarities and differences from standard events
and each other, despite having very similar interplanetary conditions and only two are sites and
CME genesis regions. They are therefore major targets for further in-depth observational studies,
and for testing both existing and new theories and models. Based on the very limited modelling available
we identify the aspects that are and are not understood, and we discuss ideas that may lead to improved
understanding of the SEP, radio, and space-weather events.
