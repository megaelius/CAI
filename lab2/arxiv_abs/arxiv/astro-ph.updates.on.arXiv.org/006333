The Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) 2011by, hosted in NGC 3972, and 2011fe, hosted in M101, are optical
"twins," having almost identical optical light-curve shapes, colours, and near-maximum-brightness
spectra. However, SN 2011fe had significantly more ultraviolet (UV; 1600 < lambda < 2500 A) flux
than SN 2011by before and at peak luminosity. Theory suggests that SNe Ia with higher progenitor
metallicity should (1) have additional UV opacity near peak and thus lower UV flux; (2) have an essentially
unchanged optical spectral-energy distribution; (3) have a similar optical light-curve shape;
and (4) because of the excess neutrons, produce more stable Fe-group elements at the expense of radioactive
56Ni and thus have a lower peak luminosity. Foley & Kirshner (2013) suggested that the difference
in UV flux between SNe 2011by and 2011fe was the result of their progenitors having significantly
different metallicities. The SNe also had a large, but insignificant, difference between their
peak absolute magnitudes (Delta M_V, peak = 0.60 +/- 0.36 mag), with SN 2011fe being more luminous.
We present a new Cepheid-based distance to NGC 3972, significantly improving the precision of the
distance measurement for SN 2011by. With these new data, we determine that the SNe have significantly
different peak luminosities (Delta M_V, peak = 0.335 +/- 0.069 mag), corresponding to SN 2011fe
having produced 38% more 56Ni than SN 2011by, and providing additional evidence for progenitor
metallicity differences for these SNe. We discuss how progenitor metallicity differences can
contribute to the intrinsic scatter for light-curve-shape-corrected SN luminosities, the use
of "twin" SNe for measuring distances, and implications for using SNe Ia for constraining cosmological
parameters.
