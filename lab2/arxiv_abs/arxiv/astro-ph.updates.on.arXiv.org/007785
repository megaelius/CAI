We present a study of the low-frequency radio properties of broad absorption line quasars (BALQSOs)
from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky-Survey Data Release 1 (LDR1). The value-added LDR1 catalogue contains
Pan-STARRS counterparts, which we match with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 and DR12 quasar
catalogues. We find that BALQSOs are twice as likely to be detected at 144$\,$MHz than their non-BAL
counterparts, and BALQSOs with low-ionisation species present in their spectra are three times
more likely to be detected than those with only high-ionisation species. The BALQSO fraction at
144$\,$MHz is constant with increasing radio luminosity, which is inconsistent with previous
results at 1.4$\,$GHz, indicating that observations at the different frequencies may be tracing
different sources of radio emission. We cross-match radio sources between the Faint Images of the
Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) survey and LDR1, which provides a bridge via the LDR1 Pan-STARRS
counterparts to identify BALQSOs in SDSS. Consequently we expand the sample of BALQSOs detected
in FIRST by a factor of three. The LDR1-detected BALQSOs in our sample are almost exclusively radio-quiet
(\logr $\,<2$), with radio sizes at 144$\,$MHz typically less than $200\,$kpc; these radio sizes
tend to be larger than those at 1.4$\,$GHz, suggesting more extended radio emission at low frequencies.
We find that although the radio detection fraction increases with increasing balnicity index (BI),
there is no correlation between BI and either low-frequency radio power or radio-loudness. This
suggests that both radio emission and BI may be linked to the same underlying process, but are spatially
distinct phenomena.
