The O6 Vn star HD 64315 is believed to belong to the star-forming region known as NGC 2467, but previous
distance estimates do not support this association. We explore the multiple nature of this star
with the aim of determining its distance, and understanding its connection to NGC 2467. A total of
52 high-resolution spectra have been gathered over a decade. We use their analysis, in combination
with the photometric data from All Sky Automated Survey and Hipparcos catalogues, to conclude that
HD 64315 is composed of at least two spectroscopic binaries, one of which is an eclipsing binary.
HD 64315 contains two binary systems, one of which is an eclipsing binary. The two binaries are separated
by 0.09 arcsec (or 500 AU) if the most likely distance to the system, around 5 kpc, is considered. The
presence of fainter companions is not excluded by current observations. The non-eclipsing binary
(HD 64315 AaAb) has a period of 2.70962901+/-0.00000021 d. Its components are hotter than those
of the eclipsing binary, and dominate the appearance of the system. The eclipsing binary (HD 64315
BaBb) has a shorter period of 1.0189569+/-0.0000008 d. We derive masses of 14.6+-2.3 M$_\odot$
for both components of the BaBb system. They are almost identical; both stars are overfilling their
respective Roche lobes, and share a common envelope in an overcontact configuration. The non-eclipsing
binary is a detached system composed of two stars with spectral types around O6 V with minimum masses
of 10.8 M$_\odot$ and 10.2 M$_\odot$, and likely masses aprox. 30 M$_\odot$. HD 64315 provides a
cautionary tale about high-mass star isolation and multiplicity. Its total mass is likely above
90 M$_\odot$,but it seems to have formed without an accompanying cluster. It contains one the most
massive overcontact binaries known, a likely merger progenitor in a very wide multiple system.
