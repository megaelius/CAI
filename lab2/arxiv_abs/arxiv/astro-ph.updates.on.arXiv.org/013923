Dust attenuation in star-forming spiral galaxies affects stars and gas in different ways due to
local variations in dust geometry. We present spatially resolved measurements of dust attenuation
for a sample of 232 such star-forming spiral galaxies, derived from spectra acquired by the SDSS-IV
MaNGA survey. The dust attenuation affecting the stellar populations of these galaxies (obtained
using full spectrum stellar population fitting methods) is compared with the dust attenuation
in the gas (derived from the Balmer decrement). Both of these attenuation measures increase for
local regions of galaxies with higher star formation rates; the dust attenuation affecting the
stellar populations increases more so than the dust attenuation in the gas, causing the ratio of
the dust attenuation affecting the stellar populations to the dust attenuation in the gas to decrease
for local regions of galaxies with higher star formation rate densities. No systematic difference
is discernible in any of these dust attenuation quantities between the spiral arm and inter-arm
regions of the galaxies. While both the dust attenuation in the gas and the dust attenuation affecting
the stellar populations decrease with galactocentric radius, the ratio of the two quantities does
not vary with radius. This ratio does, however, decrease systematically as the stellar mass of the
galaxy increases. Analysis of the radial profiles of the two dust attenuation measures suggests
that there is a disproportionately high concentration of birth clouds (incorporating gas, young
stars and clumpy dust) nearer to the centres of star-forming spiral galaxies.
