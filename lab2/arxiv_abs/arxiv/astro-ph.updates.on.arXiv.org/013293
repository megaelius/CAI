Valuable information about the neutron star interior can be obtained by comparing observations
of thermal radiation from a cooling neutron star crust with theoretical models. Nuclear burning
of lighter elements that diffuse to deeper layers of the envelope can alter the relation between
surface and interior temperatures and can change the chemical composition over time. We calculate
new temperature relations and consider two effects of diffusive nuclear burning (DNB) for H-C envelopes.
First, we consider the effect of a changing envelope composition and find that hydrogen is consumed
on short timescales and our temperature evolution simulations correspond to those of a hydrogen-poor
envelope within ~100 days. The transition from a hydrogen-rich to a hydrogen-poor envelope is potentially
observable in accreting NS systems as an additional initial decline in surface temperature at early
times after the outburst. Second, we find that DNB can produce a non-negligible heat flux, such that
the total luminosity can be dominated by DNB in the envelope rather than heat from the deep interior.
However, without continual accretion, heating by DNB in H-C envelopes is only relevant for <1-80
days after the end of an accretion outburst, as the amount of light elements is rapidly depleted.
Comparison to crust cooling data shows that DNB does not remove the need for an additional shallow
heating source. We conclude that solving the time-dependent equations of the burning region in
the envelope self-consistently in thermal evolution models instead of using static temperature
relations would be valuable in future cooling studies.
