If a phase transition is allowed to take place in the core of a compact star, a new stable branch of equilibrium
configurations can appear, providing solutions with the same mass as the purely hadronic branch
and hence giving rise to twin-star configurations. We perform an extensive analysis of the features
of the phase transition leading twin-star configurations and, at the same time, fulfilling the
constraints coming from the maximum mass of $2 M_\odot$ and the information following gravitational-wave
event GW170817. In particular, we use a general equation of state for the neutron-star matter that
parametrizes the hadron-quark phase transition between the model describing the hadronic phase
and a constant speed of sound for the quark phase. We find that the largest number of twin-star solutions
has masses in the neutron-star branch in the range $1-2 M_\odot$ and twin-branch masses $\gtrsim
2 M_\odot$. The analysis of the masses, radii and tidal deformabilities also reveals that when twin
stars appear, the tidal deformability shows two distinct branches with the same mass, thus differing
considerably from the behaviour expected for neutron stars. In addition, we find that the data from
GW170817 is compatible with the existence of hybrid stars and could also be interpreted as produced
by the merger of a binary system of hybrid stars or of a hybrid star with a neutron star. The presence
of a hybrid star in the inspiral phase can be established clearly if future gravitational-wave detections
measure chirp masses $\mathcal{M}\lesssim 1.2 M_\odot$ and tidal deformabilities of $\Lambda_{1.4}\lesssim
400$ for $1.4 M_\odot$ stars. Finally, combining all observational information available, we
set constraints on the parameters that characterise the phase transition, the maximum masses,
and the radii of $1.4 M_\odot$ stars described by equations of state leading to twin-star configurations.
