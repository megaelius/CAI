The interplanetary space probe Cassini/Huygens reached Saturn in July 2004 after seven years of
cruise phase. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) measures the interplanetary, interstellar and planetary
dust in our solar system since 1999 and provided unique discoveries. In 1999, CDA detected interstellar
dust in the inner solar system followed by the detection of electrical charges of interplanetary
dust grains during the cruise phase between Earth and Jupiter. The instrument determined the composition
of interplanetary dust and the nanometre sized dust streams originating from Jupiter's moon Io.
During the approach to Saturn in 2004, similar streams of submicron grains with speeds in the order
of 100 km/s were detected from Saturn's inner and outer ring system and are released to the interplanetary
magnetic field. Since 2004 CDA measured more than one million dust impacts characterizing the dust
environment of Saturn. The instrument is one of three experiments which discovered the active ice
geysers located at the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus in 2005. Later, a detailed compositional
analysis of the water ice grains in Saturn's E ring system lead to the discovery of large reservoirs
of liquid water (oceans) below the icy crust of Enceladus. Finally, the determination of the dust-
magnetosphere interaction and the discovery of the extended E ring (at least twice as large as predicted)
allowed the definition of a dynamical dust model of Saturn's E ring describing the observed properties.
This paper summarizes the discoveries of a ten year story of success based on reliable measurements
with the most advanced dust detector flown in space until today. This paper focuses on cruise results
and findings achieved at Saturn with a focus on flux and density measurements.
