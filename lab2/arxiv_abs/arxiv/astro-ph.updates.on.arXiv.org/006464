When planets are formed from the protoplanetary disk and after the disk has dissipated, the evolution
of their orbits is governed by tidal interactions, friction, and gravitational drag, and also by
changes in the mass of the star and planet. These interactions may change the initial distribution
of the distances between the planets and their host star by expanding the original orbit, by contracting
it (which may cause an engulfment of the planet by the star), or by destroying the planet. We study
the evolution of the orbit of a planet orbiting its host star under the effects of equilibrium tides,
dynamical tides, drag (frictional and gravitational), and stellar mass loss. We used the Geneva
stellar evolution code to compute the evolution of stars with initial masses of 1 and 1.5 solar mass
with different rotation rates at solar metallicity. The star is evolved from the pre-main-sequence
(PMS) up to the tip of the red giant branch. We used these models as input for computing the evolution
of the planetary orbits. We explored the effects of changing the planet masses (of 1 Earth mass up
to 20 Jupiter masses), the distance between the planet and the star (of 0.015 and more than 3 au), the
mass, and the spin of the star. We present results when only the equilibrium tide was accounted for
and when both equilibrium and dynamical tides were accounted for. The expression for the dynamical
tide is a frequency-averaged dissipation of tidally excited inertial waves, obtained from a piecewise
homogeneous two-layer stellar model. Gravity wave damping was neglected. Dynamical tides in convective
zones have a significant effect on planetary orbits only during the PMS phase and only for fast-rotating
stars. They have no significant effects during the PMS phase for initially slow-rotating stars
and during the red giant branch phase, regardless of the initial rotation (abridged).
