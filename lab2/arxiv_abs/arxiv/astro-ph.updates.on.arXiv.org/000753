The nature and properties of dark matter (DM) are both outstanding issues in physics. Besides clustering
in halos, the universal character of gravity implies that self-gravitating compact DM configurations
might be spread throughout the universe. The astrophysical signature of these objects may be used
to probe fundamental particle physics, or even to provide an alternative description of compact
objects in active galactic nuclei. Here we discuss the most promising dissection tool of these configurations:
the inspiral of a compact stellar-size object and consequent gravitational-wave emission. The
inward motion of this "test probe" encodes unique information about the nature of the central, supermassive
DM configuration. When the probe travels through some compact DM profile we show that, within a Newtonian
approximation, the quasi-adiabatic evolution of the inspiral is mainly driven by DM accretion
into the small compact object and by dynamical friction, rather than by gravitational-wave radiation-reaction.
These effects circularize the orbits and leave a peculiar imprint on the gravitational waves emitted
at late time. When accretion dominates, the frequency and the amplitude of the gravitational-wave
signal produced during the latest stages of the inspiral are nearly constant. In the exterior region
we study a relativistic model in which the inspiral is driven by the emission of gravitational and
scalar waves. Resonances in the energy flux appear whenever the orbital frequency matches the mass
of the DM particle and they correspond to the excitation of the central object's quasinormal frequencies.
Unexpectedly, these resonances can lead to large dephasing with respect to standard inspiral templates,
to such an extent as to prevent detection with matched filtering techniques. We discuss some observational
consequences of these effects for gravitational-wave detection.
