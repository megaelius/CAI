For the study of nonlinear stability of a dynamical system, normalized Hamiltonian of the system
is very important to discuss the dynamics in the vicinity of invariant objects. In general, it represents
a nonlinear approximation to the dynamics, which is very helpful to obtain the information about
realistic solution of the problem. Present paper reflects about normalization of the Hamiltonian
and analysis of nonlinear stability in non-resonance case, in the Chermnykh-like problem under
the influence of perturbations in the form of radiation pressure, oblateness, and a disc. To describe
nonlinear stability, initially, quadratic part of the Hamiltonian is normalized in the neighborhood
of triangular equilibrium point and then higher order normalization is performed. Due to the presence
of perturbations and a tedious huge algebraic computation for intermediate terms, we have computed
only up to the fourth order normalized Hamiltonian using Lie transforms. In non-resonance case,
nonlinear stability of the system is discussed with the help of Arnold-Moser theorem. Again, the
effects of radiation pressure, oblateness and presence of the disc are analyzed, separately and
it is observed that in the absence as well as presence of perturbation parameters, triangular equilibrium
point is unstable in nonlinear sense within the stability range $0<\mu<\mu_1=\bar{\mu_c}$ due
to failure of Arnold-Moser theorem. However, perturbation parameters affect the values of $\mu$
at which $D_4=0$, significantly. This study may help to analyze more generalized cases of the problem
in the presence of some other types of perturbations such as P-R drag and solar wind drag. The results
are limited to the regular symmetric disc but in future it can be extended.
