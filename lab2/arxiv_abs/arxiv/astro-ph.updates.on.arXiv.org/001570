Based on high-resolution spectra obtained with PHOENIX at Gemini-South, CRIRES at VLT-UT1, and
ESPaDOnS at CFHT, we present new measurements of the radial and projected rotational velocities
of 219 low-mass stars. The target likely membership was initially established using the Bayesian
analysis tool recently presented in \citet{2013malo}, taking into account only the position,
proper motion and photometry of the stars to assess their membership probability. In the present
study, we include radial velocity as an additional input to our analysis, and in doing so we confirm
the high membership probability for 130 candidates: 27 in $\beta$ Pictoris, 22 in Tucana-Horologium,
25 in Columba, 7 in Carina, 18 in Argus and 18 in AB Doradus and 13 with an ambiguous membership. Our
analysis also confirms the membership of 57 stars proposed in the literature. A subsample of 16 candidates
was observed at three or more epochs, allowing us to discover 6 new spectroscopic binaries. The fraction
of binaries in our sample is 25%, consistent with values in the literature. Twenty percent of the
stars in our sample show projected rotational velocities (\vsini) higher than 30 \kms\ and therefore
are considered as fast rotators. A parallax and other youth indicators are still needed to fully
confirm the 130 highly probable candidates identified here as new {\it bona fide} members. Finally,
based on the X-ray emission of {\it bona fide} and highly probable group members, we show that for
low-mass stars in the 12-120 Myr age range, the X-ray luminosity is an excellent indicator of youth
and better than the more traditionally used R$_{\rm X}$ parameter, the ratio of X-ray to bolometric
luminosity.
