Context. NGC 40 is a planetary nebula with diffuse X-ray emission, suggesting an interaction of
the high speed wind from WC8 central star (CS) with the nebula. It shows strong Civ 1550 {\AA} emission
that cannot be explained by thermal processes alone. We present here the first map of this nebula
in C IV emission, using broad band filters on the UVIT. Aims. To map the hot C IV emitting gas and its
correspondence with soft X-ray (0.3-8 keV) emitting regions, in order to study the shock interaction
with the nebula and the ISM. This also illustrates the potential of UVIT for nebular studies. Methods.
Morphological study of images of the nebula obtained at an angular resolution of about 1.3" in four
UVIT filter bands that include C IV 1550 {\AA} and C II] 2326 {\AA} lines and UV continuum. Comparisons
with X-ray, optical, and IR images from literature. Results. The C II] 2326 {\AA} images show the
core of the nebula with two lobes on either side of CS similar to [N II]. The C IV emission in the core
shows similar morphology and extant as that of diffuse X-ray emission concentrated in nebular condensations.
A surprising UVIT discovery is the presence of a large faint FUV halo in FUV Filter with {\lambda}eff
of 1608 {\AA}. The UV halo is not present in any other UV filter. FUV halo is most likely due to UV fluorescence
emission from the Lyman bands of H2 molecules. Unlike the optical and IR halo, FUV halo trails predominantly
towards south-east side of the nebular core, opposite to the CS's proper motion direction. Conclusions.
Morphological similarity of C IV 1550 {\AA} and X-ray emission in the core suggests that it results
mostly from interaction of strong CS wind with the nebula. The FUV halo in NGC 40 highlights the existence
of H2 molecules extensively in the regions even beyond the optical and IR halos.
