We present results from simulations of core-collapse supernovae in FLASH using a newly-implemented
multidimensional neutrino transport scheme and a newly-implemented general relativistic (GR)
treatment of gravity. We use a two-moment method with an analytic closure (so-called M1 transport)
for the neutrino transport. This transport is multienergy, multispecies, velocity-dependent
and truly multidimensional, i.e., we do not assume the commonly used "ray-by-ray" approximation.
Our GR gravity is implemented in our Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations via an effective relativistic
potential (GREP) that closely reproduces the GR structure of neutron stars and has been shown to
match GR simulations of core collapse quite well. In axisymmetry, we simulate core-collapse supernovae
with four different progenitor models in both Newtonian and GR gravity. We find that the more compact
protoneutron star structure realized in simulations with GR gravity gives higher neutrino luminosities
and higher neutrino energies. These differences in turn give higher neutrino heating rates (upwards
of $\sim$20-30% over the corresponding Newtonian gravity simulations) that increase the efficacy
of the neutrino mechanism. Three of the four models successfully explode in the simulations assuming
GREP gravity. In our Newtonian gravity simulations, two of the four models explode, but at times
much later than observed in our GR gravity simulations. Our results, both in Newtonian and GR gravity,
compare well with several other studies in the literature. These results conclusively show that
the approximation of Newtonian gravity for simulating the core-collapse supernova central engine
is not acceptable. We also simulate four additional models in GR gravity to highlight the growing
disparity between parameterized 1D models of core-collapse supernovae and the current generation
of 2D models.
