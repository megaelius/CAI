We present the first fully relativistic study of gravitational radiation from bodies in circular
equatorial orbits around the massive black hole at the Galactic Center, Sgr A* and we assess the detectability
of various kinds of objects by the gravitational wave detector LISA. Our computations are based
on the theory of perturbations of the Kerr spacetime and take into account the Roche limit induced
by tidal forces in the Kerr metric. The signal-to-noise ratio in the LISA detector, as well as the
time spent in LISA band, are evaluated. We have implemented all the computational tools in an open-source
SageMath package, within the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit framework. We find that white dwarfs,
neutrons stars, stellar black holes, primordial black holes of mass larger than $10^{-4} M_\odot$,
main-sequence stars of mass lower than $\sim 2.5\, M_\odot$ and brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A* are
all detectable in one year of LISA data with a signal-to-noise ratio above 10 during at least $10^5$
years in the slow inspiral towards either the innermost stable circular orbit (compact objects)
or the Roche limit (main-sequence stars and brown dwarfs). The longest times in-band, of the order
of $10^6$ years, are achieved for primordial black holes of mass $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot$ down to $10^{-5}
M_\odot$, depending on the spin of Sgr A*, as well as for brown dwarfs, just followed by white dwarfs
and low mass main-sequence stars. The long time in-band of these objects makes Sgr A* a valuable target
for LISA. We also consider bodies on close circular orbits around the massive black hole in the nucleus
of the nearby galaxy M32 and find that, among them, compact objects and brown dwarfs stay for $10^3$
to $10^4$ years in LISA band with a 1-year signal-to-noise ratio above 10.
