We develop an evolutionary model of the long-period comet (LPC) population, starting from their
birthplace in a massive trans-Neptunian disk that was dispersed by migrating giant planets. Most
comets that remain bound to the Solar system are stored in the Oort cloud. Galactic tides and passing
stars make some of these bodies evolve into observable comets in the inner Solar system. Our approach
models each step in a full-fledged numerical framework. Subsequent analysis consists of applying
plausible fading models and computing the original orbits to compare with observations. Our results
match the observed semimajor axis distribution of LPCs when Whipple's power-law fading scheme
with an exponent $\kappa= 0.6^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ is adopted. The cumulative perihelion ($q$) distribution
is fit well by a linear increase plus a weak quadratic term. Beyond $q = 15$~au, however, the population
increases steeply and the isotropy of LPC orbital planes breaks. We find tentative evidence from
the perihelion distribution of LPCs that the returning comets are depleted in supervolatiles and
become active due to water ice sublimation for $q\leq 3$ au. Using an independent calibration of
the population of the initial disk, our predicted LPC flux is smaller than observations suggest
by a factor of $\simeq 2$. Current data only characterize comets from the outer Oort cloud (semimajor
axes $\gtrsim 10^4$~au). A true boost in understanding the Oort cloud's structure should result
from future surveys when they detect LPCs with perihelia beyond $15$~au. Our results provide observational
predictions of what can be expected from these new data.
