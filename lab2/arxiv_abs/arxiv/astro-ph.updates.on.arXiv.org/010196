We use the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation to trace the quenching history of galaxies in its 10 most
massive clusters. We use two criteria to identify moments when galaxies suffer significant changes
in their star formation activity: {\it i)} the instantaneous star formation rate (SFR) strongest
drop, $\Gamma_{\rm SFR}^{\rm SD}$, and {\it ii)} a "quenching" criterion based on a minimum threshold
for the specific SFR of $\lesssim$ 10$^{-11}\rm yr^{-1}$. We find that a large fraction of galaxies
($\gtrsim 60\%$) suffer their $\Gamma_{\rm SFR}^{\rm SD}$ outside the cluster's R$_{200}$. This
``pre-processed" population is dominated by galaxies that are either low mass and centrals or inhabit
low mass hosts ($10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot} \lesssim$ M$_{\rm host} \lesssim 10^{11.0}$M$_{\odot}$).
The host mass distribution is bimodal, and galaxies that suffered their $\Gamma_{\rm SFR}^{\rm
SD}$ in massive hosts ($10^{13.5}\rm M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{host} \lesssim 10^{14.0}M_{\odot}$)
are mainly processed within the clusters. Pre-processing mainly limits the total stellar mass
with which galaxies arrive in the clusters. Regarding quenching, galaxies preferentially reach
this state in high-mass halos ($10^{13.5}\rm M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{host} \lesssim 10^{14.5}M_{\odot}$).
The small fraction of galaxies that reach the cluster already quenched has also been pre-processed,
linking both criteria as different stages in the quenching process of those galaxies. For the $z=0$
satellite populations, we find a sharp rise in the fraction of quenched satellites at the time of
first infall, highlighting the role played by the dense cluster environment. Interestingly, the
fraction of pre-quenched galaxies rises with final cluster mass. This is a direct consequence of
the hierarchical cosmological model used in these simulations.
