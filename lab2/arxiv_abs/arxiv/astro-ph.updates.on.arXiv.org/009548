Context: KELT-9 b exemplifies a newly emerging class of short-period gaseous exoplanets that tend
to orbit hot, early type stars - termed ultra-hot Jupiters. The severe stellar irradiation heats
their atmospheres to temperatures of $\sim 4,000$ K, similar to the photospheres of dwarf stars.
Due to the absence of aerosols and complex molecular chemistry at such temperatures, these planets
offer the potential of detailed chemical characterisation through transit and day-side spectroscopy.
Studies of their chemical inventories may provide crucial constraints on their formation process
and evolution history. Aims: To search the optical transmission spectrum of KELT-9 b for absorption
lines by metals using the cross-correlation technique. Methods: We analyse 2 transits observed
with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We use an isothermal equilibrium chemistry model to predict the
transmission spectrum for each of the neutral and singly-ionized atoms with atomic numbers between
3 and 78. Of these, we identify the elements that are expected to have spectral lines in the visible
wavelength range and use those as cross-correlation templates. Results: We detect absorption
of Na I, Cr II, Sc II and Y II, and confirm previous detections of Mg I, Fe I, Fe II and Ti II. In addition,
we find evidence of Ca I, Cr I, Co I, and Sr II that will require further observations to verify. The
detected absorption lines are significantly deeper than model predictions, suggesting that material
is transported to higher altitudes where the density is enhanced compared to a hydrostatic profile.
There appears to be no significant blue-shift of the absorption spectrum due to a net day-to-night
side wind. In particular, the strong Fe II feature is shifted by $0.18 \pm 0.27$ km~s$^{-1}$, consistent
with zero. Using the orbital velocity of the planet we revise the steller and planetary masses and
radii.
