The next decade promises to revolutionise the study of the high redshift Universe: upcoming missions
such as JWST, EUCLID and ATHENA will greatly advance our understanding of the early stages of galaxy
formation. We use an updated model for the evolution of masses and spins of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs), coupled to the latest version of the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation GALFORM
using the Planck cosmology, and a new high resolution Millennium style dark matter simulation to
make predictions for multiwavelength Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) luminosity functions in the
redshift range $0 < z < 15$. We compare the model to the observed black hole mass function and the SMBH
versus galaxy bulge stellar mass relation at $z=0$, and to the predicted bolometric, hard X-ray,
soft X-ray and optical AGN luminosity functions to observations at $z < 6$, and find that the model
is in good agreement with the observations. We employ this successful model to make predictions
for the AGN luminosity function at $z > 6$ in the broadband filters of JWST, EUCLID and ATHENA. We predict
that these three surveys will select three somewhat different samples of SMBHs, with EUCLID unveiling
the more massive, high accretion rate SMBHs, JWST the less massive, lower accretion rate SMBHs and
ATHENA covering objects inbetween. Overall, typical detected SMBHs will have masses, $M_{\mathrm{BH}}
\sim 10^{6-7} M_{\odot}$, with dimensionless mass accretion rates, $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}
\sim 1-10$, in host galaxies of stellar mass, $M_{\star} \sim 10^{8-9} M_{\odot}$. The future comparison
of these predictions to observations will provide insights into our understanding of SMBHs in galaxy
formation.
