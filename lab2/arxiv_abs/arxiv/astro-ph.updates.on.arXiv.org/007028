We compare multi-epoch sub-arcsecond VLA imaging of the 22 GHz water masers toward the massive protocluster
NGC6334I observed before and after the recent outburst of MM1B in (sub)millimeter continuum. Since
the outburst, the water maser emission toward MM1 has substantially weakened. Simultaneously,
the strong water masers associated with the synchrotron continuum point source CM2 have flared
by a mean factor of 6.5 (to 4.2 kJy) with highly-blueshifted features (up to 70 km/s from LSR) becoming
more prominent. The strongest flaring water masers reside 3000 au north of MM1B and form a remarkable
bow shock pattern whose vertex coincides with CM2 and tail points back to MM1B. Excited OH masers
trace a secondary bow shock located ~120 au downstream. ALMA images of CS (6-5) reveal a highly-collimated
north-south structure encompassing the flaring masers to the north and the non-flaring masers
to the south seen in projection toward the MM3-UCHII region. Proper motions of the southern water
masers over 5.3 years indicate a bulk projected motion of 117 km/s southward from MM1B with a dynamical
time of 170 yr. We conclude that CM2, the water masers, and many of the excited OH masers trace the interaction
of the high velocity bipolar outflow from MM1B with ambient molecular gas. The previously-excavated
outflow cavity has apparently allowed the radiative energy of the current outburst to propagate
freely until terminating at the northern bow shock where it strengthened the masers. Additionally,
water masers have been detected toward MM7 for the first time, and a highly-collimated CS (6-5) outflow
has been detected toward MM4.
