Heavily obscured, Compton Thick (CT, NH>10^24 cm-2) AGN may represent an important phase in
AGN/galaxy co-evolution and are expected to provide a significant contribution to the cosmic X-ray
background (CXB) at its peak. Through direct X-ray spectra analysis, we selected 39 heavily obscured
AGN (NH>3x10^23 cm-2) in the 2 deg^2 XMM-COSMOS survey. Thanks to deeper Chandra data available
in the field, we can define 10 of these sources as bona-fide CT, spanning a large range of redshift
and luminosity, and estimate the efficiency of our selection to be of the order of 80%. We collected
the multi-wavelength information available for these sources, to study the distribution of BH
mass (MBH), Eddington ratio (lambda_Edd), stellar mass (M*), specific star formation rate (sSFR)
in comparison with a sample of unobscured AGN. We find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantly
smaller MBH and higher lambda_Edd with respect to unobscured sources. The sSFR of highly obscured
sources is consistent with the one observed for main sequence star forming galaxies, at all redshift.
We also present and briefly discuss optical spectra, broad band spectral energy distribution (SED)
and morphology for the sample of 10 CT AGN. Both the optical spectra and SED agree with the classification
as highly obscured sources: all the available optical spectra are dominated by the stellar component
of the host galaxy, and an highly obscured torus component is needed in the SED of all the CT sources.
Exploiting the high resolution Hubble images, we show that these highly obscured sources have a
significantly larger merger fraction with respect to other X-ray selected samples of AGN. Finally
we discuss the implications of our findings in the context of AGN/galaxy co-evolutionary models,
and compare our results with the predictions of CXB synthesis models.
