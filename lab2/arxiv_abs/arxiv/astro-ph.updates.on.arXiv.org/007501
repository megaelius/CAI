Transit spectroscopy of habitable planets orbiting late-type stars requires high relative spectro-photometric
accuracy between wavelengths during transit/eclipse observation. The spectro-photometric
signal is not affected only by image movement and deformation due to wavefront error but also by electrical
variation in the detector system. These time-variation components, coupled to the transit signal,
distort the measurements of atmospheric composition in transit spectroscopy. Here we propose
a new concept for improvement of spectro-photometric accuracy through the calibration of the time-variation
components in the detector system by developing densified pupil spectroscopy that provides multiple
spectra of the star-planet system. Owing to a group of pixels exposed by the object light (i.e., science
pixels), pixel-to-pixel variations can be smoothed out through an averaging operation, thus only
common time-variation components over the science pixels remain. In addition, considering that
the detector plane is optically conjugated to the pupil plane, a pupil mask can completely block
astronomical light incoming into residual pixels. The common time-variation components are reconstructed
with the residual pixels and reduced into a random term. Applying the densified pupil spectrograph
with a mid-infrared detector system to a large space cryogenic telescope such as the Origins Space
Telescope, we show that the system nearly achieves photon-noise-limited performance and detects
absorption features through transmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse of terrestrial
planets orbiting M-type stars at 10 pc with 60 transit observations. Thus, the proposed method contributes
to the measurement of planetary habitability and biosignatures of the nearby transiting habitable
candidates.
