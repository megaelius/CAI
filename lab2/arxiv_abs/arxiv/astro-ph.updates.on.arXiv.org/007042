We present models of the H$\beta$-emitting broad-line region (BLR) in seven Seyfert 1 galaxies
from the Lick AGN (Active Galactic Nucleus) Monitoring Project 2011 sample, drawing inferences
on the BLR structure and dynamics as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole. We find
that the BLR is generally a thick disk, viewed close to face-on, with preferential emission back
toward the ionizing source. The dynamics in our sample range from near-circular elliptical orbits
to inflowing or outflowing trajectories. We measure black hole masses of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)
= 6.48^{+0.21}_{-0.18}$ for PG 1310$-$108, $7.50^{+0.25}_{-0.18}$ for Mrk 50, $7.46^{+0.15}_{-0.21}$
for Mrk 141, $7.58^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ for Mrk 279, $7.11^{+0.20}_{-0.17}$ for Mrk 1511, $6.65^{+0.27}_{-0.15}$
for NGC 4593, and $6.94^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ for Zw 229$-$015. We use these black hole mass measurements
along with cross-correlation time lags and line widths to recover the scale factor $f$ used in traditional
reverberation mapping measurements. Combining our results with other studies that use this modeling
technique, bringing our sample size to 16, we calculate a scale factor that can be used for measuring
black hole masses in other reverberation mapping campaigns. When using the root-mean-square (rms)
spectrum and using the line dispersion to measure the line width, we find $\log_{10}(f_{{\rm rms},\sigma})_{\rm
pred} = 0.57 \pm 0.19$. Finally, we search for correlations between $f$ and other AGN and BLR parameters
and find marginal evidence that $f$ is correlated with $M_{\rm BH}$ and the BLR inclination angle,
but no significant evidence of a correlation with the AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio.
