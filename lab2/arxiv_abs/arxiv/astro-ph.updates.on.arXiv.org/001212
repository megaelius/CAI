For many decades, ultrahigh energy charged particles of unknown origin that can be observed from
the ground have been a puzzle for particle physicists and astrophysicists. As an attempt to discriminate
among several possible production scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy
of the directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they are supposed to point
toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the observations are so rare that testing the
distribution of such samples of directional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose
a nonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative distributions and allows
in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected forms of anisotropy. We explore two particular
procedures. Both are derived from fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions
of densities. We use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594 (electronic)],
the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale indices no larger than some ${J^{\star}}$,
and the $L^p$ distances between those estimates and the null density are computed. One family of
tests (called Multiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each choice
of $J=1,\ldots,{J^{\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is based on the single full
${J^{\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet coefficients. We describe the practical
implementation of these two procedures and compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives
to isotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic nonisotropic models based
on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo study shows good performance of the Multiple
test, even at moderate sample size, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different
choices of the parameter ${J^{\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the Pierre
Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical evidence for anisotropy.
Using several values for the parameters of the methods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%,
but with uncontrolled multiplicity issues. The flexibility of this method and the possibility
to modify it to take into account a large variety of extensions of the problem make it an interesting
option for future investigation of the origin of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.
