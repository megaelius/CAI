We utilize multi-epoch MUSE spectroscopy to study binaries in the core of NGC 3201. Our sample consists
of 3553 stars with 54883 spectra in total comprising 3200 main-sequence stars up to 4 magnitudes
below the turn-off. Each star in our sample has between 3 and 63 (with a median of 14) reliable radial
velocity (RV) measurements within five years of observations. We introduce a statistical method
to determine the probability of a star showing RV variations based on the whole inhomogeneous RV
sample. Using HST photometry and an advanced dynamical MOCCA simulation of this specific GC we overcome
observational biases that previous spectroscopic studies had to deal with. This allows us to infer
a binary frequency in the MUSE FoV and enables us to deduce the underlying true binary frequency of
(6.75+-0.72) % in NGC 3201. The comparison of the MUSE observations with the MOCCA simulation suggests
a significant fraction of primordial binaries. We can also confirm a radial increase of the binary
fraction towards the GC centre due to mass segregation. We discovered that in our sample at least
(57.5+-7.9) % of blue straggler stars (BSS) are in a binary system. For the first time in a study of
GCs, we were able to fit Keplerian orbits to a significant sample of 95 binaries. We present the binary
system properties of eleven BSS and show evidence that two BSS formation scenarios, the mass transfer
in binary (or triple) star systems and the coalescence due to binary-binary interactions, are present
in our data. We also describe the binary and spectroscopic properties of four sub-subgiant (or red
straggler) stars. Furthermore, we discovered two new black hole (BH) candidates with minimum masses
(Msini) of (7.68+-0.50) M_sun, (4.4+-2.8) M_sun, and refine the minimum mass estimate on the already
published BH to (4.53+-0.21) M_sun. These BHs are consistent with an extensive BH subsystem hosted
by NGC 3201.
