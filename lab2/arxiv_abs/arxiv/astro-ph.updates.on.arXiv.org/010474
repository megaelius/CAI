Ancient hydrology is recorded by sedimentary rocks on Mars. The most voluminous sedimentary rocks
that formed during Mars' Hesperian period are sulfate-rich rocks, explored by the $Opportunity$
rover from 2004-2012 and soon to be investigated by the $Curiosity$ rover at Gale crater. A leading
hypothesis for the origin of these sulfates is that the cations were derived from evaporation of
deep-sourced groundwater, as part of a global circulation of groundwater. Global groundwater
circulation would imply sustained warm Earthlike conditions on Early Mars. Global circulation
of groundwater including infiltration of water initially in equilibrium with Mars' CO$_2$ atmosphere
implies subsurface formation of carbonate. We find that the CO$_2$ sequestration implied by the
global groundwater hypothesis for the origin of sulfate-rich rocks on Mars is 30-5000 bars if the
$Opportunity$ data are representative of Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks, which is so large that
(even accounting for volcanic outgassing) it would bury the atmosphere. This disfavors the hypothesis
that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from upwelling of deep sourced groundwater.
If, instead, Hesperian sulfate-rich rocks are approximated as pure Mg-sulfate (no Fe), then the
CO$_2$ sequestration is 0.3-400 bars. The low end of this range is consistent with the hypothesis
that the cations for Mars' Hesperian sulfates were derived from upwelling of deep sourced groundwater.
In both cases, carbon sequestration by global groundwater circulation actively works to terminate
surface habitability, rather than being a passive marker of warm Earthlike conditions. $Curiosity$
will soon be in a position to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Our work links Mars sulfate
cation composition, carbon isotopes, and climate change.
