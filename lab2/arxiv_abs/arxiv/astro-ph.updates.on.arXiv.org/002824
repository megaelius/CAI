We observed the Hubble Deep Field South with the new panoramic integral field spectrograph MUSE
that we built and just commissioned at the VLT. The data cube resulting from 27 hours of integration
covers one arcmin^2 field of view at an unprecedented depth with a 1 sigma emission line surface brightness
limit of 1x$10^{-19}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$ and contains ~90,000 spectra. We present the combined
and calibrated data cube, and we perform a first-pass analysis of the sources detected in the HDF-S
imaging. We measured the redshifts of 189 sources up to a magnitude F814W = 29.5, increasing by more
than an order of magnitude the number of known spectroscopic redshifts in this field. We also discovered
26 Lya emitting galaxies which are not detected in the HST WFPC2 deep broad band images. The intermediate
spectral resolution of 2.3{\AA} allows us to separate resolved asymmetric Lya emitters, [O II]
emitters, and C III] emitters and the large instantaneous wavelength range of 4500{\AA} helps to
identify single emission lines. We also show how the three dimensional information of MUSE helps
to resolve sources which are confused at ground-based image quality. Overall, secure identifications
are provided for 83% of the 227 emission line sources detected in the MUSE data cube and for 32% of the
586 sources identified in the HST catalog of Casertano et al 2000. The overall redshift distribution
is fairly flat to z=6.3, with a reduction between z=1.5 to 2.9, in the well-known redshift desert.
The field of view of MUSE also allowed us to detect 17 groups within the field. We checked that the number
counts of [O II] and Ly-a emitters are roughly consistent with predictions from the literature.
Using two examples we demonstrate that MUSE is able to provide exquisite spatially resolved spectroscopic
information on intermediate redshift galaxies present in the field.
