[Abridged version] A huge theoretical and experimental effort is being made by cosmologists and
particle physicists to gain insight of the mechanism of generation of the primordial cosmological
fluctuations, which remains still largely unknown. The bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) has been recognised as a powerful probe of this mechanism, as it is sensitive to the non-Gaussian
features in the seed fluctuations. To access this information, however, it is crucial to model the
non-linear evolution of the CMB between the formation of the initial fluctuations and its observation,
which results in the emergence of an intrinsic bispectrum. In this thesis we quantify the intrinsic
bispectrum and compute the bias it induces on the primordial signal. To do so, we develop $\text{SONG}$,
an efficient code for solving the second-order Einstein-Boltzmann equations, and use it to estimate
the CMB non-Gaussianity arising from the non-linear evolution of density perturbations. The full
calculation involves contributions from recombination and less tractable ones from terms integrated
along the line of sight. We investigate the bias that the intrinsic bispectrum implies for searches
of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that the inclusion or omission of certain line of sight terms
can make a large impact. When including all physical effects but lensing and time-delay, we find
that the contamination from the intrinsic bispectrum leads to a small bias in the estimates of non-Gaussianity,
which is good news for the prospect of using CMB data to probe primordial non-Gaussianity. The intrinsic
non-Gaussianity can be searched for directly, using the predicted signal as a template; our calculations
suggest this signal is just beyond what is possible with the Planck CMB survey, with a signal-to-noise
rising to unity only for an angular resolution of $\ell_\text{max}=3000$.
