Exocomets scattered by planets have been invoked to explain observations in multiple contexts,
including the frequently found near- and mid-infrared excess around nearby stars arising from
exozodiacal dust. Here we investigate how the process of inward scattering of comets originating
in an outer belt, is affected by the architecture of a planetary system, to determine whether this
could lead to observable exozodi levels or deliver volatiles to inner planets. Using N-body simulations,
we model systems with different planet mass and orbital spacing distributions in the 1-50 AU region.
We find that tightly packed ($\Delta a_\mathrm{p}<20 R_\mathrm{Hill,m}$) low mass planets are
the most efficient at delivering material to exozodi regions (5-7% of scattered exocomets end up
within 0.5 AU at some point), although the exozodi levels do not vary by more than a factor of ~7 for
the architectures studied here. We suggest that emission from scattered dusty material in between
the planets could provide a potential test for this delivery mechanism. We show that the surface
density of scattered material can vary by two orders of magnitude (being highest for systems of low
mass planets with medium spacing), whilst the exozodi delivery rate stays roughly constant, and
that future instruments such as JWST could detect it. In fact for $\eta$ Corvi, the current Herschel
upper limit rules out the scattering scenario by a chain of $\lesssim$30 M$_\oplus$ planets. Finally,
we show that exocomets could be efficient at delivering cometary material to inner planets (0.1-1%
of scattered comets are accreted per inner planet). Overall, the best systems at delivering comets
to inner planets are the ones that have low mass outer planets and medium spacing ($\sim20 R_\mathrm{Hill,m}$).
