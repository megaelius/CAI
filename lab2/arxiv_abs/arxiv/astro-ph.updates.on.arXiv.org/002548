Seyfert and LINER galaxies are known to exhibit compact radio emission on $\sim$ 10 to 100 parsec
scales, but larger Kiloparsec-Scale Radio structures (KSRs) often remain undetected in sub-arcsec
high resolution observations. We investigate the prevalence and nature of KSRs in Seyfert and LINER
galaxies using the 1.4 GHz VLA FIRST and NVSS observations. Our sample consists of 2651 sources detected
in FIRST and of these 1737 sources also have NVSS counterparts. Considering the ratio of total to
peak flux density ($\theta$ $=$ ${\rm (S_{\rm int}/S_{\rm peak})^{1/2}}$) as a parameter to infer
the presence of extended radio emission we show that $\geq$ 30$\%$ of FIRST detected sources possess
extended radio structures on scales larger than 1.0 kpc. The use of low-resolution NVSS observations
help us to recover faint extended KSRs that are resolved out in FIRST observations and results in
$\geq$ 42.5$\%$ KSR sources in FIRST-NVSS subsample. This fraction is only a lower limit owing to
the combination of projection, resolution and sensitivity effects. Our study demonstrates that
KSRs may be more common than previously thought and are found across all redshifts, luminosities
and radio-loudness. The extranuclear radio luminosity of KSR sources is found to be positively
correlated with the core radio luminosity as well as the [O~III] $\lambda$5007{\AA} line luminosity
and this can be interpreted as KSRs being powered by AGN rather than star-formation. The distributions
of the FIR-to-radio ratios and mid-IR colors of KSR sources are also consistent with their AGN origin.
However, contribution from star-formation cannot be ruled out particularly in sources with low
radio luminosities.
