Context. The benchmark open cluster M67 is known to have solar metallicity and similar age as the
Sun. It thus provides us a great opportunity to study the properties of solar twins, as well as the
evolution of Sun-like stars. Aims. Previous spectroscopic studies reported to detect possible
subtle changes in stellar surface abundances throughout the stellar evolutionary phase, namely
the effect of atomic diffusion, in M67. In this study we attempt to confirm and quantify more precisely
the effect of atomic diffusion, as well as to explore the level of chemical (in)homogeneity in M67.
Methods. We presented a strictly line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of two
groups of stars in M67: three turn-off stars and three sub-giants. Stellar atmospheric parameters
and elemental abundances were obtained with very high precision using the Keck/HIRES spectra.
Results. The sub-giants in our sample show negligible abundance variations ($\le$ 0.02 dex), which
implies that M67 was born chemically homogeneous. We note there is a significant abundance difference
($\sim$ 0.1 - 0.2 dex) between sub-giants and turn-off stars, which can be interpreted as the signature
of atomic diffusion. Qualitatively stellar models with diffusion agree with the observed abundance
results. Some turn-off stars do not follow the general pattern, which suggests that in some cases
diffusion can be inhibited, or they might suffered some sort of mixing event related to planets.
Conclusions. Our results pose additional challenges for chemical tagging when using turn-off
stars. In particular, the effects of atomic diffusion, which could be as large as 0.1 - 0.2 dex, must
be taken into account in order for chemical tagging to be successfully applied.
