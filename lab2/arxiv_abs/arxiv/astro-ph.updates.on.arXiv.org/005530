Cold stellar streams---produced by tidal disruptions of clusters---are long-lived, coherent
dynamical features in the halo of the Milky Way. Due to their different ages and different positions
in phase space, different streams tell us different things about the Galaxy. Here we employ a Cramer--Rao
(CRLB) or Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in eleven
known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D, PS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum).
This approach depends on a generative model, which we have developed previously, and which permits
calculation of derivatives of predicted stream properties with respect to Galaxy and stream parameters.
We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on eccentric orbits contain the most
information about the halo shape. For each stream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo
properties and parameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous fitting
of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level. At this precision, simulated
dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic parametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis
functions to give the gravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information
about the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current position of the stream.
In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream appears to measure the local acceleration at
its current position; this motivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB
formalism also permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar velocities, distances,
and proper motions. We show that kinematic measurements of stream stars are essential for producing
competitive constraints on the distribution of dark matter, which bodes well for stream studies
in the age of Gaia.
