Recently, the gravitational instability (GI) model of giant planet and brown dwarf formation has
been revisited and recast into what is often referred to as the "tidal downsizing" hypothesis. The
fragmentation of self-gravitating protostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with
masses of a few to tens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by grain sedimentation
inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central star and tidal disruption of the embryo's
upper layers. The properties of the resultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon
which each process occurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce
objects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets and brown dwarfs.
Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what proportions of the observed population
they would represent, requires a more involved statistical analysis. We present a simple population
synthesis model of star and planet formation via GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic
model of protostellar disc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo
mass, grain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While there are key
pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first step towards a mature statistical
model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of star and planet formation. We show results from four runs
of the population synthesis model, varying the opacity law and the strength of migration, as well
as investigating the effect of disc truncation during the fragmentation process. Our early results
suggest that GI plus tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation, but remains
an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and low mass stars at large semimajor
axes. (Abridged)
