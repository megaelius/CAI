Cosmological inflation predicts that the scalar spectral index "runs" with scale. Constraints
on the values of the spectral runnings, $\alpha_s\equiv \textrm{d} n_s/\textrm{d}\ln k$ and $\beta_s\equiv
\textrm{d}\alpha_s/\textrm{d}\ln k$, therefore provide a fundamental test of the physics of
inflation. Here we study the feasibility of measuring the runnings when information from upcoming
large-volume galaxy surveys is used to supplement the information provided by a CMB-S4 experiment,
particularly focusing on the effect of including high-$k$, nonlinear scales. Since these measurements
will be sensitive to modeling uncertainties for the nonlinear power spectrum, we examine how three
different ways of parameterizing those systematics---introducing zero, two, or several hundred
nuisance parameters---affect constraints and protect against parameter biases. Considering
statistical errors alone, we find that including strongly nonlinear scales can substantially
tighten constraints. However, these constraints weaken to levels not much better than those from
a CMB-S4 experiment alone when we limit our analysis to scales where estimates are not strongly affected
by systematic biases. Given these considerations, near-future large-scale structure surveys
are unlikely to add much information to the CMB-S4 measurement of the first running $\alpha_s$.
There is more potential for improvement for the second running, $\beta_s$, for which large-scale
structure information will allow constraints to be improved by a factor of 3--4 relative to using
the CMB alone. Though these constraints are still above the value predicted by slow roll inflation,
they do probe regions of parameter space relevant to nonstandard inflationary models with large
runnings, for example those that can generate an appreciable abundance of primordial black holes.
