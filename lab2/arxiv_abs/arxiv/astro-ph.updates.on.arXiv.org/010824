In our earlier Paper I, we showed that the accretion disc radius of the dwarf nova HT Cas in its quiescent
state has not changed significantly during many years of observations, remaining consistently
large, close to the tidal truncation radius. This result is not consistent with the modern understanding
of the evolution of the disc radius through an outburst cycle. Spectroscopic observations of HT
Cas during its superoutburst offered us an exceptional opportunity to compare the properties of
the disc of this object in superoutburst and in quiescence. We obtained a new set of time-resolved
spectra of HT Cas in the middle of its 2017 superoutburst. We used Doppler tomography to map emission
structures in the system, which we compared with those detected during the quiescent state. The
superoutburst spectrum is similar in appearance to the quiescent spectra, although the strength
of most of the emission lines decreased. Most of the line profiles are complex with a mix of absorption
and emission components. H$\alpha$ in superoutburst was much narrower than in quiescence, whereas
the profiles of other Balmer and HeI lines did not change significantly. Doppler maps of the Balmer
and He I lines are dominated by a bright emission arc in the right side of the tomograms, superposed
on a diffuse ring of emission. The location of the leading arc on the H$\beta$, He I, and Si II maps is
consistent with Keplerian velocities at the tidal truncation radius. However, the bulk of the H$\alpha$
emission has significantly lower velocities. We show that the accretion disc radius of HT Cas during
its superoutburst has remained the same size as it was in quiescence. Instead, we detected cool gas
beyond the accretor's Roche-lobe, possibly expelled from the hot disc during the superoutburst.
