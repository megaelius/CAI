We probe the high-ionization circumgalactic medium by examining absorber kinematics, absorber-galaxy
kinematics, and average absorption profiles of 31 OVI absorbers from the "Multiphase Galaxy Halos"
Survey as a function of halo mass, redshift, inclination, and azimuthal angle. The galaxies are
isolated at $0.12<z_{\rm gal}<0.66$ and are probed by a background quasar within $D\approx 200$
kpc. Each absorber-galaxy pair has Hubble Space Telescope images and COS quasar spectra, and most
galaxy redshifts have been accurately measured from Keck/ESI spectra. Using the pixel-velocity
two-point correlation function (TPCF) method, we find that OVI absorber kinematics have a strong
halo mass dependence. Absorbers hosted by $\sim L^{\ast}$ galaxies have the largest velocity dispersions,
which we interpret to be that the halo virial temperature closely matches the temperature at which
the collisionally ionized OVI fraction peaks. Lower mass galaxies and group environments have
smaller velocity dispersions. Total column densities follow the same behavior, consistent with
theoretical findings. After normalizing out the observed mass dependence, we studied absorber-galaxy
kinematics with a modified TPCF and found non-virialized motions due to outflowing gas. Edge-on
minor axis gas has large optical depths concentrated near the galaxy systemic velocity as expected
for bipolar outflows, while face-on minor axis gas has a smoothly decreasing optical depth distribution
out to large normalized absorber-galaxy velocities, suggestive of decelerating outflowing gas.
Accreting gas signatures are not observed due to "kinematic blurring" in which multiple line-of-sight
structures are observed. These results indicate that galaxy mass dominates OVI properties over
baryon cycle processes.
