We investigate infrared dynamics of four-dimensional Einstein gravity in de Sitter space. We set
up a general framework to investigate dynamical scaling relations in quantum/classical gravitational
theories. The conformal mode dependence of Einstein gravity is renormalized to the extent that
general covariance is not manifest. We point out that the introduction of an inflaton is necessary
as a counterterm. We observe and postulate a duality between quantum effects in Einstein gravity
and classical evolutions in an inflation (or quintessence) model. The effective action of Einstein
gravity can be constructed as an inflation model with manifest general covariance. We show that
$g=G_N H^2/\pi$: the only dimensionless coupling of the Hubble parameter $H^2$ and the Newton's
coupling $G_N$ in Einstein gravity is screened by the infrared fluctuations of the conformal mode.
We evaluate the one-loop $\beta$ function of $g$ with respect to the cosmic time $\log Ht$ as $\beta(g)=-(1/2)g^2$,
i.e., $g$ is asymptotically free toward the future. The exact $\beta$ function with the backreaction
of $g$ reveals the existence of the ultraviolet fixed point. It indicates that the de Sitter expansion
stared at the Planck scale with a minimal entropy $S=2$. We have identified the de Sitter entropy
$1/g$ with the von Neumann entropy of the conformal zero mode. The former evolves according to the
screening of $g$ and the Gibbons-Hawking formula. The latter is found to increase by diffusion in
the stochastic process at the horizon in a consistent way. Our Universe is located very close to the
fixed point $g=0$ with a large entropy. We discuss possible physical implications of our results
such as logarithmic decay of dark energy.
