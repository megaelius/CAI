The Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) region hosts satellites for navigation, communication, and geodetic/space
environmental science, among which are the Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS). Safe
and efficient removal of debris from MEO is problematic due to the high cost for maneuvers needed
to directly reach the Earth (reentry orbits) and the relatively crowded GNSS neighborhood (graveyard
orbits). Recent studies have highlighted the complicated secular dynamics in the MEO region, but
also the possibility of exploiting these dynamics, for designing removal strategies. In this paper,
we present our numerical exploration of the long-term dynamics in MEO, performed with the purpose
of unveiling the set of reentry and graveyard solutions that could be reached with maneuvers of reasonable
DV cost. We simulated the dynamics over 120-200 years for an extended grid of millions of fictitious
MEO satellites that covered all inclinations from 0 to 90deg, using non-averaged equations of motion
and a suitable dynamical model that accounted for the principal geopotential terms, 3rd-body perturbations
and solar radiation pressure (SRP). We found a sizeable set of usable solutions with reentry times
that exceed ~40years, mainly around three specific inclination values: 46deg, 56deg, and 68deg;
a result compatible with our understanding of MEO secular dynamics. For DV <= 300 m/s (i.e., achieved
if you start from a typical GNSS orbit and target a disposal orbit with e<0.3), reentry times from
GNSS altitudes exceed ~70 years, while low-cost (DV ~= 5-35 m/s) graveyard orbits, stable for at
lest 200 years, are found for eccentricities up to e~0.018. This investigation was carried out in
the framework of the EC-funded "ReDSHIFT" project.
