UV radiation can induce photochemical processes in exoplanet atmospheres and produce haze particles.
Recent observations suggest that haze and/or cloud layers could be present in the upper atmospheres
of exoplanets. Haze particles play an important role in planetary atmospheres and may provide a
source of organic material to the surface which may impact the origin or evolution of life. However,
very little information is known about photochemical processes in cool, high-metallicity exoplanetary
atmospheres. Previously, we investigated haze formation and particle size distribution in laboratory
atmosphere simulation experiments using AC plasma as the energy source. Here, we use UV photons
to initiate the chemistry rather than the AC plasma, since photochemistry driven by UV radiation
is important for understanding exoplanet atmospheres. We present photochemical haze formation
in current UV experiments, we investigated a range of atmospheric metallicities (100x, 1000x,
and 10000x solar metallicity) at three temperatures (300 K, 400 K, and 600 K). We find that photochemical
hazes are generated in all simulated atmospheres with temperature-dependent production rates:
the particles produced in each metallicity group decrease as the temperature increases. The images
taken with atomic force microscopy show the particle size (15-190 nm) varies with temperature and
metallicity. Our laboratory experimental results provide new insight into the formation and properties
of photochemical haze, which could guide exoplanet atmosphere modeling and help to analyze and
interpret current and future observations of exoplanets.
