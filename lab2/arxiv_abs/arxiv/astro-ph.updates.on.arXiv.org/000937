Recent observations of a large number of DA and DB white dwarfs show evidence of debris disks, which
are the remnants of old planetary systems. The infrared excess detected with \emph{Spitzer} and
the lines of heavy elements observed in their atmospheres with high-resolution spectroscopy converge
on the idea that planetary material accretes onto these stars. Accretion rates have been derived
by several authors with the assumption of a steady state between accretion and gravitational settling.
The results are unrealistically different for DA and DB white dwarfs. When heavy matter is accreted
onto stars, it induces an inverse $\mu$-gradient that leads to fingering (thermohaline) convection.
The aim of this letter is to study the impact of this specific process on the derived accretion rates
in white dwarfs and on the difference between DA and DB. We solve the diffusion equation for the accreted
heavy elements with a time-dependent method. The models we use have been obtained both with the IRAP
code, which computes static models, and the La Plata code, which computes evolutionary sequences.
Computations with pure gravitational settling are compared with computations that include fingering
convection. The most important result is that fingering convection has very important effects
on DAs but is inefficient in DBs. When only gravitational settling is taken into account, the time-dependent
computations lead to a steady state, as postulated by previous authors. When fingering convection
is added, this steady state occurs much later. The surprising difference found in the past for the
accretion rates derived for DA and DB white dwarfs disappears. The derived accretion rates for DAs
are increased when fingering convection is taken into account, whereas those for DBs are not modified.
More precise and developed results will be given in a forthcoming paper.
