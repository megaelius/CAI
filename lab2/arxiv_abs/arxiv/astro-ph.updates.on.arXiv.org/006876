We present comprehensive models of Herbig Ae star, HD 142666, which aim to simultaneously explain
its spectral energy distribution (SED) and near-infrared (NIR) interferometry. Our new sub-milliarcsecond
resolution CHARA (CLASSIC and CLIMB) interferometric observations, supplemented with archival
shorter baseline data from VLTI/PIONIER and the Keck Interferometer, are modeled using centro-symmetric
geometric models and an axisymmetric radiative transfer code. CHARA's 330 m baselines enable us
to place strong constraints on the viewing geometry, revealing a disk inclined at 58 degrees from
face-on with a 160 degree major axis position angle. Disk models imposing vertical hydrostatic
equilibrium provide poor fits to the SED. Models accounting for disk scale height inflation, possibly
induced by turbulence associated with magneto-rotational instabilities, and invoking grain
growth to >1 micron size in the disk rim are required to simultaneously reproduce the SED and measured
visibility profile. However, visibility residuals for our best model fits to the SED indicate the
presence of unexplained NIR emission, particularly along the apparent disk minor axis, while closure
phase residuals indicate a more centro-symmetric emitting region. In addition, our inferred 58
degree disk inclination is inconsistent with a disk-based origin for the UX Ori-type variability
exhibited by HD 142666. Additional complexity, unaccounted for in our models, is clearly present
in the NIR-emitting region. We propose the disk is likely inclined toward a more edge-on orientation
and/or an optically thick outflow component also contributes to the NIR circumstellar flux.
