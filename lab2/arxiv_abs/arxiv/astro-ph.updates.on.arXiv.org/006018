As the complexity and volume of datasets have increased along with the capabilities of modular,
open-source, easy-to-implement, visualization tools, scientists' need for, and appreciation
of, data visualization has risen too. Until recently, scientists thought of the "explanatory"
graphics created at a research project's conclusion as "pretty pictures" needed only for journal
publication or public outreach. The plots and displays produced during a research project - often
intended only for experts - were thought of as a separate category, what we here call "exploratory"
visualization. In this view, discovery comes from exploratory visualization, and explanatory
visualization is just for communication. Our aim in this paper is to spark conversation amongst
scientists, computer scientists, outreach professionals, educators, and graphics and perception
experts about how to foster flexible data visualization practices that can facilitate discovery
and communication at the same time. We present an example of a new finding made using the glue visualization
environment to demonstrate how the border between explanatory and exploratory visualization
is easily traversed. The linked-view principles as well as the actual code in glue are easily adapted
to astronomy, medicine, and geographical information science - all fields where combining, visualizing,
and analyzing several high-dimensional datasets yields insight. Whether or not scientists can
use such a flexible "undisciplined" environment to its fullest potential without special training
remains to be seen. We conclude with suggestions for improving the training of scientists in visualization
practices, and of computer scientists in the iterative, non-workflow-like, ways in which modern
science is carried out.
