Recent observational findings have suggested a positive correlation between the occurrence rates
of inner super-Earths and outer giant planets. These results raise the question if the trend can
be reproduced and explained by planet formation theory. Here, we investigate the properties of
inner super-Earths and outer giant planets that form according to the core accretion picture. The
aim of this research was to study mutual relations between these planet species in synthetic planet
populations and to compare them to the observed exoplanet population. We invoke the Generation
3 Bern model of planet formation and evolution to simulate 1000 multi-planet systems. We then confront
these synthetic systems with the observed sample, taking into account the detection bias that distorts
the observed demographics. The formation of warm super-Earths and cold Jupiters in the same system
is enhanced compared to the individual appearances, albeit weaker than proposed by observations.
We attribute the discrepancy to dynamically active giant planets, which frequently disrupt inner
super-Earth systems in the synthetic population. This result could be interpreted as an overestimation
of the migration rates predicted by giant planet migration theory. We further find differences
in the volatile content of planets in different system architectures and predict that high-density
super-Earths are more likely to host an outer giant. This correlation can be tested observationally.
Finally, super-Earth occurrence shows a negative correlation with metallicity in giant-hosting
systems. The reason for this is that giant planets around high-metallicity stars are frequently
dynamically active, which poses a threat to inner planetary systems.
