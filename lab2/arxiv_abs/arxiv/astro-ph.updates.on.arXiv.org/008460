A carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) of around unity is believed to act as a natural separator of water-
and methane-dominated spectra when characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. In this paper we quantify
the C/O ratios at which this separation occurs by calculating a large self-consistent grid of cloud-free
atmospheric models in chemical equilibrium, using the latest version of petitCODE. Our study covers
a broad range of parameter space: 400 K$<$T$_{eff}<$2600 K, 2.0$<$log(g)$<$5.0, -1.0$<$[Fe/H]$<$2.0,
0.25$<$C/O$<$1.25, and stellar types from M to F. We make the synthetic transmission and emission
spectra, as well as the temperature structures publicly available. We find that the transition
C/O ratio depends on many parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity
and spectral type of the host star, and could have values less, equal, or higher than unity. By mapping
all the transition C/O ratios we propose a "four-class" classification scheme for irradiated planets
in this temperature range. We find a parameter space where methane always remains the cause of dominant
spectral features. CH$_4$ detection in this region, or the lack of it, provides a diagnostic tool
to identify the prevalence of cloud formation and non-equilibrium chemistry. As another diagnostic
tool, we construct synthetic Spitzer IRAC color-diagrams showing two distinguishable populations
of planets. Since most of the exoplanet atmospheres appear cloudy when studied in transmission,
we regard this study as a starting point of how such a C/O-sensitive observation-based classification
scheme should be constructed. This preparatory work will have to be refined by future cloudy and
non-equilibrium modeling, to further investigate the existence and exact location of the classes,
as well as the color-diagram analysis.
