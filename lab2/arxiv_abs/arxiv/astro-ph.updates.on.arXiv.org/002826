The theoretically studied impact of rapid rotation on stellar evolution needs to be confronted
with the results of high resolution spectroscopy-velocimetry observations. A weak surface magnetic
field had recently been detected in the A0 prototype star Vega, potentially leading to a (yet undetected)
structured surface. The goal of this article is to present a thorough analysis of the line profile
variations and associated estimators in the early-type standard star Vega (A0) in order reveal
potential activity tracers, exoplanet companions and stellar oscillations. Vega was monitored
in high-resolution spectroscopy with the velocimeter Sophie/OHP. A total of 2588 high S/N spectra
was obtained during 5 nights (August 2012) at R = 75000 and covering the visible domain. For each reduced
spectrum, Least Square Deconvolved (LSD) equivalent photospheric profiles were calculated with
a Teff = 9500 and logg = 4.0 spectral line mask. Several methods were applied to study the dynamic behavior
of the profile variations (evolution of radial velocity, bisectors, vspan, 2D profiles, amongst
others). We present the discovery of a starspotted stellar surface in an A-type standard star with
faint spot amplitudes Delta F/Fc ~5 10^{-4}. A rotational modulation of spectral lines with a period
of rotation P = 0.68 d has clearly been exhibited, confirming the results of previous spectropolarimetric
studies. Either a very thin convective layer can be responsible for magnetic field generation at
small amplitudes, or a new mechanism has to be invoked in order to explain the existence of activity
tracing starspots. This first strong evidence that standard A-type stars can show surface structures
opens a new field of research and asks the question about a potential link with the recently discovered
weak magnetic field discoveries in this category of stars.
