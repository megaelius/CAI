We present a statistical study of the relative orientation in the plane of the sky between interstellar
magnetic fields and filaments hosting cold clumps. For the first time, we consider both the density
of the environment and the density contrast between the filaments and their environment. Moreover,
we geometrically distinguish between the clumps and the remaining portions of the filaments. We
infer the magnetic field orientations in the filaments and in their environment from the Stokes
parameters, assuming optically thin conditions. Thus, we analyze the relative orientations between
filaments, embedded clumps, and internal and background magnetic fields, depending on the filament
environment and evolutionary stages. We recover the previously observed trend for filaments in
low column density environments to be aligned parallel to the background magnetic field; however,
we find that this trend is significant only for low contrast filaments, whereas high contrast filaments
tend to be randomly orientated with respect to the background magnetic field. Filaments in high
column density environments do not globally show any preferential orientation, although low contrast
filaments alone tend to have perpendicular relative orientation with respect to the background
magnetic field. For a subsample of nearby filaments, for which volume densities can be derived,
we find a clear transition in the relative orientation with increasing density, at $n_{\rm H} \sim
10^{3}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$, changing from mostly parallel to mostly perpendicular in the off-clump
portions of filaments and from even to bimodal in the clumps. Our results confirm a strong interplay
between interstellar magnetic fields and filaments during their formation and evolution.
