We present new parallax measurements of 7 long-period (> 10 days) Milky Way Cepheids (SS CMa, XY Car,
VY Car, VX Per, WZ Sgr, X Pup and S Vul) using astrometry from spatial scanning of WFC3 on HST. Observations
were obtained at 6 month intervals over 4 years. The distances are 1.7--3.6 kpc with a mean precision
of 45 microarcseconds and a best of 29 microarcseconds (SNR = 14). The accuracy of the parallaxes
is demonstrated through independent analyses of >100 reference stars. This raises to 10 the number
of long-period Cepheids with significant parallax measurements, 8 obtained from this program.
We also present high-precision F555W, F814W, and F160W magnitudes of these Cepheids, allowing
a direct, zeropoint-independent comparison to >1800 extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of 19
SNeIa. This sample addresses two outstanding systematic uncertainties affecting prior comparisons
of Milky Way and extragalactic Cepheids used to calibrate H_0: their dissimilarity of periods and
photometric systems. Comparing the new parallaxes to their predicted values derived from reversing
the distance ladder gives a ratio (or independent scale for H_0) of 1.037+/-0.036, consistent with
no change and inconsistent at the 3.5 sigma level with a ratio of 0.91 needed to match the value predicted
by Planck+LCDM. Using these data instead to augment the Riess et al. (2016) measurement of H_0 improves
the precision to 2.3%, yielding 73.48+/-1.66 km/s/Mpc, and tension with Planck+LCDM increases
to 3.7 sigma. The future combination of Gaia parallaxes and HST spatial scanning photometry of 50
Milky Way Cepheids can support a < 1% calibration of H_0.
