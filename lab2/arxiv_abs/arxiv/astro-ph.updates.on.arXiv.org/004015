SDSS-V will be an all-sky, multi-epoch spectroscopic survey of over six million objects. It is designed
to decode the history of the Milky Way, trace the emergence of the chemical elements, reveal the inner
workings of stars, and investigate the origin of planets. It will also create an integral-field
spectroscopic map of the gas in the Galaxy and the Local Group that is 1,000x larger than the current
state of the art and at high enough spatial resolution to reveal the self-regulation mechanisms
of galactic ecosystems. SDSS-V will pioneer systematic, spectroscopic monitoring across the
whole sky, revealing changes on timescales from 20 minutes to 20 years. The survey will thus track
the flickers, flares, and radical transformations of the most luminous persistent objects in the
universe: massive black holes growing at the centers of galaxies. The scope and flexibility of SDSS-V
will be unique among extant and future spectroscopic surveys: it is all-sky, with matched survey
infrastructures in both hemispheres; it provides near-IR and optical multi-object fiber spectroscopy
that is rapidly reconfigurable to serve high target densities, targets of opportunity, and time-domain
monitoring; and it provides optical, ultra-wide-field integral field spectroscopy. SDSS-V,
with its programs anticipated to start in 2020, will be well-timed to multiply the scientific output
from major space missions (e.g., TESS, Gaia, eROSITA) and ground-based projects. SDSS-V builds
on the 25-year heritage of SDSS's advances in data analysis, collaboration infrastructure, and
product deliverables. The project is now refining its science scope, optimizing the survey strategies,
and developing new hardware that builds on the SDSS-IV infrastructure. We present here an overview
of the current state of these developments as we seek to build our worldwide consortium of institutional
and individual members.
