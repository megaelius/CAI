The chemical properties of protoplanetary disks are especially sensitive to their ionization
environment. Sources of molecular gas ionization include cosmic rays, stellar X-rays and short-lived
radionuclides, each of which varies with location in the disk. This behavior leads to a significant
amount of chemical structure, especially in molecular ion abundances, which is imprinted in their
submillimeter rotational line emission. Using an observationally motivated disk model, we make
predictions for the dependence of chemical abundances on the assumed properties of the ionizing
field. We calculate the emergent line intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitive
observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) for a disk at D=100
pc. The models readily distinguish between high ionization rates ($\zeta\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$
per H$_2$) and below, but it becomes difficult to distinguish between low ionization models when
$\zeta\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. We find that \htdp\ emission is not detectable for sub-interstellar
CR rates with ALMA (6h integration), and that \ntdp\ emission may be a more sensitive tracer of midplane
ionization. HCO$^+$ traces X-rays and high CR rates ($\zeta_{\rm{CR}}\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$),
and provides a handle on the warm molecular ionization properties where CO is present in the gas.
Furthermore, species like HCO$^+$, which emits from a wide radial region and samples a large gradient
in temperature, can exhibit ring-like emission as a consequence of low-lying rotational level
de-excitation near the star. This finding highlights a scenario where rings are not necessarily
structural or chemical in nature, but simply a result of the underlying line excitation properties.
