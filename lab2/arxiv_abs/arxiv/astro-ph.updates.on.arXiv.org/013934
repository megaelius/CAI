The speed of gravitational waves for a single observation can be measured by the time delay among
gravitational-wave detectors with Bayesian inference. Then multiple measurements can be combined
to produce a more accurate result. From the near simultaneous detection of gravitational waves
and gamma rays originating from GW170817/GRB 170817A, the speed of gravitational wave signal was
found to be the same as the the speed of the gamma rays to approximately one part in $10^{15}$. Here
we present a different method of measuring the speed of gravitational waves, not based on an associated
electromagnetic signal but instead by the measured transit time across a geographically separated
network of detectors. While this method is far less precise, it provides an independent measurement
of the speed of gravitational waves. For GW170817 a binary neutron star inspiral observed by Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo, by fixing sky localization of the source at the electromagnetic counterpart
the speed of gravitational waves is constrained to 90% confidence interval (0.97c, 1.02c), where
c is the speed of light in a vacuum. By combing seven BBH events and the BNS event from the second observing
run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the 90% confidence interval is narrowed down to (0.97c,
1.01c). The accurate measurement of the speed of gravitational waves allows us to test the general
theory of relativity. We further interpret these results within the test framework provided by
the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME). In doing so, we obtain simultaneous constraints
on 4 of the 9 nonbirefringent, nondispersive coefficients for Lorentz violation in the gravity
sector of the SME and place limits on the anisotropy of the speed of gravity.
