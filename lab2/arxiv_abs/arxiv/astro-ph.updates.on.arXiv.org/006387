We have combined spectrosopic and photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with
$1.4$ GHz radio observations, conducted as part of the Stripe 82 $1-2$ GHz Snapshot Survey using
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), which covers $\sim100$ sq degrees, to a flux limit of 88
$\mu$Jy rms. Cross-matching the $11\,768$ radio source components with optical data via visual
inspection results in a final sample of $4\,795$ cross-matched objects, of which $1\,996$ have
spectroscopic redshifts and $2\,799$ objects have photometric redshifts. Three previously undiscovered
Giant Radio Galaxies (GRGs) were found during the cross-matching process, which would have been
missed using automated techniques. For the objects with spectroscopy we separate radio-loud Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using three diagnostics and then further
divide our radio-loud AGN into the HERG and LERG populations. A control matched sample of HERGs and
LERGs, matched on stellar mass, redshift and radio luminosity, reveals that the host galaxies of
LERGs are redder and more concentrated than HERGs. By combining with near-infrared data, we demonstrate
that LERGs also follow a tight $K-z$ relationship. These results imply the LERG population are hosted
by population of massive, passively evolving early-type galaxies. We go on to show that HERGs, LERGs,
QSOs and star-forming galaxies in our sample all reside in different regions of a WISE colour-colour
diagram. This cross-matched sample bridges the gap between previous `wide but shallow' and `deep
but narrow' samples and will be useful for a number of future investigations.
