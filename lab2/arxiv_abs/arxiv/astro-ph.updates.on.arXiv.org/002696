Binary neutron stars in circular orbits can be modeled as helically symmetric, i.e., stationary
in a rotating frame. This symmetry gives rise to a first integral of the Euler equation, often employed
for constructing equilibrium solutions via iteration. For eccentric orbits, however, the lack
of helical symmetry has prevented the use of this method, and the numerical relativity community
has often resorted to constructing initial data by superimposing boosted spherical stars without
solving the Euler equation. The spuriously excited neutron star oscillations seen in evolutions
of such data arise because such configurations lack the appropriate tidal deformations and are
stationary in a linearly comoving---rather than rotating---frame. We consider eccentric configurations
at apoapsis that are instantaneously stationary in a rotating frame. We extend the notion of helical
symmetry to eccentric orbits, by approximating the elliptical orbit of each companion as instantaneously
circular, using the ellipse's inscribed circle. The two inscribed helical symmetry vectors give
rise to approximate instantaneous first integrals of the Euler equation throughout each companion.
We use these integrals as the basis of a self-consistent iteration of the Einstein constraints to
construct conformal thin-sandwich initial data for eccentric binaries. We find that the spurious
stellar oscillations are reduced by at least an order of magnitude, compared with those found in
evolutions of superposed initial data. The tidally induced oscillations, however, are physical
and qualitatively similar to earlier evolutions. Finally, we show how to incorporate radial velocity
due to radiation reaction in our inscribed helical symmetry vectors, which would allow one to obtain
truly non-eccentric initial data when our eccentricity parameter $e$ is set to zero.
