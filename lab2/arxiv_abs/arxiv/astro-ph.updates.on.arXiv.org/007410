On 17 August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo observatories made the first direct detection of gravitational
waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary system. The detection of this gravitational-wave
signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme
conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the
LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were
then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by
working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation
of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis
employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic
properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of the defining function
$p(\rho)$ of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO and Virgo data alone and the first method,
we measure the two neutron star radii as $R_1=10.8^{+2.0}_{-1.7}$ km for the heavier star and $R_2=
10.7^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km for the lighter star at the 90% credible level. If we additionally require
that the equation of state supports neutron stars with masses larger than $1.97 \,M_\odot$ as required
from electromagnetic observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further
constrain $R_1= 11.9^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ km and $R_2= 11.9^{+1.4}_{-1.4}$ km at the 90% credible level.
Finally, we obtain constraints on $p(\rho)$ at supranuclear densities, with pressure at twice
nuclear saturation density measured at $3.5^{+2.7}_{-1.7}\times 10^{34} \,\mathrm{dyn}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}$
at the 90% level.
