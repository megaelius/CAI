We discuss, without assuming asymptotic flatness, a gravitational lens for an observer and source
that are within a finite distance from a lens object. The proposed lens equation is consistent with
the deflection angle of light that is defined for nonasymptotic observer and source by Takizawa
et al. [Phys. Rev. D 101, 104032 (2020)] based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem with using the optical
metric. This lens equation, though it is shown to be equivalent to the lens equation by Bozza [Phys.
Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)], is linear in the deflection angle. Therefore, the proposed equation is
more convenient for the purpose of doing an iterative analysis. As an explicit example of an asymptotically
nonflat spacetime, we consider a static and spherically symmetric solution in Weyl conformal gravity,
especially a case that $\gamma$ parameter in the Weyl gravity model is of the order of the inverse
of the present Hubble radius. For this case, we examine iterative solutions for the finite-distance
lens equation up to the third order. The effect of the Weyl gravity on the lensed image position begins
at the third order and it is linear in the impact parameter of light. The deviation of the lensed image
position from the general relativistic one is $\sim 10^{-2}$ microarcsecond for the lens and source
with a separation angle of $\sim 1$ arcminute, where we consider a cluster of galaxies with $10^{14}
M_{\odot}$ at $\sim 1$ Gpc for instance. The deviation becomes $\sim 10^{-1}$ microarcseconds,
even if the separation angle is $\sim 10$ arcminutes. Therefore, effects of the Weyl gravity model
are negligible in current and near-future observations of gravitational lensing. On the other
hand, the general relativistic corrections at the third order $\sim 0.1$ milliarcseconds can be
relevant with VLBI observations.
