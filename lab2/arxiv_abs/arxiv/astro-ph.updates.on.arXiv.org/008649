The standard wide-field imaging technique, the $w$-projection, allows correction for wide-fields
of view for non-coplanar radio interferometric arrays. However, calculating exact corrections
for each measurement has not been possible due to the amount of computation required at high resolution
and with the large number of visibilities from current interferometers. The required accuracy
and computational cost of these corrections is one of the largest unsolved challenges facing next
generation radio interferometers such as the Square Kilometre Array. We show that the same calculation
can be performed with a radially symmetric $w$-projection kernel, where we use one dimensional
adaptive quadrature to calculate the resulting Hankel transform, decreasing the computation
required for kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, whilst preserving the accuracy.
We confirm that the radial $w$-projection kernel is accurate to approximately 1% by imaging the
zero-spacing with an added $w$-term. We demonstrate the potential of our radially symmetric $w$-projection
kernel via sparse image reconstruction, using the software package PURIFY. We develop a distributed
$w$-stacking and $w$-projection hybrid algorithm. We apply this algorithm to individually correct
for non-coplanar effects in 17.5 million visibilities over a $25$ by $25$ degree field of view MWA
observation for image reconstruction. Such a level of accuracy and scalability is not possible
with standard $w$-projection kernel generation methods. This demonstrates that we can scale to
a large number of measurements with large image sizes whilst still maintaining both speed and accuracy.
