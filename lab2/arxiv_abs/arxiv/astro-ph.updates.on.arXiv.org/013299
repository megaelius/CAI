Resolving the small length-scale of thermonuclear detonation waves (TNDWs) in supernovae is currently
not possible in multidimensional full-star simulations. Additionally, multidimensional simulations
usually use small, oversimplistic reaction networks and adopt an ad hoc transition criterion to
nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). The errors due to the applied approximations are not well
understood. We present here a new accurate and efficient numerical scheme that accelerates the
calculations by orders of magnitudes and allows the structure of TNDWs to be resolved. The numerical
scheme has two important ingredients: (1) a burning limiter that broadens the width of the TNDW while
accurately preserving its internal structure, and (2) an adaptive separation of isotopes into
groups that are in nuclear statistical quasi-equilibrium, which resolves the time-consuming
burning calculation of reactions that are nearly balanced out. Burning is calculated in situ employing
the required large networks without the use of post-processing or pre-describing the conditions
behind the TNDW. In particular, the approach to and deviation from NSE are calculated self-consistently.
The scheme can be easily implemented in multidimensional codes. We test our scheme against accurate
solutions of the structure of TNDWs and against homogeneous expansion from NSE. We show that with
resolutions that are typical for multidimensional full-star simulations, we reproduce the accurate
thermodynamic trajectory (density, temperature, etc.) to an accuracy that is better than a percent
for the resolved scales (where the burning limiter is not applied), while keeping the error for unresolved
scales (broadened by the burning limiter) within a few percent.
