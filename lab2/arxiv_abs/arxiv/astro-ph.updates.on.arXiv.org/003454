In relation to two meetings on stellar binary systems in July 2017, I summarize my view that in the
majority of strongly interacting stellar binary systems jets play decisive roles. In the meeting
The Physics of Evolved Stars II: The role of Binarity (Nice, July 10-13, 2017) many talks and posters
were concentrated on the shaping of circumstellar matter, with some significant new results, like
the observations of wide jets launched from binary systems. In the meeting The Impact of Binaries
on Stellar Evolution (ESO Garching, July 3-7, 2017), both in the opening and the summary talks the
speakers mentioned that "Textbooks need most likely to be rewritten". I made my point that some new
chapters were already written, although researchers do not read them but rather keep referring
to the `old textbooks'. For example, too many speakers and authors keep referring only to the single
degenerate and double degenerate scenarios for the progenitors of SNe Ia. Researchers must refer
also to the `new textbook chapter' on the core degenerate (CD) scenario. Other examples involve
the role of jets. Jets lead to a new evolutionary phase, that of the grazing envelope evolution (GEE),
that should be considered alongside the older ones, e.g., the common envelope evolution, Roche
lobe overflow (RLOF), and wind mass loss and accretion. I discuss how the GEE can solve some puzzling
binary systems. We should also consider the role of jets as an extra energy source to remove the common
envelope and in powering intermediate luminosity optical transients (ILOTs). One strong advantage
of jets is that in many cases they operate through a negative feedback mechanism, hence preventing
the need for a fine tuning. The operation of the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) connects also binary
evolution to explosion of massive stars as core collapse supernovae.
