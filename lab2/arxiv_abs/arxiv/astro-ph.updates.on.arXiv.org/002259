Context: Observations suggest that the major fraction of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
are connected with broad-lines supernovae Ib/c, (SNe-Ibc). The presence of GRB-SNe is revealed
by rebrightenings emerging from the optical GRB afterglow $10$--$15$ days, in the rest-frame of
the source, after the prompt GRB emission. Aims: \textit{Fermi}-GBM has a field of view (FoV) which
is about 6.5 times larger than the FoV of \textit{Swift}, therefore we expect that a number of GRB-SN
connections have been missed due to lack of optical and X-ray instruments on board of \textit{Fermi},
which are essential to reveal SNe associated with GRBs. This fact has motivated our search in the
\textit{Fermi} catalogue for possible GRB-SN events. Methods: The search for possible GRB-SN
associations follows two requirements: (1) SN should fall inside the \textit{Fermi}-GBM error
box of the considered long GRB, and (2) this GRB should occur within $20$ days before the SN event.
Results: We have found $5$ cases, within $z<0.2$ fulfilling the above reported requirements.
One of them, GRB 130702A-SN 2013dx, was already known as GRB-SN association. We have analyzed the
remaining $4$ cases and we concluded that three of them are, very likely, just random coincidences,
due to the \textit{Fermi}-GBM large error box associated with each GRB detection. We found one GRB
possibly associated with a SN 1998bw-like, GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba. Conclusions: The very low redshift
of GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba ($z = 0.017$) implies a low isotropic energy of this burst ($E_{iso} = 1.39
\times 10^{48}$) erg. We then compute the rate of \textit{Fermi} low-luminosity GRBs connected
with SNe to be $\rho_{0,b} \leq 770\ $Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. We estimate that \textit{Fermi}-GBM
could detect $1$--$4$ GRBs-SNe within $z \leq 0.2$ in the next 4 years.
