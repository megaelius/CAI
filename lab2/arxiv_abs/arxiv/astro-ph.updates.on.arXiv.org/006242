Only one exoplanet has so far been mapped in both longitude and latitude, but the James Webb Space
Telescope promises mapping-quality data for dozens of exoplanets. The thermal phase mapping problem
has previously been solved analytically, with orthogonal maps---spherical harmonics---yielding
orthogonal lightcurves---sinusoids. The eclipse mapping problem, let alone combined phase+eclipse
mapping, does not lend itself to such a neat solution. Previous efforts have either adopted spherical
harmonics, or various ad hoc map parameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal lightcurves.
We use principal component analysis to construct orthogonal eigencurves, which we then use to fit
published 8 micron observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This approach has a few advantages
over previously used techniques: 1) the lightcurves can be pre-computed, accelerating the fitting
process, 2) the eigencurves are orthogonal to each other, reducing parameter correlations, and
3) the eigencurves are model-independent and are ranked in order of sensitivity. One notable result
of our analysis is that eclipse-only mapping of HD 189733b is far more sensitive to the central concentration
of dayside flux than to the eastward offset of that hotspot. Mapping can, in principle, suffer from
degeneracies between spatial patterns and orbital parameters. Previous mapping efforts using
these data have either assumed a circular orbit and precise inclination, or have been pessimistic
about the prospects of eclipse mapping in the face of uncertain orbital parameters. We show that
for HD 189733b the combined photometry and radial velocity are sufficiently precise as to retire
this concern. Lastly, we present the first map of brightness temperature, and we quantify the amplitude
and longitude offset of the dayside hotspot.
