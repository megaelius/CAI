Future observatories utilizing reflection grating spectrometers for extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
and soft X-ray (SXR) spectroscopy require high-fidelity gratings with both blazed groove facets
and custom groove layouts that are often fanned or feature a slight curvature. While fabrication
procedures centering on wet anisotropic etching in monocrystalline silicon produce highly efficient
blazed gratings, the precision of a nonparallel groove layout is limited by the cubic structure
of the silicon crystal. This motivates the pursuit of alternative techniques to grating manufacture,
namely thermally activated selective topography equilibration (TASTE), which uses gray-scale
electron-beam lithography to pattern multilevel structures in resist followed by an optimized
polymer thermal reflow to smooth the 3D patterns into continuous surface relief profiles. Using
TASTE, a mold for a reflection grating with a periodicity of 400 nm and grooves resembling an asymmetric
sawtooth was patterned in 130 nm thick poly(methyl methacrylate) resist on a silicon substrate
over a 50 mm by 7.5 mm area. This structure was coated with 15 nm of gold by electron-beam physical vapor
deposition using titanium as an adhesion layer and then tested for EUV and SXR diffraction efficiency
at beamline 6.3.2 of the Advanced Light Source synchrotron facility. Results demonstrate a quasi-blaze
response characteristic of a 27 degree blaze angle with groove facets smooth to 1.5 nm rms. Absolute
peak-order efficiency ranges from 75% to 25%, while total relative efficiency measures gap90%
across the measured bandpass of 15.5 nm > lambda > 1.55 nm.
