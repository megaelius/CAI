First results from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission have revealed ubiquitous coherent ion-scale
waves in the inner heliosphere, which are signatures of kinetic wave-particle interactions and
fluid-scale instabilities. However, initial studies of the circularly polarized ion-scale waves
observed by PSP have only thoroughly analyzed magnetic field signatures, precluding a determination
of solar-wind frame propagation direction and intrinsic wave-polarization. A comprehensive
determination of wave-properties requires measurements of both electric and magnetic fields.
Here, we use full capabilities of the PSP/FIELDS instrument suite to measure both the electric and
magnetic components of circularly polarized waves. Comparing spacecraft frame magnetic field
measurements with the Doppler-shifted cold-plasma dispersion relation for parallel transverse
waves constrains allowable plasma frame polarizations and wave-vectors. We demonstrate that
the Doppler-shifted cold-plasma dispersion has a maximum spacecraft frequency $f_{sc}^{*}$
for which intrinsically right-handed fast-magnetosonic waves (FMWs) propagating sunwards can
appear left-handed in the spacecraft frame. Observations of left-handed waves with $|f|>f_{sc}^{*}$
are uniquely explained by intrinsically left-handed, ion-cyclotron, waves (ICWs). We demonstrate
that electric field measurements for waves with $|f|>f_{sc}^{*}$ are consistent with ICWs propagating
away from the sun, verifying the measured electric field. Applying the verified electric field
measurements to the full distribution of waves suggests that, in the solar wind frame, the vast majority
of waves propagate away from the sun, indicating that the observed population of coherent ion-scale
waves contains both intrinsically left and right hand polarized modes.
