In this study, we designed and experimentally evaluated a series-connected array of superconductor-insulator-superconductor
(SIS) junctions in the 100-GHz band mixer for the multi-beam receiver FOREST on the Nobeyama 45-m
millimeter-wave telescope. The construction of the junction chip comprised a waveguide probe
antenna, impedance matching circuit, SIS array junction, and choke filter, which were made from
a superconducting niobium planar circuit on a quartz substrate. The multi-stage impedance matching
circuit between the feed point and the SIS junction was designed as a capacitively loaded transmission
line, and it comprised two sections with high (~90 Ohm) and low (~10 Ohm) characteristic impedance
transmission lines. The structure of this tuning line was simple and easy to fabricate, and the feed
impedance matched with the SIS junction in a wide frequency range. The signal coupling efficiency
was more than 92% and the expected receiver noise temperature was approximately two times the quantum
limit for 75-125 GHz based on quantum theory. The array junction devices with 3-6 connected junctions
were fabricated and we measured their performance in terms of the receiver noise temperature and
gain compression in the laboratory. We successfully developed an array junction device with a receiver
noise temperature of ~15-30 K and confirmed that the improvement in the saturation power corresponded
to the number of junctions. The newly developed array junction mixer was installed in the FOREST
receiver and it successfully detected the 12CO (J = 1-0) molecular line toward IRC+10216 with the
Nobeyama 45-m telescope.
