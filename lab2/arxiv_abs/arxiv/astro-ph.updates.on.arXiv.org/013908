A portion of light scalar dark matter, especially axions, may organize into gravitationally bound
clumps (stars) and be present in large number in the galaxy today. It is therefore of utmost interest
to determine if there are novel observational signatures of this scenario. Work has shown that for
moderately large axion-photon couplings, such clumps can undergo parametric resonance into photons,
for clumps above a critical mass $M^{\star}_c$ determined precisely by some of us in Ref. [1]. In
order to obtain a clump above the critical mass in the galaxy today would require mergers. In this
work we perform full 3-dimensional simulations of pairs of axion clumps and determine the conditions
under which mergers take place through the emission of scalar waves, including analyzing head-on
and non-head-on collisions, phase dependence, and relative velocities. Consistent with other
work in the literature, we find that the final mass from the merger $M^{\star}_{\text{final}}\approx
0.7(M^{\star}_1+M^{\star}_2)$ is larger than each of the original clump masses (for $M^{\star}_1\sim
M^{\star}_2$). Hence, it is possible for sub-critical mass clumps to merge and become super-critical
and therefore undergo parametric resonance into photons. We find that mergers are expected to be
kinematically allowed in the galaxy today for high Peccei-Quinn scales, which is strongly suggested
by unification ideas, although the collision rate is small. While mergers can happen for axions
with lower Peccei-Quinn scales due to statistical fluctuations in relative velocities, as they
have a high collision rate. We estimate the collision and merger rates within the Milky Way galaxy
today. We find that a merger leads to a flux of energy on earth that can be appreciable and we mention
observational search strategies.
