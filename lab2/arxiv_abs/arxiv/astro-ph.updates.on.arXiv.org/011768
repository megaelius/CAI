The bulk density of an asteroid informs us about its interior structure and composition. To constrain
the bulk density one needs an estimate for the mass of the asteroid. The mass is estimated by analyzing
an asteroid's gravitational interaction with another object, such as another asteroid during
a close encounter. An estimate for the mass has typically been obtained with linearized least-squares
methods despite the fact that this family of methods is not able to properly describe non-Gaussian
parameter distributions. In addition, the uncertainties reported for asteroid masses in the literature
are sometimes inconsistent with each other and suspected to be unrealistically low. We present
a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the asteroid mass estimation problem based on asteroid-asteroid
close encounters. We verify that our algorithm works correctly by applying it to synthetic data
sets. We then use astrometry available through the Minor Planet Center to estimate masses for a few
example cases and compare our results to results reported in the literature. Our mass estimates
for the synthetic data sets are fully consistent with the ground truth. The nominal masses for real
example cases typically agree with the literature but tend to have greater uncertainties than what
is reported in recent literature. Possible reasons for this include different astrometric datasets
and/or weights, different test asteroids, different force models and different algorithms. For
(16) Psyche, the target of NASA's Psyche mission, our maximum likelihood mass is approximately
55% of what is reported in the literature. Such a low mass would imply that the bulk density is significantly
lower than previously expected and hence disagrees with the theory of (16) Psyche being the metallic
core of a protoplanet. We however note that masses reported in recent literature remain within our
3-sigma limits.
