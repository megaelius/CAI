We forecast the impact of weak lensing (WL) cluster mass calibration on the cosmological constraints
that will be derived using the X-ray selected galaxy cluster counts from the upcoming eROSITA survey.
To this end, we produce a realistic mock cluster catalog within a fiducial cosmology, where each
cluster has an observed eROSITA count rate, redshift and gravitational WL tangential shear profile.
The shear profiles are produced to mimic either those from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) or the future
Euclid and LSST surveys. Using a count rate selection, we generate a baseline cosmology catalog
that contains 13k clusters over 14,892~deg$^2$ of extragalactic sky. Low mass clusters are excluded
from this sample using raised count rate thresholds at low redshift. We analyze the mock cluster
sample using a prototype of the eROSITA cosmology analysis pipeline. Forecast parameter uncertainties
for $\Omega_M$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$ are 0.023 (0.016), 0.038 (0.012), and 0.085 (0.074), respectively,
when adopting DES WL (Euclid+LSST WL). We explore the parameter sensitivities in our experiment
and identify a degeneracy between the distance--redshift relation and the parameters of the observable--mass
scaling relation that ultimately limits the impact of the WL calibration on the $w$ constraints,
and we show how this degeneracy can be broken by the inclusion of BAO measurements from DESI, allowing
a determination of $w$ to 0.047. If Planck CMB priors are included, $\Omega_M$ and $\sigma_8$ can
be determined to $0.005$ and $0.007$, respectively, while putting an upper limit on the summed neutrino
mass $\sum m_\nu < 0.211$ eV (at 95\%). Finally, we show that if systematic uncertainties at the group
mass scale can be controlled, an expanded eROSITA sample with 43k objects with Euclid+LSST WL analysis
would determine $\Omega_M$ and $\sigma_8$ to 0.007 and $w$ to 0.056.
