Microlensing of stars, e.g. in the Galactic bulge and Andromeda galaxy (M31), is among the most robust,
powerful method to constrain primordial black holes (PBHs) that are a viable candidate of dark matter.
If PBHs are in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH} \lower.5ex\hbox{$\; \buildrel < \over \sim \;$} 10^{-10}M_\odot$,
its Schwarzschild radius ($r_{\rm Sch}$) becomes comparable with or shorter than optical wavelength
($\lambda)$ used in a microlensing search, and in this regime the wave optics effect on microlensing
needs to be taken into account. For a lensing PBH with mass satisfying $r_{\rm Sch}\sim \lambda$,
it causes a characteristic oscillatory feature in the microlensing light curve, and it will give
a smoking gun evidence of PBH if detected, because any astrophysical object cannot have such a tiny
Schwarzschild radius. Even in a statistical study, e.g. constraining the abundance of PBHs from
a systematic search of microlensing events for a sample of many source stars, the wave effect needs
to be taken into account. We examine the impact of wave effect on the PBH constraints obtained from
the $r$-band (6210\AA) monitoring observation of M31 stars in Niikura et al. (2019), and find that
a finite source size effect is dominant over the wave effect for PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq[10^{-11},10^{-10}]M_\odot$.
We also discuss that, if a denser-cadence (10~sec), $g$-band monitoring observation for a sample
of white dwarfs over a year timescale is available, it would allow one to explore the wave optics effect
on microlensing light curve, if it occurs, or improve the PBH constraints in $M_{\rm PBH}\lower.5ex\hbox{$\;
\buildrel < \over \sim \;$} 10^{-11}M_\odot$ even from a null detection.
