The study of X-ray reprocessing is one of the key diagnostic tools to probe the environment in X-ray
binary systems. One difficult aspect of studying X-ray reprocessing is the presence of much brighter
primary radiation from the compact star together with the reprocessed radiation. In contrast for
eclipsing systems, the X-rays we receive during eclipse are only those produced by reprocessing
of the emission from the compact star by the surrounding medium. We report results from a spectral
study of the X-ray emission during eclipse and outside eclipse (when available) in 9 high mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs) with XMM- Newton EPIC pn to investigate different aspects of the stellar wind in
these HMXBs. During eclipse the continuum component of the spectrum is reduced by a factor of $\sim$8-237,
but the count-rate for 6.4 keV Iron emission line or complex of Iron emission lines in HMXBs are reduced
by a smaller factor leading to large equivalent widths of the Iron emission lines. This indicates
a large size for the line emission region, comparable to or larger than the companion star in these
HMXB systems. However there are significant system to system differences. 4U 1538$-$52, in spite
of having a large absorption column density, shows a soft emission component with comparable flux
during the eclipse and out-of-eclipse phases. Emission from Hydrogen-like Iron has been observed
in LMC X-4 for the first time, in the out-of-eclipse phase in one of the observations. Overall, we
find significant differences in the eclipse spectrum of different HMXBs and also in their eclipse
spectra against out-of-eclipse spectra.
