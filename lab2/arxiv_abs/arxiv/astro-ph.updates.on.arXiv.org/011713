The reionization of hydrogen is closely linked to the first structures in the universe, so understanding
the timeline of cosmic reionization promises to shed light on the nature of these early objects.
In particular, transmission of Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) from galaxies through the intergalactic
medium (IGM) is sensitive to neutral hydrogen in the IGM, so can be used to probe the reionization
timeline. In this work, we implement an improved model of the galaxy UV luminosity to dark matter
halo mass relation to infer the volume-averaged fraction of neutral hydrogen in the IGM from Ly$\alpha$
observations. Many models assume that UV-bright galaxies are hosted by massive dark matter haloes
in overdense regions of the IGM, and thus reside in relatively large ionized regions. However, observations
and N-body simulations indicate that scatter in the UV luminosity-halo mass relation is expected.
Here, we model the scatter and assess the impact on Ly$\alpha$ visibility during reionization.
We show that UV luminosity-halo mass scatter tends to reduce Ly$\alpha$ visibility compared to
models without scatter, and that this is most significant for UV-bright galaxies. We then use our
model to infer the neutral fraction, $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}}$, at $z \sim 7$ using a sample
of Lyman-break galaxies in legacy fields, updating the neutral fraction inference performed without
accounting for scatter; we find $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}} = 0.55_{-0.13}^{+0.11}$ with scatter,
a slight decrease from the neutral fraction inferred without scatter, $\overline{x}_{\mathrm{HI}}
= 0.59_{-0.14}^{+0.12}$. Finally, we discuss implications for future high-redshift galaxy studies.
