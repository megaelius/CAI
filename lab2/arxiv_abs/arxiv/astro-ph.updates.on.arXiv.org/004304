Galaxies are biased tracers of the matter density on cosmological scales. For future tests of galaxy
models, we refine and assess a method to measure galaxy biasing as function of physical scale $k$
with weak gravitational lensing. This method enables us to reconstruct the galaxy bias factor $b(k)$
as well as the galaxy-matter correlation $r(k)$ on spatial scales between $0.01\,h\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}\lesssim
k\lesssim10\,h\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for redshift-binned lens galaxies below redshift $z\lesssim0.6$.
In the refinement, we account for an intrinsic alignment of source ellipticities, and we correct
for the magnification bias of the lens galaxies, relevant for the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal,
to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed $r(k)$. For simulated data, the reconstructions achieve
an accuracy of $3-7\%$ (68\% confidence level) over the above $k$-range for a survey area and a typical
depth of contemporary ground-based surveys. Realistically the accuracy is, however, probably
reduced to about $10-15\%$, mainly by systematic uncertainties in the assumed intrinsic source
alignment, the fiducial cosmology, and the redshift distributions of lens and source galaxies
(in that order). Furthermore, our reconstruction technique employs physical templates for $b(k)$
and $r(k)$ that elucidate the impact of central galaxies and the halo-occupation statistics of
satellite galaxies on the scale-dependence of galaxy bias, which we discuss in the paper. In a first
demonstration, we apply this method to previous measurements in the Garching-Bonn-Deep Survey
and give a physical interpretation of the lens population.
