We consider the possible detection of parity violation at the linear level in gravity using polarized
anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background. Since such a parity violation would lead to non-zero
TB and EB correlations, this makes those odd-parity angular power spectra a potential probe of parity
violation in the gravitational sector. These spectra are modeled incorporating the impact of lensing
and we explore their possible detection in the context of small-scale (balloon-borne or ground-based)
experiments and a future satellite mission dedicated to B-mode detection. We assess the statistical
uncertainties on their reconstruction using mode-counting and a (more realistic) pure pseudospectrum
estimator approach. Those uncertainties are then translated into constraints on the level of parity
asymmetry. We found that detecting chiral gravity is impossible for ongoing small-scale experiments.
However, for a satellite-like mission, a parity asymmetry of at least 50% could be detected at 68%
of confidence level, and a parity asymmetry of 100% is measurable with at least a confidence level
of 95%. We also assess the impact of a possible miscalibration of the orientation of the polarized
detectors, leading to spurious TB and EB cross-correlations. We show that in the context of pseudospectrum
estimation of the angular power spectra, self-calibration of this angle could significantly reduce
the statistical significance of the measured level of parity asymmetry (by e.g. a factor ~2.4 for
a miscalibration angle of 1 degree). For chiral gravity and assuming a satellite mission dedicated
to primordial B-mode, a non detection of the TB and EB correlation would translate into an upper bound
on parity violation of 39% at 95% confidence level for a tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.2, excluding
values of the (imaginary) Barbero-Immirzi parameter comprised between 0.2 and 4.9 at 95% CL.
