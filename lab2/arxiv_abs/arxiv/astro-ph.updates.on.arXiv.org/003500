Recent theoretical models suggest that the early phase of galaxy formation could involve an epoch
when galaxies are gas-rich but inefficient at forming stars: a "dark galaxy" phase. Here, we report
the results of our MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) survey for dark galaxies fluorescently
illuminated by quasars at $z>3$. Compared to previous studies which are based on deep narrow-band
(NB) imaging, our integral field survey provides a nearly uniform sensitivity coverage over a large
volume in redshift space around the quasars as well as full spectral information at each location.
Thanks to these unique features, we are able to build control samples at large redshift distances
from the quasars using the same data taken under the same conditions. By comparing the rest-frame
equivalent width (EW$_{0}$) distributions of the Ly$\alpha$ sources detected in proximity to
the quasars and in control samples, we detect a clear correlation between the locations of high EW$_{0}$
objects and the quasars. This correlation is not seen in other properties such as Ly$\alpha$ luminosities
or volume overdensities, suggesting the possible fluorescent nature of at least some of these objects.
Among these, we find 6 sources without continuum counterparts and EW$_{0}$ limits larger than $240\,\mathrm{\AA}$
that are the best candidates for dark galaxies in our survey at $z>3.5$. The volume densities and
properties, including inferred gas masses and star formation efficiencies, of these dark galaxy
candidates are similar to previously detected candidates at $z\approx2.4$ in NB surveys. Moreover,
if the most distant of these are fluorescently illuminated by the quasar, our results also provide
a lower limit of $t=60$ Myr on the quasar lifetime.
