Much difficulty has so far prevented the emergence of a consistent scenario for the origin of Type
Ib and Ic supernovae (SNe). Here, we follow a heuristic approach by examining the fate of helium stars
in the mass range 4 to 12Msun, which presumably form in interacting binaries. The helium stars are
evolved using stellar wind mass loss rates that agree with observations, and which reproduce the
observed luminosity range of galactic WR stars, leading to stellar masses at core collapse in the
range 3-5.5Msun. We then explode these models adopting an explosion energy proportional to the
ejecta mass, roughly consistent with theoretical predictions. We impose a fixed 56Ni mass and strong
mixing. The SN radiation from 3 to 100d is computed self-consistently starting from the input stellar
models using the time-dependent non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer code
CMFGEN. By design, our fiducial models yield similar light curves, with a rise time of ~20d and a peak
luminosity of ~10^42.2erg/s, in line with representative SNe Ibc. The less massive progenitors
retain a He-rich envelope and reproduce the color, line widths, and line strengths of a representative
sample of SNe Ib, while stellar winds remove most of the helium in more massive progenitors, whose
spectra match typical SNe Ic in detail. The transition between the predicted Ib-like and Ic-like
spectra is continuous, but it is sharp, such that the resulting models essentially form a dichotomy.
Further models computed with varying explosion energy, 56Ni mass, and long-term power injection
from the remnant show that a moderate variation of these parameters can reproduce much of the diversity
of SNe Ibc. We conclude that stars stripped by a binary companion can account for the vast majority
of ordinary SNe Ib and Ic, and that stellar wind mass loss is the key to remove the helium envelope in
SN Ic progenitors. [abridged]
