The most widely-studied mechanism of mass loss from extrasolar planets is photoevaporation via
XUV ionization, primarily in the context of highly irradiated planets. However, the lower energy
regime of FUV dissociation of hydrogen molecules can also theoretically drive atmospheric evaporation
on low-mass planets because the dissociation energy of hydrogen is an order of magnitude greater
than the escape energy per proton from the gravity well of an Earth-sized planet. For temperate planets
such as the early Earth, impact erosion is expected to dominate in the traditional planetesimal
accretion model, but it would be greatly reduced in pebble accretion scenarios, allowing other
mass loss processes to be major contributors. We apply the same prescription for photoionization
to this photodissociation mechanism and compare it to an analysis of other possible sources of mass
loss in pebble accretion scenarios. We find that energy-limited photodissociation could remove
the hydrogen atmosphere of an early Earth analog over several Gyr, though not over the shorter period
of mass loss in Earth's early history. Impact erosion could remove ~2,300 bars of hydrogen if 1% of
the planet's mass is accreted as planetesimals, and these are dominant over all other mass loss processes.
Similar results apply to super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which have only modestly greater escape
energies. This mechanism could also preferentially remove hydrogen from a planet's primordial
atmosphere, thereby leaving a larger abundance of primordial water compared to standard dry formation
models. We discuss the implications of these results for models of rocky planet formation including
Earth's formation and the possible application of this analysis to mass loss from observed exoplanets.
