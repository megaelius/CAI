Star-to-star dispersion of r-process elements has been observed in a significant number of old,
metal-poor globular clusters. We investigate early-time neutron-star mergers as the mechanism
for this enrichment. We show that neutron-star mergers cannot be induced through dynamical interactions
early in the history of the cluster, even when the most liberal assumptions about neutron-star segregation
are assumed. Therefore, if neutron-star mergers are the primary mechanism for r-process dispersion
in globular clusters, they likely result from the evolution of isolated, primordial binaries in
the clusters. Through population modeling, we find that only models where a significant number
of double neutron-star progenitors undergo a phase of mass transfer involving a naked He-star donor
give rise to enrichment fractions that are comparable to the observed number of enriched globular
clusters. Under various assumptions for the initial properties of globular clusters, we find if
the secondary phase of mass transfer from a naked He-star donor proceeds stably (unstably), a neutron-star
merger with the potential for enrichment will occur in ~2-12% (~4-25%) of globular clusters. The
strong anti-correlation between the pre-supernova orbital separation and post-supernova systemic
velocity due to mass loss in the supernova leads to efficient ejection of most enrichment candidates
from their host clusters. Thus, most enrichment events occur shortly after the double neutron stars
are born. This requires star-forming gas that can absorb the r-process ejecta to be present in the
globular cluster 30-50 Myr after the initial burst of star formation. If scenarios for redistributing
gas in globular clusters cannot act on these timescales, the number of neutron-star merger enrichment
candidates drops severely, and it is likely that another mechanism, such as r-process enrichment
from collapsars, is at play.
