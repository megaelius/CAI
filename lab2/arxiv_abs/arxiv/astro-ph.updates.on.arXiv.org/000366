We infer the local stellar-to-halo/subhalo mass relations (MRs) for central and satellite galaxies
separately. We constraint this relations by using several combinations of observational data,
consisting of the total galaxy stellar mass function, its decomposition into centrals and satellites,
and the projected two-point correlation functions measured in different stellar mass bins. The
differences among the resulting MRs are within the model-fit uncertainties (which are very small,
smaller than the intrinsic scatter between galaxy and halo mass), no matter what combination of
data are used. We also constrain the values of the intrinsic scatter around the central-halo (CH)
and satellite-subhalo (SS) MRs assuming them to be constant: sigma_c= 0.168+-0.051 dex and sigma_s
= 0.172+-0.057 dex, respectively. The CH and SS MRs are actually different, in particular when we
take the subhalo mass at the present-day epoch instead of at their accretion time. We calculate several
population statistics. We find that the central galaxy is not on average within the mass distribution
of the most-massive satellite, even for cluster-sized halos, i.e., centrals are not a mere realization
of the high-end of the satellite mass function; however for > 3x10^13 msun halos, ~15% of centrals
could be. We also find that the probabilities of MW-sized halos of having N Magellanic-Clouds (MCs)-sized
satellites agree well with observational measures; for a halo mass of 2x10^12 msun, the probability
to have 2 MCs is 5.4%, but if we exclude those systems with satellites larger than the MCs, then the
probability decreases to <2.2%.
