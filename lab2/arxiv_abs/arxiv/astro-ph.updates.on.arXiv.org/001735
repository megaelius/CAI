The classical Kuiper belt contains objects both from a low-inclination, presumably primordial,
distribution and from a high-inclination dynamically excited population. Based on a sample of
classical TNOs with observations at thermal wavelengths we determine radiometric sizes, geometric
albedos and thermal beaming factors as well as study sample properties of dynamically hot and cold
classicals. Observations near the thermal peak of TNOs using infra-red space telescopes are combined
with optical magnitudes using the radiometric technique with near-Earth asteroid thermal model
(NEATM). We have determined three-band flux densities from Herschel/PACS observations at 70.0,
100.0 and 160.0 $\mu$m and Spitzer/MIPS at 23.68 and 71.42 $\mu$m when available. We have analysed
18 classical TNOs with previously unpublished data and re-analysed previously published targets
with updated data reduction to determine their sizes and geometric albedos as well as beaming factors
when data quality allows. We have combined these samples with classical TNOs with radiometric results
in the literature for the analysis of sample properties of a total of 44 objects. We find a median geometric
albedo for cold classical TNOs of 0.14 and for dynamically hot classical TNOs, excluding the Haumea
family and dwarf planets, 0.085. We have determined the bulk densities of Borasisi-Pabu (2.1 g/cm^3),
Varda-Ilmare (1.25 g/cm^3) and 2001 QC298 (1.14 g/cm^3) as well as updated previous density estimates
of four targets. We have determined the slope parameter of the debiased cumulative size distribution
of dynamically hot classical TNOs as q=2.3 +- 0.1 in the diameter range 100<D<500 km. For dynamically
cold classical TNOs we determine q=5.1 +- 1.1 in the diameter range 160<D<280 km as the cold
classical TNOs have a smaller maximum size.
