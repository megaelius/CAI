Studies have shown that mergers of massive galaxy clusters produce shocks and turbulence in the
intra-cluster medium, the possible event responsible for creating observed radio relics, as well
as the halo structures. Here we present GMRT dual-band (235 and 610 MHz) radio observations of four
such merging cluster candidates from the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS) catalogue. Clusters are
chosen from their disturbed morphology in X-ray and elongated mass distribution in weak lensing
study to ensure their merging state. Among the proposed four clusters, three of them are detected
with diffuse radio emission. We report a flat spectrum ($\alpha\sim -1.15$), giant ($\sim$1.6
Mpc each) rare halo-relic system at low frequency radio waves from a previously known radio loud
cluster MACSJ0014.3-3022 (commonly known as Abell 2744). Our observations have also revealed
an ongoing second merger along with a close-by high-speed ($1769\pm^{148}_{359}$ km s$^{-1}$)
merger-shock ($M=2.02\pm^{17}_{41}$), thus providing a possible clue to the halo-relic co-existence.
We also report the detection of very faint, diffuse radio relic like sources with size of about 0.4-0.5
Mpc in MACSJ0025.4-1222 (previously reported at 325 MHz) and MACSJ0152.5-2852 clusters. In both
these clusters, proposed relics are found well inside the virial radius instead of their usual peripheral
location, but, having no halos associated. These high-redshift objects (z=0.584 and 0.413) are
possibly among the few known early and young merging galaxy clusters. We also report the non-detection
of diffuse radio emission from the MACSJ1931-2635 cluster at the reported rms levels in our study.
