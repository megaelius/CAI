The first massive galaxy groups in the Universe are predicted to have formed at redshifts well beyond
two. Baryonic physics, like stellar and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in this very active
epoch, are expected to have left a strong imprint on the thermo-dynamic properties of these early
galaxy groups. Therefore, observations of these groups are key to constrain the relative importance
of these physical processes. However, current instruments are not sensitive enough to detect them
easily and characterize their hot gas content. In this work, we quantify the observing power of the
Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (Athena), the future large X-ray observatory
of the European Space Agency (ESA), for discovering and characterizing early galaxy groups at high
redshifts. We used the SImulation of X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) simulator to mimic Athena observations,
and a custom-made wavelet-based algorithm to detect galaxy groups and clusters in the redshift
range $0.5 \le z \le 4$. We performed extensive X-ray spectral fitting in order to characterize their
gas temperature and X-ray luminosity. We also investigate how well Athena will constrain different
feedback mechanisms. In the deep Wide Field Imager (WFI) survey expected to be carried out during
part of Athena's first four years (the nominal mission lifetime) more than 10,000 galaxy groups
and clusters at $z\ge 0.5$ will be discovered. We find that Athena can detect $\sim20$ high-redshift
galaxy groups with masses of $M_{500}\geq$ $5\times 10^{13}$ $M_{\odot}$ and $z\geq2$, and almost
half of them will have a gas temperature determined to a precision of $\Delta T/T \le 25\%$. We demonstrate
that high-redshift galaxy groups can be detected very efficiently as extended sources by Athena
and that a key parameter determining the total number of such newly discovered sources is the area
on the sky surveyed by Athena.
