The short-lived radionuclide $^{26}$Al is widely used to determine the relative ages of chondrite
components and timescales of physical and thermal events that attended the formation of the Solar
System. However, an important assumption for using $^{26}$Al as a chronometer is its homogeneous
distribution in the disk. Yet, the oldest components in chondrites, the Ca-Al-rich inclusions
(CAIs), which are usually considered as time anchors for this chronometer, show evidence of $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al
variations independent of radioactive decay. Since their formation epoch may have been contemporaneous
with the collapse of the parent cloud that formed the disk, this suggests that $^{26}$Al was heteregeneously
distributed in the cloud. We model the collapse of such an heterogeneous cloud, using two different
$^{26}$Al distributions (monotonic and non-monotonic), and follow its re-distribution in the
first condensates and bulk dust that populate the forming disk. We find that CAIs inherit the $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al
ratio of the matter infalling at the time of their formation, so that variations of $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al
among primordial CAIs can be accounted for, independently of radioactive decay. The prevalence
of a canonical ratio among them and its necessity for the differentiation of the first planetesimals
suggest a (monotonic) scenario where $^{26}$Al sharply rose relatively close to the center of the
protosolar cloud and essentially remained at a high level outward (rather than decreased since).
As the $ ^{26}$Al abundance would be relatively homogeneous after cessation of infall, this would
warrant the use of the Al-Mg chronometer from the formation of "regular" CAIs onward, to chondrules
and chondrite accretion.
