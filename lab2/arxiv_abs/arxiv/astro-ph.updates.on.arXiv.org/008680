A central drop of ICM Fe abundance has been observed in several cool-core clusters. It has been proposed
that this abundance drop may be due, at least partially, to the depletion of Fe into dust grains in
the central, high-density regions. According to this scenario, noble gas elements such as Ar and
Ne are not expected to be depleted into dust, and therefore should not show any drop, but follow the
general increase of metal abundance toward the center. In this work, we test this scenario by measuring
with {\sl Chandra} data the radial profiles of Ar and Ne in a sample of 12 groups and clusters where
a central drop in Fe abundance has been detected. We confirm the presence of the Fe drop in 10 out of
12 clusters at more than 2$\sigma$ c.l., and 4 Ar drops with similar significance. We also find 4 Ne
drops, with the caveat that Ne abundance measurement from CCD spectra suffers from systematics
not completely under control. Our results are consistent with an abundance drop common to the three
elements. When comparing the profiles, we find that, on average, the abundance profiles of Ar and
Ne are significantly higher than Fe and steeper toward the center, while they all gradually become
consistent with solar composition at $r\geq 0.05r_{500}$. We also check that Si and S profiles are
mostly consistent with Fe. This result confirms a scenario in which some fraction of Fe is depleted
into dust grains in the inner regions, although the global central abundance drop is mostly due to
mechanical processes, like the displacement of metal-rich ICM from the very center to larger radii
by AGN-driven feedback. Finally, we report the detection of an Fe drop in the cluster MACSJ1423.8+2404
at $z=0.543$, showing that this feature appears early on in cool-core clusters.
