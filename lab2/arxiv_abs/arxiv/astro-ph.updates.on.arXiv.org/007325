We present the spectral and timing analysis of X-ray observations performed on the Galactic black
hole transient GRS 1716-249 during the 2016-2017 outburst. The source was almost continuously
observed with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory from December 2016 until October 2017. The X-ray
hardness ratio and timing evolution indicate that the source approached the soft state three times
during the outburst, even though it never reached the canonical soft spectral state. Thus, GRS 1716-249
increases the number of black hole transients showing outbursts with "failed" state transition.
During the softening events, XRT and BAT broadband spectral modeling, performed with thermal Comptonization
plus a multicolor disc black-body, showed a photon index (Gamma < 2) and an inner disc temperature
(kTin = 0.2-0.5 keV) characteristic of the hard intermediate state. This is in agreement with the
root mean square amplitude of the flux variability (rms > 10%). We find that, coherently with a scenario
in which the disc moves closer to the compact object, the accretion disc inner radius decreases with
the increase of the inner disc temperature, until a certain point when the temperature starts to
increase at constant radius. This, in addition with the spectral analysis results, suggests that
either the accretion disc reached the innermost stable circular orbit during the hard intermediate
state or the hot accretion flow might re-condensate in an inner mini-disc. We report on the radio
observations performed during the outburst finding that GRS 1716-249 is located on the radio-quiet
"outlier" branch of the radio/X-ray luminosity plane.
