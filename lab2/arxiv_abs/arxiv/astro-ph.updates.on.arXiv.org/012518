We perform numerical simulations of hydrodynamic (HD) and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence
driven by compressive driving to study generation of solenoidal velocity component and small-scale
magnetic field. We mainly focus on the effects of mean magnetic field ($B_0$) and the sonic Mach number
($M_s$). We also consider two different driving schemes in terms of correlation timescale of forcing
vectors: a finite-correlated driving and a delta-correlated driving. The former has a longer correlation
timescale of forcing vectors, which is comparable to large-eddy turnover time, than the latter.
Our findings are as follows. First, when we fix the value of $B_0$, the level of solenoidal velocity
component after saturation increases as $M_s$ increases. A similar trend is observed for generation
of magnetic field when $B_0$ is small. Second, when we fix the value of $M_s$, HD and MHD simulations
result in similar level of the solenoidal component when $B_0$ $\lesssim$ 0.2 (or Alfven Mach number
of $\sim$ 5). However, the level increases when $B_0$ $\gtrsim$ 0.2. Roughly speaking, the magnetic
energy density after saturation is a linearly increasing function of $B_0$ irrespective of $M_s$.
Third, generation of solenoidal velocity component is not sensitive to numerical resolution,
but that of magnetic energy density is mildly sensitive. Lastly, when initial conditions are same,
the finite-correlated driving always produces more solenoidal velocity and small-scale magnetic
field components than the delta-correlated driving. We additionally analyze the vorticity equation
to understand why higher $M_s$ and $B_0$ yield larger quantity of the solenoidal velocity component.
