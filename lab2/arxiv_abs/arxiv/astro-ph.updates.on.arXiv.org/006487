Cosmic shear is a primary cosmological probe for several present and upcoming surveys investigating
dark matter and dark energy, such as Euclid or WFIRST. The probe requires an extremely accurate measurement
of the shapes of millions of galaxies based on imaging data. Crucially, the shear measurement must
address and compensate for a range of interwoven nuisance effects related to the instrument optics
and detector, noise, unknown galaxy morphologies, colors, blending of sources, and selection
effects. In this paper, we explore the use of supervised machine learning (ML) as a tool to solve this
inverse problem. We present a simple architecture that learns to regress shear point estimates
and weights via shallow artificial neural networks. The networks are trained on simulations of
the forward observing process, and take combinations of moments of the galaxy images as inputs.
A challenging peculiarity of this ML application is the combination of the noisiness of the input
features and the requirements on the accuracy of the inverse regression. To address this issue,
the proposed training algorithm minimizes bias over multiple realizations of individual source
galaxies, reducing the sensitivity to properties of the overall sample of source galaxies. Importantly,
an observational selection function of these source galaxies can be straightforwardly taken into
account via the weights. We first introduce key aspects of our approach using toy-model simulations,
and then demonstrate its potential on images mimicking Euclid-like data. Finally, we analyze images
from the GREAT3 challenge, obtaining competitively low shear biases. We conclude that the further
development of ML approaches is of high interest to meet the stringent requirements on the shear
measurement in current and future surveys. We will make a python implementation of our technique
publicly available once the paper is accepted.
