A giant solar filament was visible on the solar surface from 2011 Nov. 8-23. The filament stretched
over more than half a solar diameter. Multiwavelength data from the SDO instrument AIA (171, 193,
304, and 211\AA) were used to examine counter-streaming flows within the spine of the filament.
H$\alpha$ images from the Kanzelh\"ohe Solar Observatory provided context information. We apply
local correlation tracking (LCT) to a two-hour time series on 2011 Nov. 16 of the AIA images to derive
horizontal flow velocities of the filament. To enhance the contrast of the AIA images, noise adaptive
fuzzy equalization is employed, which allows us to identify and quantify counter-streaming flows
in the filament. We detect counter-streaming flows in the filament, which are visible in the time-lapse
movies in all examined AIA wavelength bands. In the time-lapse movies we see that these persistent
flows lasted for at least two hours. Furthermore, by applying LCT to the images we clearly determine
counter-streaming flows in time series of 171 and 193\AA\ images. In the 304\AA\ wavelength band,
we only see minor indications for counter-streaming flows with LCT, while in the 211\AA\ wavelength
band the counter-streaming flows are not detectable. The average horizontal flows reach mean flow
speeds of 0.5 km/s. The highest horizontal flow speeds are identified in the 171\AA\ band with flow
speeds of up to 2.5 km/s. The results are averaged over a time series of 90 min. Because the LCT sampling
window has finite width, a spatial degradation cannot be avoided leading to lower estimates of the
flow velocities as compared to feature tracking or Doppler measurements. The counter-streaming
flows cover about 15-20% of the whole area of the EUV filament channel and are located in the central
part of the spine. In conclusion, we confirm the omnipresence of counter-streaming flows also in
giant quiet-Sun filaments.
