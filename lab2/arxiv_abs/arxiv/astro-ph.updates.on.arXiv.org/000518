Euclid is the second M-class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision programme, with the principal science
goal of studying dark energy. Euclid is also expected to undertake additional Legacy Science programmes.
One proposal is the Exoplanet Euclid Legacy Survey (ExELS) which will be the first survey able to
measure the abundance of exoplanets down to Earth mass for host separations from ~1AU out to the free-floating
(unbound) regime. The cold and free-floating exoplanet regimes represent a crucial discovery
space for testing planet formation theories. ExELS will use the gravitational microlensing technique
and will detect 1000 microlensing events per month over 1.6 deg^2 of the Galactic bulge. We assess
how many of these events will have detectable planetary signatures using a detailed multi-wavelength
microlensing simulator (MABuLS) which incorporates the Besancon Galactic model with 3D extinction.
MABuLS is the first theoretical simulation of microlensing to treat the effects of point spread
function (PSF) blending self-consistently with the underlying Galactic model. We use MABuLS,
together with current numerical models for the Euclid PSFs, to explore a number of designs and de-scope
options for ExELS, including the exoplanet yield as a function of filter choice and slewing time,
and the effect of systematic photometry errors. Using conservative extrapolations of current
empirical exoplanet mass functions determined from ground-based microlensing and radial velocity
surveys, ExELS can expect to detect a few hundred cold exoplanets around mainly G, K and M-type stellar
hosts, including ~45 Earth-mass planets and ~6 Mars-mass planets for an observing programme totalling
10 months. ExELS will be capable of measuring the cold exoplanet mass function down to Earth mass
or below, with orbital separations from ~1AU to the free-floating regime. (Abridged)
