In stellar astrophysics, the technique of population synthesis has been successfully used for
several decades. For planets, it is in contrast still a young method which only became important
in recent years because of the rapid increase of the number of known extrasolar planets, and the associated
growth of statistical observational constraints. With planetary population synthesis, the theory
of planet formation and evolution can be put to the test against these constraints. In this review
of planetary population synthesis, we first briefly list key observational constraints. Then,
the work flow in the method and its two main components are presented, namely global end-to-end models
that predict planetary system properties directly from protoplanetary disk properties and probability
distributions for these initial conditions. An overview of various population synthesis models
in the literature is given. The sub-models for the physical processes considered in global models
are described: the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, the planets' accretion of solids and gas,
orbital migration, and N-body interactions among concurrently growing protoplanets. Next, typical
population synthesis results are illustrated in the form of new syntheses obtained with the latest
generation of the Bern model. Planetary formation tracks, the distribution of planets in the mass-distance
and radius-distance plane, the planetary mass function, and the distributions of planetary radii,
semimajor axes, and luminosities are shown, linked to underlying physical processes, and compared
with their observational counterparts. We finish by highlighting the most important predictions
made by population synthesis models and discuss the lessons learned from these predictions - both
those later observationally confirmed and those rejected.
