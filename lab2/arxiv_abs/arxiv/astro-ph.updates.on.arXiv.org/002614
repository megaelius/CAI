We present new near-infrared (NIR) light-curve templates for fundamental (FU, JHK) and first overtone
(FO, J) Cepheids. The new templates together with PL and PW relations provide Cepheid distances
from single-epoch observations with a precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method
adopted. The templates rely on a very large set of Galactic and Magellanic Clouds (MCs) Cepheids
(FU,~600; FO,~200) with well sampled NIR (IRSF data) and optical (V,I; OGLE data) light curves.
To properly trace the change in the shape of the light curve as a function of period, we split the sample
of calibrating Cepheids into 10 different period bins. The templates for the first time cover FO
Cepheids and the FU short-period Cepheids (P<5 days). Moreover, the zero-point phase is anchored
to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. The new approach has several advantages
in sampling the light curve of bump Cepheids when compared with the phase of maximum light. We also
provide new estimates of the NIR-to-optical amplitude ratios for FU and FO Cepheids. We perform
detailed analytical fits using both 7th-order Fourier series and multi-Gaussian periodic functions.
The latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters (9 vs 15). Mean NIR magnitudes
based on the new templates are up to 80% more accurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50%
more accurate than mean magnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertainties
ranging from 0.015 mag (J) to 0.019 mag (K). Moreover, the errors on individual distances of Small
MC Cepheids derived from NIR PW relations, are essentially reduced to the intrinsic scatter of the
adopted relations. Thus, the new templates are the ultimate tool to estimate precise Cepheid distances
from NIR single-epoch observations, which can be adopted to derive the 3D structure of the MCs.
