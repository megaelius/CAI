We aim to investigate the impact of the ionized radiation from the M16 HII region on the surrounding
molecular cloud and on its hosted star formation. To present comprehensive multi-wavelength observations
towards the M16 HII region, we used new CO data and existing infrared, optical, and submillimeter
data. The 12CO J=1-0, 13CO J=1-0, and C18O J=1-0 data were obtained with the Purple Mountain Observatory
(PMO) 13.7m radio telescope. To trace massive clumps and extract young stellar objects (YSOs) associated
with the M16 HII region, we used the ATLASGAL and GLIMPSE I catalogs, respectively. From CO data,
we discern a large-scale filament with three velocity components. Because these three components
overlap with each other in both velocity and space, the filament may be made of three layers. The M16
ionized gas interacts with the large-scale filament and has reshaped its structure. In the large-scale
filament, we find 51 compact cores from the ATLASGAL catalog, 20 of them being quiescent. The mean
excitation temperature of these cores is 22.5 K, while this is 22.2 K for the quiescent cores. This
high temperature observed for the quiescent cores suggests that the cores may be heated by M16 and
do not experience internal heating from sources in the cores. Through the relationship between
the mass and radius of these cores, we obtain that 45% of all the cores are massive enough to potentially
form massive stars. Compared with the thermal motion, the turbulence created by the nonthermal
motion is responsible for the core formation. For the pillars observed towards M16, the H II region
may give rise to the strong turbulence.
