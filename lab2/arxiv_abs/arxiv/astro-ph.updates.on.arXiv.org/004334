With seven planets, the TRAPPIST-1 system has the largest number of exoplanets discovered in a single
system so far. The system is of astrobiological interest, because three of its planets orbit in the
habitable zone of the ultracool M dwarf. Assuming the planets are composed of non-compressible
iron, rock, and H$_2$O, we determine possible interior structures for each planet. To determine
how much tidal heat may be dissipated within each planet, we construct a tidal heat generation model
using a single uniform viscosity and rigidity for each planet based on the planet's composition.
With the exception of TRAPPIST-1c, all seven of the planets have densities low enough to indicate
the presence of significant H$_2$O in some form. Planets b and c experience enough heating from planetary
tides to maintain magma oceans in their rock mantles; planet c may have eruptions of silicate magma
on its surface, which may be detectable with next-generation instrumentation. Tidal heat fluxes
on planets d, e, and f are lower, but are still twenty times higher than Earth's mean heat flow. Planets
d and e are the most likely to be habitable. Planet d avoids the runaway greenhouse state if its albedo
is $\gtrsim$ 0.3. Determining the planet's masses within $\sim0.1$ to 0.5 Earth masses would confirm
or rule out the presence of H$_2$O and/or iron in each planet, and permit detailed models of heat production
and transport in each planet. Understanding the geodynamics of ice-rich planets f, g, and h requires
more sophisticated modeling that can self-consistently balance heat production and transport
in both rock and ice layers.
