We report multi-color optical imaging and polarimetry observations of the afterglow of the first
TeV-detected gamma-ray burst, GRB 190114C, using the RINGO3 polarimeter on the 2-m autonomous
robotic Liverpool Telescope. Observations begin $201 \,$s after the onset of the GRB and continue
until $\sim 7000 \,$ s post-burst. High temporal resolution ($\Delta {\rm t} \simeq 2.3-4.6\, {\rm
s}$) and dense sampling of the RINGO3 light curves reveal a chromatic break at ${\rm t} \sim 400- 500\,$s,
with initial temporal decay $\alpha \sim 1.5$ flattening to $\alpha \sim 1$ post-break, which we
model as a combination of reverse and forward-shock components, with magnetization parameter
$R_{\rm B} \sim 40$. The observed polarization degree ${\rm P} \sim 2 - 4\%$ remains steady throughout
the first $\sim 2000$-s observation window, with a constant position angle. Broadband spectral
energy distribution modeling of the afterglow confirms GRB 190114C is highly obscured (A$_{\rm
v, HG} = 1.49 \pm 0.12 \,$mag; N$_{\rm H, HG}= (9.0 \pm 0.03) \times 10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$). The measured
polarization is therefore dominated by dust scattering and the intrinsic polarization is low,
in contrast to ${\rm P} >10\%$ measured previously for other GRB reverse shocks. We test whether
1st and higher-order inverse Compton scattering in a magnetized reverse shock can explain the low
optical polarization and the sub-TeV emission but conclude neither is explained in the reverse
shock Inverse Compton model. Instead, the unexpectedly low intrinsic polarization degree in GRB
190114C can be explained if large-scale jet magnetic fields are distorted on timescales prior to
reverse shock emission.
