We constructed two new models for deuterium and spin-state chemistry for the purpose of modeling
the low-temperature environment prevailing in starless and pre-stellar cores. The fundamental
difference between the two models is in the treatment of ion-molecule proton-donation reactions
of the form $\rm XH^+ + Y \longrightarrow X + YH^+$, which are allowed to proceed either via full scrambling
or via direct proton hop, i.e., disregarding proton exchange. The choice of the reaction mechanism
affects both deuterium and spin-state chemistry, and in this work our main interest is on the effect
on deuterated ammonia. We applied the new models to the starless core H-MM1, where several deuterated
forms of ammonia have been observed. Our investigation slightly favors the proton hop mechanism
over full scrambling because the ammonia D/H ratios are better fit by the former model, although
neither model can reproduce the observed $\rm NH_2D$ ortho-to-para ratio of 3 (the models predict
a value of $\sim$2). Extending the proton hop scenario to hydrogen atom abstraction reactions yields
a good agreement for the spin-state abundance ratios, but greatly overestimates the deuterium
fractions of ammonia. However, one can find a reasonably good agreement with the observations with
this model by increasing the cosmic-ray ionization rate over the commonly-adopted value of $\sim$$10^{-17}\,\rm
s^{-1}$. We also find that the deuterium fractions of several other species, such as $\rm H_2CO$,
$\rm H_2O$, and $\rm CH_3$, are sensitive to the adopted proton-donation reaction mechanism. Whether
the full scrambling or proton hop mechanism dominates may be dependent on the reacting system, and
new laboratory and theoretical studies for various reacting systems are needed to constrain chemical
models.
