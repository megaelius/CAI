Using X-ray and optical afterglows, we present a systematic study on magnetic fields in Gamma-Ray
Burst (GRB) external shocks. There are 60 (35) GRBs in our X-ray (optical) sample, mostly from Swift.
We use two methods to study epsilon_B (fraction of energy in magnetic field in the shocked plasma).
1. For the X-ray sample, we use the constraint that the observed flux at the end of the X-ray steep decline
is larger than or equal to the flux from the forward shock (FS). 2. For the optical sample, we use the
condition that the observed flux arises from the FS (our optical sample light curves decline as ~t^-1
at early times as expected for the FS). Making a reasonable assumption on E (jet isotropic equivalent
kinetic energy), we converted these conditions into an upper limit (measurement) on epsilon_B
n^{2/(p+1)} for our X-ray (optical) sample, where n is the circumburst density and p is the electron
distribution power-law index. Taking n=1 cm^-3, the distribution of epsilon_B measurements (upper
limits) for our optical (X-ray) sample has a range of ~10^-8 -10^-3 (~10^-6 -10^-3) and median of
~few x 10^-5 (~few x 10^-5), showing that most bursts in our samples only require a weak magnetic field.
The largest source of uncertainty in these results is n, since it has beed determined to vary over
many orders of magnitude and its value is not known for each GRB. To characterize how much magnetic
field amplification is needed, beyond shock compression of a seed magnetic field ~10 muG, we expressed
our results in terms of an amplification factor, AF, which is very weakly dependent on n (AF propto
n^0.21 for p=2.4). The range of AF measurements (upper limits) for our optical (X-ray) sample is
~ 1-1000 (~10-300) with a median of ~50 (~50). These results suggest that some amplification, in
addition to shock compression, is needed to explain the majority of the afterglow observations
in our samples.
