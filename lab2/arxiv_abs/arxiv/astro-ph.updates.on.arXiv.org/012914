Exoplanet discoveries have demonstrated a vast range of planetary system architectures. The demographic
of compact planetary systems are especially interesting from the perspective of planetary formation
and the evolution of orbital dynamics. Another interesting demographic is that of giant planets
in eccentric orbits, since these planets have likely had a dynamical history involving planet-planet
scattering events. The WASP-47 system is particularly fascinating since it combines these two
demographics, having both compact planetary orbits and a giant planet on an eccentric orbit within
the system Habitable Zone. Here we provide an analysis of the WASP-47 system from the perspective
of atmospheric detection and characterization. We discuss the system architecture and the potential
for additional long-period planets. We simulate expected phase variations as a function of planet
orbital phase for the system due to the combined effect of the planets. We present analysis of precision
photometry of WASP-47 from the K2 mission, phased on each of the planets. The analysis rules out the
detection of phase signatures for the two inner-most planets, enabling constraints upon their
albedos and atmospheric properties. Our study concludes that WASP-47b is an example of a "dark"
planet with a tentative geometric albedo of 0.016 and a 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.17. The WASP-47e
data are consistent with a broad range of albedos, but also show early evidence of having a relatively
low albedo. The growing number of dark, short-period giant planets provide the framework of an ideal
sample for studying low albedo dependence on atmospheric composition.
