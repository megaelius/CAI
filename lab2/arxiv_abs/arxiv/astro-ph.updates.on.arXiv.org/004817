We present a sample of 40 AGN in dwarf galaxies at redshifts $z \lesssim$ 2.4. The galaxies are drawn
from the \textit{Chandra} COSMOS-Legacy survey as having stellar masses $10^{7}\leq M_{*}\leq3
\times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Most of the dwarf galaxies are star-forming. After removing the contribution
from star formation to the X-ray emission, the AGN luminosities of the 40 dwarf galaxies are in the
range $L_\mathrm{0.5-10 keV} \sim10^{39} - 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. With 12 sources at $z > 0.5$,
our sample constitutes the highest-redshift discovery of AGN in dwarf galaxies. The record-holder
is cid\_1192, at $z = 2.39$ and with $L_\mathrm{0.5-10 keV} \sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. One of the
dwarf galaxies has $M_\mathrm{*} = 6.6 \times 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$ and is the least massive galaxy
found so far to host an AGN. All the AGN are of type 2 and consistent with hosting intermediate-mass
black holes (BHs) with masses $\sim 10^{4} - 10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ and typical Eddington ratios $>
1\%$. We also study for the first time the evolution, corrected for completeness, of AGN fraction
with stellar mass, X-ray luminosity, and redshift in dwarf galaxies out to $z$ = 0.7. We find that
the AGN fraction for $10^{9}< M_{*}\leq3 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $L_\mathrm{X} \sim 10^{41}-10^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$ is $\sim$0.4\% for $z \leq$ 0.3 and that it decreases with X-ray luminosity and decreasing
stellar mass. Unlike massive galaxies, the AGN fraction is found to decrease with redshift, from
$\sim$0.2\% for $z \leq$ 0.3 and $L_\mathrm{X} \gtrsim 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to 0.04\% for $0.5
< z \leq 0.7$, suggesting that AGN in dwarf galaxies evolve differently than those in high-mass galaxies.
Mindful of potential caveats, the results seem to favor a direct collapse formation mechanism for
the seed BHs in the early Universe.
