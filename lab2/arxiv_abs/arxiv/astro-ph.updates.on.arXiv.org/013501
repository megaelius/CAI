The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed a plume of water vapor spewing out
from the south polar regions of Enceladus in occultation geometry 7 times during the Cassini mission.
Five of them yielded data resolved spatially that allowed fits to a set of individually modeled jets.
We created a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model to simulate individual water vapor jets
with the aim of fitting them to water vapor abundance along the UVIS line of sight during occultation
observations. Accurate location and attitude of spacecraft together with positions of Enceladus
and Saturn at each observation determine the relationship between the three-dimensional water
vapor number density in the plume and the two-dimensional profiles of water vapor abundances along
the line of sight recorded by UVIS. By individually fitting observed and modeled jets, every occultation
observation of UVIS presented a unique perspective to the physical properties and distribution
of the jets. The minimum velocity of water vapor in the jets is determined from the narrowest observed
individual jet profile: it ranges from 800 m/s to 1.8 km/s for the UVIS occultation observations.
41 individual jets were required to fit the highest resolution UVIS dataset taken during the Solar
occultation however, an alternative larger set of linearly-dependent jets can not be excluded
without invoking additional preferably unrelated data from other instruments. A smaller number
of jets is required to fit the stellar occultation data because of their spatial resolution and geometry.
We identify a set of 37 jets that were repeatedly present in best fits to several UVIS occultation
observations. These jets were probably active through the whole Cassini mission.
