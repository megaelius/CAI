We confirm that the number of globular clusters (GCs), N$_{GC}$, is an excellent tracer of their
host galaxy's halo virial mass M$_{vir}$. The simple linear relation M$_{vir} = 5 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}
\times$ N$_{GC}$ fits the data perfectly from M$_{vir} = 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ to M$_{vir} = 2 \times
10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$. This result is independent of galaxy morphology and extends statistically
into the dwarf galaxy regime with M$_{vir} = 10^8 - 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, including the extreme
ultra diffuse galaxy DF44. As this correlation does not depend on GC mass it is ideally suited for
high-precision determinations of M$_{vir}$. The linearity is most simply explained by cosmological
merging of a high-redshift halo seed population that hosted on average one GC per $5 \times 10^8$
M$_{\odot}$ of dark matter. We show that hierarchical merging is also extremely powerful in restoring
a linear correlation and erasing signatures of even a strong secular evolution of GC systems. The
cosmological merging scenario also implies a strong decline of the scatter in $N_{GC}$ with increasing
virial mass $\delta N_{GC}/N_{GC} \sim M_{vir}^{-1/2}$ in contrast with the observations that
show a roughly constant scatter, independent of virial mass. This discrepancy can be explained
if errors in determining virial masses from kinematical tracers and gravitational lensing are
on the order of a factor of 2. GCs in dwarf satellite galaxies pose a serious problem for high-redshift
GC formation scenarios; the dark halo masses of dwarf galaxies hosting GCs therefore might need
to be an order of magnitude larger than currently estimated.
