(abridged) We investigate the signatures left by the cosmic neutrino background on the clustering
of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space using a set of more than 1000 N-body and hydrodynamical
simulations with massless and massive neutrinos. We find that the effect neutrinos induce on the
clustering of CDM+baryons in redshift-space on small scales is almost entirely due to the change
in $\sigma_8$. Neutrinos imprint a characteristic signature in the quadrupole of the matter (CDM+baryons+neutrinos)
field on small scales, that can be used to disentangle the effect of $\sigma_8$ and $M_\nu$. We show
that the effect of neutrinos on the clustering of halos is very different, on all scales, to the one
induced by $\sigma_8$. We find that the effects of neutrinos of the growth rate of CDM+baryons ranges
from $\sim0.3\%$ to $2\%$ on scales $k\in[0.01, 0.5]~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for neutrinos with masses
$M_\nu \leqslant 0.15$ eV. We compute the bias between the momentum of halos and the momentum of CDM+baryon
and find it to be 1 on large scales for all models with massless and massive neutrinos considered.
This point towards a velocity bias between halos and total matter on large scales that it is important
to account for in order to extract unbiased neutrino information from velocity/momentum surveys
such as kSZ observations. We show that baryonic effects can affect the clustering of matter and CDM+baryons
in redshift-space by up to a few percent down to $k=0.5~h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that hydrodynamics
and astrophysical processes, as implemented in our simulations, only distort the relative effect
that neutrinos induce on the anisotropic clustering of matter, CDM+baryons and halos in redshift-space
by less than $1\%$. Thus, the effect of neutrinos in the fully non-linear regime can be written as
a transfer function with very weak dependence on astrophysics.
