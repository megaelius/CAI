Extragalactic surveys provide significant statistical data for the study of crucial galaxy parameters
used to constrain galaxy evolution, e.g. stellar mass (M$_*$) and star formation rate (SFR), under
different environmental conditions. These quantities are derived using manual or automatic methods
for galaxy detection and flux measurement in imaging data at different wavelengths. The reliability
of these automatic measurements, however, is subject to mis-identification and poor fitting due
to the morphological irregularities present in resolved nearby galaxies (e.g. clumps, tidal disturbances,
star-forming regions) and its environment (galaxies in overlap). Our aim is to provide accurate
multi-wavelength photometry (from the UV to the IR, including GALEX, SDSS, and WISE) in a sample
of $\sim$ 600 nearby (z<0.1) isolated mergers, as well as estimations of M$_*$ and SFR. We performed
photometry following a semi-automated approach using SExtractor, confirming by visual inspection
that we successfully extracted the light from the entire galaxy, including tidal tails and star-forming
regions. We used the available SED fitting code MAGPHYS in order to estimate M$_*$ and SFR. We provide
the first catalogue of isolated merging galaxies of galaxy mergers including aperture-corrected
photometry in 11 bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, r, i, z, W1, W2, W3, and W4), morphological classification,
merging stage, M$_*$, and SFR. We found that SFR and M$_*$ derived from automated catalogues can
be wrong by up to three orders of magnitude as a result of incorrect photometry. Contrary to previous
methods, our semi-automated method can reliably extract the flux of a merging system completely.
Even when the SED fitting often smooths out some of the differences in the photometry, caution using
automatic photometry is suggested as these measurements can lead to large differences in M$_*$
and SFR estimations.
