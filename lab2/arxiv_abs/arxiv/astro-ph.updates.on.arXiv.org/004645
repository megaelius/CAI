We present our observations of electromagnetic transients associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A
using optical telescopes of Chilescope observatory and Big Scanning Antenna (BSA) of Pushchino
Radio Astronomy Observatory at 110MHz. The Chilescope observatory detected an optical transient
of $\sim19^m$ on the third day in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993; we continued observations
following its rapid decrease. We put an upper limit of $1.5\times10^{4}$ Jy on any radio source with
a duration of 10-60 s which may be associated with GW170817/GRB 170817A. The prompt gamma-ray emission
consists of two distinctive components - a hard short pulse delayed by $\sim2$ seconds with respect
to the LIGO signal and softer thermal pulse with $T\sim 10 $ keV lasting for another $\sim2$ seconds.
The appearance of a thermal component at the end of the burst is unusual for short GRBs. Both the hard
and the soft components do not satisfy the Amati relation, making GRB 170817A distinctively different
from other short GRBs. Based on gamma-ray and optical observations, we develop a model for the prompt
high-energy emission associated with GRB 170817A. The merger of two neutron stars creates an accretion
torus of $\sim10^{-2} M_\odot$, which supplies the black hole with magnetic flux and confines the
Blandford-Znajek-powered jet. We associate the hard prompt spike with the quasispherical breakout
of the jet from the disk wind. As the jet plows through the wind with subrelativistic velocity, it
creates a radiation-dominated shock that heats the wind material to tens of kiloelectron volts,
producing the soft thermal component.
