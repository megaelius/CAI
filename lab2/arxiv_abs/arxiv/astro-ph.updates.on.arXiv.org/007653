Hi-resolution spectroscopy (R > 25,000) has recently emerged as one of the leading methods to detect
atomic and molecular species in the atmospheres of exoplanets. However, it has so far been lacking
in a robust method to extract quantitative constraints on temperature structure and molecular/atomic
abundances. In this work we present a novel Bayesian atmospheric retrieval framework applicable
to high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) that relies upon the cross-correlation
between data and models to extract the planetary spectral signal. We successfully test the framework
on simulated data and show that it can correctly determine Bayesian credibility intervals on atmospheric
temperatures and abundances allowing for a quantitative exploration of the inherent degeneracies.
Furthermore, our new framework permits us to trivially combine and explore the synergies between
HRCCS and low-resolution spectroscopy (LRS) to provide maximal leverage on the information contained
within each. This framework also allows us to quantitatively assess the impact of molecular line
opacities at high resolution. We apply the framework to VLT CRIRES K-band spectra of HD 209458 b and
HD 189733 b and retrieve abundant carbon monoxide but sub-solar abundances for water, largely invariant
under different model assumptions. This confirms previous analysis of these datasets, but is possibly
at odds with detections of water at different wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The framework
presented here is the first step towards a true synergy between space observatories and ground-based
hi-resolution observations.
