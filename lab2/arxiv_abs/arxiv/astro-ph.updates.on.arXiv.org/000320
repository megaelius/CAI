Phase-resolved spectroscopy of four AM CVn systems obtained with the William Herschel Telescope
and the Gran Telescopio de Canarias (GTC) is presented. SDSS\,J120841.96+355025.2 was found to
have an orbital period of 52.96$\pm$0.40\,min and shows the presence of a second bright spot in the
accretion disc. The average spectrum contains strong Mg\,{\sc i} and Si\,{\sc i/ii} absorption
lines most likely originating in the atmosphere of the accreting white dwarf. SDSS\,J012940.05+384210.4
has an orbital period of 37.555$\pm$0.003 min. The average spectrum shows the Stark broadened absorption
lines of the DB white dwarf accretor. The orbital period is close to the previously reported superhump
period of 37.9\,min. Combined, this results in a period excess $\epsilon$=0.0092$\pm$0.0054
and a mass ratio $q=0.031\pm$0.018. SDSS\,J164228.06+193410.0 displays an orbital period of
54.20$\pm$1.60\,min with an alias at 56.35\,min. The average spectrum also shows strong Mg\,{\sc
i} absorption lines, similar to SDSS\,J120841.96+355025.2. SDSS\,J152509.57+360054.50 displays
an period of 44.32$\pm$0.18\,min. The overall shape of the average spectrum is more indicative
of shorter period systems in the 20-35 minute range. The accretor is still clearly visible in the
pressure broadened absorption lines most likely indicating a hot donor star and/or a high mass accretor.
Flux ratios for several helium lines were extracted from the Doppler tomograms for the disc and bright
spot region, and compared with single-slab LTE models with variable electron densities and path
lengths to estimate the disc and bright spot temperature. A good agreement between data and the model
in three out of four systems was found for the disc region. All three systems show similar disc temperatures
of $\sim$10\,500 K. In contrast, only weak agreement between observation and models was found for
the bright spot region.
