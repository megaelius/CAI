Observations of the gravitational-wave (GW) event S190425z registered by the LIGO/Virgo detectors
with the Anti-Coincidence Shield (ACS) of the gamma-ray spectrometer SPI aboard the INTEGRAL observatory
are presented. With a high probability (>99%) it was associated with a neutron star (NS) merger in
a close binary system. This is only the second event of such type in the history of GW observations
(after GW170817). A weak gamma-ray burst, GRB190425, consisting of two pulses in ~0.5 and ~5.9 s
after the NS merging in S190425z was detected by SPI-ACS. The pulses had a priori reliability of 3.5
and 4.4 sigma as single events and 5.5 sigma as a combined event. Analysis of the SPI-ACS count rate
history recorded these days (~125 ks in total) has shown that the rate of appearance of two close pulses
with characteristics of GRB190425 by chance does not exceed 6.4 x 10^{-5} s^{-1}. We note that the
time profile of GRB190425 has a lot in common with the profile of the GRB170817A burst accompanying
the GW170817 event; that both the NS mergers were the closest (<150 Mpc) of all the events registered
by the LIGO/Virgo detectors; and that there were no confident excesses of gamma-ray emission over
the background detected in any of >30 black hole merger events recorded to the moment by these detectors.
No hard X-ray flares were detected in the field of view of the SPI and IBIS-ISGRI gamma-ray telescopes
aboard INTEGRAL. This, as well as the lack of detection of gamma-ray emission from GRB190425 by the
GBM monitor of the Fermi observatory assuming its occultation by the Earth, can significantly reduce
the localization area for the source of this GW event. The estimates of the parameters E_{iso} and
E_{p} for GRB190425 are obtained and compared with the similar parameters for GRB170817A.
