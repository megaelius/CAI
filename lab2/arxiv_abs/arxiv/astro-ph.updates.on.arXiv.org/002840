The SILCC project (SImulating the Life-Cycle of molecular Clouds) aims at a more self-consistent
understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) on small scales and its link to galaxy evolution.
We simulate the evolution of the multi-phase ISM in a 500 pc x 500 pc x 10 kpc region of a galactic disc,
with a gas surface density of $\Sigma_{_{\rm GAS}} = 10 \;{\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^2$. The Flash 4.1
simulations include an external potential, self-gravity, magnetic fields, heating and radiative
cooling, time-dependent chemistry of H$_2$ and CO considering (self-) shielding, and supernova
(SN) feedback. We explore SN explosions at different (fixed) rates in high-density regions (peak),
in random locations (random), in a combination of both (mixed), or clustered in space and time (clustered).
Only random or clustered models with self-gravity (which evolve similarly) are in agreement with
observations. Molecular hydrogen forms in dense filaments and clumps and contributes 20% - 40%
to the total mass, whereas most of the mass (55% - 75%) is in atomic hydrogen. The ionised gas contributes
<10%. For high SN rates (0.5 dex above Kennicutt-Schmidt) as well as for peak and mixed driving
the formation of H$_2$ is strongly suppressed. Also without self-gravity the H$_2$ fraction is
significantly lower ($\sim$ 5%). Most of the volume is filled with hot gas ($\sim$90% within $\pm$2
kpc). Only for random or clustered driving, a vertically expanding warm component of atomic hydrogen
indicates a fountain flow. Magnetic fields have little impact on the final disc structure. However,
they affect dense gas ($n\gtrsim 10\;{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and delay H$_2$ formation. We highlight that
individual chemical species, in particular atomic hydrogen, populate different ISM phases and
cannot be accurately accounted for by simple temperature-/density-based phase cut-offs.
