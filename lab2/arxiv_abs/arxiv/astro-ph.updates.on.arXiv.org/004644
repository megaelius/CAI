We study the merger of black hole-neutron star binaries by fully general-relativistic neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations throughout the coalescence, particularly focusing on the role of neutrino irradiation
in dynamical mass ejection. Neutrino transport is incorporated by an approximate transfer scheme
based on the truncated moment formalism. While we fix the mass ratio of the black hole to the neutron
star to be 4 and the dimensionless spin parameter of the black hole to be 0.75, the equations of state
for finite-temperature neutron-star matter are varied. The hot accretion disk formed after tidal
disruption of the neutron star emits a copious amount of neutrinos with the peak total luminosity
~1--3x10^53 erg s^(-1) via thermal pair production and subsequent electron/positron captures
on free nucleons. Nevertheless, the neutrino irradiation does not modify significantly the electron
fraction of the dynamical ejecta from the neutrinoless beta-equilibrium value at zero temperature
of initial neutron stars. The mass of the wind component driven by neutrinos from the remnant disk
is negligible compared to the very neutron-rich dynamical component, throughout our simulations
performed until a few tens milliseconds after the onset of merger, for the models considered in this
study. These facts suggest that the ejecta from black hole-neutron star binaries are very neutron
rich and are expected to accommodate strong r-process nucleosynthesis, unless magnetic or viscous
processes contribute substantially to the mass ejection from the disk. We also find that the peak
neutrino luminosity does not necessarily increase as the disk mass increases, because tidal disruption
of a compact neutron star can result in a remnant disk with a small mass but high temperature.
