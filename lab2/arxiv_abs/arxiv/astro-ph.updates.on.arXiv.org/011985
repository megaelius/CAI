We compare the performance of four state-of-the-art models for extracting isotropic measurements
of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale. To do this, we created a new, public, modular code
Barry, which contains datasets, model fitting tools, and model implementations incorporating
different descriptions of non-linear physics and algorithms for isolating the BAO feature. These
are then evaluated for bias, correlation, and fitting strength using mock power spectra and correlation
functions developed for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12. Our main findings are as follows:
1) All of the models can recover unbiased constraints when fit to the pre- and post-reconstruction
simulations. 2) Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using
e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average,
although the distribution of mock $\chi^{2}$ values indicates these are underestimated. 3) Allowing
the BAO damping scale to vary can provide tighter constraints for some mocks, but is an artificial
improvement that only arises when noise randomly sharpens the BAO peak. 4) Unlike recent claims
in the literature when utilising a BAO Extractor technique, we find no improvement in the accuracy
of the recovered BAO scale. 5) We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus
result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties.
Overall, Barry provides an excellent framework for performing the cosmological analyses for upcoming
surveys, and for rapidly testing and validating new models.
