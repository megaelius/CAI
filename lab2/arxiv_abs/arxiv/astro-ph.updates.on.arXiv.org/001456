Far-infrared and submillimeter wavelength surveys have now established the important role of
dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the assembly of stellar mass and the evolution of massive
galaxies in the Universe. The brightest of these galaxies have infrared luminosities in excess
of 10$^{13}$ L$_{\odot}$ with implied star-formation rates of thousands of solar masses per year.
They represent the most intense starbursts in the Universe, yet many are completely optically obscured.
Their easy detection at submm wavelengths is due to dust heated by ultraviolet radiation of newly
forming stars. When summed up, all of the dusty, star-forming galaxies in the Universe produce an
infrared radiation field that has an equal energy density as the direct starlight emission from
all galaxies visible at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. The bulk of this infrared extragalactic
background light emanates from galaxies as diverse as gas-rich disks to mergers of intense starbursting
galaxies. Major advances in far-infrared instrumentation in recent years, both space-based and
ground-based, has led to the detection of nearly a million DSFGs, yet our understanding of the underlying
astrophysics that govern the start and end of the dusty starburst phase is still in nascent stage.
This review is aimed at summarizing the current status of DSFG studies, focusing especially on the
detailed characterization of the best-understood subset (submillimeter galaxies, who were summarized
in the last review of this field over a decade ago, Blain et al., 2002), but also the selection and characterization
of more recently discovered DSFG populations. We review DSFG population statistics, their physical
properties including dust, gas and stellar contents, their environments, and current theoretical
models related to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.
