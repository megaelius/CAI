The birth of stars and the formation of galaxies are cornerstones of modern astrophysics. While
much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental
property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the
birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function (IMF), is a key
tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar
evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution.
The past decade has seen a growing number and variety of methods for measuring or inferring the shape
of the IMF, along with progressively more detailed simulations, paralleled by refinements in the
way the concept of the IMF is applied or conceptualised on different physical scales. This range
of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting
conclusions regarding whether or not the IMF is universal. Here I review and compare the growing
wealth of approaches to our understanding of this fundamental property that defines so much of astrophysics.
I summarise the observational measurements from stellar analyses, extragalactic studies and
cosmic constraints, and highlight the importance of considering potential IMF variations, reinforcing
the need for measurements to quantify their scope and uncertainties carefully, in order for this
field to progress. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the IMF and promote clarity in
the further development of this fundamental field.
