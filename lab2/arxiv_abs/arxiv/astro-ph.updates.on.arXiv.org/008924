We show that the $P\sim8\,{\rm h}$ photometric period and the astrometrically measured $A_{\rm
ng}\sim2.5\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm\,s^{-2}}$ non-gravitational acceleration (at $r\sim1.4\,{\rm
AU}$) of the interstellar object 1I/2017 (`Oumuamua) can be explained by a nozzle-like venting
of volatiles whose activity migrated to track the sub-solar location on the object's surface. Adopting
the assumption that `Oumuamua was an elongated $a\times b \times c$ ellipsoid, this model produces
a pendulum-like rotation of the body and implies a long semi-axis $a\sim 5A_{\rm ng}P^2/4\pi^2
\sim 260\,{\rm m}$. This scale agrees with the independent estimates of `Oumuamua's size that stem
from its measured brightness, assuming an albedo of $p\sim0.1$, appropriate to ices that have undergone
long-duration exposure to the interstellar cosmic ray flux. Using ray-tracing, we generate light
curves for ellipsoidal bodies that are subject to both physically consistent sub-solar torques
and to the time-varying geometry of the Sun-Earth-`Oumuamua configuration. Our synthetic light
curves display variations from chaotic tumbling and changing cross-sectional illumination that
are consistent with the observations, while avoiding significant secular changes in the photometric
periodicity. If our model is correct, `Oumuamua experienced mass loss that wasted $\sim 10\%$ of
its total mass during the $\sim 100\,{\rm d}$ span of its encounter with the inner Solar System and
had an icy composition with a very low $[{\rm C}/{\rm O}]\lesssim 0.003$. Our interpretation of
`Oumuamua's behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that it was ejected from either the outer
regions of a planetesimal disk after an encounter with an embedded $M_{\rm p} \sim M_{\rm Nep}$ planet
or from an exo-Oort cloud.
