We present the dust mass function (DMF) of 15,750 galaxies with redshift $z< 0.1$, drawn from the
overlapping area of the GAMA and {\it H-}ATLAS surveys. The DMF is derived using the density corrected
$V_{\rm max}$ method, where we estimate $V_{\rm max}$ using: (i) the normal photometric selection
limit ($pV_{\rm max}$) and (ii) a bivariate brightness distribution (BBD) technique, which accounts
for two selection effects. We fit the data with a Schechter function, and find $M^{*}=(4.65\pm0.18)\times
10^{7}\,h^2_{70}\, M_{\odot}$, $\alpha=(1.22\pm 0.01)$, $\phi^{*}=(6.26\pm 0.28)\times
10^{-3}\,h^3_{70}\,\rm Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}$. The resulting dust mass density parameter integrated
down to $10^4\,M_{\odot}$ is $\Omega_{\rm d}=(1.11 \pm0.02)\times 10^{-6}$ which implies the
mass fraction of baryons in dust is $f_{m_b}=(2.40\pm0.04)\times 10^{-5}$; cosmic variance adds
an extra 7-17\,per\,cent uncertainty to the quoted statistical errors. Our measurements have
fewer galaxies with high dust mass than predicted by semi-analytic models. This is because the models
include too much dust in high stellar mass galaxies. Conversely, our measurements find more galaxies
with high dust mass than predicted by hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. This is likely
to be from the long timescales for grain growth assumed in the models. We calculate DMFs split by galaxy
type and find dust mass densities of $\Omega_{\rm d}=(0.88\pm0.03)\times 10^{-6}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
d}=(0.060\pm0.005)\times 10^{-6}$ for late-types and early-types respectively. Comparing
to the equivalent galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMF) we find that the DMF for late-types is well
matched by the GMSF scaled by $(8.07\pm0.35) \times 10^{-4}$.
