We carry out spherical Jeans modeling of nearly round pure-bulge galaxies selected from the \atl
sample. Our modeling allows for gradients in the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M_\star/L$) through
analytic prescriptions parameterized with a `gradient strength' $K$ introduced to accommodate
any viable gradient. We use a generalized Osipkov-Merritt model for the velocity dispersion (VD)
anisotropy. We produce Monte Carlo sets of models based on the stellar VD profiles under both the
$\Lambda$CDM and MOND paradigms. Here we describe the galaxy data, the empirical inputs, and the
modeling procedures of obtaining the Monte Carlo sets. We then present the projected dynamical
stellar mass, $M_{\rm \star e}$, within the effective radius $R_{\rm e}$, and the fundamental mass
plane (FMP) as a function of $K$. We find the scaling of the $K$-dependent mass with respect to the
\atl reported mass as: $\log_{10} \left[M_{\star{\rm e}}(K)/M_{\star{\rm e}}^{\rm A3D} \right]
= a' + b' K$ with $a'=-0.019\pm 0.012$ and $b'=-0.18\pm 0.02$ ($\Lambda$CDM), or $a'=-0.023\pm
0.014$ and $b'=-0.23\pm 0.03$ (MOND), for $0\le K < 1.5$. The FMP has coefficients consistent with
the virial expectation and only the zero point scales with $K$. The median value of $K$ for the \atl
galaxies is $\langle K\rangle =0.53^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$. We perform a similar analysis of the much
larger SDSS DR7 spectroscopic sample. In this case, the VD within a single aperture is only available,
so we impose the additional requirement that the VD slope be similar to that in the \atl galaxies.
Our analysis of the SDSS galaxies suggests a positive correlation of $K$ with stellar mass.
