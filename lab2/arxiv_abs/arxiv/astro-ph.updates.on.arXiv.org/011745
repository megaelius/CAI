Coagulation of dust aggregates plays an important role in the formation of planets and is of key importance
to the evolution of protoplanetary disks (PPDs). Characteristics of dust, such as the diversity
of particle size, porosity, charge, and the manner in which dust couples to turbulent gas, affect
the collision outcome and the rate of dust growth. Here we present a numerical model of the evolution
of the dust population within a PPD which incorporates all of these effects. The probability that
any two particles collide depends on the particle charge, cross-sectional area and their relative
velocity. The actual collision outcome is determined by a detailed collision model which takes
into account the aggregate morphology, trajectory, orientation, and electrostatic forces acting
between charged grains. The data obtained in this research reveal the characteristics of dust populations
in different environments at the end of the hit-and-stick growth, which establishes the foundation
for the onset of the next growth stage where bouncing, mass transfer and fragmentation become important.
For a given level of turbulence, neutral and weakly charged particles collide more frequently and
grow faster than highly charged particles. However, highly charged particles grow to a larger size
before reaching the bouncing barrier, and exhibit a "Runaway" growth, in which a few large particles
grow quickly by accreting smaller particles while the rest of the population grows very slowly.
In general, highly charged aggregates have a more compact structure and are comprised of larger
monomers than neutral/weakly charged aggregates. The differences in the particle structure/composition
not only affect the threshold velocities for bouncing and fragmentation, but also change the scattering
and absorption opacity of dust, influencing the appearance of PPDs.
