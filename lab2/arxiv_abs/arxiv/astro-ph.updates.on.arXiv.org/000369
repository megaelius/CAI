We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the vicinity of an ultra-strong MgII
\lambda\lambda 2786,2803 absorber of rest-frame absorption equivalent width W_r(2796)=4.2\AA\
at z=0.5624. This absorber was originally found at projected separation \rho=246 kpc of a luminous
red galaxy (LRG) at z=0.5604. Magellan IMACs spectroscopy has revealed two galaxies at \rho <
60 kpc (z=0.5623 and z=0.5621) and a third one at \rho=209 kpc (z=0.5623) near the redshift of the
absorber.These findings indicate that the absorbing gas resides in a group environment. Combining
SDSS broadband photometry with additional B-, K_s-band images and optical spectroscopy, we perform
a stellar population synthesis analysis of the group members to characterize their star formation
histories, on-going star formation rates (SFR), and stellar masses. We find that the two group members
at \rho < 60 kpc are best characterized by old stellar populations (>1 Gyr) and little on-going
star formation activity (SFR<2.9 \msun/yr), while the third object at \rho=209 kpc exhibit
[OII]- and continuum-derived SFR consistent with SFR>3.0 \msun/yr. Including the two ultra-strong
MgII absorbers analyzed by Nestor et al. (2011), this is the third ultra-strong MgII absorber for
which a detailed study of the galactic environment is available. All three aborbers are found in
galaxy groups. We examine different physical mechanisms giving rise to the absorbing gas including
starburst driven-outflows, cold filaments, extended rotating disks, and stripped gas. We argue
that the large equivalent width observed in these absorbers is more likely due to the gas dynamics
of the intragroup medium rather than driven by starburst outflows.
