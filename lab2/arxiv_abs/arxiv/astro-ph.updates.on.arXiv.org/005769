GRB 111209A, one of the longest Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) ever observed, is linked to SN 2011kl, the
most luminous GRB-Supernova (SN) detected so far, which shows evidence for being powered by a magnetar
central engine. We place SN 2011kl into the context of large samples of SNe, addressing in more detail
the question of whether it could be radioactively powered, and whether it represents an extreme
version of a GRB-SN or an underluminous Superluminous SN (SLSN). We model SN 2011kl using SN 1998bw
as a template and derive a bolometric light curve including near-infrared data. We compare the properties
of SN 2011kl to literature results on stripped-envelope and superluminous supernovae. Comparison
in the k,s context, i.e., comparing it to SN 1998bw templates in terms of luminosity and light-curve
stretch, clearly shows SN 2011kl is the most luminous GRB-SN to date, and it is spectrally very dissimilar
to other events, being significantly bluer/hotter. Although SN 2011kl does not reach the classical
luminosity threshold of SLSNe and evolves faster than any of them, it resembles SLSNe more than the
classical GRB-associated broad-lined Type Ic SNe in several aspects. GRB 111209A was a very energetic
event, both at early (prompt emission) and at very late (SN) times. We have shown in a further publication
that with the exception of the extreme duration, the GRB and afterglow parameters are in agreement
with the known distributions for these parameters. SN 2011kl, on the other hand, is exceptional
both in luminosity and spectral characteristics, indicating that GRB 111209A was likely not powered
by a standard-model collapsar central engine, further supporting our earlier conclusions. Instead,
it reveals the possibility of a direct link between GRBs and SLSNe.
