Recently Assef et al.(2018) presented two catalogs of AGN candidates over 30,093 deg^2 selected
from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) observations. From their most reliable sample,
Assef et al. (2018) identified 45 AGN candidates with the highest variability levels in the AllWISE
catalog, but that are not blazars. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of some of these
targets to further constrain their nature. We also study their optical lightcurves using observations
from CRTS, and find that only seven show significant optical variability, and that five of those
seven are spectroscopically classified as AGN. In one of them, WISEA J094806.56+031801.7 (W0948+0318),
we identify a transient event in the CRTS lightcurve. We present a detailed analysis of this transient,
and characterize it through its CRTS lightcurve and its multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution
obtained from GALEX, Pan-STARRS and WISE observations. We find that the most likely source of the
transient is a super-luminous supernova (SLSN) in W0948+0318. We estimate the total radiated energy
to be E=1.6\pm 0.3 x 10^52 erg, making it one of the most energetic SLSN observed. Based on the lack
of change in mid-IR color throughout and after the transient event, we speculate that the location
of the SLSN is within the torus of the AGN. We identify 9 possible analogs to W0948+0318 based on their
WISE lightcurves. None show optically detected transients and hence suggest significant dust
obscuration. Finally, we estimate a rate of >2x10^-7 yr^-1 per AGN for these transients under the
conservative assumption that none of the identified analogs have a common origin with the transient
in W0948+0318.
