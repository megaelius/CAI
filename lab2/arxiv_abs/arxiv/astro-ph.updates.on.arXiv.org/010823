The radius $R_{1.4}$ of neutron stars (NSs) with a mass of 1.4 M$_{\odot}$ has been extracted consistently
in many recent studies in the literature. Using representative $R_{1.4}$ data, we infer high-density
nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the associated nucleon specific energy $E_0(\rho)$
in symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) within a Bayesian statistical approach using an explicitly isospin-dependent
parametric Equation of State (EOS) for nucleonic matter. We found that: (1) The available astrophysical
data can already improve significantly our current knowledge about the EOS in the density range
of $\rho_0-2.5\rho_0$. In particular, the symmetry energy at twice the saturation density $\rho_0$
of nuclear matter is determined to be $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(2\rho_0)$ =39.2$_{-8.2}^{+12.1}$ MeV
at 68\% confidence level. (2) A precise measurement of the $R_{1.4}$ alone with a 4\% 1$\sigma$ statistical
error but no systematic error will not improve much the constraints on the EOS of dense neutron-rich
nucleonic matter compared to what we extracted from using the available radius data. (3) The $R_{1.4}$
radius data and other general conditions, such as the observed NS maximum mass and causality condition
introduce strong correlations for the high-order EOS parameters. Consequently, the high-density
behavior of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ inferred depends strongly on how the high-density SNM EOS $E_0(\rho)$
is parameterized, and vice versa. (4) The value of the observed maximum NS mass and whether it is used
as a sharp cut-off for the minimum maximum mass or through a Gaussian distribution affect significantly
the lower boundaries of both the $E_0(\rho)$ and $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ only at densities higher
than about $2.5\rho_0$.
