Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarfs are prominent future targets when searching for life outside
the solar system. We apply our newly developed Coupled Atmosphere Biogeochemistry model to investigate
the coupling between the biosphere, geosphere and atmosphere to gain deeper insight into the atmospheric
evolution of Earth-like planets orbiting M-dwarfs. Our main goal is to understand better atmospheric
processes affecting biosignatures and climate on such worlds. Furthermore, this is the first study
to our knowledge which applies an automated chemical pathway analysis quantifying the production
and destruction pathways of O$_2$ for an Earth-like planet with an Archean O$_2$ abundance orbiting
in the habitable zone of the M-dwarf AD Leo. Results suggest that the main production arises in the
upper atmosphere from CO$_2$ photolysis followed by catalytic HO$_x$ reactions. The strongest
destruction does not take place in the troposphere, as was the case in Gebauer et al. (2017) for an
early-Earth analog planet around the Sun, but instead in the middle atmosphere where H$_2$O photolysis
is the strongest. This result was driven by the strong Lyman-$\alpha$-radiation output of AD Leo,
which efficiently photolyzes H$_2$O. Results further suggest that early Earth-like atmospheres
of planets orbiting an M-dwarf like AD Leo are in absolute terms less destructive for atmospheric
O$_2$ than for early-Earth analog planets around the Sun despite higher concentrations of reduced
gases such as e.g. H$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. Hence the net primary productivity (NPP) required to produce
the same amount of atmospheric O$_2$ at the surface is reduced. This implies that a possible Great
Oxidation event, analogous to that on Earth, would have occurred earlier in time in analog atmospheres
around M-dwarfs.
