In this work we investigate the generation of mock halo catalogues based on perturbation theory
and nonlinear stochastic biasing with the novel PATCHY-code. In particular, we use Augmented Lagrangian
Perturbation Theory (ALPT) to generate a dark matter density field on a mesh starting from Gaussian
fluctuations and to compute the peculiar velocity field. ALPT is based on a combination of second
order LPT (2LPT) on large scales and the spherical collapse model on smaller scales. We account for
the systematic deviation of perturbative approaches from N-body simulations together with halo
biasing adopting an exponential bias model. We then account for stochastic biasing by defining
three regimes: a low, an intermediate and a high density regime, using a Poisson distribution in
the intermediate regime and the negative binomial distribution to model over-dispersion in the
high density regime. Since we focus in this study on massive halos, we suppress the generation of
halos in the low density regime. The various nonlinear and stochastic biasing parameters, and density
thresholds (five) are calibrated with the large BigMultiDark N-body simulation to match the power
spectrum of the corresponding halo population. Our mock catalogues show power spectra, both in
real- and redshift-space, which are compatible with N-body simulations within about 2% up to k ~
1 h Mpc^-1 at z = 0.577 for a sample of halos with the typical BOSS CMASS galaxy number density. The corresponding
correlation functions are compatible down to a few Mpc. We also find that neglecting over-dispersion
in high density regions produces power spectra with deviations of 10% at k ~ 0.4 h Mpc^-1. These results
indicate the need to account for an accurate statistical description of the galaxy clustering for
precise studies of large-scale surveys.
