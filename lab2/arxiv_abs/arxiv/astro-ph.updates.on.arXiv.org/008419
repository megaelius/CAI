In AGN feedback study, it is crucial to precisely determine the accretion rate of AGN and properly
adopt the AGN physics, since they determine the AGN radiation and wind outputs. One key feature of
such an AGN physics is that, depending on the value of the accretion rate, accretion is divided into
two modes, namely hot and cold, corresponding to below and above $2\% L_{\rm Edd}$ respectively.
In this paper we investigate the role of the hot mode by performing hydrodynamical numerical simulations
of AGN feedback in an isolated elliptical galaxy. We have run two test models. In one model, we always
adopt the cold mode accretion physics no matter what value the accretion rate is; in another model,
we turn off the AGN outputs once the accretion is in the hot mode. We have calculated the AGN light curves,
black hole growth, star formation, and AGN energy duty-cycle and compared the results of these two
models with the model in which the two modes are correctly taken into account. Important differences
are found. For example, if we would adopt only the cold mode, compared to the model considering both
modes, the AGN luminosity would become significantly smaller, the total mass of newly formed stars
would become two orders of magnitude smaller, and the fraction of energy ejected within the high
accretion regime (i.e., $L_{\rm BH} > 2\% L_{\rm Edd}$) would be very small ($\ll 10^{-3}$), inconsistent
with observations. These results strongly indicate the importance of hot mode feedback, which
is because the time fraction of being in this mode is very large. We have also investigated the roles
of wind and radiation in the hot mode and found that usually wind is more important than radiation;
but, depending on the problem, radiation also cannot be neglected.
