Flux ropes (FRs) ejected from the Sun may change their geometrical orientation during their evolution
which directly affects their geoeffectiveness. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how solar
FRs evolve in the heliosphere to improve our space weather forecasting tools. We analyze 15 coronal
mass ejections (CMEs), with clear FR signatures, observed during the decay of Solar Cycle 23 and
rise of Solar Cycle 24. We estimate initial orientations of the FRs at the origin using extreme ultraviolet
observations of post-eruption arcades and/or eruptive prominences. Then we reconstruct multiviewpoint
coronagraph observations of the CMEs from ~2 to 30 Rs with a three-dimensional geometric representation
of a FR to determine their geometrical parameters. Finally, we propagate the FRs from ~30 Rs to 1 AU
through MHD-simulated background solar wind while using in-situ measurements at 1 AU of the associated
magnetic cloud as a constraint for the propagation technique. These methodology allows us to estimate
the FR orientation all the way from the Sun to 1 AU. We find that while the FRs deflection occurs predominantly
below 30 Rs, a significant amount of deflection and rotation happens between 30 Rs and 1 AU. We compare
the FR orientation to the local orientation of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). We find that
slow FRs tend to align with the streams of slow solar wind in the inner heliosphere. During the solar
cycle minimum the slow solar wind channel as well as the HCS usually occupy the area in the vicinity
of the solar equatorial plane, which in the past led researchers to the hypothesis that FRs align
with the HCS. Our results show that exclusions from this rule are explained by interaction with the
Parker-spiralled background magnetic field, which dominates over the magnetic interaction with
the HCS in the inner heliosphere at least during solar minimum conditions.
