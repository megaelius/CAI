The recent announcement of a Neptune-sized exomoon candidate around the transiting Jupiter-sized
object Kepler-1625 b could indicate the presence of a hitherto unknown kind of gas giant moons, if
confirmed. Three transits have been observed, allowing radius estimates of both objects. Here
we investigate possible mass regimes of the transiting system that could produce the observed signatures
and study them in the context of moon formation in the solar system, i.e. via impacts, capture, or
in-situ accretion. The radius of Kepler-1625 b suggests it could be anything from a gas giant planet
somewhat more massive than Saturn (0.4 M_Jup) to a brown dwarf (BD) (up to 75 M_Jup) or even a very-low-mass
star (VLMS) (112 M_Jup ~ 0.11 M_sun). The proposed companion would certainly have a planetary mass.
Possible extreme scenarios range from a highly inflated Earth-mass gas satellite to an atmosphere-free
water-rock companion of about 180 M_Ear. Furthermore, the planet-moon dynamics during the transits
suggest a total system mass of 17.6_{-12.6}^{+19.2} M_Jup. A Neptune-mass exomoon around a giant
planet or low-mass BD would not be compatible with the common mass scaling relation of the solar system
moons about gas giants. The case of a mini-Neptune around a high-mass BD or a VLMS, however, would
be located in a similar region of the satellite-to-host mass ratio diagram as Proxima b, the TRAPPIST-1
system, and LHS 1140 b. The capture of a Neptune-mass object around a 10 M_Jup planet during a close
binary encounter is possible in principle. The ejected object, however, would have had to be a super-Earth
object, raising further questions of how such a system could have formed. In summary, this exomoon
candidate is barely compatible with established moon formation theories. If it can be validated
as orbiting a super-Jovian planet, then it would pose an exquisite riddle for formation theorists
to solve.
