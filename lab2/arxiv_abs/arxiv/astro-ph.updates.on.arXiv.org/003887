Detection of prompt emission by Swift-XRT provides a unique tool to study how the prompt spectrum
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) extends down to the soft X-ray band. This energy band is particularly
important for prompt emission studies, since it is towards low energies that the observed spectral
shape is in disagreement with the synchrotron predictions. Unfortunately, the number of cases
where XRT started observing the GRB location during the prompt phase is very limited. In this work
we collect a sample of 34 GRBs and perform joint XRT+BAT spectral analysis of prompt radiation, extending
a previous study focused on the 14 brightest cases. Fermi-GBM observations are included in the analysis
when available (13 cases), allowing the characterization of prompt spectra from soft X-rays to
MeV energies. In $62\%$ of the spectra, the XRT data reveal a hardening of the spectrum, well described
by introducing an additional, low-energy power-law segment (with index $\alpha_1$) into the empirical
fitting function. The break energy below which the spectrum hardens takes values between $\rm 3\,keV$
and $\rm 30\,keV$. A second power-law ($\alpha_2$) describes the spectrum between the break energy
and the peak energy. The mean values of the photon indices are $\langle\alpha_1\rangle=-0.51$
($\sigma=0.29$) and $\langle\alpha_2\rangle=-1.54$ ($\sigma=0.26$). These are consistent,
within one $\sigma$, with the synchrotron values in fast cooling regime. As a test, if we exclude
XRT data from the fits we find typical results: the spectrum below the peak energy is described by
a power law with $\langle\alpha\rangle=-1.15$. This shows the relevance of soft X-ray data in revealing
prompt emission spectra consistent with synchrotron spectra. Finally, we do not find any correlation
between the presence of the X-ray break energy and the flux, fluence or duration of the prompt emission.
