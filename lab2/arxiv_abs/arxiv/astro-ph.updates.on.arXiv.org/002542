Context: Massive stars are extremely important for the evolution of the galaxies; there are large
gaps in our understanding of their properties and formation, however, mainly because they evolve
rapidly, are rare, and distant. It may well be that almost all massive stars are born as triples or
higher multiples, but their large distances require very high angular resolution to directly detect
the companions at milliarcsecond scales. Aims: Herschel36 is a young massive system located at
1.3 kpc. It has a combined smallest predicted mass of 45 M_sun. Multi-epoch spectroscopic data suggest
the existence of at least three gravitationally bound components. Two of them, system Ab, are tightly
bound in a spectroscopic binary, and the third one, component Aa, orbits in a wider orbit. Our aim
was to image and obtain astrometric and photometric measurements of components Aa and Ab using,
for the first time, long-baseline optical interferometry to further constrain its nature. Methods:
We observed Herschel 36 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER attached to the ESO VLT Interferometer,
which provides an angular resolution of approx. 2 mas. We used the code BSMEM to perform the interferometric
image reconstruction. We fitted the interferometric observables using proprietary IDL routines
and the code LitPro. Results: We imaged the Aa+Ab components of Herschel 36 in H and K filters. Component
Ab is located at a projected distance of 1.81 mas, at a position angle of approx. 222 deg. east of north,
the flux ratio between components Aa and Ab is close to one. The small measured angular separation
indicates that system Ab and Ab may be approaching the periastron of their orbits. These results,
only achievable with long-baseline near-infrared interferometry, constitute the first step
toward a thorough understanding of this massive triple system.
