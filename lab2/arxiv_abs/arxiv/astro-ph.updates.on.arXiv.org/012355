Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies are a rare population of galaxies that host living high-mass stars during
their WR phase (i.e. WR stars), and are thus expected to provide interesting constraints on the stellar
Initial Mass Function, massive star formation, stellar evolution models, etc. Spatially resolved
spectroscopy should in principle provide a more efficient way of identifying WR galaxies than single-fiber
surveys of galactic centers such as SDSS, as WR stars should be more preferentially found in discs.
Using Integral Field Unit data from the ongoing SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, we have performed a thorough
search for WR galaxies in a two-step method. We first identify HII regions in each datacube and carry
out full spectral fitting to the stacked spectra. We then visually inspect the residual spectrum
of each HII region and identify WR regions that present a significant ``blue bump'' at 4600-4750
\r{A}. The resulting WR catalog includes 267 WR regions of $\sim$500 pc (radius) sizes, distributed
in 90 galaxies from the current sample of MaNGA (MaNGA Product Launch 7). We find WR regions are exclusively
found in galaxies that show bluest colors and highest star formation rates for their mass, as well
as late-type dominated morphologies and lower-than-average S\'ersic indices. We estimate the
stellar mass function of WR galaxies and the mass-dependent detection rate. The detection rate
of WR galaxies is typically $\sim$2%, with weak dependence on stellar mass. This detection rate
is about 40 times higher than previous studies with SDSS single fiber data, and a factor of 2 lower
than the CALIFA-based WR catalog. We make comparisons with SDSS and CALIFA studies, and conclude
that different detection rates of different studies can be explained mainly by three factors: spatial
coverage, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift ranges of the parent sample.
