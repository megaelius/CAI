Despite the insights gained in the last few years, the formation and evolution scenario of the spheroid-dominated
galaxies is still incomplete. New and more powerful simulations have been developed that together
with more precise observations open the possibility to study in more detail the formation of early-type
galaxies (ETGs). The aim of this work is to analyse the assembly histories of ETGs in a L-CDM cosmology,
focusing on the archeological approach given by the mass growth histories. We inspect a sample of
dispersion-dominated galaxies selected from the largest volume simulation of the EAGLE project.
This simulation includes a variety of physical processes such as radiative cooling, star formation,
metal enrichment and stellar and AGN feedback. The selected sample comprised 508 spheroid-dominated
galaxies classified according to their dynamical properties. Their surface brightness profile,
the fundamental relations, kinematic properties and stellar mass growth histories are estimated
and analysed. The findings are confronted with recent observations. The simulated ETGs are found
to reproduce globally the fundamental relations of ellipticals. All of them have an inner disc component
where residual younger stellar populations (SPs) are detected. The fraction of this inner disc
correlates with bulge-to-total ratio. We find a relation between kinematics and shape which implies
that dispersion-dominated galaxies with low V/sigmaL tend to have ellipticity smaller than aprox
0.5 and are dominated by old stars. On average, less massive galaxies host slightly younger stars.
More massive spheroids show coeval SPs while for smaller galaxies, there is a clear trend to have
rejuvenated inner regions. The age gap detected between the inner and the outer regions grows from
aprox 0.5 Gyr for massive EAGLE spheroid-dominated galaxies to aprox 2 Gyr for the smaller analysed
systems.Abridged
