Using analytical and numerical methods (fluid and particle-in-cell simulations) we study a number
of model problems involving merger of magnetic flux tubes in relativistic magnetically-dominated
plasma. Mergers of current-carrying flux tubes (exemplified by the two dimensional `ABC' structures)
and zero total current magnetic flux tubes are considered. In all cases regimes of spontaneous and
driven evolution are investigated. We identify two stages of particle acceleration during flux
mergers: (i) fast explosive prompt X-point collapse and (ii) ensuing island merger. The fastest
acceleration occurs during the initial catastrophic X-point collapse, with the reconnection
electric field of the order of the magnetic field. During the X-point collapse particles are accelerated
by charge-starved electric fields, which can reach (and even exceed) values of the local magnetic
field. The explosive stage of reconnection produces non-thermal power-law tails with slopes that
depend on the average magnetization $\sigma$. For plasma magnetization $\sigma \leq 10^2$ the
spectrum power law index is $p> 2$; in this case the maximal energy depends linearly on the size of
the reconnecting islands. For higher magnetization, $\sigma \geq 10^2$, the spectra are hard,
$p< 2$, yet the maximal energy $\gamma_{max}$ can still exceed the average magnetic energy per particle,
$ \sim \sigma$, by orders of magnitude (if $p$ is not too close to unity). The X-point collapse stage
is followed by magnetic island merger that dissipates a large fraction of the initial magnetic energy
in a regime of forced magnetic reconnection, further accelerating the particles, but proceeds
at a slower reconnection rate.
