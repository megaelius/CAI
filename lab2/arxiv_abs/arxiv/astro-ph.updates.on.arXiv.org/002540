We present an investigation about the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies
(ETGs), based on a joint lensing and dynamical analysis, and on stellar population synthesis models,
for a sample of 55 lens ETGs identified by the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. We construct axisymmetric
dynamical models based on the Jeans equations which allow for orbital anisotropy and include a dark
matter halo. The models reproduce in detail the observed \textit{HST} photometry and are constrained
by the total projected mass within the Einstein radius and the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$)
within the SDSS fibers. Comparing the dynamically-derived stellar mass-to-light ratios $(M_*/L)_{\rm
dyn}$, obtained for an assumed halo slope $\rho_{\rm h}\propto r^{-1}$, to the stellar population
ones $(M_*/L)_{\rm pop}$, derived from full-spectrum fitting and assuming a Salpeter IMF, we infer
the mass normalization of the IMF. Our results confirm the previous analysis by the SLACS team that
the mass normalization of the IMF of high $\sigma$ galaxies is consistent on average with a Salpeter
slope. Our study allows for a fully consistent study of the trend between IMF and $\sigma$ for both
the SLACS and \ATLAS samples, which explore quite different $\sigma$ ranges. The two samples are
highly complementary, the first being essentially $\sigma$ selected, and the latter volume-limited
and nearly mass selected. We find that the two samples merge smoothly into a single trend of the form
$\log\alpha =(0.38\pm0.04)\times\log(\sigma_{\rm e}/200\,\mathrm{km~s}^{-1})+(-0.06\pm0.01)$,
where $\alpha=(M_*/L)_{\rm dyn}/(M_*/L)_{\rm pop}$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$ is the luminosity averaged
$\sigma$ within one effective radius $R_{\rm e}$. This is consistent with a systematic variation
of the IMF normalization from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval $\sigma_{\rm e}\approx90-270\,\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$.
