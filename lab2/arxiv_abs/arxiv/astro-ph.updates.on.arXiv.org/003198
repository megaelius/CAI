Galaxy surveys aim to map the large-scale structure of the Universe and use redshift space distortions
to constrain deviations from general relativity and to probe the existence of mas- sive neutrinos.
However, the amount of information that can be extracted will be limited by the accuracy of theoretical
models used to analyze the data. Here, by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model run over the
MXXL N-body simulation, we assess the impact of galaxy formation on satellite kinematics and the
theoretical modelling of redshift-space distortions. We show that different galaxy selection
criteria lead to noticeable differences in the radial distributions and velocity structure of
satellite galaxies. Specifically, whereas samples of stel- lar mass selected galaxies feature
satellites that roughly follow the dark matter, emission line satellite galaxies are located preferentially
in the outskirts of halos and display net infall veloc- ities. We demonstrate that capturing these
differences is crucial for modelling the multipoles of the correlation function in redshift space,
even on large scales. In particular, we show how modelling small scale velocities with a single Gaussian
distribution leads to a poor description of the measure clustering. In contrast, we propose a parametrization
that is flexible enough to model the satellite kinematics, and that leads to and accurate description
of the correlation function down to sub-Mpc scales. We anticipate that our model will be a necessary
ingredient in improved theoretical descriptions of redshift space distortions, which together
could result in a significantly tighter on cosmological constraints and more optimal exploitation
of future large datasets.
