Active Regions (ARs) that exhibit compact Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs) are known to be very flare-productive.
However, the physical mechanisms behind this statistical inference have not been demonstrated
conclusively. We show that such PILs can occur due to the collision between two emerging flux tubes
nested within the same AR. In such multipolar ARs, the flux tubes may emerge simultaneously or sequentially,
each initially producing a bipolar magnetic region (BMR) at the surface. During each flux tube's
emergence phase, the magnetic polarities can migrate such that opposite polarities belonging
to different BMRs collide, resulting in shearing and cancellation of magnetic flux. We name this
process 'collisional shearing' to emphasize that the shearing and flux cancellation develops
due to the collision. Collisional shearing is a process different from the known concept of flux
cancellation occurring between polarities of a single bipole, a process that has been commonly
used in many numerical models. High spatial and temporal resolution observations from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory for two emerging ARs, AR11158 and AR12017, show the continuous cancellation
of up to 40% of the unsigned magnetic flux of the smallest BMR, which occurs at the collisional PIL
for as long as the collision persists. The flux cancellation is accompanied by a succession of solar
flares and CMEs, products of magnetic reconnection along the collisional PIL. Our results suggest
that the quantification of magnetic cancellation driven by collisional shearing needs to be taken
into consideration in order to improve the prediction of solar energetic events and space weather.
