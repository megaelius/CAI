We examine the initiation of 10 coronal jet eruptions in quiet regions on the central disk, thereby
avoiding near-limb spicule-forest obscuration of the slow-rise onset of the minifilament eruption.
From the SDO/AIA 171A 12-second-cadence movie of each eruption, we (1) find and compare the start
times of the minifilament's slow rise, the jet-base bright point, the jet-base interior brightening,
and the jet spire, and (2) measure the minifilament's speed at the start and end of its slow rise. From
(a) these data, (b) prior observations showing that each eruption was triggered by magnetic flux
cancelation under the minifilament, and (c) the breakout-reconnection current sheet observed
in one eruption, we confirm that quiet-region jet-making minifilament eruptions are miniature
versions of CME-making filament eruptions, and surmise that in most quiet region jets: (1) the eruption
starts before runaway reconnection starts, (2) runaway reconnection does not start until the slow-rise
speed is at least about 1 km/s, and (3) at and before eruption onset there is no current sheet of appreciable
extent. We therefore expect: (i) many CME-making filament eruptions are triggered by flux cancelation
under the filament, (ii) emerging bipoles seldom, if ever, directly drive jet production because
the emergence is seldom, if ever, fast enough, and (iii) at a separatrix or quasi-separatrix in any
astrophysical setting of magnetic field in low-beta plasma, a current sheet of appreciable extent
can be built only dynamically by a magnetohydrodynamic convulsion of the field, not by quasi-static
gradual converging of the field.
