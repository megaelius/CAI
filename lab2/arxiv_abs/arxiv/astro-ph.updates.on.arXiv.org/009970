Cosmic reionization was driven by the imbalance between early sources and sinks of ionizing radiation,
both of which were dominated by small-scale structure and are thus usually treated in cosmological
reionization simulations by subgrid modelling. The recombination rate of intergalactic hydrogen
is customarily boosted by a subgrid clumping factor, ${\left<n^2\right>/\left<n\right>^2}$,
which corrects for unresolved fluctuations in gas density ${n}$ on scales below the grid-spacing
of coarse-grained simulations. We investigate in detail the impact of this inhomogeneous subgrid
clumping on reionization and its observables, as follows: (1) Previous attempts generally underestimated
the clumping factor because of insufficient mass resolution. We perform a high-resolution $N$-body
simulation that resolves haloes down to the pre-reionization Jeans mass to derive the time-dependent,
spatially-varying local clumping factor and a fitting formula for its correlation with local overdensity.
(2) We then perform a large-scale $N$-body and radiative transfer simulation that accounts for
this inhomogeneous subgrid clumping by applying this clumping factor-overdensity correlation.
Boosting recombination significantly slows the expansion of ionized regions, which delays completion
of reionization and suppresses 21 cm power spectra on large scales in the later stages of reionization.
(3) We also consider a simplified prescription in which the globally-averaged, time-evolving
clumping factor from the same high-resolution $N$-body simulation is applied uniformly to all
cells in the reionization simulation, instead. Observables computed with this model agree fairly
well with those from the inhomogeneous clumping model, e.g. predicting 21 cm power spectra to within
20% error, suggesting it may be a useful approximation.
