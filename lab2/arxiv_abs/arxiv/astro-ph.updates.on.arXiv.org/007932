We introduce an extension of the ELVIS project to account for the effects of the Milky Way galaxy on
its subhalo population. Our simulation suite, Phat ELVIS, consists of twelve high-resolution
cosmological dark matter-only (DMO) zoom simulations of Milky Way-size $\Lambda$CDM~ haloes
($M_{\rm v} = 0.7-2 \times 10^{12} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) along with twelve re-runs with embedded
galaxy potentials grown to match the observed Milky Way disk and bulge today. The central galaxy
potential destroys subhalos on orbits with small pericenters in every halo, regardless of the ratio
of galaxy mass to halo mass. This has several important implications. 1) Most of the $\mathtt{Disk}$
runs have no subhaloes larger than $V_{\rm max} = 4.5$ km s$^{-1}$ within $20$ kpc and a significant
lack of substructure going back $\sim 8$ Gyr, suggesting that local stream-heating signals from
dark substructure will be rare. 2) The pericenter distributions of Milky Way satellites derived
from $\mathit{Gaia}$ data are remarkably similar to the pericenter distributions of subhaloes
in the $\mathtt{Disk}$ runs, while the DMO runs drastically over-predict galaxies with pericenters
smaller than 20 kpc. 3) The enhanced destruction produces a tension opposite to that of the classic
`missing satellites' problem: in order to account for ultra-faint galaxies known within $30$ kpc
of the Galaxy, we must populate haloes with $V_\mathrm{peak} \simeq 7$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 3 \times
10^{7} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall), well below the atomic cooling limit of $V_\mathrm{peak}
\simeq 16$ km s$^{-1}$ ($M \simeq 5 \times 10^{8} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at infall). 4) If such tiny
haloes do host ultra-faint dwarfs, this implies the existence of $\sim 1000$ satellite galaxies
within 300 kpc of the Milky Way.
