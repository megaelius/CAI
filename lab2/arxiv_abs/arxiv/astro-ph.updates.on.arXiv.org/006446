We use high resolution hydrodynamical simulations to study the contribution to the X-ray background
from high-$z$ energetic sources, such as X-ray binaries, accreting nuclear black holes and shock
heated interstellar medium. Adopting the model discussed in Eide et al. (2018), we find that these
X-ray sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) contribute less than a few percent of the unresolved
X-ray background. The same sources contribute to less than $\sim$2\% of the measured angular power
spectrum of the fluctuations of the X-ray background. The outputs of radiative transfer simulations
modeling the EoR are used to evaluate the cross-correlations of X-ray background with the 21~cm
signal from neutral hydrogen. Such correlation could be used to confirm the origin of the 21 cm signal,
as well as give information on the properties of the X-ray sources during the EoR. We find that the
correlations are positive during the early stages of reionization when most of the hydrogen is neutral,
while they become negative when the intergalactic medium gets highly ionized, with the transition
from positive to negative depending on both the X-ray model and the scale under consideration. With
{\tt SKA} as the reference instrument for the 21~cm experiment, the predicted S/N for such correlations
is $<1$ if the corresponding X-ray survey is only able to resolve and remove X-ray sources with observed
flux $>10^{-15}\,\rm erg\, cm^{-2} \, s^{-1}$, while the cumulative S/N from $l=1000$ to $10^{4}$
at $x_{\rm HI}=0.5$ is $\sim 5$ if sources with observed flux $>10^{-17}\,\rm erg\, cm^{-2} \, s^{-1}$
are detected.
