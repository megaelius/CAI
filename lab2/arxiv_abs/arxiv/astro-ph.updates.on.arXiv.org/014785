Pyroxene crystals are common in meteorites but few compositions have been recognized in astronomical
environments. We present quantitative room-temperature spectra of 17 Mg-- Fe-- and Ca--bearing
ortho- and clinopyroxenes, and a Ca-pyroxenoid in order to discern trends indicative of crystal
structure and a wide range of composition. Data are produced using a Diamond Anvil Cell: our band
strengths are up to 6 times higher than those measured in KBr or polyethylene dispersions, which
include variations in path length (from grain size) and surface reflections that are not addressed
in data processing. Pyroxenes have varied spectra: only two bands, at 10.22~$\mu$m and 15.34~$\mu$m
in enstatite (En$_{99}$), are common to all. Peak-wavelengths generally increase as Mg is replaced
by Ca or Fe. However, two bands in MgFe-pyroxenes shift to shorter wavelengths as the Fe component
increases from 0 to 60 per cent. A high-intensity band shifts from 11.6~$\mu$m to 11.2~$\mu$m and
remains at 11.2~$\mu$m as Fe increases to 100~per~cent; it resembles an astronomical feature normally
identified with olivine or forsterite. The distinctive pyroxene bands between 13~ and 16~$\mu$m
show promise for their identification in MIRI spectra obtained with JWST. The many pyroxene bands
between 40 and 80~$\mu$m could be diagnositic of silicate mineralogy if data were obtained with
the proposed SPICA telescope. Our data indicate that comparison between room-temperature laboratory
bands for enstatite and cold $\sim 10-K$ astronomical dust features at wavelengths $\gtrsim 28~\mu$m
can result in the identification of (Mg,Fe)- pyroxenes that contain 7--15 % less Fe-- than their
true values because some temperature shifts mimic some compositional shifts. Therefore some astronomical
silicates may contain more Fe, and less Mg, than previously thought.
