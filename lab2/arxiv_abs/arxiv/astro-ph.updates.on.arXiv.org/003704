Context: The main goal of the CARMENES survey is to find Earth-mass planets around nearby M-dwarf
stars. Seven M-dwarfs included in the CARMENES sample had been observed before with HIRES and HARPS
and either were reported to have one short period planetary companion (GJ15A, GJ176, GJ436, GJ536
and GJ1148) or are multiple planetary systems (GJ581 and GJ876). Aims: We aim to report new precise
optical radial velocity measurements for these planet hosts and test the overall capabilities
of CARMENES. Methods: We combined our CARMENES precise Doppler measurements with those available
from HIRES and HARPS and derived new orbital parameters for the systems. Bona-fide single planet
systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The multiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent
dynamical model and their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability. Results: We confirm
or provide supportive arguments for planets around all the investigated stars except for GJ15A,
for which we find that the post-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4
days. Although we cannot confirm the super-Earth planet GJ15Ab, we show evidence for a possible
long-period ($P_{\rm c}$ = 7025$_{-629}^{+972}$ d) Saturn-mass ($m_{\rm c} \sin i$ = 51.8$_{-5.8}^{+5.5}M_\oplus$)
planet around GJ15A. In addition, based on our CARMENES and HIRES data we discover a second planet
around GJ1148, for which we estimate a period $P_{\rm c}$ = 532.6$_{-2.5}^{+4.1}$ d, eccentricity
$e_{\rm c}$ = 0.34$_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$ and minimum mass $m_{\rm c} \sin i$ = 68.1$_{-2.2}^{+4.9}M_\oplus$.
Conclusions: The CARMENES optical radial velocities have similar precision and overall scatter
when compared to the Doppler measurements conducted with HARPS and HIRES. We conclude that CARMENES
is an instrument that is up to the challenge of discovering rocky planets around low-mass stars.
