Transit photometry of the exoplanet candidate Kepler-1625b has recently been interpreted to show
hints of a moon. We aim to clarify whether the exomoon-like signal is really caused by a large object
in orbit around Kepler-1625b. We explore several detrending procedures, i.e. polynomials and
the Cosine Filtering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM). We then supply a light curve
simulator with the co-planar orbital dynamics of the system and fit the resulting planet-moon transit
light curves to the Kepler data. We employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether
a single planet or a planet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve variations.
We carry out a blind hare-and-hounds exercise using many noise realizations by injecting simulated
transits into different out-of-transit parts of the original Kepler-1625 data: 100 sequences
with 3 synthetic transits of a Kepler-1625b-like planet and 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits
of this planet with a Neptune-sized moon. The statistical significance and characteristics of
the exomoon-like signal strongly depend on the detrending method, and the data chosen for detrending,
and on the treatment of gaps in the light curve. Our injection-retrieval experiment shows evidence
for moons in about 10% of those light curves that do not contain an injected moon. Strikingly, many
of these false-positive moons resemble the exomoon candidate. We recover up to about half of the
injected moons, depending on the detrending method, with radii and orbital distances broadly corresponding
to the injected values. A $\Delta$BIC of -4.9 for the CoFiAM-based detrending indicates an exomoon
around Kepler-1625b. This solution, however, is only one out of many and we find very different solutions
depending on the details of the detrending method. It is worrying that the detrending is key to the
interpretation of the data.
