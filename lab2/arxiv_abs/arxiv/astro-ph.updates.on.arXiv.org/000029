We present a detailed structural and morphological study of a large sample of spectroscopically-confirmed
galaxies at z>=6, using deep HST near-IR broad-band images and Subaru optical narrow-band images.
The galaxy sample consists of 51 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z~5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16 Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs) at 5.9<z<6.5. These galaxies exhibit a wide range of rest-frame UV continuum
morphology in the HST images, from compact features to multiple component systems. The fraction
of merging/interacting galaxies reaches 40~50% at M_UV<-20.5 mag, suggesting hierarchical
build-up of the brightest galaxies at high redshift. We use half-light radius to describe the galaxy
sizes, and find that the intrinsic radii r_{hl,in}, after correction for PSF broadening, are roughly
between 0.05" and 0.3", with a median value of 0.13" (~0.75 kpc). This is consistent with the sizes
of bright LAEs and LBGs at z>6 in previous studies. In addition, more luminous galaxies tend to
have larger physical sizes, exhibiting a size-luminosity relation r_{hl,in} \propto L^0.2. The
slope 0.2 is significantly flatter than those in previous fainter LBG samples. We for the first time
characterize the morphology of z>6 galaxies using nonparametric methods, including the CAS
system, the Gini and M_{20} parameters. Compared to low-redshift galaxies, our galaxies appear
in slightly different locations in the parameter space, mainly due to their small sizes in the HST
images. However, we find strong correlations between the measured parameters, as expected from
their definitions. This implies that these nonparametric methods could be still applicable for
z>=6 galaxies, if used with caution. We search for extended Lyman-alpha emission halos around
LAEs at z~5.7 and 6.5, by stacking a number of narrow-band images. We do not find evidence of extended
halos predicted. [abridged].
