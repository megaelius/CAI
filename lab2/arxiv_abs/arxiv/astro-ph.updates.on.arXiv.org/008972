We report on a search for short-period intensity variations in the green-line FeXIV 530.3 nm emission
from the solar corona during the 21 August 2017 total eclipse viewed from Idaho in the United States.
Our experiment was performed with a much more sensitive detection system, and with better spatial
resolution, than on previous occasions (1999 and 2001 eclipses), allowing fine details of quiet
coronal loops and an active-region loop system to be seen. A guided 200-mm-aperture Schmidt-Cassegrain
telescope was used with a state-of-the-art CCD camera having 16-bit intensity discrimination
and a field-of-view 0.43 degree x 0.43 degree that encompassed approximately one third of the visible
corona. The camera pixel size was 1.55 arcseconds, while the seeing during the eclipse enabled features
of approx. 2 arcseconds (1450 km on the Sun) to be resolved. A total of 429 images were recorded during
a 122.9 second portion of the totality at a frame rate of 3.49 images per second. In the analysis, we
searched particularly for short-period intensity oscillations and travelling waves, since theory
predicts fast-mode magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves with short periods may be important in quiet
coronal and active-region heating. Allowing first for various instrumental and photometric effects,
we used a wavelet technique to search for periodicities in some 404 000 pixels in the frequency range
0.5-1.6 Hz (periods: 2 second to 0.6 second). We also searched for travelling waves along some 65
coronal structures. However, we found no statistically significant evidence in either. This negative
result considerably refines the limit that we obtained from our previous analyses, and it indicates
that future searches for short-period coronal waves may be better directed towards Doppler shifts
as well as intensity oscillations.
