In the coming years and decades, advanced space- and ground-based observatories will allow an unprecedented
opportunity to probe the atmospheres and surfaces of potentially habitable exoplanets for signatures
of life. Life on Earth, through its gaseous products and reflectance and scattering properties,
has left its fingerprint on the spectrum of our planet. Aided by the universality of the laws of physics
and chemistry, we turn to Earth's biosphere, both in the present and through geologic time, for analog
signatures that will aid in the search for life elsewhere. Considering the insights gained from
modern and ancient Earth, and the broader array of hypothetical exoplanet possibilities, we have
compiled a state-of-the-art overview of our current understanding of potential exoplanet biosignatures
including gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. We additionally survey biogenic spectral
features that are well-known in the specialist literature but have not yet been robustly vetted
in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. We briefly review advances in assessing biosignature
plausibility, including novel methods for determining chemical disequilibrium from remotely
obtainable data and assessment tools for determining the minimum biomass required for a given atmospheric
signature. We focus particularly on advances made since the seminal review by Des Marais et al. (2002).
The purpose of this work is not to propose new biosignatures strategies, a goal left to companion
papers in this series, but to review the current literature, draw meaningful connections between
seemingly disparate areas, and clear the way for a path forward.
