Galaxy morphology is inextricably linked to environment. The morphology-density relation quantifies
this relationship. However, optical morphology is only loosely related to the kinematic structure
of galaxies, and about two thirds of elliptical ("spheroidal") galaxies are actually misclassified
face-on disks, and would appear flattened if view edge on. A more robust classification is the slow/fast
rotator classification which describes the kinematic structure. Slow and fast rotators form a
bimodality in galaxy properties and are thought to follow distinct evolutionary paths, and so a
kinematic morphology-density (kT-$\Sigma$) relation is more meaningful. To date the kT-$\Sigma$
relation has only been studied for a handful of nearby clusters,or across large numbers of clusters
but with incomplete coverage. Here, we combine stellar kinematics obtained with the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey's (SDSS) Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory survey with classifications
using a novel visual method to obtain the largest complete census of slow and fast rotators in nearby
galaxy groups and clusters. To account for incompleteness in the SDSS spectroscopic catalogue,
we combine the catalogue with the photometric catalogue, which we clean using empirical criteria.
We test our visual classification method and find our false negative rate to be only $\sim$6% (0%
for $M \gtrsim 10^{11.7}M_{\odot}$). In contrast, our false positive rate is about 50% implying
half of all slow rotator candidates will be confirmed as fast rotators if stellar kinematics become
available. Hence, our misclassification is essentially random with only a weak dependence on stellar
mass, and as slow rotators are intrinsically rare, the absolute number of misclassifications will
be small compared to the sample size. The result is the largest complete census of massive slow rotator
candidates and their environments to date.
