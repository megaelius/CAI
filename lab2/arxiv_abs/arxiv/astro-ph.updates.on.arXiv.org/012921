We investigate the turbulence driving mode of ionizing radiation from massive stars on the surrounding
interstellar medium (ISM). We run hydrodynamical simulations of a turbulent cloud impinged by
a plane-parallel ionization front. We find that the ionizing radiation forms pillars of neutral
gas reminiscent of those seen in observations. We quantify the driving mode of the turbulence in
the neutral gas by calculating the driving parameter $b$, which is characterised by the relation
$\sigma_s^2 = \ln({1+b^2\mathcal{M}^2})$ between the variance of the logarithmic density contrast
$\sigma_s^2$ (where $s = \ln({\rho/\rho_0})$ with the gas density $\rho$ and its average $\rho_0$),
and the turbulent Mach number $\mathcal{M}$. Previous works have shown that $b\sim1/3$ indicates
solenoidal (divergence-free) driving and $b\sim1$ indicates compressive (curl-free) driving,
with $b\sim1$ producing up to ten times higher star formation rates than $b\sim1/3$. The time variation
of $b$ in our study allows us to infer that ionizing radiation is inherently a compressive turbulence
driving source, with a time-averaged $b\sim 0.76 \pm 0.08$. We also investigate the value of $b$
of the pillars, where star formation is expected to occur, and find that the pillars are characterised
by a natural mixture of both solenoidal and compressive turbulent modes ($b\sim0.4$) when they
form, and later evolve into a more compressive turbulent state with $b\sim0.5$--$0.6$. A virial
parameter analysis of the pillar regions supports this conclusion. This indicates that ionizing
radiation from massive stars may be able to trigger star formation by producing predominately compressive
turbulent gas in the pillars.
