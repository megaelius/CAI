The interstellar medium of galaxies is governed by supersonic turbulence, which likely controls
the star formation rate (SFR) and initial mass function (IMF) of stars. Turbulence also plays an
important role during structure formation in the early Universe. Despite its ubiquity and importance,
we have yet to understand the statistics of turbulence. ISM turbulence is non-universal, with a
wide range of Mach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and is driven by various stellar feedback
and galactic processes. Although some of these parameters were explored, the bulk of previous work
assumed that the gas is isothermal. However, cold molecular clouds form out of the warm atomic medium,
with the gas passing through various chemical and thermodynamic phases that are not isothermal.
Here we determine the role of temperature variations by modelling non-isothermal hydrodynamic
turbulence with a polytropic equation of state (EOS), P~rho^Gamma. We use grid resolutions of 2048^3
cells and compare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS), and Gamma=5/3
(stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal filaments with more small-scale fragmentation
occurring for Gamma<1, while Gamma>1 smoothes out density fluctuations. The probability
distribution function (PDF) of the gas density is significantly affected by temperature variations,
with a power-law tail developing on the low-density side for Gamma>1. In contrast, for Gamma<1,
the PDF becomes closer to a lognormal distribution. We derive and test a new density variance - Mach
number relation that takes Gamma into account. This new relation is extremely important for theoretical
models of the SFR and IMF, because it determines the dense gas mass fraction of a star-forming cloud.
We derive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of 5 from Gamma=0.7 to
Gamma=5/3, as in real molecular clouds.
