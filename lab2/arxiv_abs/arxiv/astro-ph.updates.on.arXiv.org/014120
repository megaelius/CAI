In explaining the physical origin of the jet composition of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a more general
picture, i.e. the hybrid jet model (which introduced another magnetization parameter $\sigma_{0}$
on the basis of the traditional fireball model), has been well studied in Gao \& Zhang. However, it
still has not yet been applied to a large GRB sample. Here, we first employ the "top-down" approach
of Gao \& Zhang to diagnose the photosphere properties at the central engine to see how the hybrid
model can account for the observed data as well, through applying a {\it Fermi} GRB sample (eight
bursts) with the detected photosphere component, as presented in Li (our Paper I). We infer all physical
parameters of a hybrid problem with three typical values of the radius of the jet base ($r_{0}$ = 10$^{7}$,
10$^{8}$, and 10$^{9}$ cm). We find that the dimensionless entropy for all the bursts shows $\eta\gg$
1 while the derived (1+$\sigma_{0}$) for five bursts (GRB 081224, GRB 110721A, GRB 090719, GRB 100707,
and GRB 100724) is larger than unity, indicating that in addition to a hot fireball component, another
cold Poynting-flux component may also play an important role. Our analysis also shows that in a few
time bins for all $r_{0}$ in GRB 081224 and GRB 110721A, the magnetization parameter at $\sim$ 10$^{15}$cm
(1+$\sigma_{\rm r15}$) is greater than unity, which implies that internal-collision-induced
magnetic reconnection and turbulence may be the mechanism to power the nonthermal emission, rather
than internal shocks. We conclude that the majority of bursts (probably all) can be well explained
by the hybrid jet problem.
