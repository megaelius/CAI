We present Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of three recently discovered ultra-faint Milky Way satellites,
Grus II, Tucana IV, and Tucana V. We measure systemic velocities of V_hel = -110.0 +/- 0.5 km/s, V_hel
= 15.9 +/- 1.8 km/s, and V_hel = -36.2 +/-2.5 km/s for the three objects, respectively. Their large
relative velocity differences demonstrate that the satellites are unrelated despite their close
physical proximity. We determine a velocity dispersion for Tuc IV of sigma = 4.3^+1.7_-1.0 km/s,
but we cannot resolve the velocity dispersions of the other two systems. For Gru II we place an upper
limit (90% confidence) on the dispersion of sigma < 1.9 km/s, and for Tuc V we do not obtain any useful
limits. All three satellites have metallicities below [Fe/H] = -2.1, but none has a detectable metallicity
spread. We determine proper motions for each satellite based on Gaia astrometry and compute their
orbits around the Milky Way. Gru II is on a tightly bound orbit with a pericenter of 25 kpc and orbital
eccentricity of 0.45. Tuc V likely has an apocenter beyond 100 kpc, and could be approaching the Milky
Way for the first time. The current orbit of Tuc IV is similar to that of Gru II, with a pericenter of
25 kpc and an eccentricity of 0.36. However, a backward integration of the position of Tuc IV demonstrates
that it collided with the Large Magellanic Cloud at an impact parameter of 4 kpc ~120 Myr ago, deflecting
its trajectory and possibly altering its internal kinematics. Based on their sizes, masses, and
metallicities, we classify Gru II and Tuc IV as likely dwarf galaxies, but the nature of Tuc V remains
uncertain.
