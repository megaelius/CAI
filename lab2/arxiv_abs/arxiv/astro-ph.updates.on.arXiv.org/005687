We use polarization observations of a circumbinary disk to investigate how the polarization properties
change at distinct frequency bands. Our goal is to discern the main mechanism responsible for the
polarization through comparison between our observations and model predictions. We used ALMA
to perform full polarization observations at 97.5 GHz, 233 GHz and 343.5 GHz. The target is the Class
I object BHB07-11, which is the youngest object in the Barnard 59 protocluster. Complementary VLA
observations at 34.5 GHz revealed a binary system within the disk. We detect an extended and structured
polarization pattern remarkably consistent among all three bands. The distribution of polarized
intensity resembles a horseshoe shape with polarization angles following this morphology. From
the spectral index between bands 3 and 7, we derive a dust opacity index $\beta \sim 1$ consistent
with maximum grain sizes larger than expected to produce self-scattering polarization in each
band. The polarization morphology do not match predictions from self-scattering. On the other
hand, marginal correspondence is seen between our maps and predictions from radiation field assuming
the brightest binary component as main radiation source. Molecular line data from BHB07-11 indicates
disk rotation. We produced synthetic polarization maps from a rotating magnetized disk model assuming
combined poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components. The magnetic field vectors (i. e., the
polarization vectors rotated by 90$\degr$) are better represented by a model with poloidal magnetic
field strength about 3 times the toroidal one. The similarity of our polarization patterns among
the three bands provides a strong evidence against self-scattering and radiation fields. On the
other hand, our data are reasonably well reproduced by a model of disk with toroidal magnetic field
components slightly smaller than poloidal ones.
