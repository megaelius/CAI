Context. Searching for high-redshift galaxies is a field of intense activity in modern observational
cosmology that will continue to grow with future ground-based and sky observatories. Over the last
few years, a lot has been learned about the high-z Universe. Aims. Despite extensive Ly-alpha Blobs
(LAB) surveys from low to high redshifts, giant LABs over 100 kpc have been found mostly at z~2-4.
This redshift range is coincident with the transition epoch of galactic gas-circulation processes
from inflows to outflows at z~2.5-3. This suggests that the formation of giant LABs may be related
to a combination of gas inflows and outflows. Their extreme youth makes them interesting objects
in the study of galaxy formation as they provide insight into some of the youngest known highly star
forming galaxies, with only modest time investments using ground-based telescopes. Methods.
Systematic narrow-band Ly-alpha nebula surveys are ongoing, but they are limited in their covered
redshift range and their comoving volume. This poses a significant problem when searching for such
rare sources. To address this problem, we developed a systematic searching tool, ATACAMA (A Tool
for seArChing for lArge LyMan Alpha nebulae) designed to find large Ly-alpha nebulae at any redshift
within deep multi-wavelength broad-band imaging. Results. We identified a Ly-alpha nebula candidate
at zphot~3.3 covering an isophotal area of 29.4sq.arcsec. Its morphology shows a bright core and
a faint core which coincides with the morphology of previously known Ly-alpha blobs. A first estimation
of the Ly-alpha equivalent width and line flux agree with the values from the study led by several
groups.
