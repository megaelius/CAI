Individual highly magnified stars have been recently discovered at lookback times of more than
half the age of the Universe, in lensed galaxies that straddle the critical curves of massive galaxy
clusters. Having confirmed their detectability, it is now important to carry out systematic searches
for them in order to establish their frequency, and in turn learn about the statistical properties
of high-redshift stars and of the granularity of matter in the foreground deflector. Here we report
the discovery of a highly magnified star at redshift $z = 0.94$ in a strongly lensed arc behind a Hubble
Frontier Field galaxy cluster, MACS J0416.1-2403, discovered as part of a systematic archival
search. The bright transient (dubbed "Warhol") was discovered in Hubble Space Telescope data taken
on 2014 September 15 and 16. This single image faded over a period of two weeks, and observations taken
on 2014 September 1 show that the duration of the microlensing event was at most four weeks in total.
The light curve may also exhibit slow changes over a period of years consistent with the level of microlensing
expected from stars responsible for the intracluster light (ICL) of the cluster. Optical and infrared
observations taken near peak brightness can be fit by a stellar spectrum with moderate host-galaxy
extinction. A blue supergiant matches the measured spectral energy distribution near peak, implying
a temporary magnification of at least several thousand. While the spectrum of an O-type star would
also fit the transient's spectral energy distribution, extremely luminous O-type stars are much
less common than blue supergiants. The short timescale of the event and the estimated effective
temperature indicate that the lensed source is an extremely magnified star.
