Of the C$_{3}$H$_{x}$ hydrocarbons, propane (C${_3}$H$_{8}$) and propyne (methylacetylene,
CH$_{3}$C$_{2}$H) were first detected in Titan's atmosphere during the Voyager 1 flyby in 1980.
Propene (propylene, C$_{3}$H$_{6}$) was first detected in 2013 with data from the Composite InfraRed
Spectrometer (CIRS) instrument on Cassini. We present the first measured abundance profiles of
propene on Titan from radiative transfer modeling, and compare our measurements to predictions
derived from several photochemical models. Near the equator, propene is observed to have a peak
abundance of 10 ppbv at a pressure of 0.2 mbar. Several photochemical models predict the amount at
this pressure to be in the range 0.3 - 1 ppbv and also show a local minimum near 0.2 mbar which we do not
see in our measurements. We also see that propene follows a different latitudinal trend than the
other C$_{3}$ molecules. While propane and propyne concentrate near the winter pole, transported
via a global convective cell, propene is most abundant above the equator. We retrieve vertical abundances
profiles between 125 km and 375 km for these gases for latitude averages between 60$^{\circ}$S to
20$^{\circ}$S, 20$^{\circ}$S to 20$^{\circ}$N, and 20$^{\circ}$N to 60$^{\circ}$N over two
time periods, 2004 through 2009 representing Titan's atmosphere before the 2009 equinox, and 2012
through 2015 representing time after the equinox. Additionally, using newly corrected line data,
we determined an updated upper limit for allene (propadiene, CH$_{2}$CCH$_{2}$, the isomer of
propyne). We claim a 3-$\sigma$ upper limit mixing ratio of 2.5$\times$10$^{-9}$ within 30$^\circ$
of the equator. The measurements we present will further constrain photochemical models by refining
reaction rates and the transport of these gases throughout Titan's atmosphere.
