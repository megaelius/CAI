Metal Evolution, Transport, and Abundance in the LMC (METAL) is a large Cycle 24 program on the Hubble
Space Telescope aimed at measuring dust extinction properties and interstellar depletions in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) at half-solar metallicity. The 101-orbit program is comprised
of COS and STIS spectroscopy toward 33 LMC massive stars between 1150 A and 3180 A, and parallel WFC3
imaging in 7 NUV-NIR filters. The fraction of silicon in the gas-phase (depletion) obtained from
the spectroscopy decreases with increasing hydrogen column density. Depletion patterns for silicon
differ between the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, with the silicon depletion level offsetting almost exactly
the metallicity differences, leading to constant gas-phase abundances in those galaxies for a
given hydrogen column density. The silicon depletion correlates linearly with the absolute-to-selective
extinction, R$_V$, indicating a link between gas depletion and dust grain size. Extinction maps
are derived from the resolved stellar photometry in the parallel imaging, which can be compared
to FIR images from Herschel and Spitzer to estimate the emissivity of dust at LMC metallicity. The
full METAL sample of depletions, UV extinction curves, and extinction maps will inform the abundance,
size, composition, and optical properties of dust grains in the LMC, comprehensively improve our
understanding of dust properties, and the accuracy with which dust-based gas masses, star formation
rates and histories in nearby and high-redshift galaxies are estimated. This overview paper describes
the goals, design, data reduction, and initial results of the METAL survey.
