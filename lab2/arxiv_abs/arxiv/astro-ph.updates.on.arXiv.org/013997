The most powerful superflares reaching 10^39erg bolometric energy are from giant stars. The mechanism
behind flaring is supposed to be the magnetic reconnection, which is closely related to magnetic
activity including starspots. However, it is poorly understood, how the underlying magnetic dynamo
works and how the flare activity is related to the stellar properties which eventually control the
dynamo action. We analyse the flaring activity of KIC 2852961, a late-type giant star, in order to
understand how the flare statistics are related to that of other stars with flares and superflares
and what the role of the observed stellar properties in generating flares is. We search for flares
in the full Kepler dataset of the star by an automated technique together with visual inspection.
We set a final list of 59 verified flares during the observing term. We calculate flare energies for
the sample and perform a statistical analysis. The stellar properties of KIC 2852961 are revised
and a more consistent set of parameters are proposed. The cumulative flare energy distribution
can be characterized by a broken power-law, i.e. on the log-log representation the distribution
function is fitted by two linear functions with different slopes, depending on the energy range
fitted. We find that the total flare energy integrated over a few rotation periods correlates with
the average amplitude of the rotational modulation due to starspots. Flares and superflares seem
to be the result of the same physical mechanism at different energetic levels, also implying that
late-type stars in the main sequence and flaring giant stars have the same underlying physical process
for emitting flares. There might be a scaling effect behind generating flares and superflares in
the sense that the higher the magnetic activity the higher the overall magnetic energy released
by flares and/or superflares.
