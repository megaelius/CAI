The $\lambda$ = 2.06 $\mu$m absorption band of CO$_2$ is widely used for the remote sensing of atmospheric
carbon dioxide, making it relevant to many important top-down measurements of carbon flux. The
forward models used in the retrieval algorithms employed in these measurements require increasingly
accurate line intensity and line shape data from which absorption cross-sections can be computed.
To overcome accuracy limitations of existing line lists, we used frequency-stabilized cavity
ring-down spectroscopy to measure 39 transitions in the $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$ absorption band.
The line intensities were measured with an estimated relative combined standard uncertainty of
$u_r$ = 0.08 %. We predict the $J$-dependence of the measured intensities using two theoretical
modesl: a one-dimensional spectroscopic model with Herman-Wallis rotation-vibration corrections,
and a line-by-line ab initio dipole moment surface model [Zak et al. JQSRT 2016;177:31-42]. For
the second approach, we fit only a single factor to rescale the theoretical integrated band intensity
to be consistent with the measured intensities. We find that the latter approach yields an equally
adequate representation of the fitted $J$-dependent intensity data and provides the most physically
general representation of the results. Our recommended value for the integrated band intensity
equal to 7.183$\times$10$^{-21}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$ $\pm$ 6$\times$10$^{-24}$ cm molecule$^{-1}$
is based on the rescaled ab initio model and corresponds to a fitted scale factor of 1.0069 $\pm$ 0.0002.
Comparisons of literature intensity values to our results reveal systematic deviations ranging
from $-$1.16 % to +0.33 %.
