Measuring polarization from thermal dust emission can provide constraints on the magnetic field
structure around embedded protostars. However, interpreting the observations is challenging
without models that consistently account for both the complexity of the protostellar birth environment
and polarization mechanisms. We aim to provide a better understanding with a focus on bridge-like
structures such as that observed towards the protostellar multiple IRAS 16293--2422 by comparing
synthetic polarization maps of thermal reemission with observations. We analyze the magnetic
field properties associated with the formation of a protostellar multiple based on ideal MHD 3D
zoom-in simulations carried out with the RAMSES code. To compare with observations, we post-process
a snapshot of a bridge-like structure that is associated with a forming triple star system with the
radiative transfer code POLARIS and produce multi-wavelength dust polarization maps. In the most
prominent bridge of our sample, the typical density is about 10^(-16) g cm^(-3), and the magnetic
field strength is about 1 to 2 mG. The magnetic field structure has an elongated toroidal morphology
and the dust polarization maps trace the complex morphology. In contrast, the magnetic field strength
associated with the launching of asymmetric bipolar outflows is significantly more magnetized
(~100 mG). At {\lambda}=1.3 mm, the orientation of grains in the bridge is similar for the case accounting
for radiative alignment torques (RATs) compared to perfect alignment with magnetic field lines.
However, the polarization fraction in the bridge is three times smaller for the RAT scenario compared
to assuming perfect alignment. At shorter wavelengths ({\lambda} < 200 {\mu}m), dust polarization
does not trace the magnetic field because other effects such as self-scattering and dichroic extinction
dominate the orientation of the polarization.
