The feeble radiative efficiency characteristic of Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN)
is ascribed to a sub-Eddington accretion rate, typically at $\log(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm edd}) \lesssim
-3$. At the finest angular resolutions that are attainable nowadays using mid-infrared (mid-IR)
interferometry, the prototypical LLAGN in NGC 1052 remains unresolved down to $< 5\, \rm{mas}$
($0.5\, \rm{pc}$). This is in line with non-thermal emission from a compact jet, a scenario further
supported by a number of evidences: the broken power-law shape of the continuum distribution in
the radio-to-UV range; the $\sim 4\%$ degree of polarisation measured in the nuclear mid-IR continuum,
together with the mild optical extinction ($A_V \sim 1\, \rm{mag}$); and the "harder when brighter"
behaviour of the X-ray spectrum, indicative of self-Compton synchrotron radiation. A remarkable
feature is the steepness of the IR-to-UV core continuum, characterised by a power-law index of $\sim
2.6$, as compared to the canonical value of $0.7$. Alternatively, to explain the interferometric
data by thermal emission would require an exceptionally compact dust distribution when compared
to those observed in nearby AGN, with $A_V \gtrsim 2.8\, \rm{mag}$ to account for the IR polarisation.
This is in contrast with several observational evidences against a high extinction along the line
of sight, including the detection of the nucleus in the UV range and the well defined shape of the power-law
continuum. The case of NGC 1052 shows that compact jets can dominate the nuclear emission in LLAGN
across the whole electromagnetic spectrum, a scenario that might be common among this class of active
nuclei.
