Fast and accurate simulations of the non-linear evolution of the cosmic density field are a major
component of many cosmological analyses, but the computational time and storage required to run
them can be exceedingly large. For this reason, we use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
learn a compressed representation of the 3D matter density field that is fast and easy to sample,
and for the first time show that GANs are capable of generating samples at the level of accuracy of
other conventional methods. Using sub-volumes from a suite of GADGET-2 N-body simulations, we
demonstrate that a deep-convolutional GAN can generate samples that capture both large- and small-scale
features of the matter density field, as validated through a variety of n-point statistics. The
use of a data scaling that preserves high-density features and a heavy-tailed latent space prior
allow us to obtain state of the art results for fast 3D cosmic web generation. In particular, the mean
power spectra from generated samples agree to within 5% up to k=3 and within 10% for k<5 when compared
with N-body simulations, and similar accuracy is obtained for a variety of bispectra. By modeling
the latent space with a heavy-tailed prior rather than a standard Gaussian, we better capture sample
variance in the high-density voxel PDF and reduce errors in power spectrum and bispectrum covariance
on all scales. Furthermore, we show that a conditional GAN can smoothly interpolate between samples
conditioned on redshift. Deep generative models, such as the ones described in this work, provide
great promise as fast, low-memory, high-fidelity forward models of large-scale structure.
