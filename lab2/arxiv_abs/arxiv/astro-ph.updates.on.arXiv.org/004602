Context. Despite the fact that VW Cephei is one of the well-studied contact binaries in the literature,
there is no fully consistent model available that can explain every observed property of this system.
Aims. Our motivation is to obtain new spectra along with photometric measurements, to analyze what
kind of changes may have happened in the system in the past two decades, and to propose new ideas for
explaining them. Methods. For the period analysis we determined 10 new times of minima from our light
curves, and constructed a new O$-$C diagram of the system. Radial velocities of the components were
determined using the cross-correlation technique. The light curves and radial velocities were
modelled simultaneously with the PHOEBE code. All observed spectra were compared to synthetic
spectra and equivalent widths of the H$\alpha$ line were measured on their differences. Results.
We have re-determined the physical parameters of the system according to our new light curve and
spectral models. We confirm that the primary component is more active than the secondary, and there
is a correlation between spottedness and the chromospheric activity. We propose that flip-flop
phenomenon occurring on the primary component could be a possible explanation of the observed nature
of the activity. To explain the period variation of VW Cep, we test two previously suggested scenarios:
presence of a fourth body in the system, and the Applegate-mechanism caused by periodic magnetic
activity. We conclude that although none of these mechanisms can be ruled out entirely, the available
data suggest that mass transfer with a slowly decreasing rate gives the most likely explanation
for the period variation of VW Cep.
