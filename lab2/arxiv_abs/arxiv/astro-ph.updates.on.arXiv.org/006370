General-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations are an important tool to study
a variety of astrophysical systems such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, and
accretion onto compact objects. A conservative GRMHD scheme numerically evolves a set of conservation
equations for 'conserved' quantities and requires the computation of certain primitive variables
at every time step. This recovery procedure constitutes a core part of any conservative GRMHD scheme
and it is closely tied to the equation of state (EOS) of the fluid. In the quest to include nuclear physics,
weak interactions, and neutrino physics, state-of-the-art GRMHD simulations employ finite-temperature,
composition-dependent EOSs. While different schemes have individually been proposed, the recovery
problem still remains a major source of error, failure, and inefficiency in GRMHD simulations with
advanced microphysics. The strengths and weaknesses of the different schemes when compared to
each other remain unclear. Here we present the first systematic comparison of various recovery
schemes used in different dynamical spacetime GRMHD codes for both analytic and tabulated microphysical
EOSs. We assess the schemes in terms of (i) speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) robustness. We find large
variations among the different schemes and that there is not a single ideal scheme. While the computationally
most efficient schemes are less robust, the most robust schemes are computationally less efficient.
More robust schemes may require an order of magnitude more calls to the EOS, which are computationally
expensive. We propose an optimal strategy of an efficient three-dimensional Newton-Raphson scheme
and a slower but more robust one-dimensional scheme as a fall-back.
