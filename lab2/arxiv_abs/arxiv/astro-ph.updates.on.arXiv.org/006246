We present Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy of the recurrent nova T Pyxidis obtained
more than 5 years after its 2011 outburst indicating that the system might not have yet reached its
deep quiescent state. The ultraviolet data exhibit a 20% decline in the continuum flux from the pre-outburst
deep quiescence state to the post-outburst near quiescent state. We suggest that a decline across
each recurring nova eruption might help explain the proposed 2mag steady decline of the system since
1866. Using an improved version of our accretion disk model as well as International Ultraviolet
Explorer ultraviolet and optical data, and the 4.8 kpc distance, we corroborate our previous findings
that the quiescent mass accretion rate in T Pyx is of the order of 1e-6 Solar mass per year. Such a large
mass accretion rate would imply that the mass of the white dwarf is increasing with time. However,
with the just-release Gaia DR 2 distance of 3.3 kpc (after submission of the first version of this
manuscript), we find a mass accretion of the order of 1e-7 Solar mass per year. Our results predict
powerful soft X-ray or extreme ultraviolet emission from the hot inner region of the high accretion
rate disk. Using constraining X-ray observations and assuming the accretion disk doesn't depart
too much from the standard model, we are left with two possible scenarios. The disk either emits mainly
extreme ultraviolet radiation which, at a distance of a few kpc, is completely absorbed by the interstellar
medium, or the hot inner disk, emitting soft X-rays, is masked by the bulging disk seen at a higher
inclination.
