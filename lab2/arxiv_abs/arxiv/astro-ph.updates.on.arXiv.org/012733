Comet Interceptor is an ESA F-class mission expected to launch in 2028 on the same launcher as ESA's
ARIEL mission. Comet Interceptor's science payload consists of three spacecraft, a primary spacecraft
that will carry two smaller probes to be released at the target. The three spacecraft will fly-by
the target along different chords, providing multiple simultaneous perspectives of the comet
nucleus and its environment. Each of the spacecraft will be equipped with different but complementary
instrument suites designed to study the far and near coma environment and surface of a comet or interstellar
object (ISO). The primary spacecraft will perform a fly-by at ~1000 km from the target. The two smaller
probes will travel deeper into the coma, closer to the nucleus. The mission is being designed and
launched without a specific comet designated as its main target. Comet Interceptor will travel
to the Sun-Earth L2 Lagrangian point with ARIEL and wait in hibernation until a suitable long-period
comet (LPC) is found that will come close enough to the Sun for the spacecraft to maneuver to an encounter
trajectory. To prepare for all eventualities, the science team has assembled a preliminary set
of backup targets from the known Jupiter family comets, where a suitable fly-by trajectory can be
achieved during the nominal mission timeline (including the possibility of some launch delay).
To better prioritize this list, we are releasing our potential backup targets in order to solicit
the planetary community's help with observations of these objects over future apparitions and
to encourage publication of archival data on these objects.
