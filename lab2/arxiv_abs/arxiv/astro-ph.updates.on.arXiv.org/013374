The star V426 Sge (HBHA~1704-05), originally classified as an emission-line object and a semi-regular
variable, brightened at the beginning of August 2018, showing signatures of a symbiotic star outburst.
We aim to confirm the nature of V426 Sge as a classical symbiotic star, determine the photometric
ephemeris of the light minima, and suggest the path from its 1968 symbiotic nova outburst to the following
2018 Z And-type outburst. We re-constructed an historical light curve (LC) of V426 Sge from approximately
the year 1900, and used original low- and high-resolution spectroscopy complemented with Swift-XRT
and UVOT, optical UBVRcIc and near-infrared JHKL photometry obtained during the 2018 outburst
and the following quiescence. The historical LC reveals no symbiotic-like activity from 1900 to
1967. In 1968, V426 Sge experienced a symbiotic nova outburst that ceased around 1990. From approximately
1972, a wave-like orbitally related variation with a period of $493.4\pm 0.7$ days developed in
the LC. This was interrupted by a Z And-type outburst from the beginning of August 2018 to the middle
of February 2019. At the maximum of the 2018 outburst, the burning white dwarf (WD) increased its
temperature to $>2\times 10^5$ K, generated a luminosity of $\sim 7\times 10^{37}(d/3.3kpc)^2$
erg/s, and blew a wind at the rate of $\sim 3\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr. The donor is a normal
M4-5 III giant and the accretor is a low-mass $\sim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$ WD. During the transition from
the symbiotic nova outburst to the quiescent phase, a pronounced sinusoidal variation along the
orbit develops in the LC of most symbiotic novae. The following eventual outburst is of Z And-type,
when the accretion by the WD temporarily exceeds the upper limit of the stable burning. At this point
the system becomes a classical symbiotic star.
