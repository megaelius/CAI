We analyze the clustering of galaxies in the first public data release of the HSC Subaru Strategic
Program. Despite the relatively small footprints of the observed fields, the data are an excellent
proxy for the deep photometric datasets that will be acquired by LSST, and are therefore an ideal
test bed for the analysis methods being implemented by the LSST DESC. We select a magnitude limited
sample with $i<24.5$ and analyze it in four redshift bins covering $0.15\lesssim z \lesssim1.5$.
We carry out a Fourier-space analysis of the two-point clustering of this sample, including all
auto- and cross-correlations. We demonstrate the use of map-level deprojection methods to account
for fluctuations in the galaxy number density caused by observational systematics. Through an
HOD analysis, we place constraints on the characteristic halo masses of this sample, finding a good
fit up to scales $k_{\rm max}=1\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, including both auto- and cross-correlations.
Our results show monotonically decreasing average halo masses, which can be interpreted in terms
of the drop-out of red galaxies at high redshifts for a flux-limited sample. In terms of photometric
redshift systematics, we show that additional care is needed in order to marginalize over uncertainties
in the redshift distribution in galaxy clustering, and that these uncertainties can be constrained
by including cross-correlations. We are able to make a $\sim3\sigma$ detection of lensing magnification
in the HSC data. Our results are stable to variations in $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_c$ and we find constraints
that agree well with measurements from Planck and low-redshift probes. Finally, we use our pipeline
to study the clustering of galaxies as a function of limiting flux, and provide a simple fitting function
for the linear galaxy bias for magnitude limited samples as a function of limiting magnitude and
redshift. [abridged]
