We present the largest-ever sample of 79 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs ) at $z\sim$ 7.0 selected in the
COSMOS and CDFS fields of the LAGER project (the Lyman Alpha Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization).
Our newly amassed ultra deep narrowband exposure and deeper/wider broadband images have more than
doubled the number of LAEs in COSMOS, and we have selected 30 LAEs in the second field CDFS. We detect
two large scale LAE-overdense regions in the COSMOS that are likely protoclusters at the highest
redshift to date. We perform injection and recovery simulations to derive the sample incompleteness.
We show significant incompleteness comes from blending with foreground sources, which however
has not been corrected in LAE luminosity functions in {the} literature. The bright end bump in the
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function in COSMOS is confirmed with 6 (2 newly selected) luminous LAEs (L$_{Ly\alpha}$
$>$ 10$^{43.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Interestingly, the bump is absent in CDFS, in which only one luminous
LAE is detected. Meanwhile, the faint end luminosity functions from the two fields well agree with
each other. The 6 luminous LAEs in COSMOS coincide with 2 LAE-overdense regions, while such regions
are not seen in CDFS. The bright end luminosity function bump could be attributed to ionized bubbles
in a patchy reionization. It appears associated with cosmic overdensities, thus supports an inside-out
reionization topology at $z$ $\sim$ 7.0, i.e., the high density peaks were ionized earlier compared
to the voids. An average neutral hydrogen fraction of $x_{HI}$ $\sim$ 0.2 - 0.4 is derived at $z\sim$
7.0 based on the cosmic evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function.
