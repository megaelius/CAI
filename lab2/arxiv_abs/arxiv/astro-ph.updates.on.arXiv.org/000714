We study the arrival directions of 69 ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) observed at the Pierre
Auger Observatory (PAO) with energies exceeding 55 EeV. We investigate whether the UHECRs exhibit
the anisotropy signal expected if the primary particles are protons that originate in galaxies
in the local universe, or in sources correlated with these galaxies. We cross-correlate the UHECR
arrival directions with the positions of IRAS-PSCz and 2MASS-6dF galaxies taking into account
particle energy losses during propagation. This is the first time that the 6dF survey is used in a
search for the sources of UHECRs and the first time that the PSCz survey is used with the full 69 PAO
events. The observed cross-correlation signal is larger for the PAO UHECRs than for 94% (98%) of
realisations from an isotropic distribution when cross-correlated with the PSCz (6dF). On the
other hand the observed cross-correlation signal is lower than that expected from 85% of realisations,
had the UHECRs originated in galaxies in either survey. The observed cross-correlation signal
does exceed that expected by 50% of the realisations if the UHECRs are randomly deflected by intervening
magnetic fields by 5 degrees or more. We propose a new method of analysing the expected anisotropy
signal, by dividing the predicted UHECR source distribution into equal predicted flux radial shells,
which can help localise and constrain the properties of UHECR sources. We find that the 69 PAO events
are consistent with isotropy in the nearest of three shells we define, whereas there is weak evidence
for correlation with the predicted source distribution in the two more distant shells in which the
galaxy distribution is less anisotropic.
