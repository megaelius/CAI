We present optical observations of type Ia supernova (SN) 2019ein, starting at 0.3 days since the
discovery. The spectra and the light curves show that SN 2019ein belongs to the High-Velocity (HV)
group with relatively rapid decline in the light curves (delta m15(B)=1.36+-0.02 mag) and the short
rise time. The Si ii 6355 velocity, associated with a photospheric component but not with a detached
high-velocity feature, reached 20,000 km s-1 in our first spectrum taken at 12 days before the B-band
maximum. This is among the highest velocity seen in SNe Ia. The line velocity however decreased very
rapidly and smoothly toward the maximum light, where it was 13,000 km s-1 as relatively low among
HV SNe. The rapid spectral evolution and the short rise time are probably linked to the rapidly evolving
light curves, suggesting that not only the (maximum) velocity but also the light curve decline rate
are controlling functions of the observational properties of HV SNe. The earliest light curves
did not show noticeable excess, ruling out a giant companion star. Spectral synthesis modeling
shows that the outermost layer at >17,000 km s-1 is well described by the O-Ne-C burning layer extending
to at least 25,000 km s-1, and there is no unburnt carbon below 30,000 km s-1; these properties are
largely consistent with the delayed detonation scenario, and it is shared with the prototypical
HV SN 2002bo despite large difference in delta m15(B). This structure is strikingly different from
that derived for the well-studied NV (Normal-Velocity) SN 2011fe; we suggest that the relation
between the mass of 56Ni (or delta m15) and the extent of the O-Ne-C provides an important constraint
on the explosion mechanism(s) of HV and NV SNe.
