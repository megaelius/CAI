We present the analysis of several observations of the black hole binary GX 339--4 during its bright
intermediate states from two different outbursts (2002 and 2004), as observed by RXTE/PCA. We perform
a consistent study of its reflection spectrum by employing the relxill family of relativistic reflection
models to probe the evolutionary properties of the accretion disk including the inner disk radius
($R_{\rm in}$), ionization parameter ($\xi$), temperatures of the inner disk ($T_{\rm in}$),
corona ($kT_{\rm e}$), and its optical depth ($\tau$). Our analysis indicates that the disk inner
edge approaches the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) during the early onset of bright hard
state, and that the truncation radius of the disk remains low ($< 9 R_{\rm g}$) throughout the transition
from hard to soft state. This suggests that the changes observed in the accretion disk properties
during the state transition are driven by variation in accretion rate, and not necessarily due to
changes in the inner disk's radius. We compare the aforementioned disk properties in two different
outbursts, with state transitions occurring at dissimilar luminosities, and find identical evolutionary
trends in the disk properties, with differences only seen in corona's $kT_{\rm e}$ and $\tau$. We
also perform an analysis by employing a self-consistent Comptonized accretion disk model accounting
for the scatter of disk photons by the corona, and measure low inner disk truncation radius across
the bright intermediate states, using the temperature dependent values of spectral hardening
factor, thereby independently confirming our results from the reflection spectrum analysis.
