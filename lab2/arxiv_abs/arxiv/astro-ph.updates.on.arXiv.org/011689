We present simulations of galaxy formation, based on the GADGET-3 code, in which a sub-resolution
model for star formation and stellar feedback is interfaced with a new model for AGN feedback. Our
sub-resolution model describes a multiphase ISM, accounting for hot and cold gas within the same
resolution element: we exploit this feature to investigate the impact of coupling AGN feedback
energy to the different phases of the ISM over cosmic time. Our fiducial model considers that AGN
feedback energy coupling is driven by the covering factors of the hot and cold phases. We perform
a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of disc galaxies ($M_{\rm halo, \, DM} \simeq
2 \cdot 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, at $z=0$), to investigate: $(i)$ the effect of different ways of coupling
AGN feedback energy to the multiphase ISM; $(ii)$ the impact of different prescriptions for gas
accretion (i.e. only cold gas, both cold and hot gas, with the additional possibility of limiting
gas accretion from cold gas with high angular momentum); $(iii)$ how different models of gas accretion
and coupling of AGN feedback energy affect the coevolution of supermassive BHs and their host galaxy.
We find that at least a share of the AGN feedback energy has to couple with the diffuse gas, in order
to avoid an excessive growth of the BH mass. When the BH only accretes cold gas, it experiences a growth
that is faster than in the case in which both cold and hot gas are accreted. If the accretion of cold
gas with high angular momentum is reduced, the BH mass growth is delayed, the BH mass at $z=0$ is reduced
by up to an order of magnitude, and the BH is prevented from accreting below $z \lesssim 2$, when the
galaxy disc forms.
