The processes responsible for the effective longitudinal transport of solar energetic particles
(SEPs) are still not completely understood. We address this issue by simulating SEP electron propagation
using a spatially 2D transport model that includes perpendicular diffusion. By implementing,
as far as possible, the most reasonable estimates of the transport (diffusion) coefficients, we
compare our results, in a qualitative manner, to recent observations {at energies of 55 -- 105 keV},
focusing on the longitudinal distribution of the peak intensity, the maximum anisotropy and the
onset time. By using transport coefficients which are derived from first principles, we limit the
number of free parameters in the model to: (i) the probability of SEPs following diffusing magnetic
field lines, quantified by $a \in [0,1]$, and (ii) the broadness of the Gaussian injection function.
It is found that the model solutions are extremely sensitive to the magnitude of the {perpendicular}
diffusion coefficient and relatively insensitive to the form of the injection function as long
as a reasonable value of $a=0.2$ is used. We illustrate the effects of perpendicular diffusion on
the model solutions and discuss the viability of this process as a dominant mechanism by which SEPs
are transported in longitude. Lastly, we try to quantity the effectiveness of perpendicular diffusion
as an interplay between the magnitude of the relevant diffusion coefficient and the SEP intensity
gradient driving the diffusion process. It follows that perpendicular diffusion is extremely
effective early in a SEP event when large intensity gradients are present, while the effectiveness
quickly decreases with time thereafter.
