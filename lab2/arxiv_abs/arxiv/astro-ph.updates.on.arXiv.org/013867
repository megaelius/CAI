A comprehensive understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been elusive due to the variety of questions
surrounding the radiation mechanism at play in these events. Polarization measurements of GRBs
can heavily constrain the relevant radiation mechanisms and the structure of the GRB jet; however,
there is a limited number of theoretical predictions that observed GRB polarizations can be compared
against. Here, we conduct radiative transfer calculations of a set of two dimensional relativistic
hydrodynamic long GRB (LGRB) jet simulations, of a constant and a variable jet, using the Monte Carlo
Radiation Transport (MCRaT) code. MCRaT has been enhanced by the inclusion of polarization; it
has been first verified by reproducing a variety of results in the literature and then used to obtain
the time integrated and resolved polarization degrees and angles of the synthetic LGRBs. While
the obtained time-integrated polarization degrees {($\lesssim 1$\%)} are consistent with the
constraints from the POLAR experiment, they are lower than other theoretical studies due to the
lack of strong gradients in the model jet profiles that we use. The time resolved results suggests
that GRBs with wide jets observed on axis will have small polarization degrees ($\lesssim 2\%$)
and {constant polarization angles}, during the brightest portion of the light curve. GRBs observed
off axis will have larger polarization degrees and polarization angles that change with the temporal
structure of radiating shells in the outflow. We then place our results in the context of GRB prompt
emission models and future LEAP and POLAR-2 GRB polarimetry detections.
