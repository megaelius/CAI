A luminous radio burst was recently detected in temporal coincidence with a hard X-ray flare from
the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 with a time and frequency structure consistent with cosmological
fast radio bursts (FRB) and a fluence within a factor of $\lesssim 10$ of the least energetic extragalactic
FRB previously detected. Although active magnetars are commonly invoked FRB sources, several
distinct mechanisms have been proposed for generating the radio emission which make different
predictions for the accompanying higher frequency radiation. We show that the properties of the
coincident radio and X-ray flares from SGR 1935+2154, including their approximate simultaneity
and relative fluence $E_{\rm radio}/E_{\rm X} \sim 10^{-5}$, as well as the duration and spectrum
of the X-ray emission, are consistent with extant predictions for the synchrotron maser shock model.
Rather than arising from the inner magnetosphere, the X-rays are generated by (incoherent) synchrotron
radiation from thermal electrons heated at the same shocks which produce the coherent maser emission.
Although the rate of SGR 1935+2154-like bursts in the local universe is not sufficient to contribute
appreciably to the extragalactic FRB rate, the inclusion of an additional population of more active
magnetars with stronger magnetic fields than the Galactic population can explain both the FRB rate
as well as the repeating fraction, however only if the population of active magnetars are born at
a rate that is at least two-orders of magnitude lower than that of SGR 1935+2154-like magnetars.
This may imply that the more active magnetar sources are not younger magnetars formed in a similar
way to the Milky Way population (e.g. via ordinary supernovae), but instead through more exotic
channels such as superluminous supernovae, accretion-induced collapse or neutron star mergers.
