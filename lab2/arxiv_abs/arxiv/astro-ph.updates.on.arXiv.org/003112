HI intensity mapping is a new observational technique to survey the large-scale structure of matter
using the 21 cm emission line of atomic hydrogen (HI). It can be used to constrain cosmological parameters,
including the dark energy equation-of-state $w$. As our experimental setups we use BINGO (BAO from
Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) and the SKA (Square Kilometre Array) phase-1 dish array operating
in auto-correlation mode. We find that the use of the power spectrum is potentially more powerful
than the BAO wiggles alone, even in the presence of extra nuisance parameters such as the HI bias and
HI amplitude. For the optimal case of BINGO with no foregrounds, we find that the combination of the
HI angular power spectrum with Planck results allows $w$ to be measured with a precision of $4\%$,
while the combination of the BAO acoustic scale with Planck gives a precision of $7\%$. We consider
a number of potentially complicating effects, including foregrounds and redshift dependent bias,
which increase the uncertainty on $w$ but not dramatically; in all cases we find the final uncertainty
to be $\Delta w < 8\%$ for BINGO. For the combination of SKA-MID in auto-correlation mode with Planck,
we find that $w$ can be measured with a precision of $4\%$ for band 1 $(0.35 < z < 3)$ and $2\%$ for band
2 $(0 < z < 0.49)$. Extending the model to include the sum of neutrino masses yields a $95\%$ upper limit
of $\sum m_\nu < 0.24$ eV for BINGO and $\sum m_\nu < 0.08$ eV for SKA phase 1, competitive with the current
best constraints in the case of BINGO and significantly better than them in the case of SKA.
