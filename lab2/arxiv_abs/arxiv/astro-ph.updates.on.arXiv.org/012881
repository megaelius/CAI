Current massive star evolution grids are not able to simultaneously reproduce the empirical upper
luminosity limit of red supergiants, the Humphrey-Davidson (HD) limit at high and low metallicity.
In this study, we provide a better understanding of what drives massive star evolution to blue and
red supergiant phases, with the ultimate aim of reproducing the HD limit at varied metallicities
(Z). For solar, LMC, and SMC Z, we develop eight grids of MESA models for the mass range 20-60M to probe
the effect of semiconvection and overshooting. We compare rotating and non-rotating models with
efficient (alpha_semi = 100) and inefficient semi-convection (alpha_semi = 0.1), with high and
low core overshooting (alpha_ov of 0.1 or 0.5). The red and blue supergiant evolutionary phases
are investigated by comparing the fraction of core He-burning lifetimes spent in each phase. We
find that the extension of the convective core by overshooting alpha_ov = 0.5 has an effect on the
post-MS evolution which can disable semiconvection leading to more RSGs, but a lack of BSGs. We therefore
implement alpha_ov = 0.1 which switches on semiconvective mixing, though for standard alpha_semi
= 1, would result in an HD limit which is higher than observed at low Z. Therefore, we need to implement
very efficient semiconvection of alpha_semi = 100 which reproduces the HD limit at log L ~ 5.5 for
the Magellanic Clouds while simultaneously reproducing the Galactic HD limit of log L ~ 5.8 naturally.
The effect of semiconvection is not active at high Z due to the depletion of the envelope structure
by strong mass loss such that semiconvective regions could not form. Z-dependent mass loss plays
an indirect, yet decisive role in setting the HD limit as a function of Z. For a combination of efficient
semiconvection and low overshooting with standard Z-dependent mass loss, we find a natural HD limit
at all metallicities.
