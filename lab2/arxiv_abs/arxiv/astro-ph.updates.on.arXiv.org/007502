Although the occurrence of solar irradiance variations induced by magnetic surface features (e.g.,
sunspots, faculae, magnetic network) is generally accepted, the existence of intrinsic luminosity
changes due to the internal magnetic fields is still controversial. This additional contribution
is expected to be accompanied by radius variations, and to be potentially significant for the climate
of the Earth. We aim to constrain theoretically the radius and luminosity variations of the Sun that
are due to the effect of the variable magnetic fields in its interior associated with the dynamo cycle.
We have extended a one-dimensional stellar evolution code to include several effects of the magnetic
fields on the interior structure. We investigate different magnetic configurations, based on
both observational constraints and on the output of state-of-the-art mean field dynamo models.
We explore both step-like and simply periodic time dependences of the magnetic field peak strength.
We find that the luminosity and radius variations are in anti-phase and in phase, respectively,
with the magnetic field strength. For peak magnetic field strengths of the order of tens of kilogauss,
luminosity variations ranging between 10^{-6} and 10^{-3} (in modulus) and radius variations
between 10^{-6} and 10^{-5} are obtained. Modest but significant radius variations (up to 10^{-5}
in relative terms) are obtained for magnetic fields of realistic strength and geometry, providing
a potentially observable signature of the intrinsic variations. Establishing their existence
in addition to the accepted surface effects would have very important implications for the understanding
of solar-induced long-term trends on climate.
