Joint lensing and dynamical mass profile determinations of galaxy clusters are an excellent tool
to constrain modification of gravity at cosmological scales. However, search for tiny departures
from General Relativity calls for an accurate control of the systematics affecting the method.
In this analysis we concentrate on the systematics in the reconstruction of mass profiles from the
dynamics of cluster member galaxies, while assuming that lensing provides unbiased mass profile
reconstructions. In particular, in the case study of linear $f(R)$ gravity, we aim at veryfying
whether in realistic simulations of cluster formation a spurious detection of departure from GR
can be detected due to violation of the main assumptions (e.g. dynamical equilibrium and spherical
symmetry) on which the method is based. We aim at identifying and calibrating the impact of those
systematics by analyzing a set of Dark Matter halos taken from $\Lambda$CDM N-body cosmological
simulations performed with the GADGET-3 code. [...] If no selection criteria are applied, $\sim
60\%$ of clusters in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe (where GR is assumed) produce a spurious detection
of modified gravity. We find that the probability of finding cluster in agreement with GR predictions
$P_{GR}$ mainly depends on the properties of the halo's projected phase-space and on shape orientation
of the cluster along the line-of-sight projection. We define two observational criteria which
correlate with the probability to find clusters in agreement with GR predictions and which can be
used to select [...] those objects that are more suitable for the application of the proposed method.
In particular, we find that according to these criteria the percentage of spurious detection can
be lowered down to $\sim 20\%$ in the best case. Our results are relevant in view of data that will be
available with the next generation surveys.
