In the past, SDSS J160429.12+100002.2 was spectroscopically classified as a blue horizontal branch
(BHB) star. Assuming a luminosity that is characteristic of BHB stars, the object's radial velocity
and proper motions from the second data release of Gaia would imply that its Galactic rest-frame
velocity exceeds its local escape velocity. Consequently, the object would be considered a hypervelocity
star, which would prove particularly interesting because its Galactic trajectory points in our
direction. However, based on the spectroscopic analysis of follow-up observations, we show that
the object is actually a short-period ($P=0.14337069\pm0.00000018$\,d) single-lined spectroscopic
binary system with a visible B-type star (effective temperature, $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 15\,840\pm160$\,K,
and surface gravity, $\log(g) = 4.86\pm0.04$) that is less luminous than typical BHB stars. Accordingly,
the distance of the system is lower than originally thought, which renders its Galactic orbit bound
to the Galaxy. Nevertheless, it is still an extreme halo object on a highly retrograde orbit. The
abundances of He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Ca are subsolar by factors from 3 to more than 100, while
Fe is enriched by a factor of about 6. This peculiar chemical composition pattern is most likely caused
by atomic diffusion processes. Combining constraints from astrometry, orbital motion, photometry,
and spectroscopy, we conclude that the visible component is a stripped star of $0.25^{+0.15}_{-0.06}\,M_\odot$
that is evolving into a low-mass helium white dwarf. Based on the currently available data, the mass
of the unseen compact companion is, with 99\% confidence, larger than $1.5\,M_\odot$, that is,
it is most likely a neutron star or a black hole. There are very few other systems with similar properties
known to date, all of them hosting millisecond pulsars.
