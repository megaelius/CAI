Prompt optical emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is known to have important effects on the surrounding
environment. In this paper, we study rotational disruption and alignment of dust grains by radiative
torques (RATs) induced by GRB afterglows and predict their signatures on the observational properties
of GRB afterglows. We first study grain disruption using RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism
and find that large grains (size $>0.1 \mu\rm m$) within a distance of $d< 40$ pc from the source can
be disrupted into smaller grains. We then model the extinction curve of GRB afterglows and find that
optical-NIR extinction is rapidly decreased, and UV extinction increases due to the conversion
of large grains into smaller ones via RATD. The total-to-selective visual extinction ratio is found
to decrease from the standard value of $R_{V}\sim 3.1$ to $\sim 1.5$ after disruption time $t_{\rm
disr} \lesssim 10^{4}$ s. Next, we study grain alignment by RATs induced by GRB afterglows and model
the wavelength-dependence polarization produced by grains aligned with magnetic fields. We find
that polarization degree first increases due to enhanced alignment of small grains and then decreases
when grain disruption by RATD begins. The maximum polarization wavelength $ \lambda_{\rm max}$
decreases rapidly from the standard value of $\sim 0.55 \mu\rm m$ to $\sim 0.15 \mu\rm m$ over alignment
time of $t_{\rm align} \lesssim 30$ s due to enhanced alignment of small grains. Finally, we found
that RATD induces a significant decrease in optical/NIR extinction, producing an optical re-brightening
in the observed light curve of GRB afterglows. We show that our theoretical predictions can explain
various observational properties of GRB afterglows, including steep extinction curves, time-variability
of colors, and optical re-brightening of GRB afterglows.
