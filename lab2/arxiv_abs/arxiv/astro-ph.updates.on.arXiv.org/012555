Observations of high-redshift quasars imply the presence of supermassive black holes already
at z~ 7.5. An appealing and promising pathway to their formation is the direct collapse scenario
of a primordial gas in atomic-cooling haloes at z ~ 10 - 20, when the $\rm H_2$ formation is inhibited
by a strong background radiation field, whose intensity exceeds a critical value, $J_{\rm crit}$.
To estimate $J_{\rm crit}$, typically, studies have assumed idealized spectra, with a fixed ratio
of $\rm H_{2}$ photo-dissociation rate $k_{\rm H_2}$ to the $\rm H^-$ photo-detachment rate $k_{\rm
H^-}$. This assumption, however, could be too narrow in scope as the nature of the background radiation
field is not known precisely. In this work we argue that the critical condition for suppressing the
$\rm H_2$ cooling in the collapsing gas could be described in a more general way by a combination of
$k_{\rm H_2}$ and $k_{\rm H^-}$ parameters. By performing a series of cosmological zoom-in simulations
with an encompassing set of $k_{\rm H_2}$ and $k_{\rm H^-}$, we examine the gas flow by following
evolution of basic parameters of the accretion flow. We test under what conditions the gas evolution
is dominated by $\rm H_{2}$ and/or atomic cooling. We confirm the existence of a critical curve in
the $k_{\rm H_2}-k_{\rm H^-}$ plane, and provide an analytical fit to it. This curve depends on the
conditions in the direct collapse, and reveals domains where the atomic cooling dominates over
the molecular cooling. Furthermore, we have considered the effect of $\rm H_{2}$ self-shielding
on the critical curve, by adopting three methods for the effective column density approximation
in $\rm H_{2}$. We find that the estimate of the characteristic length-scale for shielding can be
improved by using $\lambda_{\rm Jeans25}$, which is 0.25 times that of the local Jeans length.
