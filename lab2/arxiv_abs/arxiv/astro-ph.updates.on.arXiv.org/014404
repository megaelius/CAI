A variety of large-scale diffuse radio structures have been identified in many clusters with the
advent of new state-of-the-art facilities in radio astronomy. Among these diffuse radio structures,
radio mini-halos are found in the central regions of cool core clusters. Their origin is still unknown
and they are challenging to discover; less than thirty have been published to date. Based on new VLA
observations, we confirmed the mini-halo in the massive strong cool core cluster PKS 0745$-$191
($z=0.1028$) and discovered one in the massive cool core cluster MACS J1447.4+0827 ($z=0.3755$).
Furthermore, using a detailed analysis of all known mini-halos, we explore the relation between
mini-halos and AGN feedback processes from the central galaxy. We find evidence of strong, previously
unknown correlations between mini-halo radio power and X-ray cavity power, and between mini-halo
and the central galaxy radio power related to the relativistic jets when spectrally decomposing
the AGN radio emission into a component for past outbursts and one for on-going accretion. Overall,
our study indicates that mini-halos are directly connected to the central AGN in clusters, following
previous suppositions. We hypothesize that AGN feedback may be one of the dominant mechanisms giving
rise to mini-halos by injecting energy into the intra-cluster medium and reaccelerating an old
population of particles, while sloshing motion may drive the overall shape of mini-halos inside
cold fronts. AGN feedback may therefore not only play a vital role in offsetting cooling in cool core
clusters, but may also play a fundamental role in re-energizing non-thermal particles in clusters.
