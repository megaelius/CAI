We detect a weak unidentified emission line at E=(3.55-3.57)+/-0.03 keV in a stacked XMM spectrum
of 73 galaxy clusters spanning a redshift range 0.01-0.35. MOS and PN observations independently
show the presence of the line at consistent energies. When the full sample is divided into three subsamples
(Perseus, Centaurus+Ophiuchus+Coma, and all others), the line is significantly detected in all
three independent MOS spectra and the PN "all others" spectrum. It is also detected in the Chandra
spectra of Perseus with the flux consistent with XMM (though it is not seen in Virgo). However, it
is very weak and located within 50-110eV of several known faint lines, and so is subject to significant
modeling uncertainties. On the origin of this line, we argue that there should be no atomic transitions
in thermal plasma at this energy. An intriguing possibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought
dark matter particle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with m_s=2E=7.1
keV, our detection in the full sample corresponds to a neutrino decay mixing angle sin^2(2theta)=7e-11,
below the previous upper limits. However, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in
Perseus is much brighter than expected in this model. This appears to be because of an anomalously
bright line at E=3.62 keV in Perseus, possibly an Ar XVII dielectronic recombination line, although
its flux would be 30 times the expected value and physically difficult to understand. In principle,
such an anomaly might explain our line detection in other subsamples as well, though it would stretch
the line energy uncertainties. Another alternative is the above anomaly in the Ar line combined
with the nearby 3.51 keV K line also exceeding expectation by factor 10-20. Confirmation with Chandra
and Suzaku, and eventually Astro-H, are required to determine the nature of this new line.(ABRIDGED)
