The success of ground-based, high contrast imaging for the detection of exoplanets in part depends
on the ability to differentiate between quasi-static speckles caused by aberrations not corrected
by adaptive optics (AO) systems, known as non-common path aberrations (NCPAs), and the planet intensity
signal. Frazin (ApJ, 2013) introduced a post-processing algorithm demonstrating that simultaneous
millisecond exposures in the science camera and wavefront sensor (WFS) can be used with a statistical
inference procedure to determine both the series expanded NCPA coefficients and the planetary
signal. We demonstrate, via simulation, that using this algorithm in a closed-loop AO system, real-time
estimation and correction of the quasi-static NCPA is possible without separate deformable mirror
(DM) probes. Thus the use of this technique allows for the removal of the quasi-static speckles that
can be mistaken for planetary signals without the need for new optical hardware, improving the efficiency
of ground-based exoplanet detection. In our simulations, we explore the behavior of the Frazin
Algorithm (FA) and the dependence of its convergence to an accurate estimate on factors such as Strehl
ratio, NCPA strength, and number of algorithm search basis functions. We then apply this knowledge
to simulate running the algorithm in real-time in a nearly ideal setting. We then discuss adaptations
that can be made to the algorithm to improve its real-time performance, and show their efficacy in
simulation. A final simulation tests the technique's resilience against imperfect knowledge
of the AO residual phase, motivating an analysis of the feasibility of using this technique in a real
closed-loop Extreme AO system such as SCExAO or MagAO-X, in terms of computational complexity and
the accuracy of the estimated quasi-static NCPA correction.
