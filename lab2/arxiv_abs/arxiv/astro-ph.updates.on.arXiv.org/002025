What exactly controls star formation in the Galaxy remains controversial. In particular, the role
of feedback and magnetic field are still partially understood. We investigate the role played by
supernovae feedback and magnetic field onto the star formation and the structure of the Galactic
disk. We perform numerical simulations of the turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating, multi-phase,
supernovae regulated ISM within a 1 kpc stratified box. We implemented various schemes for the supernovae.
This goes from a random distribution at a fixed rate to distributions for which the supernovae are
spatially and temporally correlated to the formation of stars. To study the influence of magnetic
field on star formation, we perform both hydrodynamical and magneto-hydrodynamical simulations.
We find that supernovae feedback has a drastic influence on the galactic evolution. The supernovae
distribution is playing a very significant role. When the supernovae are not correlated with star
formation events, they do not modify significantly the very high star formation rate obtained without
feedback. When the supernovae follow the accretion, the star formation rate can be reduced by a factor
up to 30. Magnetic field is also playing a significant role. It reduces the star formation rate by
a factor up to 2-3 and reduces the number of collapse sites by a factor of about 2. The exact correlation
between the supernovae and the dense gas appears to have significant consequences on the galactic
disk evolution and the star formation. This implies that small scale studies are necessary to understand
and quantify the feedback efficiency. Magnetic field does influence the star formation at galactic
scales by reducing the star formation rate and the number of star formation sites.
