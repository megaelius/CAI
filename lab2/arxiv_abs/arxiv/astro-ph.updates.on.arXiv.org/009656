We present a seven-minute long $4\pi$-3D simulation of a shell merger event in a non-rotating $18.88\,
\text{M}_{\odot}$ supernova progenitor before the onset of gravitational collapse. The key motivation
is to capture the large-scale mixing and asymmetries in the wake of the shell merger before collapse
using a self-consistent approach. The $4\pi$ geometry is crucial as it allows us to follow the growth
and evolution of convective modes on the largest possible scales. We find significant differences
between the kinematic, thermodynamic and chemical evolution of the 3D and the 1D model. The 3D model
shows vigorous convection leading to more efficient mixing of nuclear species. In the 3D case the
entire oxygen shell attains convective Mach numbers of $\mathord{\approx}\, 0.1$, whereas in
the 1D model, the convective velocities are much lower and there is negligible overshooting across
convective boundaries. In the 3D case, the convective eddies entrain nuclear species from the neon
(and carbon) layers into the deeper part of the oxygen burning shell, where they burn and power a violent
convection phase with outflows. This is a prototypical model of a convective-reactive system.
Due to the strong convection and the resulting efficient mixing, the interface between the neon
layer and the silicon-enriched oxygen layer disappears during the evolution, and silicon is mixed
far out into merged oxygen/neon shell. Neon entrained inwards by convective downdrafts burns,
resulting in lower neon mass in the 3D model compared to the 1D model at time of collapse. In addition,
the 3D model develops remarkable large-scale, large-amplitude asymmetries, which may have important
implications for the impending gravitational collapse and the subsequent explosion.
