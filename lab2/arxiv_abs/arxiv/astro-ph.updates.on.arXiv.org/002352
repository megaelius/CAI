Recent broad-band observations of GRBs with the Fermi satellite call for a "hybrid" central engine,
with both a hot "fireball" component and a cold "Poynting flux" component. We develop a theory of
photosphere emission from such a hybrid relativistic outflow with an arbitrary dimensionless
entropy $\eta$ and magnetization $\sigma_0$ at the central engine. We develop two approaches:
a "bottom-up" approach to predict the temperature and luminosity of the photosphere emission and
its relative brightness with respect to the non-thermal emission component from an optically thin
region; and a "top-down" approach to diagnose central engine parameters based on the observed photosphere
emission properties. For both approaches, we consider two possibilities: one is that the Poynting
flux does not suffer significant dissipation beneath the photosphere, while the other is that there
is such dissipation. From our bottom-up approach, we show that a variety of observed GRB prompt emission
spectra with different degrees of photosphere emission can be reproduced. In order to reproduce
the observed spectra, the outflows of most GRBs need to have a significant $\sigma$, both at the central
engine, and at the photosphere. The $\sigma$ value at $10^{15}$ cm from the central engine is usually
also greater than unity, so that internal-collision-induced magnetic reconnection and turbulence
(ICMART) may be the mechanism to power the non-thermal emission. We apply our top-down approach
to the time-resolved spectral data of GRB 110721A, and find that the temporal behavior of the blackbody
component in its time-resolved spectrum can be well interpreted with a time-varying $(\eta,\sigma_0)$
at the central engine, instead of invoking a varying engine base size $r_0$. (abridged)
