We carried out new $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) observations of a N63A supernova remnant (SNR) from
the LMC using the ALMA and ASTE. We find three giant molecular clouds toward the northeast, east,
and near the center of the SNR. Using the ALMA data, we spatially resolved clumpy molecular clouds
embedded within the optical nebulae in both the shock-ionized and photoionized lobes discovered
by previous H$\alpha$ and [S II] observations. The total mass of the molecular clouds is $\sim$700
$M_{\odot}$ for the shock-ionized region and $\sim$1500 $M_{\odot}$ for the photoionized region.
Spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the absorbing column densities toward the
molecular clouds are $\sim$1.3-$3.2 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, which are $\sim$2-20 times less
than the averaged interstellar proton column densities for each region. This means that the X-rays
are produced not only behind the molecular clouds, but also in front of the clouds. We conclude that
the dense molecular clouds have been completely engulfed by the shock waves, but have still survived
erosion owing to their high-density and short interacting time. The X-ray spectrum toward the gas
clumps is well explained by an absorbed power-law model in addition to the thermal plasma components,
possibly implying that cosmic rays are efficiently accelerated through the shock-cloud interaction.
If the hadronic gamma-ray is dominant in the GeV band, the total energy of cosmic-ray protons is calculated
to be $\sim$0.5-$2.6 \times 10^{49}$ erg with the estimated ISM proton density of $\sim$$190 \pm
90$ cm$^{-3}$, containing both the shock-ionized gas and neutral atomic hydrogen. We also produce
a polarisation map for this SNR at radio continuum frequencies and find a mean fractional polarisation
of P $\sim$3 percent with interesting feature in the eastern region of the remnant.
