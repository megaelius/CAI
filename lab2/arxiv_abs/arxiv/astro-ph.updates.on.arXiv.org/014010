Recent advances from astronomical surveys have revealed spatial, chemical, and kinematical inhomogeneities
in the inner region of the stellar halo of the Milky Way Galaxy. In particular, large spectroscopic
surveys, combined with Gaia astrometric data, have provided powerful tools for analyzing the detailed
abundances and accurate kinematics for individual stars. Despite these noteworthy efforts, however,
spectroscopic samples are typically limited by the numbers of stars considered; their analysis
and interpretation are also hampered by the complex selection functions that are often employed.
Here we present a powerful alternative approach $-$ a synoptic view of the spatial, chemical, and
kinematical distributions of stars in the Milky Way based on large photometric survey databases,
enabled by a well-calibrated technique for obtaining individual stellar metal abundances from
broad-band photometry. We combine metallicities with accurate proper motions from the Gaia mission
along the Prime Meridian of the Galaxy, and find that various stellar components are clearly separated
from each other in the metallicity versus rotation-velocity space. The observed metallicity distribution
of the inner-halo stars deviates from the traditional single-peaked distribution, and exhibits
complex substructures comprising varying contributions from individual stellar populations,
sometimes with striking double peaks at low metallicities. The substructures revealed from our
less-biased, comprehensive maps demonstrate the clear advantages of this approach, which can
be built upon by future mixed-band and broad-band photometric surveys, and used as a blueprint for
identifying the stars of greatest interest for upcoming spectroscopic studies.
