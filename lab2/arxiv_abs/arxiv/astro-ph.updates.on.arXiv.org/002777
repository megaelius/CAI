The all-sky 408 MHz map of Haslam et al. is one the most important total-power radio surveys. It has
been widely used to study diffuse synchrotron radiation from our Galaxy and as a template to remove
foregrounds in cosmic microwave background data. However, there are a number of issues associated
with it that must be dealt with, including large-scale striations and contamination from extragalactic
radio sources. We have re-evaluated and re-processed the rawest data available to produce a new
and improved 408 MHz all-sky map. We first quantify the positional accuracy ($\approx 7$ arcmin)
and effective beam ($56.0\pm1.0$ arcmin) of the four individual surveys from which it was assembled.
Large-scale striations associated with $1/f$ noise in the scan direction are reduced to a level
$\ll 1$ K using a Fourier-based filtering technique. The most important improvement results from
the removal of extragalactic sources. We have used an iterative combination of two techniques --
two-dimensional Gaussian fitting and minimum curvature spline surface inpainting -- to remove
the brightest sources ($\gtrsim 2$ Jy), which provides a significant improvement over previous
versions of the map. We quantify the impact with power spectra and a template fitting analysis of
foregrounds to the WMAP data. The new map is publicly available and is recommended as the template
of choice for large-scale diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission. We also provide a destriped-only
version as well as a higher resolution map with small-scale fluctuations added, assuming a power-law
angular power spectrum down to the pixel scale (1.7 arcmin). This should prove useful in simulations
used for studying the feasibility of detecting HI fluctuations from the Epoch of Reionization.
