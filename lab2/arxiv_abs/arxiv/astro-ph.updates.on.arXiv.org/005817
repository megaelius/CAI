At cosmological distances, gravitational lensing can provide a direct measurement of supermassive
black hole (SMBH) masses irrespective of their luminosities. When the background lensed and foreground
lensing galaxies are well aligned, an inherent degeneracy with the mass profile of the lensing galaxy
means that only constraints are possible on its SMBH mass. Here, we directly measure the mass of a
SMBH in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of MACS J1149.5+2223 at $z=0.54$ through one of the multiply-lensed
images of a background spiral galaxy at $z=1.49$ projected close to the BCG. In this particular image,
an intrinsically compact region in one of the spiral arms is lensed into an arc that curves towards
the BCG center. Crucially, this arc has a radius of curvature of only $\sim$0."6, betraying the presence
of a local compact deflector. Its curvature is most simply reproduced by a point-like object with
a mass of $8.4^{+4.3}_{-1.8}\times10^{9}M_\odot$, similar to SMBH masses in local elliptical
galaxies having comparable luminosities. The SMBH is noticeably offset by $4.4\pm0.3$ kpc from
the BCG light centre, plausibly the result of a kick imparted $\sim2.9\times10^7$ years ago during
the merger of two SMBHs, placing it just beyond the stellar core. A similar curvature can be produced
by replacing the offset SMBH with a compact galaxy having a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{10}M_\odot$
within a cutoff radius of $<4$ kpc, and an unusually large $M/L>50(M/L)_\odot$ to make it undetectable
in the deep Hubble Frontiers Fields image, at or close to the cluster redshift; such a lensing galaxy,
however, perturbs other nearby lensed features of the spiral galaxy in an undesirable manner.
