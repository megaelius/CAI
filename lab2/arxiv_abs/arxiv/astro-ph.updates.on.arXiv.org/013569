We study the evolution of chromospheric line and continuum emission during the impulsive phase
of the X-class SOL2014-09-10T17:45 solar flare. We extend previous analyses of this flare to multiple
chromospheric lines of Fe I, Fe II, Mg II, C I, and Si II, observed with IRIS, combined with radiative-hydrodynamical
(RHD) modeling. For multiple flaring kernels, the lines all show a rapidly evolving double-component
structure: an enhanced, emission component at rest, and a broad, highly red-shifted component
of comparable intensity. The red-shifted components migrate from 25-50 km s$^{-1}$ towards the
rest wavelength within $\sim$30 seconds. Using Fermi hard X-ray observations, we derive the parameters
of an accelerated electron beam impacting the dense chromosphere, using them to drive a RHD simulation
with the RADYN code. As in Kowalski et al. 2017a, our simulations show that the most energetic electrons
penetrate into the deep chromosphere, heating it to T$\sim$10,000 K, while the bulk of the electrons
dissipate their energy higher, driving an explosive evaporation, and its counterpart condensation
-- a very dense (n$_e \sim 2 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$), thin layer (30--40 km thickness), heated
to 8--12,000 K, moving towards the stationary chromosphere at up to 50 km s$^{-1}$. The synthetic
Fe II 2814.45A profiles closely resemble the observational data, including a continuum enhancement,
and both a stationary and a highly red-shifted component, rapidly moving towards the rest wavelength.
Importantly, the absolute continuum intensity, ratio of component intensities, relative time
of appearance, and red-shift amplitude, are sensitive to the model input parameters, showing great
potential as diagnostics.
