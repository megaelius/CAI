We present results from observations of the Galactic Center (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745-2900, at 2.3
and 8.4 GHz with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) 70 m antenna, DSS-43. We study the magnetar's radio
profile shape, flux density, radio spectrum, and single pulse behavior over a ~1 year period between
MJDs 57233 and 57621. In particular, the magnetar exhibits a significantly negative average spectral
index of $\langle\alpha\rangle$ = -1.86 $\pm$ 0.02 when the 8.4 GHz profile is single-peaked, which
flattens considerably when the profile is double-peaked. We have carried out an analysis of single
pulses at 8.4 GHz on MJD 57479 and find that giant pulses and pulses with multiple emission components
are emitted during a significant number of rotations. The resulting single pulse flux density distribution
is incompatible with a log-normal distribution. The typical pulse width of the components is ~1.8
ms, and the prevailing delay time between successive components is ~7.7 ms. Many of the single pulse
emission components show significant frequency structure over bandwidths of ~100 MHz, which we
believe is the first observation of such behavior from a radio magnetar. We report a characteristic
single pulse broadening timescale of $\langle\tau_{d}\rangle$ = 6.9 $\pm$ 0.2 ms at 8.4 GHz. We
find that the pulse broadening is highly variable between emission components and cannot be explained
by a thin scattering screen at distances $\gtrsim$ 1 kpc. We discuss possible intrinsic and extrinsic
mechanisms for the magnetar's emission and compare our results to other magnetars, high magnetic
field pulsars, and fast radio bursts (FRBs).
