Arcuate infrared nebulae are ubiquitous throughout the Galactic Plane and are candidates for partial
shells, bubbles, or bowshocks produced by massive runaway stars. We tabulate infrared photometry
for 709 such objects using images from the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), Wide-Field Infrared Explorer
(WISE), and Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). Of the 709 objects identified at 24 or 22 microns,
422 are detected at the HSO 70 micron bandpass. Of these, only 39 are detected at HSO 160 microns. The
70 micron peak surface brightnesses are 0.5 to 2.5 Jy/square arcminute. Color temperatures calculated
from the 24 micron to 70 micron ratios range from 80 K to 400 K. Color temperatures from 70 micron to
160 micron ratios are systematically lower, 40 K to 200 K. Both of these temperature are, on average,
75% higher than the nominal temperatures derived by assuming that dust is in steady-state radiative
equilibrium. This may be evidence of stellar wind bowshocks sweeping up and heating --- possibly
fragmenting but not destroying --- interstellar dust. Infrared luminosity correlates with standoff
distance, R_0, as predicted by published hydrodynamical models. Infrared spectral energy distributions
are consistent with interstellar dust exposed to a either single radiant energy density, U=10^3
to 10^5 (in more than half of the objects) or a range of radiant energy densities U_min=25 to U_max=10^3
to 10^5 times the mean interstellar value for the remainder. Hence, the central OB stars dominate
the energetics, making these enticing laboratories for testing dust models in constrained radiation
environments. SEDs are consistent with PAH fractions q_PAH <1% in most objects.
