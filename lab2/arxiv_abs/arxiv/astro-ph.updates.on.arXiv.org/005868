Aims: To investigate solar polar fields during cycle 24, using measurements of solar magnetic fields
in the latitude range 55 - 90 degree and 78 - 90 degree, to report a prolonged and unusual hemispheric
asymmetry in the polar field reversal pattern in solar cycle 24. Methods: This study was carried
out using medium resolution line-of-sight synoptic magnetograms from the magnetic database of
the National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak (NSO/KP), USA for the period between February 1975 and
October 2017, covering solar cycles 21-24 and high-resolution line-of-sight synoptic magnetograms
from the Michaelson Doppler Imager instrument onboard the Solar Heliospheric Observatory. Synoptic
magnetograms using radial measurements from the Heliospheric Magnetic Imager instrument onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory, covering solar cycle 23 and 24, were also used. Results: We show
that the Southern solar hemisphere unambiguously reversed polarity in mid-2013 while the reversal
in the field in the Northern solar hemisphere started as early as June 2012, was followed by a sustained
period of near-zero field strength lasting until the end of 2014, after which the field began to show
a clear rise from its near-zero value. While this study compliments a similar study carried out using
microwave brightness measurements (Gopalswamy et al. 2016) which claimed that the field reversal
process in cycle 24 was completed by the end of 2015, our results show that the field reversal in cycle
24 was completed earlier i.e. in late 2014. Signatures of this unusual field reversal pattern were
also clearly identifiable in the solar wind, using our observations of interplanetary scintillation
at 327 MHz which supported our magnetic field observations and confirmed that the field reversal
process was completed at the end of 2014.
