Galactic microlensing datasets now comprise in excess of $10^4$ events, and with the advent of next
generation microlensing surveys that may be undertaken with facilities such as the Vera Rubin Observatory
(formerly LSST) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST), this number will increase
significantly. So too will the fraction of events with measurable higher order information such
as finite source effects and lens-source relative proper motion. Analysing such data requires
a more sophisticated Galactic microlens modeling approach. We present a new second-generation
Manchester-Besan\c{c}on Microlensing Simulator (MaB$\mu$lS-2), which uses a version of the
Besan\c{c}on population synthesis Galactic model that provides good agreement with stellar kinematics
observed by HST towards the bulge. MaB$\mu$lS-2 provides high-fidelity signal-to-noise limited
maps of the microlensing optical depth, rate and average timescale towards a 400 sq. degree region
of the Galactic bulge in several optical to near-infrared pass-bands. The maps take full account
of the unresolved stellar background as well as limb-darkened source profiles. Comparing MaB$\mu$lS-2
to the efficiency-corrected OGLE-IV 8,000 event sample shows a much improved agreement over the
previous version of MaB$\mu$lS, and succeeds in matching even small-scale structural features
in the OGLE-IV event rate map. However, there remains evidence for a small under-prediction in the
event rate per source and over-prediction in timescale. MaB$\mu$lS-2 is available online (\<www.mabuls.net>)
to provide on-the-fly maps for user supplied cuts in survey magnitude, event timescale and relative
proper motion.
