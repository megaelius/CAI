Dust temperature is an important property of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. It is required
when converting (sub)millimeter broadband flux to total infrared luminosity (L_IR), and hence
star formation rate, in high-z galaxies. However, different definitions of dust temperatures
have been used in the literature, leading to different physical interpretations of how ISM conditions
change with, e.g., redshift and star formation rate. In this paper, we analyse the dust temperatures
of massive (M* > 10^10 Msun) z=2-6 galaxies with the help of high-resolution cosmological simulations
from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. At z~2, our simulations successfully
predict dust temperatures in good agreement with observations. We find that dust temperatures
based on the peak emission wavelength increase with redshift, in line with the higher star formation
activity at higher redshift, and are strongly correlated with the specific star formation rate.
In contrast, the mass-weighted dust temperature does not strongly evolve with redshift over z=2-6
at fixed IR luminosity but is tightly correlated with L_IR at fixed z. The mass-weighted temperature
is important for accurately estimating the total dust mass. We also analyse an 'equivalent' dust
temperature for converting (sub)millimeter flux density to total IR luminosity, and provide a
fitting formula as a function of redshift and dust-to-gas ratio. We find that galaxies of higher
equivalent (or higher peak) dust temperature ('warmer dust') do not necessarily have higher mass-weighted
temperatures. A 'two-phase' picture for interstellar dust can explain the different scaling relations
of the various dust temperatures.
