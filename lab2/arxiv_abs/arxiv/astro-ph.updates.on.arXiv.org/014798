Gravitational-wave memory effects are identified by their distinctive effects on families of
freely falling observers: after a burst of waves pass by their locations, memory effects can cause
lasting relative displacements of the observers. These effects are closely related to the infrared
properties of gravity and other massless field theories, including their asymptotic symmetries
and conserved quantities. In this paper, we investigate the connection between memory effects,
symmetries, and conserved quantities in Brans-Dicke theory. We compute the field equations in
Bondi coordinates, and we define a set of boundary conditions that represent asymptotically flat
solutions in this context. Next, we derive the asymptotic symmetry group of these spacetimes, and
we find that it is the same as the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group in general relativity. Because there
is an additional polarization of gravitational waves in Brans-Dicke theory, we compute the memory
effects associated with this extra polarization (the so-called "breathing" mode). This breathing
mode produces a uniform expansion (or contraction) of a ring of freely falling observers. After
these breathing gravitational waves pass by the observers' locations, there are two additional
memory effects that depend on their initial displacements and relative velocities. Neither of
these additional memory effects seems to be related to asymptotic symmetries or conserved quantities;
rather, they are determined by the properties of the nonradiative region before and after the bursts
of the scalar field and the gravitational waves. We discuss the properties of these regions necessary
to support nontrivial breathing-mode-type memory effects.
