We report on quasar outflow properties revealed by analyzing more than 60 composite outflow spectra
built from $\sim 60\,000$ CIV absorption troughs in the SDSS-III/BOSS DR12QBAL catalog. We assess
the dependences of the equivalent widths of many outflow metal absorption features on outflow velocity,
trough width and position, and quasar magnitude and redshift. The evolution of the equivalent widths
of the OVI and NV lines with outflow velocity correlates with that of the mean absorption-line width,
the outflow electron density, and the strength of lines arising from collisionally-excited meta-stable
states. None of these correlations is found for the other high- or low-ionization species, and different
behaviors with trough width are also suggested. We find no dependence on quasar magnitude or redshift
in any case. All the observed trends can be reconciled by considering a multiphase stratified outflow
structure, where inner regions are colder, denser and host lower-ionization species. Given the
prevalence of radiative acceleration in quasar outflows found by \cite{Masribas2019}, we suggest
that radiation pressure sweeps up and compresses the outflowing gas outwards, creating waves or
filaments where the multiphase stratified structure could take form. This scenario is supported
by the correlation between electron density and outflow velocity, and the similar behavior observed
for the line and line-locking components of the absorption features. We show that this outflow structure
is also consistent with other X-ray, radiative transfer, and polarization results, and discuss
the implications of our findings for future observational and numerical quasar outflow studies.
