Aim: We aim to determine the abundances of CS, SiO, and SiS in a large sample of carbon star envelopes
covering a wide range of mass loss rates to investigate the potential role that these molecules could
play in the formation of dust in the surroundings of the central AGB star. Methods: We surveyed a sample
of 25 carbon-rich AGB stars in the $\lambda$ 2 mm band, using the IRAM 30 m telescope. We performed
excitation and radiative transfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines
of the molecules and to derive their fractional abundances in the observed CSEs. Results: We detected
CS in all 25 CSEs, SiO in 24 of them, and SiS in 17 sources. We found that CS and SiS have similar abundances
in carbon star envelopes, while SiO is present with a lower abundance. We also found a strong correlation
in which the denser the envelope, the less abundant are CS and SiO. The trend is however only tentatively
seen for SiS in the range of high mass loss rates. Furthermore, we found a relation in which the integrated
flux of the MgS dust feature at 30 um increases as the fractional abundance of CS decreases. Conclusions:
The decline in the fractional abundance of CS with increasing density could be due to gas-phase chemistry
in the inner envelope or to adsorption onto dust grains. The latter possibility is favored by a correlation
between the CS fractional abundance and the 30 um feature, which suggests that CS is efficiently
incorporated onto MgS dust around C-rich AGB stars. In the case of SiO, the observed abundance depletion
with increasing density is most likely caused by an efficient incorporation onto dust grains. We
conclude that CS, SiO (very likely), and SiS (tentatively) are good candidates to act as gas-phase
precursors of dust in C-rich AGB envelopes.
