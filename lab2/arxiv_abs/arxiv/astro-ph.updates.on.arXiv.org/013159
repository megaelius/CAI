HD 209458b is an exoplanet with an upper atmosphere undergoing blow-off escape that has mainly been
studied using measurements of the Ly-alpha absorption. Recently, high-resolution measurements
of absorption in the He I triplet line at 10830 angstroms of several exoplanets (including HD 209458b)
have been reported, creating a new opportunity to probe escaping atmospheres. We aim to better understand
the atmospheric regions of HD 209458b from where the escape originates. We developed a 1D hydrodynamic
model with spherical symmetry for the HD 209458 b thermosphere coupled with a non-local thermodynamic
model for the population of the He triplet state. In addition, we performed high-resolution radiative
transfer calculations of synthetic spectra for the He triplet lines and compared them with the measured
absorption spectrum in order to retrieve information about the atmospheric parameters. We find
that the measured spectrum constrains the [H]/[H$^{+}$] transition altitude occurring in the
range of 1.2 to 1.9Rp. H is almost fully ionised at altitudes above 2.9Rp. We also find that the X-ray
and EUV absorption takes place at effective radii from 1.16 to 1.30Rp, and that the He triplet peak
density occurs at altitudes from 1.04 to 1.60Rp. Additionally, the averaged mmw is confined to the
0.61-0.73 g/mole interval, and the thermospheric H/He ratio should be larger than 90/10, and most
likely approximately 98/2. We also provide a one-to-one relationship between mass-loss rate and
temperature. Based on the energy-limited escape approach and assuming heating efficiencies of
0.1-0.2, we find a mass-loss rate in the range of (0.42-1.00)$\times 10^{11}$ g/s and a corresponding
temperature range of 7125 to 8125K. The analysis of the measured He triplet absorption spectrum
significantly constrains the thermospheric structure of HD 209458b and advances our knowledge
of its escaping atmosphere.
