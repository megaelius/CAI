We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) detection of the [O III] 88
$\mu$m line and dust continuum emission in a $Y$-dropout Lyman break galaxy (LBG), MACS0416_Y1,
lying behind the Frontier Field cluster MACS J0416.1$-$2403. This [O III] detection confirms the
LBG with a spectroscopic redshift of $z = 8.3118 \pm 0.0003$, making this galaxy one of the furthest
galaxies ever identified spectroscopically. The observed 850 $\mu$m flux density of $137 \pm 26$
$\mu$Jy corresponds to a de-lensed total infrared (IR) luminosity of $L_\mathrm{IR} = (1.7 \pm
0.3) \times 10^{11}\,L_{\odot}$ if assuming a dust temperature of $T_\mathrm{dust} = 50$ K and
an emissivity index of $\beta = 1.5$, yielding a large dust mass of $4 \times 10^6\,M_{\odot}$. The
apparent [O III] flux and line width are $71 \pm 17$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ and $141 \pm 21$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.
The inferred [O III]-to-IR luminosity ratio is low ($\approx 1 \times 10^{-3}$) and is comparable
to local spirals or dusty starbursts even if the uncertainty in dust temperature is taken into account.
The ultraviolet-to-far IR spectral energy distribution modeling where the [O III] emissivity
model is incorporated suggests the presence of a moderately-evolved stellar component with the
stellar mass of $M_\mathrm{star} = 5 \times 10^9\,M_{\odot}$, the age of $\tau_\mathrm{age} =
0.18$ Gyr and the metallicity of $Z \approx 0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ if the dust extinction law is similar
to the Calzetti or Milky Way law. This implies that a formation epoch dates back to $z \approx 11$.
Despite a large uncertainty, an analytic dust mass evolution model reproduces these physical properties
including the dust mass in $\tau_\mathrm{age} = 0.18$ Gyr, suggesting rapid enrichment of heavy
elements in the middle of the reionization era.
