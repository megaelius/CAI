We present a new Bayesian algorithm making use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling that allows us
to simultaneously estimate the unknown continuum level of each quasar in an ensemble of high-resolution
spectra, as well as their common probability distribution function (PDF) for the transmitted Ly$\alpha$
forest flux. This fully automated PDF regulated continuum fitting method models the unknown quasar
continuum with a linear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) basis, with the PCA coefficients treated
as nuisance parameters. The method allows one to estimate parameters governing the thermal state
of the intergalactic medium (IGM), such as the slope of the temperature-density relation $\gamma-1$,
while marginalizing out continuum uncertainties in a fully Bayesian way. Using realistic mock
quasar spectra created from a simplified semi-numerical model of the IGM, we show that this method
recovers the underlying quasar continua to a precision of $\simeq7\%$ and $\simeq10\%$ at $z=3$
and $z=5$, respectively. Given the number of principal component spectra, this is comparable to
the underlying accuracy of the PCA model itself. Most importantly, we show that we can achieve a nearly
unbiased estimate of the slope $\gamma-1$ of the IGM temperature-density relation with a precision
of $\pm8.6\%$ at $z=3$, $\pm6.1\%$ at $z=5$, for an ensemble of ten mock high-resolution quasar
spectra. Applying this method to real quasar spectra and comparing to a more realistic IGM model
from hydrodynamical simulations would enable precise measurements of the thermal and cosmological
parameters governing the IGM, albeit with somewhat larger uncertainties given the increased flexibility
of the model.
