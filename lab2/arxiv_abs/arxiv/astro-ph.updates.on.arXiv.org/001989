We present a detailed, 3D hydrodynamics study of the neutrino-driven winds that emerge from the
remnant of a NS merger. Our simulations are performed with the Newtonian, Eulerian code FISH, augmented
by a detailed, spectral neutrino leakage scheme that accounts for heating due to neutrino absorption
in optically thin conditions. Consistent with the 2D study of Dessart et al. (2009), we find that
a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original binary rotation axis within $100$ ms after
the merger. We compute a lower limit on the expelled mass of $3.5 \times 10^{-3} M_{\odot}$, large
enough to be relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis. The physical properties vary significantly
between different wind regions. For example, due to stronger neutrino irradiation, the polar regions
show substantially larger $Y_e$ than those at lower latitudes. This has its bearings on the nucleosynthesis:
the polar ejecta produce interesting r-process contributions from $A\sim 80$ to about 130, while
the more neutron-rich, lower-latitude parts produce also elements up to the third r-process peak
near $A\sim 195$. We also calculate the properties of electromagnetic transients that are powered
by the radioactivity in the wind, in addition to the macronova transient that stems from the dynamic
ejecta. The high-latitude (polar) regions produce UV/optical transients reaching luminosities
up to $10^{41} {\rm erg \, s^{-1}}$, which peak around 1 day in optical and 0.3 days in bolometric luminosity.
The lower-latitude regions, due to their contamination with high-opacity heavy elements, produce
dimmer and more red signals, peaking after $\sim 2$ days in optical and infrared. Our numerical experiments
indicate that it will be difficult to infer the collapse time-scale of the HMNS to a BH based on the
wind electromagnetic transient, at least for collapse time-scales larger than the wind production
time-scale.
