In coupled ring-satellite systems, satellites exchange angular momentum with both the primary
through tides and with the ring through Lindblad torques, and may exchange material with the ring
through accretion and tidal disruption. Here we show that these coupled ring-satellite systems
fall into three distinct dynamical regimes, which we refer to as `Boomerang,' `Slingshot,' and
`Torque-Dependent.' These regimes are determined by the relative locations of the Fluid Roche
Limit, the synchronous orbit, and the location of the maximum orbit that Lindblad torques can perturb
a satellite. Satellites that accrete from rings in the Boomerang regime remain interior to the synchronous
orbit, and may be driven back toward the primary by tides. Satellites that accrete from rings in the
Slingshot regime form exterior to the synchronous orbit, and are always driven away from the primary.
Satellites that accrete from rings in the Torque-Dependent regime may exhibit either Boomerang
or Slingshot behavior, depending on ring and satellite masses. We consider both known and hypothesized
ring/satellite systems in the solar system, and identify which of these three regimes they fall
into. We determine that Uranus exists within the Torque-Dependent regime. Using the RING-MOONS
code, which models the dynamical evolution of coupled ring-satellite systems, we show that the
Uranian satellite Miranda may have accreted from a massive ancient Roche-interior ring and followed
a Slingshot-like dynamical path to its present orbit beyond the synchronous orbit, while satellites
that accreted after Miranda followed Boomerang-like evolution paths and remained interior to
the synchronous orbit.
