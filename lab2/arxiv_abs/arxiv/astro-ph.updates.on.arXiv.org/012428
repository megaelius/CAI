In this letter, we investigate the impact of environment on integrated and spatially-resolved
stellar kinematics of a sample of massive, quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshift ($0.6<z<1.0$).
For this analysis, we combine photometric and spectroscopic parameters from the UltraVISTA and
Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) surveys in the COSMOS field and environmental
measurements. We analyze the trends with overdensity (1+$\delta$) on the rotational support of
quiescent galaxies and find no universal trends at either fixed mass or fixed stellar velocity dispersion.
This is consistent with previous studies of the local Universe; rotational support of massive galaxies
depends primarily on stellar mass. We highlight two populations of massive galaxies ($\log M_\star/M_\odot\geq11$)
that deviate from the average mass relation. First, the most massive galaxies in the most under-dense
regions ($(1+\delta)\leq1$) exhibit elevated rotational support. Similarly, at the highest
masses ($\log M_\star/M_\odot\geq11.25$) the range in rotational support is significant in all
but the densest regions. This corresponds to an increasing slow-rotator fraction such that only
galaxies in the densest environments ($(1+\delta)\geq3.5$) are primarily (90$\pm$10\%) slow-rotators.This
effect is not seen at fixed velocity dispersion, suggesting minor merging as the driving mechanism:
only in the densest regions have the most massive galaxies experienced significant minor merging,
building stellar mass and diminishing rotation without significantly affecting the central stellar
velocity dispersion. In the local Universe, most massive galaxies are slow-rotators, regardless
of environment, suggesting minor merging occurs at later cosmic times $(z\lesssim0.6)$ in all
but the most dense environments.
