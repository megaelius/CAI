Dust polarization depends on the physical and mechanical properties of dust, as well as the properties
of local environments. To understand how dust polarization varies with grain mechanical properties
and the local environment, in this paper, we model the wavelength-dependence polarization of starlight
and polarized dust emission by aligned grains by simultaneously taking into account grain alignment
and rotational disruption by radiative torques (RATs). We explore a wide range of the local radiation
field and grain mechanical properties characterized by tensile strength. We find that the maximum
polarization and the peak wavelength shift to shorter wavelengths as the radiation strength $U$
increases due to the enhanced alignment of small grains. Grain rotational disruption by RATs tends
to decrease the optical-near infrared polarization but increases the ultraviolet polarization
of starlight due to the conversion of large grains into smaller ones. In particular, we find that
the submillimeter (submm) polarization degree at $850~\mu \rm m$ ($P_{850}$) does not increase
monotonically with the radiation strength or grain temperature ($T_{d}$), but it depends on the
tensile strength of grain materials. Our physical model of dust polarization can be tested with
observations toward star-forming regions or molecular clouds irradiated by a nearby star, which
have higher radiation intensity than the average interstellar radiation field. Finally, we compare
our predictions of the $P_{850}-T_{d}$ relationship with {\it Planck} data and find that the observed
decrease of $P_{850}$ with $T_{d}$ can be explained when grain disruption by RATs is accounted for,
suggesting that interstellar grains unlikely to have a compact structure but perhaps a composite
one. The variation of the submm polarization with U (or $T_{d}$) can provide a valuable constraint
on the internal structures of cosmic dust.
