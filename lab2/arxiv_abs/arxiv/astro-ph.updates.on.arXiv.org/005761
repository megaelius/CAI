We use the POLARIS radiative transport code to generate predictions of the two main observables
directly sensitive to the magnetic field morphology and strength in filaments: dust polarization
and gas Zeeman line splitting. We simulate generic gas filaments with power-law density profiles
assuming two density-field strength dependencies, six different filament inclinations, and
nine distinct magnetic field morphologies, including helical, toroidal, and warped magnetic
field geometries. We present idealized spatially resolved dust polarization and Zeeman-derived
field strengths and directions maps. Under the assumption that dust grains are aligned by radiative
torques (RATs), dust polarization traces the projected plane-of-the-sky magnetic field morphology.
Zeeman line splitting delivers simultaneously the intensity-weighted line-of-sight field strength
and direction. We show that linear dust polarization alone is unable to uniquely constrain the 3D
field morphology. We demonstrate that these ambiguities are ameliorated or resolved with the addition
of the Zeeman directional information. Thus, observations of both the dust polarization and Zeeman
splitting together provide the most promising means for obtaining constraints of the 3D magnetic
field configuration. We find that the Zeeman-derived field strengths are at least a factor of a few
below the input field strengths due to line-of-sight averaging through the filament density gradient.
Future observations of both dust polarization and Zeeman splitting are essential for gaining insights
into the role of magnetic fields in star and cluster forming filaments.
