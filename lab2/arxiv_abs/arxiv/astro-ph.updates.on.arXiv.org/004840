X-ray shocks and radio relics detected in the cluster outskirts are commonly interpreted as shocks
induced by mergers of sub-clumps. We study the properties of merger shocks in merging galaxy clusters,
using a set of cosmological simulations for the large-scale structure formation of the universe.
As a representative case, we here focus on the simulated clusters that undergo almost head-on collisions
with mass ratio $\sim2$. Due to the turbulent nature of the intracluster medium, shock surfaces
are not smooth, but composed of shocks with different Mach numbers. As the merger shocks expand outward
from the core to the outskirts, the average Mach number, $\left<M_s\right>$, increases in time.
We suggest that the shocks propagating along the merger axis could be manifested as X-ray shocks
and/or radio relics. The kinetic energy through the shocks, $F_\phi$, peaks at $\sim1$ Gyr after
their initial launching, or at $\sim1-2$ Mpc from the core. Because of the Mach number dependent
model adopted here for the cosmic ray (CR) acceleration efficiency, their CR-energy-weighted
Mach number is higher with $\left< M_s \right>_{\rm CR}\sim3-4$, compared to the kinetic-energy-weighted
Mach number, $\left<M_s\right>_{\phi}\sim2-3$. Most energetic shocks are to be found ahead of
the lighter dark matter (DM) clump, while the heavier DM clump is located in the opposite side of clusters.
Although our study is limited to the merger case considered, the results such as the means and variations
of shock properties and their time evolution could be compared with the observed characteristics
of merger shocks, constraining interpretations of relevant observations.
