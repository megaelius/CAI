Early-phase Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), especially those with luminosity enhancement within
the first few days of explosions ("early-excess SNe Ia"), play an irreplaceable role in addressing
the long-standing progenitor and explosion issue of SNe Ia. In this paper, we systematically investigate
11 early-excess SNe Ia from subluminous to luminous subclasses. Eight of them are selected from
23 SNe Ia with extremely early-phase optical light curves ("golden" early-phase SNe Ia), and three
of them are selected from 40 SNe Ia (including 14 golden samples) with early-phase UV/NUV light curves.
We found that previously discovered early-excess SNe Ia show a clear preference for specific SN
Ia subclasses. In particular, the early-excess feature shown in all six luminous (91T- and 99aa-like)
SNe Ia is in conflict with the viewing angle dependence predicted by the companion-ejecta interaction
scenario. Instead, such a high early-excess fraction is likely related to the explosion physics
of luminous SNe Ia; i.e. a more efficient detonation happening in the progenitor of luminous SNe
Ia may consequently account for the early-excess feature powered by the radiation from a $^{56}$Ni-abundant
outer layer. The diversity of early-excess features shown in different SN Ia subclasses suggests
multiple origins of the discovered early-excess SNe Ia, challenging their applicability as a robust
progenitor indicator. Further understanding of the early-excess diversity relies not only on
multiband photometry and prompt-response spectroscopy of individual early-excess SNe Ia but
also on investigations of the general early-phase light-curve behavior of each SN Ia subclass,
which can be realized through ongoing/forthcoming transient survey projects in the near future.
