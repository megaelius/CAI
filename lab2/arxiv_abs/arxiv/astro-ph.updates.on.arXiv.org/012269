The Wide-Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission is expected to launch in the mid-2020s.
Its weak lensing program is designed to enable unprecedented systematics control in photometric
measurements, including shear recovery, point-spread function (PSF) correction, and photometric
calibration. This will enable exquisite weak lensing science and allow us to adjust to and reliably
contribute to the cosmological landscape after the initial years of observations from other concurrent
Stage IV dark energy experiments. This potential requires equally careful planning and requirements
validation as the mission prepares to enter its construction phase. We present a suite of image simulations
based on GalSim that are used to construct a complex, synthetic WFIRST weak lensing survey that incorporates
realistic input galaxies and stars, relevant detector non-idealities, and the current reference
five-year WFIRST survey strategy. We present a first study to empirically validate the existing
WFIRST weak lensing requirements flowdown using a suite of 12 matched image simulations, each representing
a different perturbation to the wavefront or image motion model. These are chosen to induce a range
of potential static and low- and high-frequency time-dependent PSF model errors. We analyze the
measured shapes of galaxies from each of these simulations and compare them to a reference, fiducial
simulation to infer the response of the shape measurement to each of these modes in the wavefront
model. We then compare this to existing analytic flowdown requirements, and find general agreement
between the empirically derived response and that predicted by the analytic model.
