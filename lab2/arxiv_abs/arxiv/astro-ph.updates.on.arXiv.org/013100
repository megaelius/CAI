This paper presents an investigation on the four open clusters Czernik 14, Haffner 14, Haffner 17
and King 10 located near the Perseus arm of Milky Way Galaxy using Gaia DR2, 2MASS, WISE, APASS and
Pan-STARRS1 data sets. We find normal interstellar extinction in twelve photometric bands for
these clusters. Likely cluster members are identified as 225, 353, 350 and 395 for Czernik 14, Haffner
14, Haffner 17 and King 10, respectively by using Gaia DR2 proper motion data. Radii are determined
as 3.5, 3.7, 6.2 and 5.7 arcmin for Czernik 14, Haffner 14, Haffner 17 and King 10 respectively. Mean
proper motions in RA and DEC are estimated as (-0.42 \pm 0.02, -0.38 \pm 0.01), (-1.82 \pm 0.009, 1.73
\pm 0.008), (-1.17 \pm 0.007, 1.88 \pm 0.006) and (-2.75 \pm 0.008, -2.04 \pm 0.006) mas/yr for Czernik
14, Haffner 14, Haffner 17 and King 10, respectively. The comparison of observed CMDs with solar
metallicity isochrones leads to an age of 570 \pm 60, 320 \pm 35, 90 \pm 10 and 45 \pm 5 Myr for these clusters.
The distances 2.9 \pm 0.1, 4.8 \pm 0.4, 3.6 \pm 0.1 and 3.8 \pm 0.1 kpc determined using parallax are
comparable with the values derived by the isochrone fitting method. Mass function slopes are found
to be in good agreement with the Salpeter value. The total masses are derived as 348, 595, 763 and 1088
solar mass for the clusters Czernik 14, Haffner 14, Haffner 17 and King 10, respectively. Evidence
for the existence of mass-segregation effect is observed in each cluster. Using the Galactic potential
model, Galactic orbits are derived for the clusters. The present study indicates that all clusters
under study fallow a circular path around the Galactic center.
