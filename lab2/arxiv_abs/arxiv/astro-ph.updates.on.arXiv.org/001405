We present a detailed stellar clustering analysis with the application of the two-point correlation
function on distinct young stellar ensembles. Our aim is to understand how stellar systems are assembled
at the earliest stages of their formation. Our object of interest is the star-forming region NGC
346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is a young stellar system well-revealed from its natal environment,
comprising complete samples of pre--main-sequence and upper main-sequence stars, very close
to their formation. We apply a comprehensive characterization of the autocorrelation function
for both centrally condensed stellar clusters and self-similar stellar distributions through
numerical simulations of stellar ensembles. We interpret the observed autocorrelation function
of NGC 346 on the basis of these simulations. We find that it can be best explained as the combination
of two distinct stellar clustering designs, a centrally concentrated, dominant at the central
part of the star-forming region, and an extended self-similar distribution of stars across the
complete observed field. The cluster component, similar to non-truncated young star clusters,
is determined to have a core radius of ~2.5 pc and a density profile index of ~2.3. The extended fractal
component is found with our simulations to have a fractal dimension of ~2.3, identical to that found
for the interstellar medium, in agreement to hierarchy induced by turbulence. This suggests that
the stellar clustering at a time very near to birth behaves in a complex manner. It is the combined
result of the star formation process regulated by turbulence and the early dynamical evolution
induced by the gravitational potential of condensed stellar clusters.
