Accurate and precise measurements of masses of galaxy clusters are key to derive robust constraints
on cosmological parameters. Rising evidence from observations, however, confirms that X-ray
masses, obtained under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, might be underestimated, as
previously predicted by cosmological simulations. We analyse more than 300 simulated massive
clusters, from `The Three Hundred Project', and investigate the connection between mass bias and
several diagnostics extracted from synthetic X-ray images of these simulated clusters. We find
that the azimuthal scatter measured in 12 sectors of the X-ray flux maps is a statistically significant
indication of the presence of an intrinsic (i.e. 3D) clumpy gas distribution. We verify that a robust
correction to the hydrostatic mass bias can be inferred when estimates of the gas inhomogeneity
from X-ray maps (such as the azimuthal scatter or the gas ellipticity) are combined with the asymptotic
external slope of the gas density or pressure profiles, which can be respectively derived from X-ray
and millimetric (Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) observations. We also obtain that mass measurements
based on either gas density and temperature or gas density and pressure result in similar distributions
of the mass bias. In both cases, we provide corrections that help reduce both the dispersion and skewness
of the mass bias distribution. These are effective even when irregular clusters are included leading
to interesting implications for the modelling and correction of hydrostatic mass bias in cosmological
analyses of current and future X-ray and SZ cluster surveys.
