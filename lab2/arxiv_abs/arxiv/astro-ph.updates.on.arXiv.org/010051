Recycled pulsars are old ($\gtrsim10^{8}$ yr) neutron stars that are descendants from close, interacting
stellar systems. In order to understand their evolution and population, we must find and study the
largest number possible of recycled pulsars in a way that is as unbiased as possible. In this work,
we present the discovery and timing solutions of five recycled pulsars in binary systems (PSRs J0509$+$0856,
J0709$+$0458, J0732$+$2314, J0824$+$0028, J2204$+$2700) and one isolated millisecond pulsar
(PSR J0154$+$1833). These were found in data from the Arecibo 327-MHz Drift-Scan Pulsar Survey
(AO327). All these pulsars have a low dispersion measure (DM) ($\lesssim 45 \, \rm{pc}\, cm^{-3}$),
and have a DM-determined distance of $\lesssim$ 3 kpc. Their timing solutions, have data spans ranging
from 1 to $\sim$ 7 years, include precise estimates of their spin and astrometric parameters, and
for the binaries, precise estimates of their Keplerian binary parameters. Their orbital periods
range from about 4 to 815 days and the minimum companion masses (assuming a pulsar mass of 1.4 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$)
range from $\sim$ 0.06--1.11 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$. For two of the binaries we detect post-Keplerian
parameters; in the case of PSR~J0709$+$0458 we measure the component masses but with a low precision,
in the not too distant future the measurement of the rate of advance of periastron and the Shapiro
delay will allow very precise mass measurements for this system. Like several other systems found
in the AO327 data, PSRs J0509$+$0854, J0709$+$0458 and J0732$+$2314 are now part of the NANOGrav
timing array for gravitational wave detection.
