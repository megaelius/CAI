Exoplanets orbiting very close to their host star are strongly irradiated. This can lead the upper
atmospheric layers to expand and evaporate into space. The metastable helium (HeI) triplet at 1083.3nm
has recently been shown to be a powerful diagnostic to probe extended and escaping exoplanetary
atmosphere. We perform high-resolution transmission spectroscopy of the transiting hot Jupiter
HD189733b with the GIARPS (GIANO-B + HARPS-N) observing mode of the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo,
taking advantage of the simultaneous optical+near infrared spectral coverage to detect HeI in
the planet's extended atmosphere and to gauge the impact of stellar magnetic activity on the planetary
absorption signal. Observations were performed during five transit events of HD189733b. By comparison
of the in- and out-of-transit GIANO-B observations we compute high-resolution transmission spectra,
on which we perform equivalent width measurements and light-curves analyses to gauge the excess
in-transit absorption in the HeI triplet. We detect an absorption signal during all five transits.
The mean in-transit absorption depth amounts to 0.75+/-0.03%. We detect night-to-night variations
in the HeI absorption signal likely due to the transit events occurring in presence of stellar surface
inhomogeneities. We evaluate the impact of stellar-activity pseudo-signals on the true planetary
absorption using a comparative analysis of the HeI and the H$\alpha$ lines. We interpret the time-series
of the HeI absorption lines in the three nights not affected by stellar contamination -exhibiting
a mean in-transit absorption depth of 0.77+/-0.04%- using a 3-d atmospheric code. Our simulations
suggest that the helium layers only fill part of the Roche lobe. Observations can be explained with
a thermosphere heated to $\sim$12000 K, expanding up to $\sim$1.2 planetary radii, and losing $\sim$1
g/s of metastable helium.
