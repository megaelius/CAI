We present measurements of the large-scale (~40 comoving Mpc) effective optical depth of HeII Ly$\alpha$
absorption, $\tau_{\rm eff}$, at 2.54<z<3.86 toward 16 HeII-transparent quasars observed with
the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), to characterize the
ionization state of helium in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We provide the first statistical
sample of $\tau_{\rm eff}$ measurements in six signal-to-noise ratio >3 HeII sightlines at z>3.5,
and study the redshift evolution and sightline-to-sightline variance of $\tau_{\rm eff}$ in 24
HeII sightlines. We confirm an increase of the median $\tau_{\rm eff}$ from ~2 at z=2.7 to >5 at z>3,
and a scatter in $\tau_{\rm eff}$ that increases with redshift. The z>3.5 HeII absorption is predominantly
saturated, but isolated narrow ($\Delta v<650$ km/s) transmission spikes indicate patches of
reionized helium. We compare our measurements to predictions for a range of UV background models
applied to outputs of a large-volume (146 comoving Mpc)$^3$ hydrodynamical simulation by forward-modeling
our sample's quality and size. At z>2.74 the variance in $\tau_{\rm eff}$ significantly exceeds
expectations for a spatially uniform UV background, but is consistent with a fluctuating radiation
field sourced by variations in the quasar number density and the mean free path in the post-reionization
IGM. We develop a method to infer the approximate median HeII photoionization rate $\Gamma_{\rm
HeII}$ of a fluctuating UV background from the median $\tau_{\rm eff}$, finding a factor ~5 decrease
in $\Gamma_{\rm HeII}$ between z~2.6 and z~3.1. At z~3.1 a $\Gamma_{\rm HeII}=\left[9.1^{+1.1}_{-1.2}\,\mathrm{(stat.)}\,^{+2.4}_{-3.4}\,\mathrm{(sys.)}\right]\times10^{-16}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$
corresponds to a median HeII fraction of ~2.5%, indicating that our data probe the tail end of HeII
reionization.
