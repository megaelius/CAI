In 1984, three telescopes in South America recorded an occultation of a star near Neptune. It was
attributed to the existence of a partial ring or ring arc. The existence of ring arcs around Neptune
was confirmed during subsequent years via other occultation experiments and by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.
The Voyager observations established that the Neptunian arcs are concentrations of particles
embedded within Neptune's narrow Adams ring, the outermost of six tenuous rings discovered by Voyager
and discussed here. Four ring arcs were identified: the trailing arc Fraternit\'e, a double-component
arc Egalit\'e, dubbed Egalit\'e 1 and 2, Libert\'e, and the leading arc Courage. The arcs varied
in extent from $\sim$ 1$^\circ$ to $\sim$ 10$^\circ$, and together were confined to a longitude
range of 40$^\circ$, with typical radial widths of $\sim$ 15 km and optical depth of order 0.1. The
properties of the dusty component of Neptune's rings are also discussed in this chapter. Although
the arcs should have been destroyed in a few months time through differential Keplerian motion,
they appeared to persist at least throughout the Voyager era, and well beyond. However, observations
from Earth (both with the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based adaptive optics) show an evolution
in the last three decades, with the disappearance of both Courage and Libert\'e by 2009. This chapter
reviews the constraints provided on the mean motion of the arcs and Galatea, the satellite possibly
responsible for the arc confinement. This in turn constrains the various models that have been proposed
to explain the arc longevity.
