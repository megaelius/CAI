We present a local dust mass function (DMF) of 15,355 galaxies drawn from the overlapping GAMA and
H-ATLAS fields out to redshifts of 0.1. We derive this fundamental measurement of the dust content
of galaxies using the traditional density corrected $V$max method where we use: (i) the normal photometric
selection limit ($pV$max) and (ii) a bivariate brightness distribution (BBD) technique, which
accounts for two selection effects. A single Schechter function adequately represents both the
$pV$max and BBD estimates. We derive Schechter function parameters of $\alpha$=(-1.21+/-0.01),
M$^*$=(4.70+/-0.17)$\times10^{7}h^{2}_{70}M_{\odot}$, $\phi^*$=(6.18+/-0.26)$\times10^{-3}h^{3}_{70}\rm
Mpc^{-3}dex^{-1}$. The dust mass density parameter integrated down to our limit of $10^{4}M_{\odot}$
is $\Omega_{d}$=(1.09+/-0.02)$\times10^{-6}$ with an overall fraction of baryons (by mass)
stored in dust $f_{mb}$=(4.59+/-0.08)$\times10^{-5}$; the additional error due to cosmic variance
is ~17 per cent. We show that the observed DMF does not agree with theoretical predictions derived
from semi-analytic models or hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. We show that the former
attributes too much dust to high stellar mass galaxies. The dust-to-stellar mass ratio is higher
for low-mass disks than currently assumed in the models. The latter underpredicts the high mass
end of the DMF potentially due to long grain growth timescales. In comparing the DMFs and galaxy stellar
mass functions (GSMF) we find there may be a simple approximate linear scaling of (7.61+/-0.36)$\times10^{-4}$
from the late-type galaxy (LTG) GSMF to the LTG DMF. The LTG DMF can also be approximated by scaling
the disk GSMF by a factor of (9.63+/-0.46)$\times10^{-4}$. We derive dust mass densities of ${\Omega}_{d}$=(0.83+/-0.03)$\times10^{-6}$
and ${\Omega}_{d}$=(0.060+/-0.004)$\times10^{-6}$ for LTGs and early-types respectively.
