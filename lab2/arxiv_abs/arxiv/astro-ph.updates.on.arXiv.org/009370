Evidence has increasingly mounted in recent decades that outflows of matter and energy from the
central parsecs of our Galaxy have shaped the observed structure of the Milky Way on a variety of larger
scales. On scales of ~15 pc, the Galactic centre has bipolar lobes that can be seen in both X-rays and
radio, indicating broadly collimated outflows from the centre, directed perpendicular to the
Galactic plane. On far larger scales approaching the size of the Galaxy itself, gamma-ray observations
have identified the so-called Fermi Bubble features, implying that our Galactic centre has, or
has recently had, a period of active energy release leading to a production of relativistic particles
that now populate huge cavities on both sides of the Galactic plane. The X-ray maps from the ROSAT
all-sky survey show that the edges of these cavities close to the Galactic plane are bright in X-rays.
At intermediate scales (~150 pc), radio astronomers have found the Galactic Centre Lobe, an apparent
bubble of emission seen only at positive Galactic latitudes, but again indicative of energy injection
from near the Galactic centre. Here we report the discovery of prominent X-ray structures on these
intermediate (hundred-parsec) scales above and below the plane, which appear to connect the Galactic
centre region to the Fermi bubbles. We propose that these newly-discovered structures, which we
term the Galactic Centre Chimneys, constitute a channel through which energy and mass, injected
by a quasi-continuous train of episodic events at the Galactic centre, are transported from the
central parsecs to the base of the Fermi bubbles.
