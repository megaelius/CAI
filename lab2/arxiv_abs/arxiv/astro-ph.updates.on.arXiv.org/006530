The detection of a gravitational capture of a stellar-mass compact object by a massive black hole
(MBH) will allow us to test gravity in the strong regime. These sources form via two-body relaxation,
by exchanging energy and angular momentum, and inspiral in a slow, progressive way down to the final
merger. The range of frequencies is localised in the range of millihertz in the case of MBH of masses
$\sim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$, i.e. that of space-borne gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA.
In this article I show that, depending on their orbital parameters, in globular clusters intermediate-mass
ratios (IMRIs) of MBH of masses between a hundred and a few thousand have frequencies that make them
detectable (i) with ground-based observatories, or (ii) with both LISA and ground-based ones such
as advanced LIGO/Virgo and third generation ones, with ET as an example. The binaries have a signal-to-noise
ratio large enough to ensure detection. More extreme values in their orbital parameters correspond
to systems detectable only with ground-based detectors and enter the LIGO/Virgo band in particular
in many different harmonics for masses up to some $2000,\,M_{\odot}$. I show that environmental
effects are negligible, so that the source should not have this kind of complication. The accumulated
phase-shift is measurable with LISA and ET, and for some cases also with LIGO, so that it is possible
to recover information about the eccentricity and formation scenario. For IMRIs with a total mass
$\lessapprox 2000\,M_{\odot}$ and initial eccentricities up to $0.999$, LISA can give a warning
to ground-based detectors with enough time in advance and seconds of precision. The possibility
of detecting IMRIs from the ground alone or combined with space-borne observatories opens new possibilities
for gravitational wave astronomy.
