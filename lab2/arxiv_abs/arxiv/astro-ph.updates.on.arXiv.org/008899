Filaments are ubiquitous structures in molecular clouds and play an important role in the mass assembly
of stars. We present results of dynamical stability analyses for filaments in the infrared dark
cloud G14.225$-$0.506, where a delayed onset of massive star formation was reported in the two hubs
at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length. Full-synthesis imaging is performed
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to map the $\mathrm{N_2H^+} \; (1-0)$
emission in two hub-filament systems with a spatial resolution of $\sim 0.034 \; \mathrm{pc}$.
Kinematics are derived from sophisticated spectral fitting algorithm that accounts for line blending,
large optical depth, and multiple velocity components. We identify five velocity coherent filaments
and derive their velocity gradients with principal component analysis. The mass accretion rates
along the filaments are up to $10^{-4} \; \mathrm{M_\odot \, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}}$ and are significant
enough to affect the hub dynamics within one free-fall time ($\sim 10^5 \; \mathrm{yr}$). The $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$
filaments are in equilibrium with virial parameter $\alpha_\mathrm{vir} \sim 1.2$. We compare
$\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$ measured in the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ filaments, $\mathrm{NH_3}$ filaments,
$870 \; \mu\mathrm{m}$ dense clumps, and $3 \; \mathrm{mm}$ dense cores. The decreasing trend in
$\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$ with decreasing spatial scales persists, suggesting an increasingly
important role of gravity at small scales. Meanwhile, $\alpha_\mathrm{vir}$ also decreases with
decreasing non-thermal motions. In combination with the absence of high-mass protostars and massive
cores, our results are consistent with the global hierarchical collapse scenario.
