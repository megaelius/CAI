Close-in giant planets represent the most significant evidence of planetary migration. If large
exomoons form around migrating giant planets which are more stable (e.g. those in the Solar System),
what happens to these moons after migration is still under intense research. This paper explores
the scenario where large regular exomoons escape after tidal-interchange of angular momentum
with its parent planet, becoming small planets by themselves. We name this hypothetical type of
object a \textit{ploonet}. By performing semi-analytical simulations of tidal interactions
between a large moon with a close-in giant, and integrating numerically their orbits for several
Myr, we found that in $\sim$50 per cent of the cases a young ploonet may survive ejection from the planetary
system, or collision with its parent planet and host star, being in principle detectable. Volatile-rich
ploonets are dramatically affected by stellar radiation during both planetocentric and siderocentric
orbital evolution, and their radius and mass change significantly due to the sublimation of most
of their material during time-scales of hundred of Myr. We estimate the photometric signatures
that ploonets may produce if they transit the star during the phase of evaporation, and compare them
with noisy lightcurves of known objects (\textit{Kronian} stars and non-periodical dips in dusty
lightcurves). Additionally, the typical transit timing variations (TTV) induced by the interaction
of a ploonet with its planet are computed. We find that present and future photometric surveys' capabilities
can detect these effects and distinguish them from those produced by other nearby planetary encounters.
