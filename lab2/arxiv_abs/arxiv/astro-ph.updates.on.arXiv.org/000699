We present a study of galaxy populations in the central region of the IRAC-selected, X-ray detected
galaxy cluster Cl J1449+0856 at z=2. Based on a sample of spectroscopic and photometric cluster
members, we investigate stellar populations and morphological structure of cluster galaxies
over an area of ~0.7Mpc^2 around the cluster core. The cluster stands out as a clear overdensity both
in redshift space, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies close to the center of the extended
X-ray emission. The cluster core region (r<200 kpc) shows a clearly enhanced passive fraction
with respect to field levels. However, together with a population of massive passive galaxies mostly
with early-type morphologies, it also hosts massive actively star-forming, often highly dust-reddened
sources. Close to the cluster center, a multi-component system of passive and star-forming galaxies
could be the future BCG still assembling. We observe a clear correlation between passive stellar
populations and an early-type morphology, in agreement with field studies at similar redshift.
Passive early-type galaxies in this clusters are typically a factor 2-3 smaller than similarly
massive early-types at z~0, but also on average larger by a factor ~2 than their field analogs at z~2,
lending support to recent claims of an accelerated structural evolution in high-redshift dense
environments. These results point towards the early formation of a population of massive galaxies,
already evolved both in their structure and stellar populations, coexisting with still-actively
forming massive galaxies in the central regions of young clusters 10 billion years ago.
