We present SCUBA-2 850-$\mu$m observations of 13 candidate starbursting protoclusters selected
using Planck and Herschel data. The cumulative number counts of the 850-$\mu$m sources in 9/13 of
these candidate protoclusters show significant overdensities compared to the field, with the
probability $<$10$^{-2}$ assuming the sources are randomly distributed in the sky. Using the 250-,
350-, 500- and 850-$\mu$m flux densities, we estimate the photometric redshifts of individual
SCUBA-2 sources by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) templates with an MCMC method. The
photometric redshift distribution, peaking at $2<z<3$, is consistent with that of known $z>2$
protoclusters and the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD). We find that the 850-$\mu$m
sources in our candidate protoclusters have infrared luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{IR}}\gtrsim$10$^{12}L_{\odot}$
and star-formation rates of SFR=(500-1,500)$M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. By comparing with results
in the literature considering only Herschel photometry, we conclude that our 13 candidate protoclusters
can be categorised into four groups: six of them being high-redshift starbursting protoclusters,
one being a lower-redshift cluster/protocluster, three being protoclusters that contain lensed
DSFG(s) or are rich in 850-$\mu$m sources, and three regions without significant Herschel or SCUBA-2
source overdensities. The total SFRs of the candidate protoclusters are found to be comparable
or higher than those of known protoclusters, suggesting our sample contains some of the most extreme
protocluster population. We infer that cross-matching Planck and Herschel data is a robust method
for selecting candidate protoclusters with overdensities of 850-$\mu$m sources.
