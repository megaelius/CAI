Context: Post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) binaries are surrounded by stable dusty and gaseous
disks similar to the ones around young stellar objects. Whereas significant effort is spent on modeling
observations of disks around young stellar objects, the disks around post-AGB binaries receive
significantly less attention, even though they pose significant constraints on theories of disk
physics and binary evolution. Aims: We want to examine the structure of and phenomena at play in circumbinary
disks around post-AGB stars. We continue the analysis of our near-infrared interferometric image
of the inner rim of the circumbinary disk around IRAS08544-4431. We want to understand the physics
governing this inner disk rim. Methods: We use a radiative transfer model of a dusty disk to reproduce
simultaneously the photometry as well as the near-infrared interferometric dataset on IRAS08544-4431.
The model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium and takes dust settling self-consistently into account.
Results: The best-fit radiative transfer model shows excellent agreement with the spectral energy
distribution up to mm wavelengths as well as with the PIONIER visibility data. It requires a rounded
inner rim structure, starting at a radius of 8.25 au. However, the model does not fully reproduce
the detected over-resolved flux nor the azimuthal flux distribution of the inner rim. While the
asymmetric inner disk rim structure is likely to be the consequence of disk-binary interactions,
the origin of the additional over-resolved flux remains unclear. Conclusions: As in young stellar
objects, the disk inner rim of IRAS08544-4431 is ruled by dust sublimation physics. Additional
observations are needed to understand the origin of the extended flux and the azimuthal perturbation
at the inner rim of the disk.
