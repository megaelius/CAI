The solar brightness varies on timescales from minutes to decades. Determining the sources of such
variations, often referred to as solar noise, is of importance for multiple reasons: a) it is the
background that limits the detection of solar oscillations, b) variability in solar brightness
is one of the drivers of the Earth's climate system, c) it is a prototype of stellar variability which
is an important limiting factor for the detection of extra-solar planets. Here we show that recent
progress in simulations and observations of the Sun makes it finally possible to pinpoint the source
of the solar noise. We utilise high-cadence observations from the Solar Dynamic Observatory and
the SATIRE model to calculate the magnetically-driven variations of solar brightness. The brightness
variations caused by the constantly evolving cellular granulation pattern on the solar surface
are computed with the MURAM code. We find that surface magnetic field and granulation can together
precisely explain solar noise on timescales from minutes to decades, i.e. ranging over more than
six orders of magnitude in the period. This accounts for all timescales that have so far been resolved
or covered by irradiance measurements. We demonstrate that no other sources of variability are
required to explain the data. Recent measurements of Sun-like stars by CoRoT and Kepler uncovered
brightness variations similar to that of the Sun but with much wider variety of patterns. Our finding
that solar brightness variations can be replicated in detail with just two well-known sources will
greatly simplify future modelling of existing CoRoT and Kepler as well as anticipated TESS and PLATO
data.
