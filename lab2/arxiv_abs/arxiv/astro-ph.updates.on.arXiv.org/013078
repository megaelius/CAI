All three components of the current density are required to compute the heating rate due to free magnetic
energy dissipation. Here we present a first test of a new model developed to determine if the times
of increases in the resistive heating rate in active region (AR) photospheres are correlated with
the subsequent occurrence of M and X flares in the corona. A data driven, 3 D, non-force-free magnetohydrodynamic
model restricted to the near-photospheric region is used to compute time series of the complete
current density and the resistive heating rate per unit volume $(Q(t))$ in each pixel in neutral
line regions (NLRs) of 14 ARs. The model is driven by time series of the magnetic field ${\bf B}$ measured
by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Spurious
Doppler periods due to SDO orbital motion are filtered out of the time series for ${\bf B}$ in every
AR pixel. For each AR, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of the NLR area integral
$Q_i(t)$ of $Q(t)$ is found to be a scale invariant power law distribution essentially identical
to the observed CDF for the total energy released in coronal flares. This suggests that coronal flares
and the photospheric $Q_i$ are correlated, and powered by the same process. The model predicts spikes
in $Q_i$ with values orders of magnitude above background values. These spikes are driven by spikes
in the non-force free component of the current density. The times of these spikes are plausibly correlated
with times of subsequent M or X flares a few hours to a few days later. The spikes occur on granulation
scales, and may be signatures of heating in horizontal current sheets. It is also found that the times
of relatively large values of the rate of change of the NLR unsigned magnetic flux are also plausibly
correlated with the times of subsequent M and X flares, and spikes in $Q_i$.
