We perform a comprehensive analysis of the redshift evolution of the rest-UV spectra of star-forming
galaxies out to z~5. We combine new z~5 measurements of HI Ly$\alpha$ and low- and high-ionization
interstellar metal absorption features with comparable measurements at z~2-4. This redshift
range covers the peak epoch of star formation in the Universe and extends back towards the epoch of
reionization. We measure the equivalent widths of interstellar absorption features using stacked
spectra in bins of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width, and perform corrections to the strength of Ly$\alpha$
based on a model for the transmission of the intergalactic medium. We find a strong trend of decreasing
low-ionization line strength with increasing Ly$\alpha$ emission strength over the redshift
range z~2-5, suggesting that both of these quantities are fundamentally linked to neutral gas covering
fraction. At the highest Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths, we see evolution with increasing redshift
towards greater Ly$\alpha$ emission strength at fixed low-ionization absorption strength. This
evolution suggests a higher intrinsic production rate of Ly$\alpha$ photons at z~5 than at lower
redshift. Our conclusion is supported by the joint evolution of the relationships among Ly$\alpha$
emission strength, interstellar absorption strength, and dust reddening. We perform additional
analysis in bins of stellar mass, star-formation rate, UV luminosity, and age, examining how the
relationships between galaxy properties and Ly$\alpha$ emission evolve towards higher redshift.
We conclude that increasing intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ photon production and strong detection of nebular
CIV emission (signaling lower metallicity) at z~5 indicate an elevated ionized photon production
efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$).
