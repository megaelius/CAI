The precipitation of cloud particles in brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres establishes an ongoing
downward flux of condensable elements. To understand the efficiency of cloud formation, it is therefore
crucial to quantify the replenishment mechanism that is able to compensate for the element losses
in the upper atmosphere, to keep the extrasolar weather cycle running. In this paper, we introduce
a new cloud formation model by combining the cloud particle moment method of Helling & Woitke with
a diffusive mixing approach, taking into account turbulent mixing and gas-kinetic diffusion for
both gas and cloud particles. The equations are of diffusion-reaction type and are solved time-dependently
for a prescribed 1D atmospheric structure, until the model has relaxed toward a time-independent
solution. In comparison to our previous models, the new hot Jupiter model results (Teff=2000K,
log g=3) show fewer but larger cloud particles which are more concentrated towards the cloud base.
The abundances of condensable elements in the gas phase are featured by a steep decline above the
cloud base, followed by a shallower, monotonous decrease towards a plateau, the level of which depends
on temperature. The chemical composition of the cloud particles also differs significantly from
our previous models. Due to the condensation of specific condensates like Mg2SiO4[s] in deeper
layers, certain elements, such as Mg, are almost entirely removed from the gas phase early. This
leads to unusual (and non-solar) element ratios in higher atmospheric layers, which then favours
the formation of SiO[s] and SiO2[s], for example, rather than MgSiO3[s]. Such condensates are not
expected in phase-equilibrium models that start from solar abundances. Above the main silicate
cloud layer, which is enriched with iron and metal oxides, we find a second cloud layer made of Na2S[s]
particles in cooler models (Teff<1500K).
