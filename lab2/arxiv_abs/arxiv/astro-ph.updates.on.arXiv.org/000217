When planetesimals begin to grow by coagulation, they enter an epoch of runaway, during which the
biggest bodies grow faster than all the others. The questions of how runaway ends and what comes next
have not been answered satisfactorily. Here we show that runaway is followed by a `trans-hill stage'
that commences once the bodies become trans-hill, i.e. once the Hill velocity of the bodies that
dominate viscous stirring matches the random speed of the small bodies they accrete. Subsequently,
the small bodies' speed grows in lockstep with the big bodies' sizes, such that the bodies remain
in the trans-hill state. Trans-hill growth is crucial for determining the efficiency of growing
big bodies, as well as their growth timescale and size spectrum. We work out the properties of trans-hill
growth analytically and confirm these numerically. Trans-hill growth has two sub-stages. In the
earlier one, collisional cooling is irrelevant, in which case the efficiency of forming big bodies
remains very low (0.1% in the Kuiper belt) and their mass spectrum is flat. This explains results
from previous coagulation simulations for both the Kuiper belt and the asteroid belt. The second
sub-stage commences when small bodies begin to collide with one another. Collisional cooling then
controls the evolution, in which case the efficiency of forming big bodies rises, and their size
spectrum becomes more top-heavy. Trans-hill growth terminates in one of two ways, depending on
parameters. First, mutual accretion of big bodies can become significant and conglomeration proceeds
until half the total mass is converted into big bodies. This mode of growth may explain the size distributions
of minor bodies in the Solar System, and is explored in forthcoming work. Second, if big bodies become
separated by their Hill radius, oligarchy commences. This mode likely precedes the formation of
fully-fledged planets.
