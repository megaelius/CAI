Protonated molecular species have been proven to be abundant in the interstellar gas. This class
of molecules is also pivotal for the determination of important physical parameters for the ISM
evolution (e.g. gas ionisation fraction) or as tracers of non-polar, hence not directly observable,
species. The identification of these molecular species through radioastronomical observations
is directly linked to a precise laboratory spectral characterisation. The goal of the present work
is to extend the laboratory measurements of the pure rotational spectrum of the ground electronic
state of protonated carbonyl sulfide (HSCO$^+$) and its deuterium substituted isotopomer (DSCO$^+$).
At the same time, we show how implementing different laboratory techniques allows the determination
of different spectroscopical properties of asymmetric-top protonated species. Three different
high-resolution experiments were involved to detected for the first time the $b-$type rotational
spectrum of HSCO$^+$, and to extend, well into the sub-millimeter region, the $a-$type spectrum
of the same molecular species and DSCO$^+$. The electronic ground-state of both ions have been investigated
in the 273-405 GHz frequency range, allowing the detection of 60 and 50 new rotational transitions
for HSCO$^+$ and DSCO$^+$, respectively. The combination of our new measurements with the three
rotational transitions previously observed in the microwave region permits the rest frequencies
of the astronomically most relevant transitions to be predicted to better than 100 kHz for both HSCO$^+$
and DSCO$^+$ up to 500 GHz, equivalent to better than 60 m/s in terms of equivalent radial velocity.
The present work illustrates the importance of using different laboratory techniques to spectroscopically
characterise a protonated species at high frequency, and how a similar approach can be adopted when
dealing with reactive species.
