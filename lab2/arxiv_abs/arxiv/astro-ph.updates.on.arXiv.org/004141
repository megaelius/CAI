Understanding the impact of active M-dwarf stars on the atmospheric equilibrium and surface conditions
of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key to assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous
modeling of the impact of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on
an Earth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in ozone were possible,
but the atmosphere recovered. These stars more realistically exhibit frequent flaring with a power-law
distribution of energies. Here we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model
to investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and surface UV of an Earth-like
planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field. We use time-resolved flare spectra obtained
for the dM3 star AD Leo, combined with flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically
10$^{30.5}$ to 10$^{34}$ erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star GJ1243. Our
model results show repeated EM-only flares have little effect on the ozone column depth, but that
multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the ozone column. Combining the realistic flare and
proton event frequencies with nominal CME & SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like
planet can be depleted by 94% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery unlikely and suggests
further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs O3 depletion allows a constant 0.1-1 W m$^{-2}$
of UV-C at the planet's surface, which is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results
suggest that active M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the surface
of magnetically-unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation that can damage complex
organic structures. However, this does not preclude habitability, as a safe haven for life could
still exist below an ocean surface.
