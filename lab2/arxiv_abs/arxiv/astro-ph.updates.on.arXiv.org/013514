We use deep adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy from SINFONI on the VLT to study
the spatially resolved properties of ionized gas outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN)
in three galaxies at z~2.2 -- K20-ID5, COS4-11337 and J0901+1814. These systems probe AGN feedback
from nuclear to circumgalactic scales, and provide unique insights into the different mechanisms
by which AGN-driven outflows interact with their host galaxies. K20-ID5 and COS4-11337 are compact
star forming galaxies with powerful $\sim$1500 km s$^{-1}$ AGN-driven outflows that dominate
their nuclear H$\alpha$ emission. The outflows do not appear to have any impact on the instantaneous
star formation activity of the host galaxies, but they carry a significant amount of kinetic energy
which could heat the halo gas and potentially lead to a reduction in the rate of cold gas accretion
onto the galaxies. The outflow from COS4-11337 is propagating directly towards its companion galaxy
COS4-11363, at a projected separation of 5.4 kpc. COS4-11363 shows signs of shock excitation and
recent truncation of star formation activity, which could plausibly have been induced by the outflow
from COS4-11337. J0901+1814 is gravitationally lensed, giving us a unique view of a compact (R =
470 $\pm$ 70 pc), relatively low velocity ($\sim$650 km s$^{-1}$) AGN-driven outflow. J0901+1814
has a similar AGN luminosity to COS4-11337, suggesting that the difference in outflow properties
is not related to the current AGN luminosity, and may instead reflect a difference in the evolutionary
stage of the outflow and/or the coupling efficiency between the AGN ionizing radiation field and
the gas in the nuclear regions.
