Over the last decade more than five thousand gamma-ray sources were detected by the Large Area Telescope
(LAT) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Given the positional uncertainty of the telescope,
nearly 30% of these sources remain without an obvious counterpart in lower energies. This motivated
the release of new catalogs of gamma-ray counterpart candidates and several follow up campaigns
in the last decade. Recently, two new catalogs of blazar candidates were released, they are the improved
and expanded version of the WISE Blazar-Like Radio-Loud Sources (WIBRaLS2) catalog and the Kernel
Density Estimation selected candidate BL Lacs (KDEBLLACS) catalog, both selecting blazar-like
sources based on their infrared colors from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). In
this work we characterized these two catalogs, clarifying the true nature of their sources based
on their optical spectra from SDSS data release 15, thus testing how efficient they are in selecting
true blazars. We first selected all WIBRaLS2 and KDEBLLACS sources with available optical spectra
in the footprint of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 15. Then we analyzed these spectra to verify
the nature of each selected candidate and see which fraction of the catalogs is composed by spectroscopically
confirmed blazars. Finally, we evaluated the impact of selection effects, specially those related
to optical colors of WIBRaLS2/KDEBLLACS sources and their optical magnitude distributions. We
found that at least ~ 30% of each catalog is composed by confirmed blazars, with quasars being the
major contaminants in the case of WIBRaLS2 (~ 58%) and normal galaxies in the case of KDEBLLACS (~
38.2%). The spectral analysis also allowed us to identify the nature of 11 blazar candidates of uncertain
type (BCUs) from the Fermi-LAT 4th Point Source Catalog (4FGL) and to find 25 new BL Lac objects.
