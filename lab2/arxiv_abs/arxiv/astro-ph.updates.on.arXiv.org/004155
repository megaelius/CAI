We present results from MUSE observations of the nearly face-on disk galaxy NGC 7742. This galaxy
hosts a spectacular nuclear ring of enhanced star formation, which is unusual in that it is hosted
by a non-barred galaxy, and also because this star formation is most likely fuelled by externally
accreted gas that counter-rotates with respect to its main stellar body. We use the MUSE data to derive
the star-formation history (SFH) and accurately measure the stellar and ionized-gas kinematics
of NGC7742 in its nuclear, bulge, ring, and disk regions. We map the previously known gas counter-rotation
well outside the ring region and deduce the presence of a slightly warped inner disk, which is inclined
~6 degrees compared to the outer disk. The gas-disk inclination is well constrained from the kinematics;
the derived inclination 13.7 $\pm$ 0.4 degrees agrees well with that derived from photometry and
from what one expects using the inverse Tully-Fisher relation. We find a prolonged SFH in the ring
with stellar populations as old as 2-3 Gyr and an indication that the star formation triggered by
the minor merger event was delayed in the disk compared to the ring. There are two separate stellar
components: an old population that counter-rotates with the gas, and a young one, concentrated
to the ring, that co-rotates with the gas. We recover the kinematics of the old stars from a two-component
fit, and show that combining the old and young stellar populations results in the erroneous average
velocity of nearly zero found from a one-component fit. The superior spatial resolution and large
field of view of MUSE allow us to establish the kinematics and SFH of the nuclear ring in NGC 7742. We
show further evidence that this ring has its origin in a minor merger event, possibly 2-3 Gyr ago.
