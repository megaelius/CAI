Context: Transmission spectroscopy has become a prominent tool for characterizing the atmospheric
properties on close-in transiting planets. Recent observations have revealed a remarkable diversity
in exoplanet spectra, which show absorption signatures of Na, K and $\mathrm{H_2O}$, in some cases
partially or fully attenuated by atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols (clouds and hazes) themselves
have been detected in the transmission spectra of several planets thanks to wavelength-dependent
slopes caused by the particles' scattering properties. Aims: We present an optical 550 - 960 nm transmission
spectrum of the extremely irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-103b, one of the hottest (2500 K) and most
massive (1.5 $M_J$) planets yet to be studied with this technique. WASP-103b orbits its star at a
separation of less than 1.2 times the Roche limit and is predicted to be strongly tidally distorted.
Methods: We have used Gemini/GMOS to obtain multi-object spectroscopy hroughout three transits
of WASP-103b. We used relative spectrophotometry and bin sizes between 20 and 2 nm to infer the planet's
transmission spectrum. Results: We find that WASP-103b shows increased absorption in the cores
of the alkali (Na, K) line features. We do not confirm the presence of any strong scattering slope
as previously suggested, pointing towards a clear atmosphere for the highly irradiated, massive
exoplanet WASP-103b. We constrain the upper boundary of any potential cloud deck to reside at pressure
levels above 0.01 bar. This finding is in line with previous studies on cloud occurrence on exoplanets
which find that clouds dominate the transmission spectra of cool, low surface gravity planets while
hot, high surface gravity planets are either cloud-free, or possess clouds located below the altitudes
probed by transmission spectra.
