We have conducted the first systematic search for interday variability in a large sample of extragalactic
radio sources at 15 GHz. From the sample of 1158 radio-selected blazars monitored over a $\sim$10
year span by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40-m telescope, we identified 20 sources exhibiting
significant flux density variations on 4-day timescales. The sky distribution of the variable
sources is strongly dependent on the line-of-sight Galactic H$\alpha$ intensities from the Wisconsin
H$\alpha$ Mapper Survey, demonstrating the contribution of interstellar scintillation (ISS)
to their interday variability. 21% of sources observed through sight-lines with H$\alpha$ intensities
larger than 10 rayleighs exhibit significant ISS persistent over the $\sim$10 year period. The
fraction of scintillators is potentially larger when considering less significant variables
missed by our selection criteria, due to ISS intermittency. This study demonstrates that ISS is
still important at 15 GHz, particularly through strongly scattered sight-lines of the Galaxy.
Of the 20 most significant variables, 11 are observed through the Orion-Eridanus superbubble,
photoionized by hot stars of the Orion OB1 association. The high-energy neutrino source TXS0506$+$056
is observed through this region, so ISS must be considered in any interpretation of its short-term
radio variability. J0616$-$1041 appears to exhibit large $\sim$20% interday flux density variations,
comparable in magnitude to that of the very rare class of extreme, intrahour scintillators that
includes PKS0405$-$385, J1819$+$3845 and PKS1257$-$326; this needs to be confirmed by higher
cadence follow-up observations.
