A dark matter halo is commonly defined as a spherical overdensity of matter with respect to a reference
density, such as the critical density or the mean matter density of the Universe. Such definitions
can lead to a spurious pseudo-evolution of halo mass simply due to redshift evolution of the reference
density, even if its physical density profile remains constant over time. We estimate the amount
of such pseudo-evolution of mass between z=1 to 0 for halos identified in a large N-body simulation,
and show that it accounts for almost the entire mass evolution of the majority of halos with M200 of
about 1E12 solar masses and can be a significant fraction of the apparent mass growth even for cluster-sized
halos. We estimate the magnitude of the pseudo-evolution assuming that halo density profiles remain
static in physical coordinates, and show that this simple model predicts the pseudo-evolution
of halos identified in numerical simulations to good accuracy, albeit with significant scatter.
We discuss the impact of pseudo-evolution on the evolution of the halo mass function and show that
the non-evolution of the low-mass end of the halo mass function is the result of a fortuitous cancellation
between pseudo-evolution and the absorption of small halos into larger hosts. We also show that
the evolution of the low mass end of the concentration-mass relation observed in simulations is
almost entirely due to the pseudo-evolution of mass. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results for the interpretation of the evolution of various scaling relations between the observable
properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters and their halo masses.
