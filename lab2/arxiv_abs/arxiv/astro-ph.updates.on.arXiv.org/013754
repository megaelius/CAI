We address the 'plane of satellites problem' by studying planar configurations around two disc
galaxies with no late major mergers, formed in zoom-in hydro-simulations. Due to the current lack
of good quality kinematic data for M31 satellites, we use only positional information. So far, positional
analyses of simulations are unable to find planes as thin and populated as the observed ones. Moreover,
they miss systematicity and detail in the plane-searching techniques, as well as in the study of
the properties and quality of planes, both in simulations or real data. To fill this gap, i) we extend
the 4-galaxy-normal density plot method (Pawlowski et al. 2013) in a way designed to efficiently
identify the best quality planes (i.e., thin and populated) without imposing extra constraints
on their properties, and ii), we apply it for the first time to simulations. Using zoom-in simulations
allows us to mimic MW/M31-like systems regarding the number of satellites involved as well as the
galactic disc mass and morphology, in view of possible disc effects. At all timesteps analyzed in
both simulations we find satellite planar configurations that are compatible, along given time
intervals, with all the spatial characteristics of observed planes identified using the same methodology.
However, the fraction of co-orbiting satellites within them is in general low, suggesting time-varying
satellite membership. We conclude that high-quality positional planes of satellites are not infrequent
in LCDM-formed disc galaxies with a quiet assembly history. Detecting kinematically-coherent,
time-persistent planes demands considering the full six-dimensional phase-space information
of satellites.
