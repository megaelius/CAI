We present cluster counts and corresponding cosmological constraints from the Planck full mission
data set. Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal
down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 Planck cluster
cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints
under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis
to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from
two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide
priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $(1-b)$. In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck clusters as an independent constraint on
this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of
matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the Planck analysis of primary
fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of $(1-b)$ the tension is mild, only a little
over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial ($3.7\,\sigma$) for the largest estimated
value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat $\Lambda$CDM model by combining
the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,
but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers
the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current
astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current
10%-level to 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent
test of the base $\Lambda$CDM model.
