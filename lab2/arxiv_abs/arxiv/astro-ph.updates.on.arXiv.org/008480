There is growing evidence that the Galactic Center Excess identified in the $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT
gamma-ray data arises from a population of faint astrophysical sources. We provide compelling
supporting evidence by showing that the morphology of the excess traces the stellar over-density
of the Galactic bulge. By adopting a template of the bulge stars obtained from a triaxial 3D fit to
the diffuse near-infrared emission, we show that it is detected at high significance. The significance
deteriorates when either the position or the orientation of the template is artificially shifted,
supporting the correlation of the gamma-ray data with the Galactic bulge. In deriving these results,
we have used more sophisticated templates at low-latitudes for the $\textit{Fermi}$ bubbles compared
to previous work and the three-dimensional Inverse Compton (IC) maps recently released by the ${\tt
GALPROP}$ team. Our results provide strong constraints on Millisecond Pulsar (MSP) formation
scenarios proposed to explain the excess. We find that an $\textit{admixture formation}$ scenario,
in which some of the relevant binaries are $\textit{primordial}$ and the rest are formed $\textit{dynamically}$,
is preferred over a primordial-only formation scenario at $7.6\sigma$ confidence level. Our detailed
morphological analysis also disfavors models of the disrupted globular clusters scenario that
predict a spherically symmetric distribution of MSPs in the Galactic bulge. For the first time,
we report evidence of a high energy tail in the nuclear bulge spectrum that could be the result of IC
emission from electrons and positrons injected by a population of MSPs and star formation activity
from the same site.
