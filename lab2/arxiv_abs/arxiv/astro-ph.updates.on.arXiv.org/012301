The dynamical structure of the Solar System can be explained by a period of orbital instability experienced
by the giant planets. While a late instability was originally proposed to explain the Late Heavy
Bombardment, recent work favors an early instability. We model the early dynamical evolution of
the outer Solar System to self-consistently constrain the most likely timing of the instability.
We first simulate the dynamical sculpting of the primordial outer planetesimal disk during the
accretion of Uranus and Neptune from migrating planetary embryos during the gas disk phase, and
determine the separation between Neptune and the inner edge of the planetesimal disk. We performed
simulations with a range of migration histories for Jupiter. We find that, unless Jupiter migrated
inwards by 10 AU or more, the instability almost certainly happened within 100 Myr of the start of
Solar System formation. There are two distinct possible instability triggers. The first is an instability
that is triggered by the planets themselves, with no appreciable influence from the planetesimal
disk. Of those, the median instability time is $\sim4$Myr. Among self-stable systems -- where the
planets are locked in a resonant chain that remains stable in the absence of a planetesimal's disk--
our self-consistently sculpted planetesimal disks nonetheless trigger a giant planet instability
with a median instability time of 37-62 Myr for a reasonable range of migration histories of Jupiter.
The simulations that give the latest instability times are those that invoked long-range inward
migration of Jupiter from 15 AU or beyond; however these simulations over-excited the inclinations
of Kuiper belt objects and are inconsistent with the present-day Solar System. We conclude on dynamical
grounds that the giant planet instability is likely to have occurred early in Solar System history.
