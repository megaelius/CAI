388 hot subdwarf stars have been identified by using the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram built
from the second data release (DR2) of the Gaia mission. By analyzing their observed LAMOST spectra,
we characterized 186 sdB, 73 He-sdOB, 65 sdOB, 45 sdO, 12 He-sdO and 7 He-sdB stars. The atmospheric
parameters of these stars (e.g., T eff , log g, log(nHe/nH)) are obtained by fitting the hydrogen
(H) and helium (He) line profiles with synthetic spectra calculated from non-Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium (non-LTE) model atmospheres. Among these stars, we have 135 new identified hot subdwarfs
which have not been cataloged before. Although 253 stars appear in the catalog by Geier et al. (2017)
, but only 91 of them have atmospheric parameters. Together with the 294 hot subdwarf stars found
by Lei et al. (2018), we identified 682 hot subdwarf stars in total by using the Gaia HR-diagram and
LAMOST spectra. These results demonstrate the efficiency of our method to combine large surveys
to search for hot subdwarf stars. We found a distinct gap in our He-sdOB stars based on their He abundance,
which is also presented in extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars of the globular cluster (GC) {\omega}
Cen. The number fraction of the sample size for the two sub-groups is very different between the two
counterparts. However, the distinct gap between the H-sdB stars and He-sdOB stars in {\omega} Cen
is not visible in our sample. More interestingly, the He-sdB population with the highest He abundance
in our sample is completely missing in {\omega} Cen. The discrepancy between our field hot subdwarf
stars and the EHB stas in {\omega} Cen indicate different origins for the two counterparts.
