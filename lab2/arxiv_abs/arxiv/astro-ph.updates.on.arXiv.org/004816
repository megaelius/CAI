ATLAS (Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy) Probe is a concept for a NASA probe-class
space mission, the spectroscopic follow-up to WFIRST, multiplexing its scientific return by obtaining
deep 1 to 4 micron slit spectroscopy for ~90% of all galaxies imaged by the ~2200 sq deg WFIRST High
Latitude Survey at z > 0.5. ATLAS spectroscopy will measure accurate and precise redshifts for ~300M
galaxies out to z < 7, and deliver spectra that enable a wide range of diagnostic studies of the physical
properties of galaxies over most of cosmic history. ATLAS and WFIRST together will produce a 3D map
of the Universe with ~Mpc resolution in redshift space. ATLAS will: (1) Revolutionize galaxy evolution
studies by tracing the relation between galaxies and dark matter from galaxy groups to cosmic voids
and filaments, from the epoch of reionization through the peak era of galaxy assembly; (2) Open a
new window into the dark Universe by weighing the dark matter filaments using 3D weak lensing with
spectroscopic redshifts, and obtaining definitive measurements of dark energy and modification
of General Relativity using galaxy clustering; (3) Probe the Milky Way's dust-enshrouded regions,
reaching the far side of our Galaxy; and (4) Explore the formation history of the outer Solar System
by characterizing Kuiper Belt Objects. ATLAS is a 1.5m telescope with a field of view (FoV) of 0.4
sq deg, and uses Digital Micro-mirror Devices (DMDs) as slit selectors. It has a spectroscopic resolution
of R = 600, a wavelength range of 1-4 microns, and a spectroscopic multiplex factor ~5,000-10,000.
ATLAS is designed to fit within the NASA probe-class mission cost envelope; it has a single instrument,
a telescope aperture that allows for a lighter launch vehicle, and mature technology (DMDs can reach
TRL 6 within 2 years). ATLAS will lead to transformative science over the entire range of astrophysics.
