Context: XB 1916-053 is a low mass X-ray binary system (LMXB) hosting a neutron star (NS) and showing
periodic dips. The spectrum of the persistent emission was modeled with a blackbody component having
a temperature between 1.31 and 1.67 keV and with a Comptonization component with an electron temperature
of 9.4 keV and a photon index $\Gamma$ between 2.5 and 2.9. The presence of absorption features associated
with highly ionized elements suggested the presence of partially ionized plasma in the system.
Aims: In this work we performed a study of the spectrum of XB 1916-053, which aims to shed light on the
nature of the seed photons that contribute to the Comptonization component. Methods: We analyzed
three Suzaku observations of XB 1916-053: the first was performed in November 2006 and the others
were carried out in October 2014. We extracted the persistent spectra from each observation and
combined the spectra of the most recent observations, obtaining a single spectrum with a higher
statistic. We also extracted and combined the spectra of the dips observed during the same observations.
Results: On the basis of the available data statistics, we infer that the scenario in which the corona
Comptonizes photons emitted both by the innermost region of the accretion disk and the NS surface
is not statistically relevant with respect to the case in which only photons emitted by the NS surface
are Comptonized. We find that the source is in a soft spectral state in all the analyzed observations.
We detect the K$\alpha$ absorption lines of \ion{Fe}{xxv} and \ion{Fe}{xxvi}, which have already
been reported in literature, and for the first time the K$\beta$ absorption lines of the same ions.
We also detect an edge at 0.876 keV, which is consistent with a \ion{O}{viii} K absorption edge. (Abridged)
