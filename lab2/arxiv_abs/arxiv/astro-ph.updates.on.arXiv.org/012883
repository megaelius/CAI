We present multi-band photometry covering $\sim$ 5\deg $\times$ 5\deg across $\omega$ Cen collected
with the Dark Energy Camera, combined to Hubble Space Telescope and Wide Field Imager data for the
central regions. The unprecedented photometric accuracy and field coverage allowed us to confirm
the different spatial distribution of blue and red main-sequence stars, and of red-giant branch
(RGB) stars with different metallicities. The ratio of the number of blue to red main-sequence stars
shows that the blue main-sequence sub-population has a more extended spatial distribution compared
to the red main-sequence one, and the frequency of blue main-sequence stars increases at a distance
of $\sim$ 20 arcmin from $\omega$ Cen center. Similarly, the more metal-rich RGB stars show a more
extended spatial distribution compared to the more metal-poor ones in the outskirts of the cluster.
Moreover, the centers of the distributions of metal-rich and metal-poor RGB stars are shifted in
different directions with respect to the geometrical center of $\omega$ Cen. We constructed stellar
density profiles for the blue and red main-sequence stars; they confirm that the blue main-sequence
sub-population has a more extended spatial distribution compared to the red main-sequence one
in the outskirts of $\omega$ Cen, as found based on the star number ratio. We also computed the ellipticity
profile of $\omega$ Cen, which has a maximum value of 0.16 at a distance of $\sim$ 8 arcmin from the
center, and a minimum of 0.05 at $\sim$ 30 arcmin; the average ellipticity is $\sim0.10$. The circumstantial
evidence presented in this work suggests a merging scenario for the formation of the peculiar stellar
system $\omega$ Cen.
