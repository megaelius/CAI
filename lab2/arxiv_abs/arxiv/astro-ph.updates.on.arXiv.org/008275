We present results of a global survey of single-pixel intensity power spectra from a 12-hour time
period on 26 June 2013 in a 1600x1600 pixel region from four channels of the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. We extract single-pixel time series from
a derotated image sequence, fit models to the power spectra of these time series, and study the spatial
dependence of the model parameters. Two power spectra models are considered: i) a three-parameter
power-law + tail model and ii) a power-law + tail model + three-parameter localized Lorentzian,
the latter to model periodicity. Spectra are well-described by at least one of these models for all
pixel locations, with the spatial distribution of best-fit model parameters shown to provide new
and unique insights into turbulent, quiescent and periodic features in the EUV corona and upper
photosphere. Findings include: individual model parameters correspond clearly and directly
to visible solar features; detection of numerous quasi-periodic three- and five-minute oscillations;
observational identification of concentrated magnetic flux as regions of largest power-law indices
[n]; identification of unique spectral features of coronal holes and filaments; identification
of sporadic and pervasive five-minute oscillations throughout the corona; detection of the known
global ~4.0-minute chromospheric oscillation; "coronal bullseyes" appearing as radially decaying
periodicities over sunspots and sporadic foot-point regions; and "penumbral periodic voids"
appearing as broad rings around sunspots in 1600 and 1700 {\AA} in which spectra contain no statistically
significant periodic component.
