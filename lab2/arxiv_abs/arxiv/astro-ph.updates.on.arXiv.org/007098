Westerlund 2 (Wd2) is the central ionizing star cluster of the \ion{H}{2} region RCW~49 and the second
most massive young star cluster (${\rm M} = (3.6 \pm 0.3)\times 10^4\,{\rm M}_\odot$) in the Milky
Way. Its young age ($\sim2\,$Myr) and close proximity to the Sun ($\sim 4\,$kpc) makes it a perfect
target to study stars emerging from their parental gas cloud, the large number of OB-stars and their
feedback onto the gas, and the gas dynamics. We combine high-resolution multi-band photometry
obtained in the optical and near-infrared with the \textit{Hubble} Space Telescope (HST), and
VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy to study the gas, the stars, and their interactions, simultaneously.
In this paper we focus on a small, $64\times64\,{\rm arcsec}^2$ region North of the main cluster
center, which we call the Northern Bubble (NB), a circular cavity carved into the gas of the cluster
region. Using MUSE data, we determined the spectral types of 17 stars in the NB from G9III to O7.5.
With the estimation of these spectral types we add 2 O and 5 B-type stars to the previously published
census of 37 OB-stars in Wd2. To measure radial velocities we extracted 72 stellar spectra throughout
Wd2, including the 17 of the NB, and show that the cluster member stars follow a bimodal velocity distribution
centered around $(8.10 \pm 1.53)\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $(25.41 \pm 1.57)\,{\rm km}\,{\rm
s}^{-1}$ with a dispersion of $(4.52 \pm 1.78)\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $(3.46 \pm 1.29)\,{\rm
km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, respectively. These are in agreement with CO($J=1$-2) studies of RCW~49 leaving
cloud-cloud collision as a viable option for the formation scenario of Wd2. The bimodal distribution
is also detected in the Gaia DR2 proper motions.
