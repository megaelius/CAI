Misalignments between the orbital planes of planets and the equatorial planes of their host stars
have been observed in our solar system, in transiting exoplanets, and in the orbital planes of debris
discs. We present a mechanism that causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc
due to its movement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism is based
on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea by performing self-consistent
hydrodynamical simulations and simplified gravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body
model reduces the mechanism to the relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations
show the mechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in the disc
which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a protoplanetary disc embedded
in a flow changes its orientation as its angular momentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative
velocity vector. Due to the force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which
produces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The tilting of the disc
causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the gaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even
if the inclination does not change substantially. The process is most effective at high velocities
and observational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming regions and
around winds or supernova ejecta. Our $N$-body model indicates that the interaction with supernova
ejecta is a viable explanation for the observed spin-orbit misalignment in our solar system.
