Galaxy filaments are the dominant feature in the overall structure of the cosmic web. The study of
the filamentary web is an important aspect in understanding galaxy evolution and the evolution
of matter in the Universe. A map of the filamentary structure is an adequate probe of the web. We propose
that photometric redshift galaxies are significantly positively associated with the filamentary
structure detected from the spatial distribution of spectroscopic redshift galaxies. The catalogues
of spectroscopic and photometric galaxies are seen as point-process realisations in a sphere,
and the catalogue of filamentary spines is proposed to be a realisation of a random set in a sphere.
The positive association between these sets was studied using a bivariate $J-$function, which
is a summary statistics studying clustering. A quotient $D$ was built to estimate the distance distribution
of the filamentary spine to galaxies in comparison to the distance distribution of the filamentary
spine to random points in $3-$dimensional Euclidean space. This measure gives a physical distance
scale to the distances between filamentary spines and the studied sets of galaxies. The bivariate
$J-$function shows a statistically significant clustering effect in between filamentary spines
and photometric redshift galaxies. The quotient $D$ confirms the previous result that smaller
distances exist with higher probability between the photometric galaxies and filaments. The trend
of smaller distances between the objects grows stronger at higher redshift. Additionally, the
quotient $D$ for photometric galaxies gives a rough estimate for the filamentary spine width of
about $1$~Mpc. Photometric redshift galaxies are positively associated with filamentary spines
detected from the spatial distribution of spectroscopic galaxies.
