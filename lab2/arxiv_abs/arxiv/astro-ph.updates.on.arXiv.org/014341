Context. Coronal loops are the basic building blocks of the solar corona, which are related to the
mass supply and heating of solar plasmas in the corona. However, their fundamental magnetic structures
are still not well understood. Most coronal loops do not expand significantly, whereas the diverging
magnetic field would have an expansion factor of about 5-10 over one pressure scale height. Aims.
In this study, we investigate a unique coronal loop with a roughly constant cross section, it is ultra
long and quite thin. A coronal loop model with magnetic helicity is presented to explain the small
expansion of the loop width. Methods. This coronal loop was predominantly detectable in the 171
A channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). Then, the local magnetic field line was extrapolated
by a Potential-Field-Source-Surface model. Finally, the differential emission measure analysis
made from six AIA bandpasses was applied to obtain the thermal properties of this loop. Results.
This coronal loop has a projected length of roughly 130 Mm, a width of about 1.5 +(-) 0.5 Mm and a lifetime
of around 90 minutes. It follows an open magnetic field line. The cross section expanded very little
(i.e., 1.5-2.0) along the loop length during its whole lifetime. This loop has a nearly constant
temperature at about 0.7 +(-) 0.2 MK, whereas its density exhibits the typical structure of a stratified
atmosphere. Conclusions. We use a thin twisted flux tube theory to construct a model for this non-expanding
loop, and find that indeed with sufficient twist a coronal loop can attain equilibrium. However,
we can not rule out other possibilities such as footpoint heating by small-scale reconnection,
elevated scale height by a steady flow along the loop etc.
