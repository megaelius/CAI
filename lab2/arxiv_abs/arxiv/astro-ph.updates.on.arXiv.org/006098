The episodic dynamics of the magnetic eruption of a spinning black hole (BH) accretion disks and
its associated intense shapeup of their jets is studied via three-dimensional general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). The embedded magnetic fields in the disk get amplified by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) so large as to cause an eruption of magnetic field (recconection) and large chunks
of matter episodically accrete toward the roots of the jets upon such an event. We also find that the
eruption events produce intensive Alfv\'en pulses, which propagate through the jets. After the
eruption, the disk backs to the weakly magnetic states. Such disk activities cause short time variabilities
in mass accretion rate at the event horizon as well as electromagnetic luminosity inside the jet.
Since the dimensionless strength parameter $a_0=eE/m_e \omega c$ of these Alfv\'en wave pulses
is extremely high for a substantial fraction of Eddington accretion rate accretion flow onto a supermassive
black hole, the Alfv\'en shocks turn into ultrarelativistic $(a_0\gg 1)$ bow wake acceleration,
manifesting into the ultra-high energy cosmic rays and electrons which finally emit gamma-rays.
Since our GRMHD model has universality in its spatial and temporal scales, it is applicable to a wide
range of astrophysical objects ranging from those of AGN (which is the primary target of this research),
to micro-quasars. Properties such as time variabilities of blazar gamma-ray flares and spectrum
observed by {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Observatory are well explained by linear acceleration of electrons
by the bow wake.
