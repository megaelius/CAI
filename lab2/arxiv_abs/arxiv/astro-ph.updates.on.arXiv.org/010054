The magnetic field in the Galactic Center (GC) is challenging to measure in detail due to its large
distance in combination with a difficult foreground estimate. More precise knowledge is, however,
required in particular in the context of proper modeling of Cosmic Ray (CR) transport. A detailed
model of the magnetic field in the GC region, therefore, is not only required in order to understand
the origin of CRs but also for appropriate modeling of electron transport with the resulted synchrotron
spectra, as well as background estimates for dark matter searches in this region. For this kind of
modeling, the gas distribution is equally important, as the production of high-energy gamma-ray
via hadronic interaction depends on it. In this work, we are putting together and interpreting available
data from the Galactic Center region in order to model both the gas distribution and the magnetic
field configuration. We derive the configuration and strength of the total magnetic field in the
GC via a combination of an analytical and divergence-free model for the diffuse inter-cloud medium
and information from local molecular clouds and non-thermal filaments which are based on investigations
from previous works and the molecular gas density. We present a comprehensive model of the magnetic
field in the central 200 pc of the Galaxy. It can be shown that the model is compatible with recent polarization
data. In first test simulations of cosmic-ray transport, we can show that using this more detailed
magnetic field configuration in comparison to large-scale magnetic field configurations that
discard the direct information from the GC has a significant impact on the propagation profiles
of cosmic-rays.
