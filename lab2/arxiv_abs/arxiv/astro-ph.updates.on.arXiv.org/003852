Active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence the formation and evolution of galaxies and their environments.
Since the large scale environment can also affect AGN, this work studies how their formation and
properties depend on the environment. We use a reconstructed three-dimensional high-resolution
density field obtained from a Bayesian large-scale structure reconstruction method applied to
the 2M++ galaxy sample. A web-type classification relying on the shear tensor is used to identify
different structures on the cosmic web, defining voids, sheets, filaments, and clusters. We confirm
that the environmental density affects the AGN formation and their properties. We found that the
AGN clustering is equivalent to the galaxy clustering, indicating that active and non-active galaxies
reside in similar dark matter halos. However, the clustering and the occurrence rate are different
for each spectral type and accretion rate. These differences are consistent with the AGN evolutionary
sequence suggested by previous authors, Seyferts and Transition objects transforming into LINERs
(Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission Line Regions), the weaker counterpart of Seyferts. AGN properties
show correlations with the environmental density that can be explained by mergers and interactions
at high densities. More powerful starbursts and younger stellar populations are found in high densities,
where interactions and mergers are more likely. AGN hosts show smaller masses in clusters for Seyferts
and Transition objects, which might be due to gas stripping. In voids, the AGN population is dominated
by the most massive galaxy hosts.
