Dome C in Antarctica is a promising site for photometric observations thanks to the continuous night
during the Antarctic winter and favorable weather conditions. We developed instruments to assess
the quality of this site for photometry in the visible and to detect and characterize variable objects
through the Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) project. Here, we present the full
analysis of four winters of data collected with ASTEP South, a 10 cm refractor pointing continuously
toward the celestial south pole. We achieved nearly continuous observations over the winters.
We improved the instrument over the years and developed specific data reduction methods. We measure
an average sky background of 20 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the 579-642 nm bandpass. We built the lightcurves
of 6000 stars and developed a model to infer the photometric quality of Dome C from the lightcurves
themselves. The weather is photometric $67.1\pm4.2$ % of the time and veiled $21.8\pm2.0$ % of the
time. The remaining time corresponds to poor quality data or winter storms. We analyzed the lightcurves
of $\sigma$ Oct and HD 184465 and find that the amplitude of their main frequency varies by a factor
of 3.5 and 6.7 over the four years, respectively. We also identify 34 new variable stars and eight
new eclipsing binaries with periods ranging from 0.17 to 81 days. The phase coverage that we achieved
with ASTEP South is exceptional for a ground-based instrument and the data quality enables the detection
and study of variable objects. These results demonstrate the high quality of Dome C for photometry
in the visible and for time series observations in general.
