Migration of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets, which was divided
into seven regions depending on the distance to the Sun, was simulated. The influence of gravity
of all planets was taken into account. In some cases, the embryos of the terrestrial planets rather
than the planets themselves were considered; their masses were assumed to be 0.1 or 0.3 of the current
masses of the planets. The arrays of orbital elements of migrated planetesimals were used to calculate
the probabilities of their collisions with the planets, the Moon, or their embryos. Based on our
calculations, we drew conclusions on the process of accumulation of the terrestrial planets. The
embryos of the terrestrial planets, the masses of which did not exceed a tenth of the current planetary
masses, accumulated planetesimals mainly from the vicinity of their orbits. When planetesimals
fell onto the embryos of the terrestrial planets from the feeding zone of Jupiter and Saturn, these
embryos had not yet acquired the current masses of the planets, and the material of this zone (including
water and volatiles) could be accumulated in the inner layers of the terrestrial planets. The inner
layers of each of the terrestrial planets were mainly formed from the material located in the vicinity
of the orbit of a certain planet. The outer layers of the Earth and Venus could accumulate the same
material for these two planets from different parts of the feeding zone of the terrestrial planets.
The Earth and Venus could acquire more than half of their masses in 5 Myr. A relatively rapid growth
of the bulk of the Martian mass can be explained by the formation of Mars' embryo (the mass of which
is several times less than that of Mars) due to contraction of a rarefied condensation.
