Several fast radio bursts have been discovered recently, showing a bright, highly dispersed millisecond
radio pulse. The high dispersion suggests sources at cosmological distances, implying an extremely
high radio luminosity. We propose that a fast radio burst represents the final signal of a supramassive
rotating neutron star that collapses to a black hole due to magnetic braking. The neutron star is
initially above the critical mass for non-rotating models and is supported by rapid rotation. As
magnetic braking constantly reduces the spin, the neutron star will suddenly collapse to a black
hole several thousand to million years after its birth. We discuss several formation scenarios
for supramassive neutron stars and estimate the possible observational signatures making use
of the results of recent numerical general-relativistic calculations. While the collapse will
hide the stellar surface behind an event horizon, the magnetic-field lines will snap violently.
This can turn an almost ordinary pulsar into a bright radio "blitzar": Accelerated electrons from
the travelling magnetic shock dissipate a significant fraction of the magnetosphere and produce
a massive radio burst that is observable out to z>0.7. Only a few percent of the neutron stars needs
to be supramassive in order to explain the observed rate. We suggest the intriguing possibility
that fast radio bursts might trace the solitary and almost silent formation of stellar mass black
holes at high redshifts. These bursts {could be an electromagnetic complement to gravitational-wave
emission} and reveal a new formation and evolutionary channel for black holes and neutron stars
that are not seen as gamma-ray bursts. If supramassive neutron stars are formed at birth and not by
accretion, radio observations of these bursts could trace the core-collapse supernova rate throughout
the universe.
