The Be X-ray binary EXO 2030+375 was in an extended low luminosity state during most of 2016. We observed
this state with NuSTAR and Swift, supported by INTEGRAL observations as well as optical spectroscopy
with the NOT. We present a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of these data here to study
the accretion geometry and investigate a possible onset of the propeller effect. The H-alpha data
show that the circumstellar disk of the Be-star is still present. We measure equivalent widths similar
to values found during more active phases in the past, indicating that the low-luminosity state
is not simply triggered by a smaller Be disk. The NuSTAR data, taken at a 3-78 keV luminosity of ~6.8e35
erg/s (for a distance of 7.1 kpc), are well described by standard accreting pulsar models, such as
an absorbed power-law with a high-energy cutoff. We find that pulsations are still clearly visible
at these luminosities, indicating that accretion is continuing despite the very low mass transfer
rate. In phase-resolved spectroscopy we find a peculiar variation of the photon index from ~1.5
to ~2.5 over only about 3% of the rotational period. This variation is similar to that observed with
XMM-Newton at much higher luminosities. It may be connected to the accretion column passing through
our line of sight. With Swift/XRT we observe luminosities as low as 1e34 erg/s during which the data
quality did not allow us to search for pulsations, but the spectrum is much softer and well described
by either a blackbody or soft power-law continuum. This softer spectrum might be due to the fact that
accretion has been stopped by the propeller effect and we only observe the neutron star surface cooling.
