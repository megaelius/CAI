Simulated exoplanet transmission spectra are critical for planning and interpretation of observations
and to explore the sensitivity of spectral features to atmospheric thermochemical processes.
We present a publicly available generic model grid of planetary transmission spectra, scalable
to a wide range of H$_2$/He dominated atmospheres. The grid is computed using the 1D/2D atmosphere
model ATMO for two different chemical scenarios, first considering local condensation only, secondly
considering global condensation and removal of species from the atmospheric column (rainout).
The entire grid consists of 56,320 model simulations across 22 equilibrium temperatures (400 -
2600 K), four planetary gravities (5 - 50 ms$^{-2}$), five atmospheric metallicities (1x - 200x),
four C/O ratios (0.35 - 1.0), four scattering haze parameters, four uniform cloud parameters, and
two chemical scenarios. We derive scaling equations which can be used with this grid, for a wide range
of planet-star combinations. We validate this grid by comparing it with other model transmission
spectra available in the literature. We highlight some of the important findings, such as the rise
of SO$_2$ features at 100x solar metallicity, differences in spectral features at high C/O ratios
between two condensation approaches, the importance of VO features without TiO to constrain the
limb temperature and features of TiO/VO both, to constrain the condensation processes. Finally,
this generic grid can be used to plan future observations using the HST, VLT, JWST and various other
telescopes. The fine variation of parameters in the grid also allows it to be incorporated in a retrieval
framework, with various machine learning techniques.
