Observations suggest that some massive stars experience violent and eruptive mass loss associated
with significant brightening that can not be explained by hydrostatic stellar models. This event
seemingly forms dense circumstellar matter (CSM). The mechanism of eruptive mass loss has not been
clarified. We focus on the fact that the timescale of nuclear burning gets shorter than the dynamical
timescale of the envelope a few years before core collapse for some massive stars. To reveal the properties
of the eruptive mass loss, we investigate its relation to the energy injection at the bottom of the
envelope supplied by nuclear burning taking place inside the core. In this study, we do not specify
the actual mechanism to transport energy from the site of nuclear burning to the bottom of the envelope.
Instead, we parameterize the amount of injected energy and the injection time and try to extract
information on these parameters from comparisons with observations. To this end, we carried out
1-D radiation hydrodynamical simulations for progenitors of red, yellow, and blue supergiants,
and Wolf-Rayet stars. We calculated the evolution of the progenitors with a public stellar evolution
code. We obtained the light curve associated with the eruption, the amount of ejected mass, and the
CSM distribution at the time of core-collapse. The energy injection at the bottom of the envelope
of a massive star within a period shorter than the dynamical timescale of the envelope could reproduce
some observed optical outbursts prior to the core-collapse and form the CSM, which can power an interaction
SN classified as type IIn.
