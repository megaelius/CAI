We study a sample of 28 S0 galaxies extracted from the integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) survey
CALIFA. We combine an accurate two-dimensional (2D) multi-component photometric decomposition
with the IFS kinematic properties of their bulges to understand their formation scenario. Our final
sample is representative of S0s with high stellar masses ($M_{star}/M_{sun} > 10^{10}$). They
lay mainly on the red sequence and live in relatively isolated environments similar to that of the
field and loose groups. We use our 2D photometric decomposition to define the size and photometric
properties of the bulges, as well as their location within the galaxies. We perform mock spectroscopic
simulations mimicking our observed galaxies to quantify the impact of the underlying disc on our
bulge kinematic measurements ($\lambda$ and $v/\sigma$). We compare our bulge corrected kinematic
measurements with the results from Schwarzschild dynamical modelling. The good agreement confirms
the robustness of our results and allows us to use bulge reprojected values of $\lambda$ and $v/\sigma$.
We find that the photometric ($n$ and $B/T$) and kinematic ($v/\sigma$ and $\lambda$) properties
of our field S0 bulges are not correlated. We demonstrate that this morpho-kinematic decoupling
is intrinsic to the bulges and it is not due to projection effects. We conclude that photometric diagnostics
to separate different types of bulges (disc-like vs classical) might not be useful for S0 galaxies.
The morpho-kinematics properties of S0 bulges derived in this paper suggest that they are mainly
formed by dissipation processes happening at high redshift, but dedicated high-resolution simulations
are necessary to better identify their origin.
