We present a large ensemble of simulations of an Earth-like world with increasing insolation and
rotation rate. Unlike previous work utilizing idealized aquaplanet configurations we focus our
simulations on modern Earth-like topography. The orbital period is the same as modern Earth, but
with zero obliquity and eccentricity. The atmosphere is 1 bar N$_{2}$-dominated with CO$_{2}$=400
ppmv and CH$_{4}$=1 ppmv. The simulations include two types of oceans; one without ocean heat transport
(OHT) between grid cells as has been commonly used in the exoplanet literature, while the other is
a fully coupled dynamic bathtub type ocean. The dynamical regime transitions that occur as day length
increases induce climate feedbacks producing cooler temperatures, first via the reduction of
water vapor with increasing rotation period despite decreasing shortwave cooling by clouds, and
then via decreasing water vapor and increasing shortwave cloud cooling, except at the highest insolations.
Simulations without OHT are more sensitive to insolation changes for fast rotations while slower
rotations are relatively insensitive to ocean choice. OHT runs with faster rotations tend to be
similar with gyres transporting heat poleward making them warmer than those without OHT. For slower
rotations OHT is directed equator-ward and no high latitude gyres are apparent. Uncertainties
in cloud parameterization preclude a precise determination of habitability but do not affect robust
aspects of exoplanet climate sensitivity. This is the first paper in a series that will investigate
aspects of habitability in the simulations presented herein. The datasets from this study are opensource
and publicly available.
