We study the thermal structure of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) in a set of cosmological hydrodynamical
cluster simulations performed with an SPH numerical scheme employing an artificial conductivity
(AC) term. We explore the effects of this term on the ICM temperature and entropy profiles, thermal
distribution, velocity field and expected X-ray emission. We find that in adiabatic runs the artificial
conductivity favours (i) the formation of an entropy core, raising and flattening the central entropy
profiles, in better agreement with findings from Eulerian codes; and (ii) a systematic reduction
of the cold gas component. In fact, the cluster large-scale structure and dynamical state are preserved
across different runs, but the improved gas mixing enabled by the AC term strongly increases the
stripping rate of gas from the cold clumps moving through the ICM. This in turn reduces the production
of turbulence generated by the instabilities which develop because of the interaction between
clumps and ambient ICM. We then find that turbulent motions, enhanced by the time-dependent artificial
viscosity scheme we use, are rather damped by the AC term. The ICM synthetic X-ray emission substantially
mirrors the changes in its thermo-dynamical structure, stressing the robustness of the AC impact.
All these effects are softened by the introduction of radiative cooling but still present, especially
a partial suppression of cold gas. Therefore, not only the physics accounted for, but also the numerical
approach itself can have an impact in shaping the ICM thermo-dynamical structure and ultimately
in the use of SPH cluster simulations for cosmological studies.
