Numerous superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) of Type Ic have been discovered and monitored in the
last decade. The favored mechanism at their origin is a sustained power injection from a magnetar.
This study presents non-local thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent radiative transfer
simulations of various single carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet star explosions influenced by magnetars
of diverse properties and covering from a few days to one or two years after explosion. Nonthermal
processes are treated; the magnetar-power deposition profile is prescribed; dynamical effects
are ignored. In this context, the main influence of the magnetar power is to boost the internal energy
of the ejecta on week-long time scales, enhancing the ejecta temperature and ionization, shifting
the spectral energy distribution to the near-UV (even for the adopted solar metallicity), creating
blue optical colors. Varying the ejecta and magnetar properties introduces various stretches
and shifts to the light curve (rise time, peak or nebular luminosity, light curve width). At maximum,
all models show the presence of OII and CII lines in the optical, and more rarely OIII and CIII lines.
Non-thermal effects are found to be negligible during the high-brightness phase. After maximum,
higher energy explosions are hotter and more ionized, and produce spectra that are optically bluer.
Clumping is a source of spectral diversity after maximum. Clumping is essential to trigger ejecta
recombination and yield the presence of OI, CaII, and FeII lines from a few weeks after maximum until
nebular times. The UV and optical spectrum of Gaia16apd at maximum or the nebular spectrum of LSQ14an
at +410d are compatible with some models that assume no clumping. However, most observed SLSNe Ic
seem to require clumping from early post-maximum to nebular times (e.g., SN2007bi at +46 and +367d;
Gaia16apd at +43d).
