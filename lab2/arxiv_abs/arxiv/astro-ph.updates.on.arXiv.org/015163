The growth time scales of planetary embryos and their formation process are imperative for our understanding
on how planetary systems form and develop. They determine the subsequent growth mechanisms during
the life stages of a circumstellar disk. We quantify the timescales and spatial distribution of
planetary embryos via collisional growth and fragmentation of dynamically forming 100km sized
planetesimals. In our study, the formation timescales of viscous disk evolution and planetesimal
formation are linked to the formation of planetary embryos in the terrestrial planet zone. We connect
a one dimensional model for viscous gas evolution, dust and pebble dynamics and pebble flux regulated
planetesimal formation to the N-body code LIPAD. Our framework enables us to study the formation,
growth, fragmentation and evolution of planetesimals with an initial size of 100km in diameter
for the first million years of a viscous disk. Our study shows the effect of the planetesimal surface
density evolution on the preferential location and timescales of planetary embryo formation.
A one dimensional analytically derived model for embryo formation based on the local planetesimal
surface density evolution is presented. This model manages to reproduce the spatial distribution,
formation rate and total number of planetary embryos at a fraction of the computational cost of the
N-body simulations. The formation of planetary embryos in the terrestrial planet zone occurs simultaneously
to the formation of planetesimals. The local planetesimal surface density evolution and the orbital
spacing of planetary embryos in the oligarchic regime serve well as constraints to model planetary
embryo formation analytically. Our embryo formation model will be a valuable asset in future studies
regarding planet formation.
