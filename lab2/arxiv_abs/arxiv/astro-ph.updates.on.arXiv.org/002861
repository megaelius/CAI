Our current understanding of the stellar initial mass function and massive star evolution suggests
that young globular clusters may have formed hundreds to thousands of stellar-mass black holes,
the remnants of stars with initial masses from $\sim 20 - 100\, M_\odot$. Birth kicks from supernova
explosions may eject some black holes from their birth clusters, but most should be retained. Using
a Monte Carlo method we investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of globular clusters containing
large numbers of stellar black holes. We describe numerical results for 42 models, covering a range
of realistic initial conditions, including up to $1.6\times10^6$ stars. In almost all models we
find that significant numbers of black holes (up to $\sim10^3$) are retained all the way to the present.
This is in contrast to previous theoretical expectations that most black holes should be ejected
dynamically within a few Gyr. The main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by
black holes (through the Spitzer "mass segregation instability") is easily reverted through three-body
processes, and involves only a small number of the most massive black holes, while lower-mass black
holes remain well-mixed with ordinary stars far from the central cusp. Thus the rapid segregation
of stellar black holes does not lead to a long-term physical separation of most black holes into a
dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed previously. Combined with the recent detections
of several black hole X-ray binary candidates in Galactic globular clusters, our results suggest
that stellar black holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusters today,
and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long-term dynamical evolution and the present-day
dynamical structure of many clusters.
