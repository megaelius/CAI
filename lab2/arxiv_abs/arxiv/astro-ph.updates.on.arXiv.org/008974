Transmission spectra probe the atmospheres of transiting exoplanets, but these observations
are also subject to signals introduced by magnetic active regions on host stars. Here we outline
scientific opportunities in the next decade for providing useful constraints on stellar photospheres
and inform interpretations of transmission spectra of the smallest ($R<4\,R_{\odot}$) exoplanets.
We identify and discuss four primary opportunities: (1) refining stellar magnetic active region
properties through exoplanet crossing events; (2) spectral decomposition of active exoplanet
host stars; (3) joint retrievals of stellar photospheric and planetary atmospheric properties
with studies of transmission spectra; and (4) continued visual transmission spectroscopy studies
to complement longer-wavelength studies from $\textit{JWST}$. We make five recommendations
to the Astro2020 Decadal Survey Committee: (1) identify the transit light source (TLS) effect as
a challenge to precise exoplanet transmission spectroscopy and an opportunity ripe for scientific
advancement in the coming decade; (2) include characterization of host star photospheric heterogeneity
as part of a comprehensive research strategy for studying transiting exoplanets; (3) support the
construction of ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs); (4) support multi-disciplinary
research teams that bring together the heliophysics, stellar physics, and exoplanet communities
to further exploit transiting exoplanets as spatial probes of stellar photospheres; and (5) support
visual transmission spectroscopy efforts as complements to longer-wavelength observational
campaigns with $\textit{JWST}$.
