To study motions and oscillations in the solar chromosphere and at the transition region (TR) level
we analyze some extreme Doppler shifts observed off-limb with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS). Raster scans and slit-jaw imaging observations performed in the near-ultraviolet (NUV)
channels were used. Large transverse oscillations are revealed by the far wings profiles after
accurately removing the bulk average line profiles of each sequence. Different regions around
the Sun are considered. Accordingly, the cool material of spicules is observed in Mg II lines rather
dispersed up to coronal heights. In the quiet Sun and especially in a polar coronal hole, we study
dynamical properties of the dispersed spicules-material off-limb using a high spectral, temporal
and spatial resolutions IRIS observations. We suggest that numerous small-scale jet-like spicules
show rapid twisting and swaying motions evidenced by the large distortion and dispersion of the
line profiles, including impressive periodic Doppler shifts. Most of these events repeatedly
appear in red- and blue-shifts above the limb throughout the whole interval of the observation datasets
with an average swaying speed of order +/-35 kms-1 reaching a maximum value of 50 km s-1 in the polar
coronal hole region, well above the 2.2 Mm heights. We identified for the 1st time waves with a short
period of order of 100 sec and less and transverse amplitudes of order of +/- 20 to 30 km s-1 with the
definite signature of Alfven waves. No correlation exists between brightness and Doppler shift
variations; the phase speed of the wave is very large and cannot definitely be determined from the
spectral features seen along the quasi-radial features. Even shorter periods waves are evidenced,
although their contrast is greatly attenuated by the overlapping effects along the line of sight.
