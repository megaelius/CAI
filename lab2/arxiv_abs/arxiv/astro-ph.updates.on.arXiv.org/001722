Starlight from galaxies plays a pivotal role throughout the process of cosmic reionisation. We
present the statistics of dwarf galaxy properties at z > 7 in haloes with masses up to 10^9 solar
masses, using a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows their buildup starting
with their Population III progenitors. We find that metal-enriched star formation is not restricted
to atomic cooling (T_vir > 10^4 K) haloes, but can occur in haloes down to masses ~10^6 solar masses,
especially in neutral regions. Even though these smallest galaxies only host up to 10^4 solar masses
of stars, they provide a significant fraction of the ionising photon budget because of their high
number densities. We find that the galaxy luminosity function flattens above M_UV ~ -12 with a number
density that is unchanged during reionisation. The fraction of ionising radiation escaping into
the intergalactic medium is inversely dependent on halo mass, decreasing from 50 to 5 per cent in
the mass range $\log M/M_\odot = 7.0-8.5$. We find that low-mass galaxies are just as efficient at
producing ionising photons per unit mass as atomic cooling haloes. However, they are gradually
photo-suppressed as they are engulfed in ionised regions, giving way for larger galaxies to dominate
the latter half of reionisation. Using our galaxy statistics in a semi-analytic reionisation model,
we find a Thomson scattering optical depth consistent with the latest Planck results, while still
being consistent with the UV emissivity constraints provided by Ly-alpha forest observations
at z = 4-6. We find that haloes less massive than the atomic cooling limit provide nearly 30 per cent
to the total ionising photon budget. Our work suggests that a yet-to-be observed population of low-mass
galaxies was responsible for starting reionisation at very high redshifts.
