With the advent of space-based precision photometry missions the quantity and quality of starspot
light curves has greatly increased. This paper presents a large number of starspot models and their
resulting light curves to: 1) better determine light curve metrics and methods that convey useful
physical information, 2) understand how the underlying degeneracies of the translation from physical
starspot distributions to the resulting light curves obscure that information. We explore models
of relatively active stars at several inclinations while varying the number of (dark) spots, random
spot distributions in position and time, timescales of growth and decay, and differential rotation.
We examine the behavior of absolute and differential variations of individual intensity dips and
overall light curves, and demonstrate how complex spot distributions and behaviors result in light
curves that typically exhibit only one or two dips per rotation. Unfortunately simplistic "one
or two spot" or "active longitude" descriptions or modeling of light curves can often be highly misleading.
We also show that short "activity cycles" can easily be simply due to random processes. It turns out
to be quite difficult to disentangle the competing effects of spot lifetime and differential rotation,
but under most circumstances spot lifetime is the more influential of the two. Many of the techniques
tried to date only work when spots live for many rotations. These include autocorrelation degradation
for spot lifetimes and periodograms for both global and differential rotation. Differential rotation
may be nearly impossible to accurately infer from light curves alone unless spots live for many rotations.
The Sun and solar-type stars its age or older are unfortunately the most difficult type of case. Further
work is needed to have increased confidence in light curve inferences.
