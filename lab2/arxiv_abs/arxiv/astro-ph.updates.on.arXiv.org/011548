Simulations of magnetohydrodynamics convection in slowly rotating stars predict anti-solar
differential rotation (DR) in which the equator rotates slower than poles. This anti-solar DR in
the usual $\alpha \Omega$ dynamo model does not produce polarity reversal. Thus, the features of
large-scale magnetic fields in slowly rotating stars are expected to be different than stars having
solar-like DR. In this study, we perform mean-field kinematic dynamo modelling of different stars
at different rotation periods. We consider anti-solar DR for the stars having rotation period larger
than 30~days and solar-like DR otherwise. We show that with particular $\alpha$ profiles, the dynamo
model produces magnetic cycles with polarity reversals even with the anti-solar DR provided, the
DR is quenched when the toroidal field grows considerably high and there is a sufficiently strong
$\alpha$ for the generation of toroidal field. Due to the anti-solar DR, the model produces an abrupt
increase of magnetic field exactly when the DR profile is changed from solar-like to anti-solar.
This enhancement of magnetic field is in good agreement with the stellar observational data as well
as some global convection simulations. In the solar-like DR branch, with the decreasing rotation
period, we find the magnetic field strength increases while the cycle period shortens. Both of these
trends are in general agreement with observations. Our study provides additional support for the
possible existence of anti-solar DR in slowly rotating stars and the presence of unusually enhanced
magnetic fields and possibly cycles which are prone to production of superflare.
