With the aim to determine the spatial distribution of the dark matter halo, we investigate two polar
ring galaxies NGC 4262 and SPRC-7. For both galaxies the stellar kinematics data for the central
galaxy were obtained from optical spectroscopy at the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The information about polar gaseous components
was taken from the optical 3D-spectroscopic observations of ionized gas (for SPRC-7) and H {\sc
i} radio observations (for NGC 4262). SPRC-7 is the system with a relative angle $\delta=73^{\circ}$
towards the central galaxy and a quite massive stellar-gaseous polar component. Meanwhile NGC
4262 is the classic polar case with $\delta=88^{\circ}$ where the polar ring mainly consists of
neutral gas with a negligible stellar contribution to the mass. We are hence dealing with two different
systems and the results are quite diverse too. The observed properties of both galaxies were compared
with the results of self consistent simulations of velocity fields of the polar component along
with the rotation curve of the central lenticular galaxy. For SPRC-7 we have found a slightly flattened
halo towards the polar plane with the axis ratio $c/a \simeq 1.7 \pm 0.2$ for the isothermal halo model
and $c/a \simeq 1.5 \pm 0.2$ for the NFW model. The case of NGC 4262 is more unusual, the shape of the
dark matter distribution varies strongly with radius. Namely, the dark matter halo is fattened
in the vicinity of the galactic disc ($c/a \approx 0.4 \pm 0.1$), however it is prolate far beyond
the central galaxy ($c/a \approx 1.7$ for the isothermal halo and $c/a \approx 2.3$ for NFW).
