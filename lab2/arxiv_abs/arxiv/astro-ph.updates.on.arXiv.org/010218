The determination of the specific angular momentum radial profile, $j(r)$, in the early stages
of star formation is crucial to constrain star and circumstellar disk formation theories. The specific
angular momentum is directly related to the largest Keplerian disk possible, and it could constrain
the angular momentum removal mechanism. We determine $j(r)$ towards two Class 0 objects and a first
hydrostatic core candidate in the Perseus cloud, which is consistent across all three sources and
well fit with a single power-law relation between 800 and 10,000\,au: $j_{fit}(r)=10^{-3.60\pm0.15}\left(r/\textrm{1,000au}\right)^{1.80\pm0.04}$
km s$^{-1}$ pc. This power-law relation is in between solid body rotation ($\propto r^2$) and pure
turbulence ($\propto r^{1.5}$). This strongly suggests that even at 1,000\,au, the influence
of the dense core's initial level of turbulence or the connection between core and the molecular
cloud is still present. The specific angular momentum at 10,000\,au is $\approx3\times$ higher
than previously estimated, while at 1,000\,au it is lower by $2\times$. We do not find a region of
conserved specific angular momentum, although it could still be present at a smaller radius. We
estimate an upper limit to the largest Keplerian disk radius of 60\,au, which is small but consistent
with published upper limits. Finally, these results suggest that more realistic initial conditions
for numerical simulations of disk formation are needed. Some possible solutions include: a) use
a larger simulation box to include some level of driven turbulence or connection to the parental
cloud, or b) incorporate the observed $j(r)$ to setup the dense core kinematics initial conditions.
