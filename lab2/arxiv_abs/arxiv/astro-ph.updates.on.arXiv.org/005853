We present results of a deep spectroscopic survey designed to quantify the statistics of the escape
of ionizing photons from star-forming galaxies at z~3. We measure the ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing
UV flux density <f900/f1500>_obs, where f900 is the mean flux density evaluated over the range [880,910]
A. We quantify the emergent ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing UV flux density by analyzing high-S/N
composite spectra formed from sub-samples with common observed properties and numbers sufficient
to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the modeled IGM+CGM correction to obtain precise values
of <f900/f1500>_out, including a full-sample average <f900/f1500>_out=$0.057\pm0.006$. We
further show that <f900/f1500>_out increases monotonically with Ly$\alpha$ rest equivalent
width, inducing an inverse correlation with UV luminosity as a by-product. We fit the composite
spectra using stellar spectral synthesis together with models of the ISM in which a fraction f_c
of the stellar continuum is covered by gas with column density N(HI). We show that the composite spectra
simultaneously constrain the intrinsic properties of the stars (L900/L1500)_int along with f_c,
N(HI), E(B-V), and $f_{esc,abs}$, the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons. We find a sample-averaged
$f_{esc,abs} =0.09\pm0.01$, and that subsamples fall along a linear relation $\langle f_{esc,abs}\rangle
\sim 0.75[W(Ly\alpha)/110 A]$. We use the FUV luminosity function, the distribution function
$n[W(Ly\alpha)]$, and the relationship between $W(Ly\alpha)$ and <f900/f1500>_out to estimate
the total ionizing emissivity of $z\sim3$ star-forming galaxies with Muv < -19.5: $\epsilon_{LyC}\sim
6\times10^{24}$ ergs/s/Hz/Mpc$^3$, exceeding the contribution of QSOs by a factor of $\sim 3$,
and accounting for $\sim50$% of the total $\epsilon_{LyC}$ at $z\sim3$ estimated using indirect
methods.
