We examine systematically the (in)consistency between cosmological constraints as obtained
from various current data sets of the expansion history, Large Scale Structure (LSS), and Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) from Planck. We run (dis)concordance tests within each set and across
the sets using a recently introduced index of inconsistency (IOI) capable of dissecting inconsistencies
between two or more data sets. First, we compare the constraints on $H_0$ from five different methods
and find that the IOI drops from 2.85 to 0.88 (on Jeffreys' scales) when the local $H_0$ measurements
is removed. This seems to indicate that the local measurement is an outlier, thus favoring a systematics-based
explanation. We find a moderate inconsistency (IOI=2.61) between Planck temperature and polarization.
We find that current LSS data sets including WiggleZ, SDSS RSD, CFHTLenS, CMB lensing and SZ cluster
count, are consistent one with another and when all combined. However, we find a persistent moderate
inconsistency between Planck and individual or combined LSS probes. For Planck TT+lowTEB versus
individual LSS probes, the IOI spans the range 2.92--3.72 and increases to 3.44--4.20 when the polarization
data is added in. The joint LSS versus the combined Planck temperature and polarization has an IOI
of 2.83 in the most conservative case. But if Planck lowTEB is added to the joint LSS to constrain $\tau$
and break degeneracies, the inconsistency between Planck and joint LSS data increases to the high-end
of the moderate range with IOI=4.81. Whether due to systematic effects in the data or to the underlying
model, these inconsistencies need to be resolved. Finally, we perform forecast calculations using
LSST and find that the discordance between Planck and future LSS data, if it persists as present,
can rise up to a high IOI of 17, thus falling in the very strong range of inconsistency. (Abridged).
