Cosmological analyses based on surveys of galaxy clusters observed through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(tSZ) effect strongly rely on the mean pressure profile of the galaxy cluster population. A tension
is currently observed between the cosmological constraints obtained from the analyses of the CMB
primary anisotropies and those from cluster abundance in tSZ surveys. This discrepancy between
the estimated cosmological constraints may be partly explained by a wrong estimate of the hydrostatic
bias parameter that links the hydrostatic mass to the true mass of galaxy clusters. However, a variation
of both the amplitude and the shape of the mean normalized pressure profile could also explain part
of this tension. If the self-similar hypothesis is not verified in the whole mass-redshift plane,
the parameters of the mean normalized pressure profile of the cluster population could be different
from the ones observed at high mass and low redshift. We analyze the effects of a modification of this
profile on the constraints of the $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ parameters through the analysis of
the $Planck$ tSZ power spectrum. We choose two mean normalized pressure profiles that are respectively
lower and higher than the one obtained from the observation of 62 nearby clusters by $Planck$. The
selection of the parameters of these two profiles is based on the current estimates of the pressure
and the gas mass fraction profile distributions at low redshift. The cosmological parameters found
for these two profiles are significantly different from the ones obtained with the $Planck$ pressure
profile. We conclude that a ${\sim}15\%$ decrease of the amplitude of the mean normalized pressure
profile would alleviate the tension observed between the constraints of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$
obtained from the CMB and cluster analyses without requiring extreme values of the mass bias parameter.
