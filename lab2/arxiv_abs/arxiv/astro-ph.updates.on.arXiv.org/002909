Millimeter-wave continuum astronomy is today an indispensable tool for both general Astrophysics
studies and Cosmology. General purpose, large field-of-view instruments are needed to map the
sky at intermediate angular scales not accessible by the high-resolution interferometers and
by the coarse angular resolution space-borne or ground-based surveys. These instruments have
to be installed at the focal plane of the largest single-dish telescopes. In this context, we have
constructed and deployed a multi-thousands pixels dual-band (150 and 260 GHz, respectively 2mm
and 1.15mm wavelengths) camera to image an instantaneous field-of-view of 6.5arc-min and configurable
to map the linear polarization at 260GHz. We are providing a detailed description of this instrument,
named NIKA2 (New IRAM KID Arrays 2), in particular focusing on the cryogenics, the optics, the focal
plane arrays based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID) and the readout electronics. We are presenting
the performance measured on the sky during the commissioning runs that took place between October
2015 and April 2017 at the 30-meter IRAM (Institut of Millimetric Radio Astronomy) telescope at
Pico Veleta. NIKA2 has been successfully deployed and commissioned, performing in-line with the
ambitious expectations. In particular, NIKA2 exhibits FWHM angular resolutions of 10.9 and 17.5
arc-seconds at respectively 260 and 150GHz. The NEFD (Noise Equivalent Flux Densities) demonstrated
on the maps are, at these two respective frequencies, 20 and 6mJy*sqrt(s). A first successful science
verification run has been achieved in April 2017. The instrument will be offered to the astronomical
community during the coming winter and will remain available for at least the next ten years.
