We present photometry, spectra, and spectropolarimetry of supernova (SN) 2014ab, obtained through
$\sim 200$ days after peak brightness. SN 2014ab was a luminous Type IIn SN ($M_V < -19.14$ mag) discovered
after peak brightness near the nucleus of its host galaxy, VV 306c. Prediscovery upper limits constrain
the time of explosion to within 200 days prior to discovery. While SN 2014ab declined by $\sim 1$ mag
over the course of our observations, the observed spectrum remained remarkably unchanged. Spectra
exhibit an asymmetric emission-line profile with a consistently stronger blueshifted component,
suggesting the presence of dust or a lack of symmetry between the far side and near side of the SN. The
Pa$\beta$ emission line shows a profile very similar to that of H$\alpha$, implying that this stronger
blueshifted component is caused either through obscuration by large dust grains, occultation
by optically thick material, or a lack of symmetry between the far side and near side of the interaction
region. Despite these asymmetric line profiles, our spectropolarimetric data show that SN 2014ab
has little detected polarization after accounting for the interstellar polarization. This suggests
that we are seeing emission from a photosphere that has only small deviation from circular symmetry
face-on. We are likely seeing a SN IIn with nearly circular symmetry in the plane normal to our line
of sight, but with either large-grain dust or significant asymmetry in the density of circumstellar
material or SN ejecta along our line of sight. We suggest that SN 2014ab and SN 2010jl (as well as other
SNe IIn) may be similar events viewed from different directions.
