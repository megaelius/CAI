We present ionized gas kinematics for 681 galaxies at $z\sim 1.4-3.8$ from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution
Field survey, measured using models which account for random galaxy-slit misalignments together
with structural parameters derived from CANDELS Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. Kinematics
and sizes are used to derive dynamical masses. Baryonic masses are estimated from stellar masses
and inferred gas masses from dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation. We measure resolved rotation for 105 galaxies. For the remaining 576 galaxies we use models
based on HST imaging structural parameters together with integrated velocity dispersions and
baryonic masses to statistically constrain the median ratio of intrinsic ordered to disordered
motion, $V/\sigma_{V,0}$. We find that $V/\sigma_{V,0}$ increases with increasing stellar mass
and decreasing specific SFR (sSFR). These trends may reflect marginal disk stability, where systems
with higher gas fractions have thicker disks. For galaxies with detected rotation we assess trends
between their kinematics and mass, sSFR, and baryon surface density ($\Sigma_{\mathrm{bar},e}$).
Intrinsic dispersion correlates most with $\Sigma_{\mathrm{bar},e}$ and velocity correlates
most with mass. By comparing dynamical and baryonic masses, we find that galaxies at $z\sim 1.4-3.8$
are baryon dominated within their effective radii ($R_E$), with Mdyn/Mbaryon increasing over
time. The inferred baryon fractions within $R_E$, $f_{\mathrm{bar}}$, decrease over time, even
at fixed mass, size, or surface density. At fixed redshift, $f_{\mathrm{bar}}$ does not appear
to vary with stellar mass but increases with decreasing $R_E$ and increasing $\Sigma_{\mathrm{bar},e}$.
For galaxies at $z\geq2$, the median inferred baryon fractions generally exceed 100%. We discuss
possible explanations and future avenues to resolve this tension.
