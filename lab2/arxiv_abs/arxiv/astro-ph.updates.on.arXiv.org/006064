Over the last few years, a large family of cosmological attractor models has been discovered, which
can successfully match the latest inflation-related observational data. Many of these models
can also describe a small cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which provides the most natural description
of the present stage of the cosmological acceleration. In this paper, we study $\alpha$-attractor
models with dynamical dark energy, including the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as a free parameter.
Predominantly, the models with $\Lambda > 0$ converge to the asymptotic regime with the equation
of state $w=-1$. However, there are some models with $w\neq -1$, which are compatible with the current
observations. In the simplest models with $\Lambda = 0$, one has the tensor to scalar ratio $r=\frac{12\alpha}{N^2}$
and the asymptotic equation of state $w=-1+\frac{2}{9\alpha}$ (which in general differs from
its present value). For example, in the seven disk M-theory related model with $\alpha = 7/3$ one
finds $r \sim 10^{-2}$ and the asymptotic equation of state is $w \sim -0.9$. Future observations,
including large-scale structure surveys as well as B-mode detectors will test these, as well as
more general models presented here. We also discuss gravitational reheating in models of quintessential
inflation and argue that its investigation may be interesting from the point of view of inflationary
cosmology. Such models require a much greater number of $e$-folds, and therefore predict a spectral
index $n_{s}$ that can exceed the value in more conventional models by about $0.006$. This suggests
a way to distinguish the conventional inflationary models from the models of quintessential inflation,
even if they predict $w = -1$.
