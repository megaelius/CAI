The production rate of primordial black holes is often calculated by considering a nearly Gaussian
distribution of cosmological perturbations, and assuming that black holes will form in regions
where the amplitude of such perturbations exceeds a certain threshold. A threshold $\zeta_{\rm
th}$ for the curvature perturbation is somewhat inappropriate for this purpose, because it depends
significantly on environmental effects, not essential to the local dynamics. By contrast, a threshold
$\delta_{\rm th}$ for the density perturbation at horizon crossing seems to provide a more robust
criterion. On the other hand, the density perturbation is known to be bounded above by a maximum limit
$\delta_{\rm max}$, and given that $\delta_{\rm th}$ is comparable to $\delta_{\rm max}$, the
density perturbation will be far from Gaussian near or above the threshold. In this paper we provide
a new plausible estimate for the primordial black hole abundance based on peak theory. In our approach,
we assume a Gaussian distribution for the curvature perturbation, while an optimized criterion
for PBH formation is imposed, based on the locally averaged density perturbation around the nearly
spherically symmetric high peaks. Both variables are related by the full nonlinear expression
derived in the long-wavelength approximation of general relativity. We find that the mass spectrum
is shifted to larger mass scales by one order of magnitude or so, compared to a conventional calculation.
The abundance of PBHs becomes significantly larger than the conventional one, by many orders of
magnitude, mainly due to the optimized criterion for PBH formation.
