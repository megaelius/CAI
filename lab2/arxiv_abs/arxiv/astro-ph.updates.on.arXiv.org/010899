We analyse the mass density distribution in the centres of galaxies across five orders of magnitude
in mass range. Using high-quality spiral galaxy rotation curves and infrared photometry from SPARC,
we conduct a systematic study of their central dark matter fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$) and their mass
density slope ($\alpha$), within their effective radius. We show that lower-mass spiral galaxies
are more dark matter dominated and have more shallow mass density slopes when compared with more
massive galaxies, which have density profiles closer to isothermal. Low-mass ($M_{\star} \lesssim
10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$) gas-rich spirals span a wide range of \fdm\ values, but systematically
lower than in gas-poor systems of similar mass. With increasing galaxy mass, the values of \fdm\
decrease and the density profiles steepen. In the most massive late-type gas-poor galaxies, a possible
flattening of these trends is observed. When comparing these results to massive ($M_{\star} \gtrsim
10^{10}M_{\odot}$) elliptical galaxies from SPIDER and to dwarf ellipticals from SMACKED, these
trends result to be inverted. Hence, the values of both $f_{\rm DM}$ and $\alpha$, as a function of
$M_{\star}$, exhibit a U-shape trend. At a fixed stellar mass, the mass density profiles in dwarf
ellipticals are steeper than in spirals. These trends can be understood by stellar feedback from
a more prolonged star formation period in spirals, causing a transformation of the initial steep
density cusp to a more shallow profile via differential feedback efficiency by supernovae, and
by galaxy mergers or AGN feedback in higher-mass galaxies.
