We report on the first sub-arcsecond (0.44 $\times$ 0.41 arcsec$\rm ^2$) angular resolution image
at 150 MHz of the A-nucleus in the Luminous Infrared Galaxy Arp$\,$299, from International Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR) Telescope observations. The most remarkable finding is that of an intriguing two-sided,
filamentary structure emanating from A-nucleus, which we interpret as an outflow that extends
up to at least 14 arcseconds from the A-nucleus in the N-S direction ($\approx$ 5 kpc deprojected
size) and accounts for almost 40% of the extended emission of the entire galaxy system. We also discuss
HST/NICMOS [FeII] 1.64 $\rm \mu m$ and H$\rm_2$ 2.12 $\rm \mu m$ images of Arp$\,$299-A, which show
similar features to those unveiled by our 150 MHz LOFAR observations, thus giving string morphological
support for the outflow scenario. Finally, we discuss unpublished NaI D spectra that confirm the
outflow nature of this structure. From energetic arguments, we rule out the low-luminosity active
galactic nucleus in Arp$\,$299-A as a driver for the outflow. On the contrary, the powerful, compact
starburst in the central regions of Arp$\,$299-A provides plenty of mechanical energy to sustain
an outflow, and we conclude that the intense supernova (SN) activity in the nuclear region of Arp299-A
is driving the observed outflow. We estimate that the starburst wind can support a mass-outflow
rate in the range (11-63) $\rm M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ at speeds of up to (370 - 890) $\rm km \, s^{-1}$,
and is relatively young, with an estimated kinematic age of (3 - 7) Myr. Those results open an avenue
to the use of low-frequency (150 MHz), sub-arcsecond imaging with LOFAR to detect outflows in the
central regions of local luminous infrared galaxies.
