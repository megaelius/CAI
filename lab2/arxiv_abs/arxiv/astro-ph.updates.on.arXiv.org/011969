We validate the discovery of a 2 Earth radii sub-Neptune-size planet around the nearby high proper
motion M2.5-dwarf G 9-40 (EPIC 212048748), using high-precision near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity
(RV) observations with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF), precision diffuser-assisted
ground-based photometry with a custom narrow-band photometric filter, and adaptive optics imaging.
At a distance of $d=27.9\mathrm{pc}$, G 9-40b is the second closest transiting planet discovered
by K2 to date. The planet's large transit depth ($\sim$3500ppm), combined with the proximity and
brightness of the host star at NIR wavelengths (J=10, K=9.2) makes G 9-40b one of the most favorable
sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting an M-dwarf for transmission spectroscopy with JWST, ARIEL,
and the upcoming Extremely Large Telescopes. The star is relatively inactive with a rotation period
of $\sim$29 days determined from the K2 photometry. To estimate spectroscopic stellar parameters,
we describe our implementation of an empirical spectral matching algorithm using the high-resolution
NIR HPF spectra. Using this algorithm, we obtain an effective temperature of $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=3404\pm73$K,
and metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-0.08\pm0.13$. Our RVs, when coupled with the orbital parameters
derived from the transit photometry, exclude planet masses above $11.7 M_\oplus$ with 99.7% confidence
assuming a circular orbit. From its radius, we predict a mass of $M=5.0^{+3.8}_{-1.9} M_\oplus$
and an RV semi-amplitude of $K=4.1^{+3.1}_{-1.6}\mathrm{m\:s^{-1}}$, making its mass measurable
with current RV facilities. We urge further RV follow-up observations to precisely measure its
mass, to enable precise transmission spectroscopic measurements in the future.
