In this thesis a measurement of the high energy $\gamma$-ray flux between 200 MeV and 1 TeV with the
Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is presented. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a multi-purpose
particle detector mounted externally on the International Space Station. Although primarily
designed for the measurement of charged cosmic rays AMS-02 is capable of measuring high energy $\gamma$-rays
in two complementary modes. Two independent analyses are presented in this thesis, one for each
of the two modes. The event selection criteria and the associated resolution functions are presented
in detail. The effective area is estimated from a full detector Monte-Carlo simulation and corrected
for the most important differences between data and simulation. A full sky model for $\gamma$-rays
is constructed from diffuse emission predictions and recent $\gamma$-ray source catalogs. A dedicated
analysis of Fermi-LAT data is performed to fully enable a detailed comparison with the AMS result.
The measured flux of $\gamma$-rays is presented for various parts of the sky, including comparisons
with Fermi-LAT data and with the constructed model. The inner galaxy is studied in detail, as an example
of a region in which the photon flux is dominated by diffuse emission. The fluxes of several $\gamma$-ray
producing sources, including Vela, Geminga and the Crab pulsar are shown. The Geminga pulsar is
studied in detail, revealing its pulsed emission of $\gamma$-rays in the AMS-02 data, which allows
to measure its frequency of rotation and to estimate its magnetic field strength and age. Finally,
AMS-02 observed an outburst of the flaring blazar CTA-102 at the end of 2016.
