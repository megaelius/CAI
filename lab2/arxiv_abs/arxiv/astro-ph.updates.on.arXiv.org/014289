We present a spectroscopic survey of 230 white dwarf candidates within 40 pc of the Sun from the William
Herschel Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias. All candidates were selected from $\textit{Gaia}$
Data Release 2 (DR2) and in almost all cases had no prior spectroscopic classifications. We find
a total of 191 confirmed white dwarfs and 39 main-sequence star contaminants. The majority of stellar
remnants in the sample are relatively cool ($\langle T_{\rm eff} \rangle$ = 6200 K), showing either
hydrogen Balmer lines or a featureless spectrum, corresponding to 89 DA and 76 DC white dwarfs, respectively.
We also recover two DBA white dwarfs and 9--10 magnetic remnants. We find two carbon-bearing DQ stars
and 14 new metal-rich white dwarfs. This includes the possible detection of the first ultra-cool
white dwarf with metal lines. We describe three DZ stars for which we find at least four different
metal species, including one which is strongly Fe- and Ni-rich, indicative of the accretion of a
planetesimal with core-Earth composition. We find one extremely massive (1.31 $\pm$ 0.01 M$_{\odot}$)
DA white dwarf showing weak Balmer lines, possibly indicating stellar magnetism. Another white
dwarf shows strong Balmer line emission but no infrared excess, suggesting a low-mass sub-stellar
companion. High spectroscopic completeness ($>$99%) has now been reached for $\textit{Gaia}$
DR2 sources within 40 pc sample, in the northern hemisphere ($\delta >$ 0 deg) and located on the white
dwarf cooling track in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. A statistical study of the full northern
sample is presented in a companion paper.
