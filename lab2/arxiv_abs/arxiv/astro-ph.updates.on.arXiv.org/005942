We want to study whether the astrometric and photometric accuracies obtained for the Carte du Ciel
plates digitized with a commercial digital camera are high enough for scientific exploitation
of the plates. We use a digital camera Canon EOS~5Ds, with a 100mm macrolens for digitizing. We analyze
six single-exposure plates and four triple-exposure plates from the Helsinki zone of Carte du Ciel
(+39 degr < delta < 47 degr). Each plate is digitized using four images, with a significant central
area being covered twice for quality control purposes. The astrometric calibration of the digitized
images is done with the data from the Gaia TGAS (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution) of the first Gaia
data release (Gaia DR1), Tycho-2, HSOY (Hot Stuff for One Year), UCAC5 (USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog),
and PMA catalogs. The best astrometric accuracy is obtained with the UCAC5 reference stars. The
astrometric accuracy for single-exposure plates is sigma(R.A.)=0.16" and sigma(Dec.)=0.15"
expressed as a Gaussian deviation of the astrometric residuals. For triple-exposure plates the
astrometric accuracy is sigma(R.A.)=0.12" and sigma(Dec.)=0.13". The 1-sigma uncertainty of
photometric calibration is about 0.28 mag and 0.24 mag for single- and triple-exposure plates,
respectively. We detect the photographic adjacency (Kostinsky) effect in the triple-exposure
plates. We show that accuracies at least of the level of scanning machines can be achieved with a digital
camera, without any corrections for possible distortions caused by our instrumental setup. This
method can be used to rapidly and inexpensively digitize and calibrate old photographic plates
enabling their scientific exploitation.
