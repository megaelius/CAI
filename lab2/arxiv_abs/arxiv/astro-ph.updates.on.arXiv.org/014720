Planet-planet scattering events can leave an observable trace of a planet's migration history
in the form of orbital misalignment with respect to the the stellar spin axis, which is measurable
from spectroscopic timeseries taken during transit. We present high-resolution spectroscopic
transits observed with ESPRESSO of the close-in super-Earth $\pi$ Men c. The system also contains
an outer giant planet on a wide, eccentric orbit, recently found to be inclined with respect to the
inner planetary orbit. These characteristics are reminiscent of past dynamical interactions.
We successfully retrieve the planet-occulted light during transit and find evidence that the orbit
of $\pi$ Men c is moderately misaligned with the stellar spin axis with $\lambda = -24.0^\circ \pm
4.1^\circ$ ($\psi = 26.9^{\circ +5.8^\circ}_{\,-4.7^\circ}$). This is consistent with the super-Earth
$\pi$ Men c having followed a high-eccentricity migration followed by tidal circularisation,
and hints that super-Earths can form at large distances from their star. We also detect clear signatures
of solar-like oscillations within our ESPRESSO radial velocity timeseries, where we reach a radial
velocity precision of ${\sim}20$ cm/s. We model the oscillations using Gaussian processes and
retrieve a frequency of maximum oscillation, $\nu_\text{max} = 2771^{+65}_{-60}$ $\mu$Hz. These
oscillations makes it challenging to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect using traditional
methods. We are, however, successful using the reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin approach. Finally,
in an appendix we also present updated physical parameters and ephemerides for $\pi$ Men c from a
Gaussian process transit analysis of the full TESS Cycle 1 data.
