Submillimeter dust polarization measurements of a sample of 50 star-forming regions, observed
with the SMA and the CSO covering pc-scale clouds to mpc-scale cores, are analyzed in order to quantify
the magnetic field importance. The magnetic field misalignment $\delta$ -- the local angle between
magnetic field and dust emission gradient -- is found to be a prime observable, revealing distinct
distributions for sources where the magnetic field is preferentially aligned with or perpendicular
to the source minor axis. Source-averaged misalignment angles $\langle|\delta|\rangle$ fall
into systematically different ranges, reflecting the different source-magnetic field configurations.
Possible bimodal $\langle|\delta|\rangle$-distributions are found for the separate SMA and
CSO samples. Combining both samples broadens the distribution with a wide maximum peak at small
$\langle|\delta|\rangle$-values. Assuming the 50 sources to be representative, the prevailing
source-magnetic field configuration is one that statistically prefers small magnetic field misalignments
$|\delta|$. When interpreting $|\delta|$ together with an MHD force equation, as developed in
the framework of the polarization-intensity gradient method, a sample-based scaling fits the
magnetic field tension-to-gravity force ratio $\langle\Sigma_B\rangle$ versus $\langle|\delta|\rangle$
with $\langle\Sigma_B\rangle = 0.116 \cdot \exp(0.047\cdot \langle|\delta|\rangle)\pm 0.20$
(mean error), providing a way to estimate the relative importance of the magnetic field, only based
on measurable field misalignments $|\delta|$. The force ratio $\Sigma_B$ discriminates systems
that are collapsible on average ($\langle \Sigma_B\rangle <1$) from other molecular clouds
where the magnetic field still provides enough resistance against gravitational collapse ($\langle
\Sigma_B\rangle >1$) (abridged).
