The dominant source of radio emission from quasars has been debated for decades. We present the radio
luminosity function (RLF) of optically-selected quasars below 1~mJy, constructed by applying
a Bayesian-fitting stacking technique to objects below the nominal radio flux-density limit.
We test the technique using simulated data, confirming that we can reconstruct the RLF over three
orders of magnitude below the typical $5\sigma$ threshold, although this is dependent on the number
density of the population in question. We apply our method to 1.4-GHz flux-densities from the Faint
Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey, extracted at the positions of optical quasars
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) over seven redshift bins. The lowest redshift bin ($0.2
< z < 0.45$) constitutes a volume-limited sampled defined by $M_i <-23$ and we measure the optically-selected
quasar RLF over two orders of magnitude below the FIRST detection threshold of 1 mJy. We find that
our measured RLF is in agreement with deeper data from the literature. We find that the radio luminosity
function for the radio-loud quasars flattens around $\log_{10}[L_{1.4}/{\rm W\,Hz}^{-1}] \approx
25$, where radio-quiet quasars start to emerge. The radio luminosity were radio-quiet quasars
emerge coincides with the luminosity were star-forming galaxies start to dominate the radio source
counts. This implies that there could be a significant contribution from star formation in the host
galaxies, but additional data is required to investigate this further. The higher-redshift bins
show similar behavior (i.e. RLF shape) as for the lowest-$z$ bin, at least up to $z=2.15$, implying
that the same physical process may be responsible.
