Our understanding of protoplanetary disks has greatly improved over the last decade due to a wealth
of data from new facilities. Unbiased dust surveys with Spitzer leave us with good constraints on
the dust dispersal timescale of small grains in the terrestrial planet forming region. In the ALMA
era, this can be confronted for the first time also with evolutionary timescales of mm grains in the
outer disk. Gas surveys in the context of the existing multi-wavelength dust surveys will be a key
in large statistical studies of disk gas evolution. Unbiased gas surveys are limited to ALMA CO submm
surveys, where the quantitative interpretation is still debated. Herschel gas surveys have been
largely biased, but [OI] 63 mic surveys and also accretion tracers agree qualitatively with the
evolutionary timescale of small grains in the inner disk. Recent advances achieved by means of consistent
multi-wavelength studies of gas AND dust in planet forming disks reveal the subtleties of the quantitative
interpretation of gas surveys. Observational methods to determine disk masses e.g. from CO submm
lines require the knowledge of the dust properties in the disk. Understanding not only the gas evolution,
but also its chemical composition will provide crucial input for planet formation models. Kinetic
chemical results give profoundly different answers than thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of
the C/O ratios as well as the water ice/rock ratios. Again, dust has a key impact on the chemical evolution
and composition of the gas. Grain growth for example affects freeze-out processes and strongly
increases the cosmic ray induced UV field.
