The C$^{+}$ ion is an important coolant of interstellar gas, and so the [CII] fine structure line
is frequently observed in the interstellar medium. However, the physical and chemical properties
of the [CII]-emitting gas are still unclear. We carry out non-LTE radiative transfer simulations
with RADMC-3D to study the [CII] line emission from a young, turbulent molecular cloud before the
onset of star formation, using data from the SILCC-Zoom project. The [CII] emission is optically
thick over 40% of the observable area with $I_{[\textrm{CII}]} > 0.5$ K km s$^{-1}$. To determine
the physical properties of the [CII] emitting gas, we treat the [CII] emission as optically thin.
We find that the [CII] emission originates primarily from cold, moderate density gas ($40 \lesssim
T \lesssim 65$ K and $50 \lesssim n \lesssim 440$ cm$^{-3}$), composed mainly of atomic hydrogen
and with an effective visual extinction between $\sim 0.50$ and $\sim 0.91$. Gas dominated by molecular
hydrogen contributes only $\lesssim$20% of the total [CII] line emission. Thus, [CII] is not a good
tracer for CO-dark H$_2$ at this early phase in the cloud's lifetime. We also find that the total gas,
H and C$^+$ column densities are all correlated with the integrated [CII] line emission, with power
law slopes ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. Further, the median ratio between the total column density and
the [CII] line emission is $Y_{{\rm CII}}\approx 1.1 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$,
and $Y_{{\rm CII}}$ scales with $I_{[\textrm{CII}]}^{-0.3}$. We expect $Y_{{\rm CII}}$ to change
in environments with a lower or higher radiation field than simulated here.
