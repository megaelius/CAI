The study of the evolution of coronal holes (CHs) is especially important in the context of high-speed
solar wind streams (HSS) emanating from them. Stream interaction regions may deliver large amount
of energy into the Earths system, cause geomagnetic storms, and shape interplanetary space. By
statistically analysing 16 long-living CHs observed by the SDO, we focus on coronal, morphological
and underlying photospheric magnetic field characteristics as well as investigate the evolution
of the associated HSSs. We use CATCH to extract and analyse CHs using observations taken by AIA and
HMI. We derive changes in the CH properties and correlate them to the CH evolution. Further we analyse
the properties of the HSS signatures near 1au from OMNI data by manually extracting the peak bulk
velocity of the solar wind plasma. We find that the area evolution of CHs mostly shows a rough trend
of growing to a maximum followed by a decay. No correlation of the area evolution to the evolution
of the signed magnetic flux and signed magnetic flux density enclosed in the projected CH area was
found. From this we conclude that the magnetic flux within the extracted CH boundaries is not the
main cause for its area evolution. We derive CH area change rates (growth and decay) of 14.2 +/- 15.0
* 10^8 km^2/day showing a reasonable anti-correlation (cc =-0.48) to the solar activity, approximated
by the sunspot number. The change rates of the signed mean magnetic flux density (27.3 +/- 32.2 mG/day)
and the signed magnetic flux (30.3 +/- 31.5 * 10^18 Mx/day) were also found to be dependent on solar
activity (cc =0.50 and cc =0.69 respectively) rather than on the individual CH evolutions. Further
we find that the CH area-to-HSS peak velocity relation is valid for each CH over its evolution but
revealing significant variations in the slopes of the regression lines.
