We present the first photometric redshift distribution for a large unbiased sample of 870um selected
submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with robust identifications based on observations with the Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In our analysis we consider 96 SMGs in the Extended Chandra Deep Field
South, 77 of which have 4-19 band, optical-near-infrared, photometry. We model the Spectral Energy
Distributions (SEDs) for these 77 SMGs, deriving a median photometric redshift of z=2.3+/-0.1.
The remaining 19 SMGs have insufficient optical or near-infrared photometry to derive photometric
redshifts, but a stacking analysis of IRAC and Herschel observations confirms they are not spurious.
Assuming these sources have an absolute H-band magnitude distribution comparable to that of a complete
sample of z~1-2 SMGs, we demonstrate that the undetected SMGs lie at higher redshifts, raising the
median redshift for SMGs to z=2.5+/-0.2. More critically we show that the proportion of galaxies
undergoing an SMG phase at z>3 is 35+/-5% of the total population. We derive a median stellar mass
for SMGs of Mstar=(8+/-1)x10^10Mo, but caution that there are significant systematic uncertainties
in our stellar mass estimate, up to x5 for individual sources. We compare our sample of SMGs to a volume-limited,
morphologically classified sample of ellipticals in the local Universe. Assuming the star formation
activity in SMGs has a timescale of ~100Myr we show that their descendants at z~0 would have a space
density and M_H distribution which are in good agreement with those of local ellipticals. In addition
the inferred mass-weighted ages of the local ellipticals broadly agree with the look-back times
of the SMG events. Taken together, these results are consistent with a simple model that identifies
SMGs as events that form most of the stars seen in the majority of luminous elliptical galaxies at
the present day.
