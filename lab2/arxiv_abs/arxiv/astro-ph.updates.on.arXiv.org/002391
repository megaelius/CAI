Observations reveal a strong structural coupling between bulge and disc in S0 galaxies, which seems
difficult to explain if they have formed from supposedly catastrophic events such as major mergers.
We face this question by quantifying the bulge-disc coupling in dissipative simulations of major
and minor mergers that result in realistic S0s. We have studied the dissipative N-body binary merger
simulations from the GalMer database that give rise to realistic, relaxed E/S0 and S0 remnants (67
major and 29 minor mergers). We simulate surface brightness profiles of these S0-like remnants
in the K-band, mimicking typical observational conditions, to perform bulge-disc decompositions
analogous to those carried out in real S0s. The global bulge-disc structure of these remnants has
been compared with real data, and they distribute in the B/T - r_e - h_d parameter space consistently
with real bright S0s, where B/T is the bulge-to-total luminosity ratio, r_e is the bulge effective
radius, and h_d is the disc scalelength. Major mergers can rebuild a bulge-disc coupling in the remnants
after having destroyed the structures of the progenitors, whereas minor mergers directly preserve
them. Remnants exhibit B/T and r_e/h_d spanning a wide range of values, and their distribution is
consistent with observations. Many remnants have bulge Sersic indices ranging 1<n<2, flat
appearance, and contain residual star formation in embedded discs, a result which agrees with the
presence of pseudobulges in real S0s. Contrary to the popular view, mergers (and in particular,
major events) can result in S0 remnants with realistically coupled bulge-disc structures in less
than ~3 Gyr. In conclusion, the bulge-disc coupling and the presence of pseudobulges in real S0s
cannot be used as an argument against the possible major-merger origin of these galaxies.
