The multi-messenger observation of GW170817 has opened a new window into the Universe and proved
that neutron star mergers not only emit gravitational waves, but in addition, can give rise to a variety
of electromagnetic signatures in multiple wavelengths. Within the first half of the third observing
run of the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, there have been a number of gravitational wave candidates
of compact binary systems for which at least one component is potentially a neutron star. In this
article, we look at the candidates S190425z, S190426c, S190510g, S190901ap, and S190910h, predicted
to have potentially a non-zero remnant mass, in more detail. All these triggers have been followed
up with extensive campaigns by the astronomical community doing electromagnetic searches for
their optical counterparts, such as kilonovae. Furthermore, the events have not been retracted
by the LIGO and Virgo collaboration, however, according to the released classification, there
is a high probability that some of these events might not be of extraterrestrial origin. Assuming
that the triggers are caused by a compact binary coalescence, not due to noise, and that the individual
source locations have been covered during the EM follow-up campaigns, we employ three different
kilonova models and apply them to derive constraints on the matter ejection consistent with the
existing gravitational-wave trigger information but the non-existing kilonova. These upper
bounds on the ejecta mass can be related to limits on the maximum mass of the binary neutron star candidate
S190425z and to constraints on the mass-ratio, spin, and NS compactness for the potential black
hole-neutron star candidate S190426c. Our results show that deeper observations for future gravitational
wave events near the horizon limit of the advanced detectors are essential.
