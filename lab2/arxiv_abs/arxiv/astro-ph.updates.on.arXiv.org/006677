The role of galaxy mergers in fueling active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated, owing partly
to selection effects inherent to studies of the merger/AGN connection. In particular, luminous
AGN are often heavily obscured in late-stage mergers. Mid-infrared (IR) color selection of dust-enshrouded
AGN with, e.g., the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has uncovered large new populations
of obscured AGN. However, this method is sensitive mainly to AGN that dominate emission from the
host. To understand how these selection biases affect mid-IR studies of the merger/AGN connection,
we simulate the evolution of obscured AGN throughout galaxy mergers. Although mid-IR colors closely
trace luminous, obscured AGN, we show that nearly half of merger-triggered AGN are missed with common
mid-IR selection criteria, even in late-stage, gas-rich major mergers. At z < 0.5, where merger
signatures and dual nuclei can most easily be detected, we find that a more lenient W1-W2 > 0.5 cut
greatly improves completeness without significantly decreasing reliability. Extreme nuclear
starbursts are briefly able to mimic this AGN signature, but this is largely irrelevant in mergers,
where such starbursts are accompanied by AGN. We propose a two-color cut that yields high completeness
and reliability even in starbursting systems. Further, we show that mid-IR color selection very
effectively identifies dual AGN hosts, with the highest fraction at the smallest separations (<
3 kpc). Thus, many merger hosts of mid-IR AGN should contain unresolved dual AGN; these are ideal
targets for high-resolution follow-up, particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope.
