Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are amongst the fastest objects in our Milky Way. These stars are predicted
to come from the Galactic center (GC) and travel along unbound orbits across the Galaxy. In the coming
years, the ESA satellite Gaia will provide the most complete and accurate catalogue of the Milky
Way, with full astrometric parameters for more than $1$ billion stars. In this paper, we present
the expected sample size and properties (mass, magnitude, spatial, velocity distributions) of
HVSs in the Gaia stellar catalogue. We build three Gaia mock catalogues of HVSs anchored to current
observations, exploring different ejection mechanisms and GC stellar population properties.
In all cases, we predict hundreds to thousands of HVSs with precise proper motion measurements within
a few tens of kpc from us. For stars with a relative error in total proper motion below $10 \%$, the mass
range extends to ~$10 M_{\odot}$ but peaks at ~$1$ $M_\odot$. The majority of Gaia HVSs will therefore
probe a different mass and distance range compared to the current non-Gaia sample. In addition,
a subset of a few hundreds to a few thousands of HVSs with $M$ ~ $3$ $M_\odot$ will be bright enough to
have a precise measurement of the three-dimensional velocity from Gaia alone. Finally, we show
that Gaia will provide more precise proper motion measurements for the current sample of HVS candidates.
This will help identifying their birthplace narrowing down their ejection location, and confirming
or rejecting their nature as HVSs. Overall, our forecasts are extremely encouraging in terms of
quantity and quality of HVS data that can be exploited to constrain both the Milky Way potential and
the GC properties.
