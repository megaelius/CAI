The Galactic Center (GC) is dominated by the gravity of a super-massive black hole (SMBH), Sagittarius
A$^*$, and is suspected to contain a sizable population of binary stars. Such binaries form hierarchical
triples with the SMBH, undergoing Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) evolution, which can lead to high
eccentricity excitations for the binary companions' mutual orbit. This effect can lead to stellar
collisions or Roche-lobe crossings, as well as orbital shrinking due to tidal dissipation. In this
work we investigate the dynamical and stellar evolution of such binary systems, especially with
regards to the binaries' post-main-sequence evolution. We find that the majority of binaries (~75%)
is eventually separated into single stars, while the remaining binaries (~25%) undergo phases
of common-envelope evolution and/or stellar mergers. These objects can produce a number of different
exotic outcomes, including rejuvenated stars, G2-like infrared-excess objects, stripped giant
stars, Type Ia supernovae (SNe), cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotic binaries (SBs), or compact
object binaries. We estimate that, within a sphere of 250 Mpc radius, about 7.5 to 15 Type Ia SNe per
year should occur in galactic nuclei due to this mechanism, potentially detectable by ZTF and ASAS-SN.
Likewise we estimate that, within a sphere of 1 Gpc$^3$ volume, about 10 to 20 compact object binaries
form per year that could become gravitational wave sources. Based on results of EKL-driven compact
object binary mergers in galactic nuclei by Hoang at al. (2018), this compact object binary formation
rate translates to about 15 to 30 events per year detectable by Advanced LIGO.
