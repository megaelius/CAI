Most major planetary bodies in the solar system rotate in the same direction as their orbital motion:
their spin is prograde. Theoretical studies to explain the direction as well as the magnitude of
the spin vector have had mixed success. When the accreting building blocks are $\sim$ km-size planetesimals
-- as predicted by the classical model -- the accretion process is so symmetric that it cancels out
prograde with retrograde spin contributions, rendering the net spin minute. For this reason, the
currently-favored model for the origin of planetary rotation is the giant impact model, in which
a single collision suffices to deliver a spin, which magnitude is close to the breakup rotation rate.
However, the giant impact model does not naturally explain the preference for prograde spin. Similarly,
an increasing number of spin-vector measurement of asteroids also shows that the spin vector of
large (primordial) asteroids is not isotropic. Here, we re-assess the viability of smaller particles
to bestow planetary bodies with a net spin, focusing on the pebble accretion model in which gas drag
and gravity join forces to accrete small particles at a large cross section. Similar to the classical
calculation for planetesimals, we integrate the pebble equation of motion and measure the angular
momentum transfer at impact. We consider a variety of disk conditions and pebble properties and
conduct our calculations in the limits of 2D (planar) and 3D (homogeneous) pebble distributions.
We find that in certain regions of the parameter space the angular momentum transfer is significant,
much larger than with planetesimals and on par with or exceeding the current spin of planetary bodies.
