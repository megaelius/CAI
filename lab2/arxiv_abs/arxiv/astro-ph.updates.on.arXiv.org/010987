We present a new cosmological, magnetohydrodynamical simulation for galaxy formation: TNG50,
the third and final installment of the IllustrisTNG project. TNG50 evolves 2x2160^3 dark-matter
particles and gas cells in a volume 50 comoving Mpc across. It hence reaches a numerical resolution
typical of zoom-in simulations, with a baryonic element mass of 8.5x10^4 Msun and an average cell
size of 70-140 parsecs in the star-forming regions of galaxies. Simultaneously, TNG50 samples
~700 (6,500) galaxies with stellar masses above 10^10 (10^8) Msun at z=1. Here we investigate the
structural and kinematical evolution of star-forming galaxies across cosmic time (0 < z < 6). We
quantify their sizes, disk heights, 3D shapes, and degree of rotational vs. dispersion-supported
motions as traced by rest-frame V-band light (i.e. roughly stellar mass) and by Halpha light (i.e.
star-forming and dense gas). The unprecedented resolution of TNG50 enables us to model galaxies
with sub-kpc half-light radii and with <300-pc disk heights. Coupled with the large-volume statistics,
we characterize a diverse, redshift- and mass-dependent structural and kinematical morphological
mix of galaxies all the way to early epochs. Our model predicts that for star-forming galaxies the
fraction of disk-like morphologies, based on 3D stellar shapes, increases with both cosmic time
and galaxy stellar mass. Gas kinematics reveal that the vast majority of 10^9-11.5 Msun star-forming
galaxies are rotationally-supported disks for most cosmic epochs (Vmax/sigma>2-3, z<5), being
dynamically hotter at earlier epochs (z>1.5). Despite large velocity dispersion at high redshift,
cold and dense gas in galaxies predominantly arranges in disky or elongated shapes at all times and
masses; these gaseous components exhibit rotationally-dominated motions far exceeding the collisionless
stellar bodies.
