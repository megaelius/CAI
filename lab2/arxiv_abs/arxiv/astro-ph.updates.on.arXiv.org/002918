The Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) is a large spectroscopic survey that provides a unique opportunity to
study the distribution of spectroscopic multiple systems among different populations of the Galaxy.
We aim at detecting binarity/multiplicity for stars targeted by the GES from the analysis of the
cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of the GES spectra with spectral templates. We develop a method
based on the computation of the CCF successive derivatives to detect multiple peaks and determine
their radial velocities, even when the peaks are strongly blended. The parameters of the detection
of extrema (DOE) code have been optimized for each GES GIRAFFE and UVES setup to maximize detection.
This code therefore allows to automatically detect multiple line spectroscopic binaries (SBn,
n>1). We apply this method on the fourth GES internal data release and detect 354 SBn candidates (342
SB2, 11 SB3 and even one SB4), including only 9 SB2 known in the literature. This implies that about
98% of these SBn candidates are new (because of their faint visual magnitude that can reach V=19).
Visual inspection of the SBn candidate spectra reveals that the most probable candidates have indeed
a composite spectrum. Among SB2 candidates, an orbital solution could be computed for two previously
unknown binaries: 06404608+0949173 (known as V642 Mon) in NGC 2264 and 19013257-0027338 in Berkeley
81. A detailed analysis of the unique SB4 (four peaks in the CCF) reveals that HD 74438 in the open cluster
IC 2391 is a physically bound stellar quadruple system. The SB candidates belonging to stellar clusters
are reviewed in detail to discard false detections. We warn against the use of atmospheric parameters
for these system components rather than by SB-specific pipelines. Our implementation of an automatic
detection of spectroscopic binaries within the GES has allowed an efficient discovery of many new
multiple systems.
