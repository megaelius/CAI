We describe the SDSS-IV MaNGA PyMorph Photometric (MPP-VAC) and MaNGA Deep Learning Morphology
(MDLM-VAC) Value Added Catalogs. The MPP-VAC provides photometric parameters from S\'ersic and
S\'ersic+Exponential fits to the 2D surface brightness profiles of the MaNGA DR15 galaxy sample.
Compared to previous PyMorph analyses of SDSS imaging, our analysis of the MaNGA DR15 incorporates
three improvements: the most recent SDSS images; modified criteria for determining bulge-to-disk
decompositions; and the fits in MPP-VAC have been eye-balled, and re-fit if necessary, for additional
reliability. A companion catalog, the MDLM-VAC, provides Deep Learning-based morphological
classifications for the same galaxies. The MDLM-VAC includes a number of morphological properties
(e.g., a TType, and a finer separation between elliptical and S0 galaxies). Combining the MPP- and
MDLM-VACs allows to show that the MDLM morphological classifications are more reliable than previous
work. It also shows that single-S\'ersic fits to late- and early-type galaxies are likely to return
S\'ersic indices of $n \le 2$ and $\ge 4$, respectively, and this correlation between $n$ and morphology
extends to the bulge component as well. While the former is well-known, the latter contradicts some
recent work suggesting little correlation between $n$-bulge and morphology. Combining both VACs
with MaNGA's spatially resolved spectroscopy allows us to study how the stellar angular momentum
depends on morphological type. We find correlations between stellar kinematics, photometric
properties, and morphological type even though the spectroscopic data played no role in the construction
of the MPP- and MDLM-VACs.
