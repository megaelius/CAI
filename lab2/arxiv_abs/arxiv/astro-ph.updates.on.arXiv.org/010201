We combine sophisticated high precision scattering experiments, together with results from the
Millenium-II simulation, to compute the cosmic merger rate of bound compact object (CO) binaries
dynamically interacting with supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). We consider binaries
composed of white dwarfs (WDs), neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). The overall merger rates
for WD-WD, NS-NS, BH-BH, BH-NS binaries and EBBH (eccentric binaries of black holes) from redshift
$\sim 5$ are found to be $4.32\times 10^3\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$($5.93\times10^2\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for
Type Ia SNe), $82.7\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $96.3\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, $13.1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and $148\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$ , respectively, for a nominal CO binary fraction in the Galactic centre of 0.1. We calculate
the distance ($R$) distribution of the merger sites with respect to the host galaxies of the binaries.
The distribution shows a wide range of distances up to $\sim$Mpc; this tail is produced by escaped
hyper-velocity CO binaries. Due to the differences in the matter density of the surrounding environment,
merger events with different $R$ are expected to display significantly different signatures in
their EM counterparts. In particular, merger events (and especially NS-NS) producing a relativistic
jet but occurring in the intergalactic medium will have very weak afterglow radiation relative
to their prompt emission. These events, which we call 'off-center', can only be produced from a close
encounter between CO binaries and SMBHBs; hence the detection of such merger events would indicate
the existence of nearby SMBHBs, and in particular with high mass ratio, produced in the aftermath
of a major galaxy merger.
