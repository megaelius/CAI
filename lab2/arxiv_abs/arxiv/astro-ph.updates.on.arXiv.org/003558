We perform a detailed analysis of the covariance matrix of the spherically averaged galaxy power
spectrum and present a new, practical method for estimating this within an arbitrary survey without
the need for running mock galaxy simulations that cover the full survey volume. The method uses theoretical
arguments to modify the covariance matrix measured from a set of small-volume cubic galaxy simulations,
which are computationally cheap to produce compared to larger simulations and match the measured
small-scale galaxy clustering more accurately than is possible using theoretical modelling.
We include prescriptions to analytically account for the window function of the survey, which convolves
the measured covariance matrix in a non-trivial way. We also present a new method to include the effects
of supersample covariance and modes outside the small simulation volume which requires no additional
simulations and still allows us to scale the covariance matrix. As validation, we compare the covariance
matrix estimated using our new method to that from a brute force calculation using 500 simulations
originally created for analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample (SDSS-MGS).
We find excellent agreement on all scales of interest for large scale structure analysis, including
those dominated by the effects of the survey window, and on scales where theoretical models of the
clustering normally break-down, but the new method produces a covariance matrix with significantly
better signal-to-noise. Although only formally correct in real-space, we also discuss how our
method can be extended to incorporate the effects of Redshift Space Distortions.
