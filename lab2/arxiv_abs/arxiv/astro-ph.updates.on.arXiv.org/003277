The interstellar medium (ISM) is a magnetised system in which transonic or supersonic turbulence
is driven by supernova explosions. This leads to the production of intermittent, filamentary structures
in the ISM gas density, whilst the associated dynamo action also produces intermittent magnetic
fields. The traditional theory of random functions, restricted to second-order statistical moments
(or power spectra), does not adequately describe such systems. We apply topological data analysis
(TDA), sensitive to all statistical moments and independent of the assumption of Gaussian statistics,
to the gas density fluctuations in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the multi-phase ISM.
This simulation admits dynamo action, so produces physically realistic magnetic fields. The topology
of the gas distribution, with and without magnetic fields, is quantified in terms of Betti numbers
and persistence diagrams. Like the more standard correlation analysis, TDA shows that the ISM gas
density is sensitive to the presence of magnetic fields. However, TDA gives us important additional
information that cannot be obtained from correlation functions. In particular, the Betti numbers
per correlation cell are shown to be physically informative. Magnetic fields make the ISM more homogeneous,
reducing the abundance of both isolated gas clouds and cavities, with a stronger effect on the cavities.
Remarkably, the modification of the gas distribution by magnetic fields is captured by the Betti
numbers even in regions more than 300 pc from the midplane, where the magnetic field is weaker and
correlation analysis fails to detect any signatures of magnetic effects.
