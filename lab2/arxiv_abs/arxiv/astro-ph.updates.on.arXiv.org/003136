Determination of high precision and high accuracy abundances has and will always be an important
goal of spectroscopic studies. The abundance of iron plays a special role as it is a pre-requisite
to many chemical abundance analyses. We investigate the role of hydrogen collisions in NLTE spectral
line synthesis, and introduce a new empirical recipe to determine inelastic charge transfer and
bound-bound hydrogen collisional rates. This recipe is based on fitting the calculated quantum
rates of several elements (Be I, Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I and Ca I), and extrapolating the fit functional
dependence with energy to the iron case. We call this recipe the Quantum Fitting Method (QFM). The
QFM was first tested on silicon, before being applied to iron. A new iron model atom was developed.
The fitting coefficients for the iron QFM were developed using three benchmark stars at various
metallicities (the Sun, Arcturus and HD140283). We could derive a consistent set of QFM fitting
parameters for the three benchmark stars. We found that the charge exchange collisional rates dominate
the NLTE effects in iron. Fe I and Fe II abundances were calculated for a sample of 24 benchmark stars
with well-determined non-spectroscopic fundamental parameters. Our results are in good agreement
with recent 1D and 3D NLTE analyses of metal-poor stars using yet unpublished quantum data for H-collisions.
Our empirical quantum fitting method for estimating hydrogen collision rates appears as an alternative
to the widely used Drawin approximation. It could be extended to other elements for which quantum
calculations do not yet exist.
