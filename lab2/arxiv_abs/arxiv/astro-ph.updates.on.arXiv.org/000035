The Kepler Mission was designed to measure the frequency of Earth-size planets in the habitable
zone of Sun-like stars. A crucial component for recovering the underlying planet population from
a sample of detected planets is understanding the completeness of that sample - what fraction of
the planets that could have been discovered in a given data set were actually detected. Here we outline
the information required to determine the sample completeness, and describe an experiment to address
a specific aspect of that question, which is the issue of transit signal recovery. We investigate
the extent to which the Kepler pipeline preserves individual transit signals by injecting simulated
transits into the pixel-level data, processing the modified pixels through the pipeline, and comparing
the measured transit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to that expected without perturbation by the
pipeline. We inject simulated transit signals across the full focal plane for a set of observations
of length 89 days. On average, we find that the SNR of the injected signal is recovered at MS = 0.9973(+/-0.0012)xBS-0.0151(+/-0.0049),
where MS is the measured SNR and BS is the baseline, or expected, SNR. The 1{\sigma} width of the distribution
around this correlation is +/-2.64%. We discuss the pipeline processes that cause the measured
SNR to deviate significantly from the baseline SNR; these are primarily the handling of data adjacent
to spacecraft re-pointings and the removal of harmonics prior to the measurement of the SNR. Finally
we outline the further work required to characterise the completeness of the Kepler pipeline.
