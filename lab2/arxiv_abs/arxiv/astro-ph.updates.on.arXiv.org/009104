(abridged) Observing the signature of accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM) onto galaxies
at z~3 requires the detection of faint (L<<L*) galaxies embedded in a filamentary matrix of low-density,
metal-poor gas coherent over hundreds of kpc. We study the gaseous environment of three Lyman$\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) at z=2.7-2.8, found to be aligned in projection with a background QSO over ~250 kpc
along the slit of a long-slit spectrum. The lack of detection of the LAEs in deep continuum images
and the low inferred Ly$\alpha$ luminosities show the LAEs to be intrinsically faint, low-mass
galaxies (L<0.1 L*, M_star< 0.1 M*). An echelle spectrum of the QSO reveals strong Ly-alpha absorption
within $\pm200$ km/s from the LAEs. Our absorption line analysis leads to HI column densities in
the range of log N(HI) =16-18. Associated absorption from ionic metal species CIV and SiIV constrains
the gas metallicities to ~0.01 solar if the gas is optically thin, and possibly as low as ~0.001 solar
if the gas is optically thick, assuming photoionization equilibrium. While the inferred metallicities
are at least a factor of ten lower than expected metallicities in the interstellar medium (ISM) of
these LAEs, they are consistent with the observed chemical enrichment level in the IGM at the same
epoch. Total metal abundances and kinematic arguments suggest that these faint galaxies have not
been able to affect the properties of their surrounding gas. The projected spatial alignment of
the LAEs, together with the kinematic quiescence and correspondence between the LAEs and absorbing
gas in velocity space suggests that these observations probe a possible filamentary structure.
Taken together with the blue-dominant Ly$\alpha$ emission line profile of one of the objects, the
evidence suggests that the absorbing gas is part of an accretion stream of low-metallicity gas in
the IGM.
