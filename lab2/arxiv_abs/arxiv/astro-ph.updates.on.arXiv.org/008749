After the Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) of a star around a SuperMassive Black Hole (SMBH), the bound
stellar debris rapidly forms an accretion disk. If the accretion disk is not aligned with the spinning
SMBH's equatorial plane, the disk will be driven into Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH's
spin axis, possibly affecting the TDE's light curve. We carry out an eigenmode analysis of such a
disk to understand how the disk's warp structure, precession, and inclination evolution are influenced
by the disk's accretion rate and viscosity, as well as the SMBH's mass and spin. We find the TDE disk
has a warp profile that is generally more tilted out of the SMBH's equatorial plane at the inner radius
than the outer radius, and an oscillatory warp may develop as a result of strong non-Keplarian motion
near the SMBH. The global disk precession frequency matches the Lense-Thirring precession frequency
of a rigid disk around a spinning black hole within a factor of a few when the disk's accretion rate
is high, but deviates significantly at low accretion rates. Viscosity aligns the disk with the SMBH's
equatorial plane within a few years for high accretion rates, but within a few days to months for low
accretion rates. We also examine the effect of fall-back material on the warp evolution of TDE disks,
and find that the fall-back torque aligns the TDE disk with the SMBH's equatorial plane in a few to
tens of days for the parameter space investigated. Our results place constraints on models of TDE
emission which rely on the changing disk orientation with respect to the line of sight to explain
observations.
