A spinning neutron star (NS) that is asymmetric with respect to its spin axis can emit continuous
gravitational wave (GW) signals. The spin frequencies and their distribution of radio MSPs and
accreting MSPs provide some evidences of GW radiation, and MSPs are ideal probes detecting high
frequency GW signals. It is generally thought that millisecond pulsars (MSPs) originate from the
recycled process, in which the NS accretes the material and angular momentum from the donor star.
The accreted matter would be confined at the polar cap zone by an equatorial belt of compressed magnetic
field fixed in the deep crust of the NS, and yields "magnetic mountain". Based on an assumption that
the spin-down rates of the transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038 and three redbacks are the combinational
contribution of the accretion torque, the propeller torque, and the GW radiation torque, in this
work we attempt to constrain the ellipticities of MSPs with observed spin-down rates. Assuming
some canonical parameters of neutron stars, the ellipticities of three transitional MSPs and ten
redbacks are estimated to be $\epsilon=(0.9-23.4)\times 10^{-9}$. The electrical resistivities
of three transitional MSPs are also derived to be in the range $\eta=(1.2-15.3)\times 10^{-31}~\rm
s$, which display an ideal power law relation with the accretion rate. The characteristic strains
($h_{\rm c}=(0.6-2.5)\times10^{-27}$) of GW signals emitting by these sources are obviously
beyond the sensitivity scope of the aLIGO. We expect that the third-generation GW detectors like
the Einstein Telescope can seize the GW signals from these sources in the future.
