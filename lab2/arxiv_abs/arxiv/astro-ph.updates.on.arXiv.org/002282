We present N-body simulations of planetary system formation in thermally-evolving, viscous disc
models. The simulations incorporate type I migration (including corotation torques and their
saturation), gap formation, type II migration, gas accretion onto planetary cores, and gas disc
dispersal through photoevaporation. The aim is to examine whether or not the oligarchic growth
scenario, when combined with self-consistent disc models and up-to-date prescriptions for disc-driven
migration, can produce planetary systems similar to those that have been observed. The results
correlate with the initial disc mass. Low mass discs form close-packed systems of terrestrial-mass
planets and super-Earths. Higher mass discs form multiple generations of planets, with masses
in the range 10 < mp < 45M_Earth. These planets generally type I migrate into the inner disc,
because of corotation torque saturation, where they open gaps and type II migrate into the central
star. Occasionally, a final generation of low-to-intermediate mass planets forms and survives
due to gas disc dispersal. No surviving gas giants were formed in our simulations. Analysis shows
that these planets can only survive migration if a core forms and experiences runaway gas accretion
at orbital radii r > 10 au prior to the onset of type II migration. We conclude that planet growth
above masses mp > 10M_Earth during the gas disc life time leads to corotation torque saturation
and rapid inward migration, preventing the formation and survival of gas giants. This result is
in contrast to the success in forming gas giant planets displayed by some population synthesis models.
This discrepancy arises, in part, because the type II migration prescription adopted in the population
synthesis models causes too large a reduction in the migration speed when in the planet dominated
regime.
