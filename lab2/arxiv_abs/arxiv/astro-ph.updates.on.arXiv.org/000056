As the 50th anniversary of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) draws near, the author
was surprised to learn that the published latitude and longitude for CTIO in the Astronomical Almanac
and iraf observatory database appears to differ from modern GPS-measured geodetic positions by
nearly a kilometer. Surely, the position for CTIO could not be in error after five decades? The source
of the discrepancy appears to be due to the ~30" difference between the astronomical and geodetic
positions -- a systematic effect due to vertical deflection first reported by Harrington, Mintz
Blanco, & Blanco (1972). Since the astronomical position is not necessarily the desired quantity
for some calculations, and since the number of facilities on Cerro Tololo and neighboring Cerro
Pachon has grown considerably over the years, I decided to measure accurate geodetic positions
for all of the observatories and some select landmarks on the two peaks using GPS and Google Earth.
Both sets of measurements were inter-compared, and externally compared to a high accuracy geodetic
position for a NASA Space Geodesy Program survey monument on Tololo. I conclude that Google Earth
can currently be used to determine absolute geodetic positions (i.e. compared to GPS) accurate
to roughly +-0.15" (+-5 m) in latitude and longitude without correction, or approximately +-0".10
(+-3 m) with correction. I tabulate final geodetic and geocentric positions on the WGS-84 coordinate
system for all astronomical observatories on Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon with accuracy +-0".1
(+-3 m). One surprise is that an oft-cited position for LSST is in error by 9.4 km and the quoted elevation
is in error by 500 m.
