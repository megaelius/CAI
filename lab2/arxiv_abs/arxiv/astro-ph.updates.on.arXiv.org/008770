Consistent modeling of protoplanetary disks requires the simultaneous solution of both continuum
and line radiative transfer, heating/cooling balance between dust and gas and, of course, chemistry.
Such models depend on panchromatic observations that can provide a complete description of the
physical and chemical properties and energy balance of protoplanetary systems. Along these lines
we present a homogeneous, panchromatic collection of data on a sample of 85 T Tauri and Herbig Ae objects
for which data cover a range from X-rays to centimeter wavelengths. Datasets consist of photometric
measurements, spectra, along with results from the data analysis such as line fluxes from atomic
and molecular transitions. Additional properties resulting from modeling of the sources such
as disc mass and shape parameters. dust size and PAH properties are also provided for completeness.
Targets were selected based on their properties data availability. Data from more than 50 different
telescopes and facilities were retrieved and combined in homogeneous datasets directly from public
data archives or after being extracted from more than 100 published articles. X-ray data for a subset
of 56 sources represent an exception as they were reduced from scratch and are presented here for
the first time. Compiled datasets along with a subset of continuum and emission-line models are
stored in a dedicated database and distributed through a publicly accessible online system. All
datasets contain metadata descriptors that allow to backtrack them to their original resources.
The graphical user interface of the online system allows the user to visually inspect individual
objects but also compare between datasets and models. It also offers to the user the possibility
to download any of the stored data and metadata for further processing.
