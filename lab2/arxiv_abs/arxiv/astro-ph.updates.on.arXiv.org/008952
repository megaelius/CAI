TESS is revolutionising the search for planets orbiting bright and nearby stars. In sectors 3 and
4, TESS observed TOI-402 (TIC-120896927), a bright V=9.1 K1 dwarf also known as HD 15337, and found
two transiting signals with period of 4.76 and 17.18 days and radius of 1.90 and 2.21\,\Rearth. This
star was observed as part of the radial-velocity search for planets using the HARPS spectrometer,
and 85 precise radial-velocity measurements were obtained over a period of 14 years. In this paper,
we analyse the HARPS radial-velocity measurements in hand to confirm the planetary nature of these
two signals. By reanalysing TESS photometry and host star parameters using EXOFASTv2, we find that
TOI-402.01 and TOI-402.02 have periods of 4.75642$\pm$0.00021 and 17.1784$\pm$0.0016 days and
radii of 1.70$\pm$0.06 and 2.52$\pm$0.11\,\Rearth\,(precision 3.6 and 4.2\%), respectively.
By analysing the HARPS radial-velocity measurements, we find that those planets are both super-Earths
with masses of 7.20$\pm$0.81 and 8.79$\pm$1.67\,\Mearth\,(precision 11.3 and 19.0\%), and small
eccentricities compatible with zero at 2$\sigma$. Although having rather similar masses, the
radius of these two planets is really different, putting them on different sides of the radius gap.
With stellar irradiation 160 times more important than Earth for TOI-402.01 and only 29 times more
for TOI-402.02, it is likely that photo-evaporation is at the origin of this radius difference.
Those two planets, being in the same system and therefore being in the same irradiation environment
are therefore extremely important to perform comparative exoplanetology across the evaporation
valley and thus bring constraints on the mechanisms responsible for the radius gap.
