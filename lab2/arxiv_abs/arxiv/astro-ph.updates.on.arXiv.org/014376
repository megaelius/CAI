The discrepancy between estimates of the Hubble Constant ($H_0$) measured from local ($z \lesssim
0.1$) scales and from scales of the sound horizon is a crucial problem in modern cosmology. Peculiar
velocities ($v_{pec}$) of standard candle distance indicators can systematically affect local
$H_0$ measurements. We here use 2MRS galaxies to measure the local galaxy density field, finding
a notable $z$ < 0.05 under-density in the SGC-6dFGS region of 27 $\pm$ 2 %. However, no strong evidence
for a 'Local Void' pertaining to the full 2MRS sky coverage is found. Galaxy densities are used to
measure a density parameter, $\Delta \phi_{+-}$, which we introduce as a proxy for $v_{pec}$ which
quantifies density gradients along a SN line-of-sight. $\Delta \phi_{+-}$ is found to correlate
with local $H_0$ estimates from 171 Pantheon & Union 2.1 SNeIa (0.02 < $z$ < 0.05). Density structures
on scales of $\sim$ 50 Mpc are found to correlate strongest with $H_0$ estimates in both the observational
data and in mock data from the MDPL2-Galacticus simulation. Using trends of $H_0$ with $\Delta \phi_{+-}$,
we can correct for the effects of density structure on local $H_0$ estimates, even in the presence
of biased $v_{pec}$. However, for these observational data we reveal a < 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$
difference in the sample mean estimate from $v_{pec}$ corrections. Our best estimate is then 73.0
km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Using the mock data, the systematic uncertainty on these corrections is
estimated to be 0.26 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The dominant source of uncertainty in our estimate
instead relates to Cepheid-based calibrations of distance moduli (2.0 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$).
In summary, corrections for $v_{pec}$ in SNIa environments cannot resolve the tension between
local and CMB-derived $H_0$ estimates.
