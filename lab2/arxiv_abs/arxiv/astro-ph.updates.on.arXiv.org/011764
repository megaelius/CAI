After its formation, a young star spends some time traversing the molecular cloud complex in which
it was born. It is therefore not unlikely that, well after the initial cloud collapse event which
produced the star, it will encounter one or more low mass cloud fragments, which we call "cloudlets"
to distinguish them from full-fledged molecular clouds. Some of this cloudlet material may accrete
onto the star+disk system, while other material may fly by in a hyperbolic orbit. In contrast to the
original cloud collapse event, this process will be a "cloudlet flyby" and/or "cloudlet capture"
event: A Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton type accretion event, driven by the relative velocity between
the star and the cloudlet. As we will show in this paper, if the cloudlet is small enough and has an impact
parameter similar or less than $GM_{*}/v^2_\infty$ (with $v_\infty$ being the approach velocity),
such a flyby and/or capture event would lead to arc-shaped or tail-shaped reflection nebulosity
near the star. Those shapes of reflection nebulosity can be seen around several transitional disks
and FU Orionis stars. Although the masses in the those arcs appears to be much less than the disk masses
in these sources, we speculate that higher-mass cloudlet capture events may also happen occasionally.
If so, they may lead to the tilting of the outer disk, because the newly infalling matter will have
an angular momentum orientation entirely unrelated to that of the disk. This may be one possible
explanation for the highly warped/tilted inner/outer disk geometries found in several transitional
disks. We also speculate that such events, if massive enough, may lead to FU Orionis outbursts.
