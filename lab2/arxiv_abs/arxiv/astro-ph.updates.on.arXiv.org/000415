We present a 2D study of the internal extinction on (sub)kiloparsec scales of a sample of local (z<0.1)
(U)LIRGs, based on near-infrared Pa_a, Br_d, and Br_g line ratios, obtained with VLT-SINFONI integral-field
spectroscopy. The 2D extinction (Av) distributions of the objects, map regions of ~3x3 kpc (LIRGs)
and ~12x12 kpc (ULIRGs), with average angular resolutions (FWHM) of ~0.2 kpc and ~0.9 kpc, respectively.
The individual Av galaxy distributions indicate a very clumpy dust structure already on sub-kiloparsec
scales, with values (per spaxel) ranging from Av ~ 1 to 20 mag in LIRGs, and from Av ~ 2 to 15 mag in ULIRGs.
As a class, the median values of the distributions are Av=5.3 mag and Av=6.5 mag for the LIRG and ULIRG
subsamples, respectively. We evaluated the effects of the galaxy distance in the measurements
of the extinction as a function of the linear scale (in kpc) of the spaxel (i.e. due to the limited angular
resolution of the observations). If the distribution of the gas/dust and star-forming regions
in local LIRGs (63 Mpc, 40 pc/spaxel on average) is the same for galaxies at greater distances, the
observed median Av values based on emission line ratios would be a factor ~0.8 lower at the average
distance of our ULIRG sample (328 Mpc, 0.2 kpc/spaxel), and a factor ~0.67 for galaxies located at
distances of more than 800 Mpc (0.4 kpc/spaxel). This distance effect would have implications for
deriving the intrinsic extinction in high-z star-forming galaxies and for subsequent properties
such as star formation rate, star formation surface density, and KS- law, based on H_alpha line fluxes.
If local LIRGs are analogues of the main-sequence star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances,
the extinction values (Av) derived from the observed emission lines in these high-z sources would
need to be increased by a factor 1.4 on average.
