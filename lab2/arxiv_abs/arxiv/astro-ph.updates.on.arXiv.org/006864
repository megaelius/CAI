The kilonova emission observed following the binary neutron star merger event GW170817 provided
the first direct evidence for the synthesis of heavy nuclei through the rapid neutron capture process
(r-process). The late-time transition in the spectral energy distribution to near-infrared wavelengths
was interpreted as indicating the production of lanthanide nuclei, with atomic mass number $A\gtrsim
140$. However, compelling evidence for the presence of even heavier third-peak ($A\sim 195$) r-process
elements (e.g., gold, platinum) or translead nuclei remains elusive. At early times (~ days) most
of the r-process heating arises from a large statistical ensemble of $\beta$-decays, which thermalize
efficiently while the ejecta is still dense, generating a heating rate that is reasonably approximated
by a single power-law. However, at later times of weeks to months, the decay energy input can also
be dominated by a discrete number of $\alpha$-decays, $^{223}$Ra (half-life $t_{1/2} = 11.43$
d), $^{225}$Ac ($t_{1/2} = 10.0$ d, following the $\beta$-decay of $^{225}$Ra with $t_{1/2} =14.9$
d), and the fissioning isotope $^{254}$Cf ($t_{1/2} = 60.5$ d), which liberate more energy per decay
and thermalize with greater efficiency than beta-decay products. Late-time nebular observations
of kilonovae which constrain the radioactive power provide the potential to identify signatures
of these individual isotopes, thus confirming the production of heavy nuclei. In order to constrain
the bolometric light to the required accuracy, multi-epoch and wide-band observations are required
with sensitive instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope. In addition, we show how a precise
determination of the r-process contribution to the $^{72}$Ge abundance in the Solar System sheds
light on whether neutron star mergers can account for the full range of Solar r-process abundances.
