The ketenyl radical, HCCO, has recently been detected in the ISM for the first time. Further astronomical
detections of HCCO will help us understand its gas-grain chemistry, and subsequently revise the
oxygen-bearing chemistry towards dark clouds. Moreover, its deuterated counterpart, DCCO, has
never been observed in the ISM. HCCO and DCCO still lack a broad spectroscopic investigation, although
they exhibit a significant astrophysical relevance. In this work we aim to measure the pure rotational
spectra of the ground state of HCCO and DCCO in the millimeter and submillimeter region, considerably
extending the frequency range covered by previous studies. The spectral acquisition was performed
using a frequency-modulation absorption spectrometer between 170 and 650 GHz. The radicals were
produced in a low-density plasma generated from a select mixture of gaseous precursors. For each
isotopologue we were able to detect and assign more than 100 rotational lines. The new lines have
significantly enhanced the previous data set allowing the determination of highly precise rotational
and centrifugal distortion parameters. In our analysis we have taken into account the interaction
between the ground electronic state and a low-lying excited state (Renner-Teller pair) which enables
the prediction and assignment of rotational transitions with $K_a$ up to 4. The present set of spectroscopic
parameters provides highly accurate, millimeter and submillimeter rest-frequencies of HCCO
and DCCO for future astronomical observations. We also show that towards the pre-stellar core L1544,
ketenyl peaks in the region where $c$-$\mathrm{C_3H_2}$ peaks, suggesting that HCCO follows a
predominant hydrocarbon chemistry, as already proposed by recent gas-grain chemical models.
