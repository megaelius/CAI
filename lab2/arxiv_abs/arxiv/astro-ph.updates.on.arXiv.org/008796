Parametric models for galaxy star-formation histories (SFHs) are widely used, though they are
known to impose strong priors on physical parameters. This has consequences for measurements of
the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF), star-formation-rate density (SFRD) and star-forming
main sequence (SFMS). We investigate the effects of the exponentially declining, delayed exponentially
declining, lognormal and double power law SFH models using BAGPIPES. We demonstrate that each of
these models imposes strong priors on specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), potentially biasing
the SFMS, and also imposes a strong prior preference for young stellar populations. We show that
stellar mass, SFR and mass-weighted age inferences from high-quality mock photometry vary with
the choice of SFH model by at least 0.1, 0.3 and 0.2 dex respectively. However the biases with respect
to the true values depend more on the true SFH shape than the choice of model. We also demonstrate that
photometric data cannot discriminate between SFH models, meaning it is important to perform independent
tests to find well-motivated priors. We finally fit a low-redshift, volume-complete sample of
galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey with each model. We demonstrate that our
stellar masses and SFRs at redshift, $z\sim0.05$ are consistent with other analyses. However,
our inferred cosmic SFRDs peak at $z\sim0.4$, approximately 6 Gyr later than direct observations
suggest, meaning our mass-weighted ages are significantly underestimated. This makes the use
of parametric SFH models for understanding mass assembly in galaxies challenging. In a companion
paper we consider non-parametric SFH models.
