We analyze seven NICER and NuSTAR epochs of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 in the low-hard state
during its two most recent hard-only outbursts in 2017 and 2019. These observations cover the $0.1-300$
keV unabsorbed luminosities from $0.9\%-5.7\%$ of the Eddington limit. With NICER's negligible
pile-up, high count rate and unprecedented time resolution, we can perform simultaneous spectral
modeling and timing analysis on the same observations. Implementing a standard reflection model
including thermal disk, continuum emission, and both relativistic and distant reflections using
the relxillCp and xillverCp flavor, we perform a simultaneous fit for all observations. During
the rise in 2017, we see clear evidence that as the inner radius of the accretion disk moves inwards
($>49$ to $<2R_g$), the unscattered flux contribution from the thermal disk component increases
along with the disk temperature, the disk becomes more ionized, and the reflection fraction also
increases. We see a hint of hysteresis effect at $\sim0.8\%$ of Eddington: while mild truncation
($\sim5R_g$) is found in the decay, the inner radius is significantly more truncated in the rise
($>49R_{g}$). In our 4 epochs reaching $L>4\%L_{\rm Edd}$, the truncation level is small with $R_{\rm
in}\le10R_g$. At higher frequencies ($2-7$ Hz) in the highest luminosity epoch, a soft lag is present,
whose energy dependence reveals a thermal reverberation lag, with an amplitude similar to previous
finding for this source. We also discuss the plausibility of the hysteresis effect and the controversy
of disk truncation from spectral and timing analysis.
