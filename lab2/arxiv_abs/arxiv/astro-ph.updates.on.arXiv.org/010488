Exterior of ice lines in protoplanetary discs solid particles can grow by direct vapour deposition.
The presence of microscopic silicate particles may nevertheless hinder growth to large pebbles,
since the available vapour is deposited predominantly on the small grains that dominate the total
surface area. Experiments on heterogeneous ice nucleation, performed to understand ice clouds
in the martian atmosphere, show that the formation of a new ice layer on a silicate surface requires
a substantially higher water vapour pressure than the deposition of water vapour on an existing
ice surface. In this paper, we investigate how the difference in partial vapour pressure needed
for deposition of vapour on water ice vs. heterogeneous ice nucleation on silicate grains influence
particle growth close to the water ice line. We develop and test a dynamical 1D deposition and sublimation
model, where we include radial drift, sedimentation and diffusion in a turbulent protoplanetary
disc. We find that vapour is deposited predominantly on already ice-covered particles, since the
vapour pressure exterior of the ice line is too low for heterogeneous nucleation on bare silicate
grains. Icy particles can thus grow to centimetre-sized pebbles in a narrow region around the ice
line, whereas silicate particles stay dust-sized and diffuse out over the disc. The inhibition
of heterogeneous ice nucleation results in a preferential region for growth towards planetesimals
close to the ice line where we find large icy pebbles. The suppression of heterogeneous ice nucleation
on silicate grains may also be the mechanism behind some of the observed dark rings around ice lines
in protoplanetary discs, as the presence of large ice pebbles outside ice lines leads to a decrease
in the opacity there.
