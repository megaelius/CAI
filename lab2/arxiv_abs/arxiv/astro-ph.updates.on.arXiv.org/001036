[Abridged] In this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of the performance of two different methods
to identify the diffuse stellar light in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters.
One method is based on a dynamical analysis of the stellar component. The second method is closer
to techniques commonly employed in observational studies. Both the dynamical method and the method
based on the surface brightness limit criterion are applied to the same set of hydrodynamical simulations
for a large sample about 80 galaxy clusters. We find significant differences between the ICL and
DSC fractions computed with the two corresponding methods, which amounts to about a factor of two
for the AGN simulations, and a factor of four for the CSF set. We also find that the inclusion of AGN
feedback boosts the DSC and ICL fractions by a factor of 1.5-2, respectively, while leaving the BCG+ICL
and BCG+DSC mass fraction almost unchanged. The sum of the BCG and DSC mass stellar mass fraction
is found to decrease from ~80 per cent in galaxy groups to ~60 per cent in rich clusters, thus in excess
of what found from observational analysis. We identify the average surface brightness limits that
yields the ICL fraction from the SBL method close to the DSC fraction from the dynamical method. These
surface brightness limits turn out to be brighter in the CSF than in the AGN simulations. This is consistent
with the finding that AGN feedback makes BCGs to be less massive and with shallower density profiles
than in the CSF simulations. The BCG stellar component, as identified by both methods, are slightly
older and more metal-rich than the stars in the diffuse component.
