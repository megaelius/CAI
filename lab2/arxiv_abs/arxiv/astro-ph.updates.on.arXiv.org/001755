We present high-resolution N-body/hydrodynamics simulations of dwarf galaxies formed in isolated
CDM halos with the same virial mass, Mv~2.5x10^10 Msun at z=0, in order to (1) study the mass assembly
histories (MAHs) of the halo, stars, and gas components, and (2) explore the effects of the halo MAHs
on the stellar/baryonic assembly of the simulated dwarfs and on their z~0 properties. Overall,
the simulated dwarfs are roughly consistent with observations. Our main results are: a) The stellar-to-halo
mass ratio is ~0.01 and remains roughly constant since z~1 (the stellar MAHs follow closely the halo
MAHs), with a smaller value at higher z's for those halos that assemble their mass later. b) The evolution
of the galaxy gas fraction, fg, is episodic and higher, most of the time, than the stellar fraction.
When fg decreases (increases), the gas fraction in the halo typically increases (decreases), showing
that the SN driven outflows play an important role in regulating the gas fractions -and hence the
SFR- of the dwarfs. However, in most cases, an important fraction of the gas escapes the virial radius,
Rv; at z=4 the total baryon fraction inside Rv is 1.5-2 times smaller than the universal one, while
at z=0 is 2-6 times smaller, with the earlier assembled halos ejecting more gas. c) The SF histories
are episodic with changes in the SFRs of factors 2-10 on average. d) Although the dwarfs formed in
late assembled halos show more extended SF histories, their z~0 SFRs are still below the ones measured
for local isolated dwarfs. e) The effects of baryons on Mv are such that at almost any time Mv is 10-20%
smaller than the corresponding Mv obtained in pure N-body simulations. Our results suggest that
rather than increasing the strength of the SN-driven outflows, processes that reduce the SF efficiency
even more will help to solve the potential issues faced by the CDM-based simulations of dwarfs.
