Low Mass X-Ray Binaries (LMXBs) are systems in which a compact object accretes from a binary companion
star via an accretion disk. The X-ray properties of LMXBs show strong variability over timescales
ranging from milliseconds to decades, much of which is tied to the extreme environment of the inner
accretion disk, hence an understanding of this behaviour is key to understanding how matter behaves
in such an environment. GRS 1915+105 and MXB 1730-335 are two LMXBs which show particularly unusual
variability. GRS 1915+105 shows a large number of distinct classes of second-to-minute scale variability,
consisting of repeated patterns of dips and flares. MXB 1730 shows Type II X-ray Bursts; minute-scale
increases in X-ray intensity with a sudden onset and a slow decay. More recently two new objects,
IGR J17091-3624 and GRO J1744-28 have been shown to display similar behaviours. In this thesis I
present a new framework with which to classify variability in IGR J17091. I perform a comparison
study between this source and GRS 1915. In GRS 1915, hard X-rays lag soft X-rays in all variability
classes; in IGR J17091, I find that the sign of this lag varies between variability classes. Additionally,
while GRS 1915+105 accretes at close to its Eddington Limit, I find that IGR J17091-3624 accretes
at only ~5-33% of its Eddington Limit. I also perform a study of variability in GRO J1744 and find that
it is more complex than in MXB 1730, consisting of at least 4 separate phenomena which may have separate
physical origins. One of these phenomena, `Structured Bursting', consists of patterns of flares
and dips similar to those seen in GRS 1915 and IGR J17091. I compare these types of variability and
discuss the possibility of a physical link. I also present the alternative hypothesis that Structured
Bursting is caused my 'hiccup accretion' similar to that seen in systems approaching the propeller
regime.
