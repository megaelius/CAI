The cross-correlation technique is a well-tested tool for exoplanet characterization. A new application
is measuring atmospheric isotope ratios; in particular D/H ratios can give insight in the formation
and evolution of planets. In this paper we study the detectability of molecular isotopologues in
the spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, identify the optimal wavelength ranges for such studies,
and predict the required observational efforts with current and future ground-based instruments.
High-dispersion (R=10$^5$) thermal emission spectra are calculated based on modelling of exoplanet
atmospheres over a wide range of temperatures. They are analysed using cross-correlation, resulting
in signal-to-noise predictions for the $^{13}$CO, HDO, and CH$_3$D isotopologues. For the best
observable exoplanets, $^{13}$CO is well in range of current 10m-class telescopes. We predict
it to be most favourably detectable at 4.7 micron, but to also be observable at 2.4 micron, just longward
of the wavelengths probed by several high-dispersion observations in the literature. CH$_3$D
is best targeted at 4.7 micron, and may be detectable with present-day instruments for planets with
$T_{\rm equ} <$700~K. For both isotopologues, ELT-class telescopes will allow detections for
a wide range of planets. HDO is best targeted at 3.7 micron, but is more challenging, because methane
can shield HDO. However, methane-quenching may make HDO even easier to detect than CH$_3$D, out
to temperatures $\lesssim$1200~K. If Proxima Cen b is water-rich, HDO could be detected with the
ELT in $\sim$1 night in its reflected-light spectrum. Isotopologues will soon be a part of the exoplanet
characterisation tools. Measuring D/H ratios in exoplanets, and that of other isotopologues,
could become a prime science case for the first-light instrument METIS on the ELT, especially for
nearby temperate rocky and ice giant planets.
