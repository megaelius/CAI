The persisting consistency of ever more accurate observational data with the predictions of the
standard LCDM cosmological model puts severe constraints on possible alternative scenarios,
but still does not shed any light on the fundamental nature of the cosmic dark sector.As large deviations
from a LCDM cosmology are ruled out by data, the path to detect possible features of alternative models
goes necessarily through the definition of cosmological scenarios that leave almost unaffected
the background and -- to a lesser extent -- the linear perturbations evolution of the universe. In
this context,the Multi-coupled DE (McDE) model was proposed by Baldi 2012 as a particular realization
of an interacting Dark Energy field characterized by an effective screening mechanism capable
of suppressing the effects of the coupling at the background and linear perturbation level. In the
present paper, for the first time, we challenge the McDE scenario through a direct comparison with
real data, in particular with the luminosity distance of Type Ia supernovae. By studying the existence
and stability conditions of the critical points of the associated background dynamical system,
we select only the cosmologically consistent solutions, and confront their background expansion
history with data. Confirming previous qualitative results, the McDE scenario appears to be fully
consistent with the adopted sample of Type Ia supernovae, even for coupling values corresponding
to an associated scalar fifth-force about four orders of magnitude stronger than standard gravity.
Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the McDE background screening, and shows some new
non-trivial asymptotic solutions for the future evolution of the universe. Our results show how
the background expansion history might be highly insensitive to the fundamental nature and to the
internal complexity of the dark sector. [Abridged]
