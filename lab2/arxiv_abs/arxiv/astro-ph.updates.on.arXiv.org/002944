Aims. To explore the possible chemical signature of planet formation in the binary system HAT-P-4,
by studying abundance vs condensation temperature Tc trends. The star HAT-P-4 hosts a planet detected
by transits while its stellar companion does not have any detected planet. We also study the Lithium
content, which could shed light on the problem of Li depletion in exoplanet host stars. Conclusions.
The exoplanet host star HAT-P-4 is found to be ~0.1 dex more metal rich than its companion, which is
one of the highest differences in metallicity observed in similar systems. This could have important
implications for chemical tagging studies, disentangling groups of stars with a common origin.
We rule out a possible peculiar composition for each star as lambda Boo, delta Scuti or a Blue Straggler.
The star HAT-P-4 is enhanced in refractory elements relative to volatile when compared to its stellar
companion. Notably, the Lithium abundance in HAT-P-4 is greater than in its companion by ~0.3 dex,
which is contrary to the model that explains the Lithium depletion by the presence of planets. We
propose a scenario where, at the time of planet formation, the star HAT-P-4 locked the inner refractory
material in planetesimals and rocky planets, and formed the outer gas giant planet at a greater distance.
The refractories were then accreted onto the star, possibly due to the migration of the giant planet.
This explains the higher metallicity, the higher Lithium content, and the negative Tc trend detected.
A similar scenario was recently proposed for the solar twin star HIP 68468, which is in some aspects
similar to HAT-P-4. We estimate a mass of at least Mrock ~ 10 Mearth locked in refractory material
in order to reproduce the observed Tc trends and metallicity.
