Power spectra play an important role in the theory of inflation, and their ability to reproduce current
observational data to high accuracy is often considered a triumph of inflation, largely because
of a lack of credible alternatives. In previous work we introduced an alternative picture for the
cosmological power spectra based on the nonperturbative features of the quantum version of Einstein's
gravity, instead of currently popular inflation models based on scalar fields. The key ingredients
in this new picture are the appearance of a nontrivial gravitational vacuum condensate (directly
related to the observed cosmological constant), and a calculable renormalization group running
of Newton's G on cosmological scales. Results obtained previously were largely based on a semi-analytical
treatment, and often suffered from the limitations of various approximations and simplifying
assumptions. In this work, we extend and refine our previous calculations by laying out an updated
and extended analysis, which now utilizes a set of suitably modified state-of-the-art numerical
programs (ISiTGR, MGCAMB and MGCLASS) developed for observational cosmology. As a result, we are
able to remove some of the approximations employed in our previous studies, leading to a number of
novel and detailed physical predictions. These should help in potentially distinguish the vacuum
condensate picture of quantum gravity from that of other models such as scalar field inflation.
Here, besides the matter power spectrum P(k), we work out in detail predictions for what are referred
to as the TT, TE, EE, BB angular spectra, as well as their closely related lensing spectra. However,
the current limited precision of observational data today (especially on large angular scales)
does not allow us yet to clearly prove or disprove either set of ideas.
