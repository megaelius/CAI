We present visible and near-infrared observations of a near-Earth object (NEO), 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$.
The NEO 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ approached close to the Earth at a distance of about 50,000 km in October
2017. This close approach provided a practical exercise for planetary defense. This apparition
was also an appropriate opportunity to investigate 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$, which is a monolithic
asteroid \citep{Polishook13}. We conducted the observation campaign of 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$
using six small- and medium-sized telescopes. The multiband photometry analysis showed that the
taxonomic class of 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ to be an X-type. In particular, we successfully obtained
the high time resolution lightcurve of 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ with the Tomo-e Gozen camera, which
is the world's first wide-field CMOS camera, mounted on the 1.05 m Schmidt telescope at Kiso Observatory.
The shape and rotational motion models of 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ were derived from the lightcurve.
When 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ was assumed to be a triaxial ellipsoid, the rotational and precession
periods were 8.47 $\pm$ 0.01 min and 12.25 $\pm$ 0.01 min, respectively, with the long axis mode.
This indicates that 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ is a tumbling and monolithic asteroid. The shape models
showed that the plausible axial lengths to be 6.2 $\times$ 8.0 $\times$ 14.9~m or 3.3 $\times$ 8.0
$\times$ 14.3~m. The flattened and elongated shape indicates that 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ is a fragment
produced by a impact event. We also estimated the excitation timescale, which implied that the impact
event happened within $\sim$3 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ yr and 2012 $\mathrm{TC_4}$ has a fresh surface.
