We report the discovery of a molecular wind signature from a massive intensely star-forming clump
of a few $10^9$ Msun, in the strongly gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxy "the Emerald"
(PLCK_G165.7+49.0) at z=2.236. The Emerald is amongst the brightest high-redshift galaxies on
the submillimeter sky, and was initially discovered with the Planck satellite. The system contains
two magnificient structures with projected lengths of 28.5" and 21" formed by multiple, near-infrared
arcs, falling behind a massive galaxy cluster at z=0.35, as well as an adjacent filament that has
so far escaped discovery in other wavebands. We used HST/WFC3 and CFHT optical and near-infrared
imaging together with IRAM and SMA interferometry of the CO(4-3) line and 850 $\mu$m dust emission
to characterize the foreground lensing mass distribution, construct a lens model with Lenstool,
and calculate gravitational magnification factors between 20 and 50 in most of the source. The majority
of the star formation takes place within two massive star-forming clumps which are marginally gravitationally
bound and embedded in a $9 \times 10^{10}$ Msun, fragmented disk with 20% gas fraction. One of the
clumps shows a pronounced blue wing in the CO(4-3) line profile, which we interpret as a wind signature.
The mass outflow rates are high enough for us to suspect that the clump might become unbound within
a few tens of Myr, unless the outflowing gas can be replenished by gas accretion from the surrounding
disk. The velocity offset of -200 km s$^{-1}$ is above the escape velocity of the clump, but not that
of the galaxy overall, suggesting that much of this material might ultimately rain back onto the
galaxy and contribute to fueling subsequent star formation.
