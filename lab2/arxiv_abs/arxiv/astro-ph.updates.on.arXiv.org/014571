We develop a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) framework to study the clustering of cold dark
matter (CDM) in cosmologies with massive neutrinos. We follow the trajectories of CDM particles
with Lagrangian displacements fields up to third order in perturbation theory. Once the neutrinos
become non-relativistic, their density fluctuations are modeled as being proportional to the
CDM density fluctuations, with a scale-dependent proportionality factor. This yields a gravitational
back-reaction that introduces additional scales to the linear growth function, which is accounted
for in the higher order LPT kernels. Through non-linear mappings from Eulerian to Lagrangian frames,
we ensure that our theory has a well behaved large scale behavior free of unwanted UV divergences,
which are common when neutrino and CDM densities are not treated on an equal footing, and in resummation
schemes that manifestly break Galilean invariance. We use our theory to construct correlation
functions for both the underlying matter field, as well as for biased tracers using Convolution-LPT.
Redshift-space distortions effects are modeled using the Gaussian Streaming Model. When comparing
our analytical results to simulated data from the Quijote simulation suite, we find good accuracy
down to $r=20 \,\text{Mpc} \, h^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0.5$, for the real space and redshift space
monopole particle correlation functions with no free parameters. The same accuracy is reached
for the redshift space quadrupole if we additionally consider an effective field theory parameter
that shifts the pairwise velocity dispersion. For modeling the correlation functions of tracers
we adopt a simple Lagrangian biasing scheme with only density and curvature operators, which we
find sufficient to reach down to $r=20 \,\text{Mpc} \, h^{-1}$ when comparing to simulated halos.
