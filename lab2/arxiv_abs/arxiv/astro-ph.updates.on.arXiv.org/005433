Observations have revealed rich structures in protoplanetary disks, offering clues about their
embedded planets. Due to the complexities introduced by the abundance of gas in these disks, modeling
their structure in detail is computationally intensive, requiring complex hydrodynamic codes
and substantial computing power. It would be advantageous if computationally simpler models could
provide some preliminary information on these disks. Here we apply a particle-only model (that
we developed for gas-poor debris disks) to the gas-rich disk, HL Tauri, to address the question of
whether such simple models can inform the study of these systems. Assuming three potentially embedded
planets, we match HL Tau's radial profile fairly well and derive best-fit planetary masses and orbital
radii (0.40, 0.02, 0.21 Jupiter masses for the planets orbiting a 0.55 solar-mass star at 11.22,
29.67, 64.23 AU). Our derived parameters are comparable to those estimated by others, except for
the mass of the second planet. Our simulations also reproduce some narrower gaps seen in the ALMA
image away from the orbits of the planets. The nature of these gaps is debated but, based on our simulations,
we argue they could result from planet-disk interactions via mean-motion resonances, and need
not contain planets. Our results suggest that a simple particle-only model can be used as a first
step to understanding dynamical structures in gas disks, particularly those formed by planets,
and determine some parameters of their hidden planets, serving as useful initial inputs to hydrodynamic
models which are needed to investigate disk and planet properties more thoroughly.
