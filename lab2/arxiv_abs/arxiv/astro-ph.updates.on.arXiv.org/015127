In situ observations of small asteroids show that surfaces covered by boulders and coarse terrain
are frequent on such bodies. Regolith grain sizes have distributions on approximately mm and cm
scales, and the behavior of such large grains in the very low-gravity environments of small body
surfaces dictates their morphology and evolution. In order to support the understanding of natural
processes (e.g., the recapturing of impact ejecta) or spacecraft-induced interactions (e.g.,
the fate of a small lander), we aim to experimentally investigate the response of coarse-grained
target surfaces to very-low-speed impacts (below 2 m/s). We present the outcome of 86 low-speed
impacts of a cm-sized spherical projectile into a bed of simulated regolith, composed of irregular
mm- and cm-sized grains. These impacts were performed under vacuum and microgravity conditions.
Our results include measurements for the projectile coefficient of restitution and penetration
depth, as well as ejecta production, speed, and mass estimation. We find that impact outcomes include
the frequent occurrence of projectile bouncing and tangential rolling on the target surface upon
impact. Ejecta is produced for impact speeds higher than about 12 cm/s, and ejecta speeds scale with
the projectile to target the grain size ratio and the impact speed. Ejected mass estimations indicate
that ejecta is increasingly difficult to produce for increasing grain sizes. Coefficients of restitution
of rebounding projectiles do not display a dependency on the target grain size, unlike their maximum
penetration depth, which can be scaled with the projectile to target grain size ratio. Finally,
we compare our experimental measurements to spacecraft data and numerical work on Hayabusa 2's
MASCOT landing on the surface of the asteroid Ryugu.
