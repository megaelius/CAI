We present new L-band ($1\mbox{--}2$ GHz) observations of the nearby spiral galaxy M33 with 80 pc
resolution obtained with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The HI observations, combined with
HI measurements from the Green Bank Telescope, improve the spectral resolution and sensitivity
($2.8$ K rms noise in a $0.2$ km s$^{-1}$ channel) compared to previous observations. We find individual
profiles are usually non-Gaussian, harbouring line wings, multiple components, and asymmetries.
Given this spectral complexity, we quantify the motions in the atomic ISM through moment analysis
of the spectra and fits to aligned, stacked profiles. The measured value of the HI line width depends
strongly on the method used, with the velocity stacked profiles aligned to the peak velocity giving
the minimum value of $\sigma = 7$ km s$^{-1}$ and all other methods giving higher values ($\sigma\sim10$
km s$^{-1}$). All measurements of the line width show a shallow radial trend, with $\sigma$ decreasing
by $\sim2$ km s$^{-1}$ from $R_{\rm gal}=0$ to $R_{\rm gal}=8$ kpc. We consider a number of energy
sources that might maintain the line width against turbulent dissipation, but no single source
is adequate. We find excess emission relative to a Gaussian in the stacked profile line wings, ranging
from 9% to 26% depending on how the spectra are aligned. By splitting the line wings into symmetric
and asymmetric components, we find that the lagging rotational disk accounts for one-third of the
line wing flux. We also find emission far from the rotation axis of the galaxy in multiple discrete
HI clouds, including a filament with a projected length of $\sim8$ kpc.
