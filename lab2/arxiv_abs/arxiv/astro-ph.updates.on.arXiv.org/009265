Here we present the analysis of multi-epoch secondary eclipse observations of HD 189733b and HD
209458b as a probe of temporal variability in the planetary climate using both Spitzer channels
1 and 2 (3.6 and 4.5 um). Constraining temporal variability will inform models and identify physical
processes occurring at either length scales too small to directly observe or at pressure levels
that are inaccessible to transit observations. We do not detect statistically significant variability
and are able to place useful upper limits on the IR variability amplitudes in these atmospheres.
There are very few planets with multi-epoch observations at the required precision to probe variability
in dayside emission. The observations considered in this study span several years, providing insight
into temporal variability at multiple timescales. In the case of HD 189733b, the best fit eclipse
depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 102 ppm about a median depth of 1827 ppm
and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 88 ppm about a median depth of 1481 ppm. For HD 209458b, the best
fit eclipse depths for the channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 22 ppm about a median depth
of 1406 ppm and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 131 ppm about a median depth of 1092 ppm. The precision
and scatter in these observations allow us to constrain variability to less than (5.6% and 6.0%)
and (12% and 1.6%) for channels (1,2) of HD 189733b and HD 209458b respectively. There is a difference
in the best fit eclipse timing compared to the predicted time consistent with an offset hotspot as
predicted by GCMs and confirmed in previous phase curve observations.
