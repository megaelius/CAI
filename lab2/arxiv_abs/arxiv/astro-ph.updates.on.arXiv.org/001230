The next generation of adaptive optics (AO) systems will require tomographic reconstruction techniques
to map the optical refractive index fluctuations, generated by the atmospheric turbulence, along
the line of sight to the astronomical target. These systems can be enhanced with data from an external
atmospheric profiler. This is important for Extremely Large Telescope scale tomography. Here
we propose a new instrument which utilises the generalised SCIntillation Detection And Ranging
(SCIDAR) technique to allow high sensitivity vertical profiles of the atmospheric optical turbulence
and wind velocity profile above astronomical observatories. The new approach, which we refer to
as 'Stereo-SCIDAR', uses a stereoscopic system with the scintillation pattern from each star of
a double-star target incident on a separate detector. Separating the pupil images for each star
has several advantages including: increased magnitude difference tolerance for the target stars;
negating the need for re-calibration due to the normalisation errors usually associated with SCIDAR;
an increase of at least a factor of two in the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross-covariance function
and hence the profile for equal magnitude target stars and up to a factor of 16 improvement for targets
of 3 magnitudes difference; and easier real-time reconstruction of the wind-velocity profile.
Theoretical response functions are calculated for the instrument, and the performance is investigated
using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The technique is demonstrated using data recorded at the 2.5 m Nordic
Optical Telescope and the 1.0 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, both on La Palma.
