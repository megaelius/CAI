The afterglow emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is believed to originate from a relativistic
blast wave driven into the circumburst medium. Although the afterglow emission from radio up to
X-ray frequencies is thought to originate from synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic,
non-thermal electrons accelerated by the blast wave, the origin of the emission at high energies
(HE; $\gtrsim$GeV) remains uncertain. The recent detection of sub-TeV emission from GRB 190114C
by MAGIC raises further debate on what powers the very high-energy (VHE; $\gtrsim 300$GeV) emission.
Here, we explore the inverse Compton scenario as a candidate for the HE and VHE emissions and consider
two sources of seed photons for scattering: synchrotron photons from the blast wave (synchrotron
self-Compton or SSC) and isotropic photon fields external to the blast wave (external Compton).
For each case, we compute the multi-wavelength afterglow spectra and light curves. We find that
SSC will dominate particle cooling and the GeV emission, unless a dense ambient infrared photon
field, typical of star-forming regions, is present. Additionally, considering the extragalactic
background light attenuation, we discuss the detectability of VHE afterglows by existing and future
gamma-ray instruments for a wide range of model parameters. Studying GRB 190114C, we find that its
afterglow emission in the Fermi-LAT band is synchrotron-dominated for $t\lesssim10^3$ s, but
it later becomes SSC-dominated. The late-time Fermi-LAT measurement (i.e., $t\sim 10^4$ s) also
sets an upper limit on the energy density of a putative external infrared photon field (i.e., $\lesssim
7.5\times 10^{-8}\, {\rm erg\,cm^{-3}}$). Finally, we predict that the VHE flux at $10^4$ s, which
is still SSC dominated, is $ 3\times 10^{-11}$ ${\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$.
