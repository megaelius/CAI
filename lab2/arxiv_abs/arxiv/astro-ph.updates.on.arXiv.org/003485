We present 888 visual-wavelength spectra of 122 nearby type II supernovae (SNe II) obtained between
1986 and 2009, and ranging between 3 and 363 days post explosion. In this first paper, we outline our
observations and data reduction techniques, together with a characterization based on the spectral
diversity of SNe~II. A statistical analysis of the spectral matching technique is discussed as
an alternative to non-detection constraints for estimating SN explosion epochs. The time evolution
of spectral lines is presented and analysed in terms of how this differs for SNe of different photometric,
spectral, and environmental properties: velocities, pseudo-equivalent widths, decline rates,
magnitudes, time durations, and environment metallicity. Our sample displays a large range in
ejecta expansion velocities, from $\sim9600$ to $\sim1500$ km s$^{-1}$ at 50 days post explosion
with a median H$_{\alpha}$ value of 7300 km s$^{-1}$. This is most likely explained through differing
explosion energies. Significant diversity is also observed in the absolute strength of spectral
lines, characterised through their pseudo-equivalent widths. This implies significant diversity
in both temperature evolution (linked to progenitor radius) and progenitor metallicity between
different SNe~II. Around 60\% of our sample show an extra absorption component on the blue side of
the H$_{\alpha}$ P-Cygni profile ("Cachito" feature) between 7 and 120 days since explosion. Studying
the nature of Cachito, we conclude that these features at early times (before $\sim35$ days) are
associated with \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda6355$, while past the middle of the plateau phase they are
related to high velocity (HV) features of hydrogen lines.
