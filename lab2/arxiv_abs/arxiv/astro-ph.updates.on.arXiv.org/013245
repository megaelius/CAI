The obscuring structure surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be explained as a dust and
gas flow cycle that fundamentally connects the AGN with their host galaxies. This structure is believed
to be associated with dusty winds driven by radiation pressure. However, the role of magnetic fields,
which are invoked in almost all models for accretion onto a supermassive black hole and outflows,
is not thoroughly studied. Here we report the first detection of polarized thermal emission by means
of magnetically aligned dust grains in the dusty torus of NGC 1068 using ALMA Cycle 4 polarimetric
dust continuum observations ($0.07"$, $4.2$ pc; 348.5 GHz, $860$ $\mu$m). The polarized torus
has an asymmetric variation across the equatorial axis with a peak polarization of $3.7\pm0.5$\%
and position angle of $109\pm2^{\circ}$ (B-vector) at $\sim8$ pc east from the core. We compute
synthetic polarimetric observations of magnetically aligned dust grains assuming a toroidal
magnetic field and homogeneous grain alignment. We conclude that the measured 860 $\mu$m continuum
polarization arises from magnetically aligned dust grains in an optically thin region of the torus.
The asymmetric polarization across the equatorial axis of the torus arises from 1) an inhomogeneous
optical depth, and 2) a variation of the velocity dispersion, i.e. variation of the magnetic field
turbulence at sub-pc scales, from the eastern to the western region of the torus. These observations
and modeling constrain the torus properties beyond spectral energy distribution results. This
study strongly supports that magnetic fields up to a few pc contribute to the accretion flow onto
the active nuclei.
