Recently, high-precision optical 2~min cadence light curves obtained with \emph{TESS} for targets
located in the mission's defined first four sectors have been released. The majority of these high-cadence
and high-precision measurements currently span $\sim28\,{\rm d}$, thereby allowing periodic
variability occurring on timescales $\lesssim14\,{\rm d}$ to potentially be detected. Magnetic
chemically peculiar (mCP) A-type stars are well known to exhibit rotationally modulated photometric
variability that is produced by inhomogeneous chemical abundance distributions in their atmospheres.
While mCP stars typically exhibit rotation periods that are significantly longer than those of
non-mCP stars, both populations exhibit typical periods $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$; therefore, the
early \emph{TESS} releases are suitable for searching for rotational modulation of the light curves
of both mCP and non-mCP stars. We present the results of our search for A-type stars that exhibit variability
in their \emph{TESS} light curves that is consistent with rotational modulation based on the first
two data releases obtained from sectors 1 to 4. Our search yielded $134$ high-probability candidate
rotational variables -- $60$ of which have not been previously reported. Approximately half of
these stars are identified in the literature as Ap (mCP) stars. Comparisons between the subsample
of high-probability candidate rotationally variable Ap stars and the subsample of stars that are
not identified as Ap reveal that the latter subsample exhibits statistically (i) shorter rotation
periods and (ii) significantly lower photometric amplitudes.
