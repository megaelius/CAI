We report two secure ($z=3.775, 4.012$) and one tentative ($z\approx3.767$) spectroscopic confirmations
of massive and quiescent galaxies through $K$-band observations with Keck/MOSFIRE and VLT/X-Shooter.
The stellar continuum emission, the absence of strong nebular emission lines and the lack of significant
far-infrared detections confirm the passive nature of these objects, disfavoring the alternative
solution of low-redshift dusty star-forming interlopers. We derive stellar masses of $\mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/M_\odot)\sim11$
and ongoing star formation rates placing these galaxies $\gtrsim 1-2$ dex below the main sequence
at their redshifts. The adopted parametrization of the star formation history suggests that these
sources experienced a strong ($\langle \rm SFR \rangle \sim 1200-3500\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$)
and short ($\sim 50$ Myr) burst of star formation, peaking $\sim 150-500$ Myr before the time of observation,
all properties reminiscent of the characteristics of sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z>4$.
We investigate this connection by comparing the comoving number densities and the properties of
these two populations. We find a fair agreement only with the deepest sub-mm surveys detecting not
only the most extreme starbursts, but also more normal galaxies. We support these findings by further
exploring the Illustris-TNG cosmological simulation, retrieving populations of both fully quenched
massive galaxies at $z\sim3-4$ and SMGs at $z\sim4-5$, with number densities and properties in
agreement with the observations at $z\sim3$, but in increasing tension at higher redshift. Nevertheless,
as suggested by the observations, not all the progenitors of quiescent galaxies at these redshifts
shine as bright SMGs in their past and, similarly, not all bright SMGs quench by $z\sim3$, both fractions
depending on the threshold assumed to define the SMGs themselves.
