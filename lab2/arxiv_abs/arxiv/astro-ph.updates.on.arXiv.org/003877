Non-resonant FeII* 2365, 2396, 2612, 2626 emission can potentially trace galactic winds in emission
and provide useful constraints to wind models. From the 3'x3' mosaic of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(UDF) obtained with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph, we identify a statistical sample
of 40 FeII* emitters and 50 MgII 2796, 2803 emitters from a sample of 271 [OII] 3726, 3729 emitters
with reliable redshifts from z = 0.85 - 1.5 down to 2E-18 (3 sigma) ergs/s/cm^2 (for [OII]), covering
the stellar mass range 10^8 - 10^11 Msun. The FeII* and MgII emitters follow the galaxy main sequence,
but with a clear dichotomy. Galaxies with masses below 10^9 Msun and star formation rates (SFRs)
of <1 Msun/year have MgII emission without accompanying FeII* emission, whereas galaxies with
masses above 10^10 Msun and SFRs >10 Msun/year have FeII* emission without accompanying MgII emission.
Between these two regimes, galaxies have both MgII and FeII* emission, typically with MgII P-Cygni
profiles. Indeed, the MgII profile shows a progression along the main sequence from pure emission
to P-Cygni profiles to strong absorption, due to resonant trapping. Combining the deep MUSE data
with HST ancillary information, we find that galaxies with pure MgII emission profiles have lower
star formation rate surface densities than those with either MgII P-Cygni profiles or FeII* emission.
These spectral signatures produced through continuum scattering and fluorescence, MgII P-Cygni
profiles and FeII* emission, are better candidates for tracing galactic outflows than pure MgII
emission, which may originate from HII regions. We compare the absorption and emission rest-frame
equivalent widths for pairs of FeII transitions to predictions from outflow models and find that
the observations consistently have less total re-emission than absorption, suggesting either
dust extinction or non-isotropic outflow geometries.
