Penumbral filaments and light bridges are prominent structures inside sunspots and are important
for understanding the nature of sunspot magnetic fields and magneto-convection underneath. We
investigate an interesting event where several penumbral filaments intruded into a sunspot light
bridge for more insights into magnetic fields of the sunspot penumbral filament and light bridge,
as well as their interaction. The emission, kinematic, and magnetic topology characteristics
of the penumbral filaments intruding into the light bridge and the resultant jets are studied. At
the west part of the light bridge, the intruding penumbral filaments penetrated into the umbrae
on both sides of the light bridge, and two groups of jets were also detected. The jets shared the same
projected morphology with the intruding filaments and were accompanied by intermittent footpoint
brightenings. Simultaneous spectral imaging observations provide convincing evidences for
the presences of magnetic reconnection related heating and bidirectional flows near the jet bases
and contribute to measuring vector velocities of the jets. Additionally, nonlinear force-free
field extrapolation results reveal strong and highly inclined magnetic fields along the intruding
penumbral filaments, consistent well with the results deduced from the vector velocities of the
jets. Therefore, we propose that the jets could be caused by magnetic reconnections between emerging
fields within the light bridge and the nearly horizontal fields of intruding filaments. They were
then ejected outward along the stronger filaments fields. Our study indicates that magnetic reconnection
could occur between the penumbral filament fields and emerging fields within light bridge and produce
jets along the stronger filament fields. These results further complement the study of magnetic
reconnection and dynamic activities within the sunspot.
