Young massive stars in the halo are assumed to be runaway stars from the Galactic disk. Possible ejection
scenarios are binary supernova ejections (BSE) or dynamical ejections from star clusters (DE).
Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are extreme runaway stars that are potentially unbound from the Galaxy.
Powerful acceleration mechanisms such as the tidal disruption of a binary system by a supermassive
black hole (SMBH) are required to produce them. Therefore, HVSs are believed to originate in the
Galactic center (GC), the only place known to host an SMBH. The second Gaia data release (DR2) offers
the opportunity of studying HVSs in an unprecedented manner. We revisit some of the most interesting
high-velocity stars, that is, 15 stars for which proper motions with the Hubble Space Telescope
were obtained in the pre-Gaia era, to unravel their origin. By carrying out kinematic analyses based
on revised spectrophotometric distances and proper motions from Gaia DR2, kinematic properties
were obtained that help constrain the spatial origins of these stars. Stars that were previously
considered (un)bound remain (un)bound in Galactic potentials favored by Gaia DR2 astrometry.
For nine stars (five candidate HVSs plus all four radial velocity outliers), the GC can be ruled out
as spatial origin at least at $2\sigma$ confidence level, suggesting that a large portion of the
known HVSs are disk runaway stars launched close to or beyond Galactic escape velocities. The fastest
star in the sample, HVS3, is confirmed to originate in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because the ejection
velocities of five of our non-GC stars are close to or above the upper limits predicted for BSE and
DE, another powerful dynamical ejection mechanism (e.g., involving massive perturbers such as
intermediate-mass black holes) is likely to operate in addition to the three classical scenarios
mentioned above.
