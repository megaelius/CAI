We report 885$\mu$m ALMA continuum flux densities for 24 Taurus members spanning the stellar/substellar
boundary, with spectral types from M4 to M7.75. Of the 24 systems, 22 are detected at levels ranging
from 1.0-55.6 mJy. The two non-detections are transition disks, though other transition disks
in the sample are detected. Converting ALMA continuum measurements to masses using standard scaling
laws and radiative transfer modeling yields dust mass estimates ranging from $\sim$0.3-20M$_{\oplus}$.
The dust mass shows a declining trend with central object mass when combined with results from submillimeter
surveys of more massive Taurus members. The substellar disks appear as part of a continuous sequence
and not a distinct population. Compared to older Upper Sco members with similar masses across the
substellar limit, the Taurus disks are brighter and more massive. Both Taurus and Upper Sco populations
are consistent with an approximately linear relationship in $M_{dust}$ to $M_{star}$, although
derived power-law slopes depend strongly upon choices of stellar evolutionary model and dust temperature
relation. The median disk around early M-stars in Taurus contains a comparable amount of mass in
small solids as the average amount of heavy elements in Kepler planetary systems on short-period
orbits around M-dwarf stars, with an order of magnitude spread in disk dust mass about the median
value. Assuming a gas:dust ratio of 100:1, only a small number of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs
have a total disk mass amenable to giant planet formation, consistent with the low frequency of giant
planets orbiting M-dwarfs.
