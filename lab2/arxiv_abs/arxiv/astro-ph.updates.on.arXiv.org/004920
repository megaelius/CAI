Adopting the thermal free-free emission mechanism, the coronal and chromospheric magnetic fields
are derived from the polarization and spectral observations with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph
at 1.76 cm. The solar active regions (AR) located near the disk center observed on January 8, 2015
(AR 12257) and December 4, 2016 (AR 12615) are used for the estimate of the chromospheric and coronal
magnetic fields with the microwave radio observations. We compare solar radio maps of active regions
for both intensity and circularly polarized component with the optical maps from observations
with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and the chromosphere and corona transition region images
obtained with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument, on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory.
We notice from the comparison between radio maps of both AR that the circular polarization degree
in the AR 12257 is about 2 percent, but the AR 12615 has a higher existent value by 3 percent. Radio observations
provide us for direct measurements of magnetic fields in the chromospheric and coronal layers.
We estimate the coronal magnetic fields using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly observations by
adopting magnetic loops in the corona over some patches with weak photospheric magnetic fields.
The coronal magnetic field derived from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly data was from 90 to 240
Gauss. We also study the coronal magnetic fields based on the structure of the extrapolated field,
where the result of the magnetic fields was in the range from 35 to 145 Gauss, showing that the difference
in the coronal magnetic fields between both results is attributed to the assumption of the force-free
approximation.
