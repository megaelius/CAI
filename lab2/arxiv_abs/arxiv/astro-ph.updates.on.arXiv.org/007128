We use a suite of cosmological zoom galaxy formation simulations and dust radiative transfer calculations
to explore the use of the monochromatic $850~\mu m$ luminosity (\Le) as a molecular gas mass (\Mmol)
estimator in galaxies between $0 < z < 9.5$ for a broad range of masses. For our fiducial simulations,
where we assume the dust mass is linearly related to the metal mass, we find that empirical \Le-\Mmol
calibrations accurately recover the molecular gas mass of our model galaxies, and that the \Le-dependent
calibration is preferred. We argue the major driver of scatter in the \Le-\Mmol relation arises
from variations in the molecular gas to dust mass ratio, rather than variations in the dust temperature,
in agreement with the previous study of Liang et al. Emulating a realistic measurement strategy
with ALMA observing bands that are dependent on the source redshift, we find that estimating \Se
from continuum emission at a different frequency contributes $10-20\%$ scatter to the \Le-\Mmol
relation. This additional scatter arises from a combination of mismatches in assumed \Tdust and
$\beta$ values, as well as the fact that the SEDs are not single-temperature blackbodies. However
this observationally induced scatter is a sub-dominant source of uncertainty. Finally we explore
the impact of a dust prescription in which the dust-to-metals ratio varies with metallicity. Though
the resulting mean dust temperatures are $\sim50\%$ higher, the dust mass is significantly decreased
for low-metallicity halos. As a result, the observationally calibrated \Le-\Mmol relation holds
for massive galaxies, independent of the dust model, but below \Le$\lesssim10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$
(metallicities $\log_{10}({\rm Z}/{\rm Z}_{\odot})\lesssim -0.8$) we expect galaxies may deviate
from literature observational calibrations by $\gtrsim0.5$ dex.
