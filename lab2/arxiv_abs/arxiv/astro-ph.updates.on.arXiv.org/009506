KOI-3890 is a highly eccentric, 153-day period eclipsing, single-lined spectroscopic binary
system containing a red-giant star showing solar-like oscillations alongside tidal interactions.
The combination of transit photometry, radial velocity observations, and asteroseismology have
enabled the detailed characterisation of both the red-giant primary and the M-dwarf companion,
along with the tidal interaction and the geometry of the system. The stellar parameters of the red-giant
primary are determined through the use of asteroseismology and grid-based modelling to give a mass
and radius of $M_{\star}=1.04\pm0.06\;\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $R_{\star}=5.8\pm0.2\;\textrm{R}_{\odot}$
respectively. When combined with transit photometry the M-dwarf companion is found to have a mass
and radius of $M_{\mathrm{c}}=0.23\pm0.01\;\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $R_{\mathrm{c}}=0.256\pm0.007\;\textrm{R}_{\odot}$.
Moreover, through asteroseismology we constrain the age of the system through the red-giant primary
to be $9.1^{+2.4}_{-1.7}\;\mathrm{Gyr}$. This provides a constraint on the age of the M-dwarf
secondary, which is difficult to do for other M-dwarf binary systems. In addition, the asteroseismic
analysis yields an estimate of the inclination angle of the rotation axis of the red-giant star of
$i=87.6^{+2.4}_{-1.2}$ degrees. The obliquity of the system\textemdash the angle between the
stellar rotation axis and the angle normal to the orbital plane\textemdash is also derived to give
$\psi=4.2^{+2.1}_{-4.2}$ degrees showing that the system is consistent with alignment. We observe
no radius inflation in the M-dwarf companion when compared to current low-mass stellar models.
