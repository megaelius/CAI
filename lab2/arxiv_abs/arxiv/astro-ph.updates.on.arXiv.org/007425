Pulsar scintillation allows a glimpse into small-scale plasma structures in the interstellar
medium, if we can infer their properties from the scintillation pattern. With Very Long Baseline
Interferometry and working in delay-delay rate space, where the contributions of pairs of images
to the interference pattern become localized, the scattering geometry and distribution of scattered
images on the sky can be determined if a single, highly-anisotropic scattering screen is responsible
for the scintillation. However, many pulsars are subject to much more complex scattering environments
where this method cannot be used. We present a novel technique to reconstruct the scattered flux
of the pulsar and solve for the scattering geometry in these cases by combining interferometric
visibilities with cross-correlations of single-station intensities. This takes advantage of
the fact that, considering a single image pair in delay-delay rate space, the visibilities are sensitive
to the sum of the image angular displacements, while the cross-correlated intensities are sensitive
to the difference, so that their combination can be used to localize both images of the pair. We show
that this technique is able to reconstruct the published scattering geometry of PSR B0834+06, then
apply it to simulations of more complicated scattering systems, where we find that it can distinguish
features from different scattering screens even when the presence of multiple screens is not obvious
in the Fourier transform of the dynamic spectrum. This technique will allow us to both better understand
the distribution of scattering within the interstellar medium and to apply current scintillometry
techniques, such as modelling scintillation and constraining the location of pulsar emission,
to sources for which a current lack of understanding of the scattering environment precludes the
use of these techniques. (abridged)
