The rapidly growing statistical precision of galaxy surveys has lead to a need for ever-more precise
predictions of the observables used to constrain cosmological and galaxy formation models. The
primary avenue through which such predictions will be obtained is suites of numerical simulations.
These simulations must span the relevant model parameter spaces, be large enough to obtain the precision
demanded by upcoming data, and be thoroughly validated in order to ensure accuracy. In this paper
we present one such suite of simulations, forming the basis for the AEMULUS Project, a collaboration
devoted to precision emulation of galaxy survey observables. We have run a set of 75 (1.05 h^-1 Gpc)^3
simulations with mass resolution and force softening of 3.51\times 10^10 (Omega_m / 0.3) ~ h^-1
M_sun and 20 ~ h^-1 kpc respectively in 47 different wCDM cosmologies spanning the range of parameter
space allowed by the combination of recent Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
and Type Ia Supernovae results. We present convergence tests of several observables including
spherical overdensity halo mass functions, galaxy projected correlation functions, galaxy clustering
in redshift space, and matter and halo correlation functions and power spectra. We show that these
statistics are converged to 1% (2%) for halos with more than 500 (200) particles respectively and
scales of r>200 ~ h^-1 kpc in real space or k ~ 3 h Mpc^-1 in harmonic space for z\le 1. We find that the
dominant source of uncertainty comes from varying the particle loading of the simulations. This
leads to large systematic errors for statistics using halos with fewer than 200 particles and scales
smaller than k ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc. We provide the halo catalogs and snapshots detailed in this work to the
