We describe plans for the development of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO),
a next-generation instrument with sensitivity to the very-high-energy (VHE) band to be constructed
in the Southern Hemisphere. SWGO will provide wide-field coverage of a large portion of the southern
sky, effectively complementing current and future instruments in the global multi-messenger
effort to understand extreme astrophysical phenomena throughout the universe. A detailed description
of science topics addressed by SWGO is available in the science case white paper [1]. The development
of SWGO will draw on extensive experience within the community in designing, constructing, and
successfully operating wide-field instruments using observations of extensive air showers.
The detector will consist of a compact inner array of particle detection units surrounded by a sparser
outer array. A key advantage of the design of SWGO is that it can be constructed using current, already
proven technology. We estimate a construction cost of 54M USD and a cost of 7.5M USD for 5 years of operation,
with an anticipated US contribution of 20M USD ensuring that the US will be a driving force for the
SWGO effort. The recently formed SWGO collaboration will conduct site selection and detector optimization
studies prior to construction, with full operations foreseen to begin in 2026. Throughout this
document, references to science white papers submitted to the Astro2020 Decadal Survey with particular
relevance to the key science goals of SWGO, which include unveiling Galactic particle accelerators
[2-10], exploring the dynamic universe [11-21], and probing physics beyond the Standard Model
[22-25], are highlighted in red boldface.
