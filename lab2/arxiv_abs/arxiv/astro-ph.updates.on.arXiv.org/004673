The post-reionization ${\rm HI}$ 21-cm signal is an excellent candidate for precision cosmology,
this however requires accurate modelling of the expected signal. Sarkar et al. (2016) have simulated
the real space ${\rm HI}$ 21-cm signal, and have modelled the ${\rm HI}$ power spectrum as $P_{{\rm
HI}}(k)=b^2 P(k)$ where $P(k)$ is the dark matter power spectrum and $b(k)$ is a (possibly complex)
scale dependent bias for which fitting formulas have been provided. This paper extends these simulations
to incorporate redshift space distortion and predict the expected redshift space ${\rm HI}$ 21-cm
power spectrum $P^s_{{\rm HI}}(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$ using two different prescriptions
for the ${\rm HI}$ distributions and peculiar velocities. We model $P^s_{{\rm HI}}(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$
assuming that it is the product of $P_{{\rm HI}}(k)=b^2 P(k)$ with a Kaiser enhancement term and
a Finger of God (FoG) damping which has $\sigma_p$ the pair velocity dispersion as a free parameter.
Considering several possibilities for the bias and the damping profile, we find that the models
with a scale dependent bias and a Lorentzian damping profile best fit the simulated $P^s_{{\rm HI}}(k_{\perp},k_{\parallel})$
over the entire range $1 \le z \le 6$. The best fit value of $\sigma_p$ falls approximately as $(1+z)^{-m}$
with $m=2$ and $1.2$ respectively for the two different prescriptions. The model predictions are
consistent with the simulations for $k < 0.3 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ over the entire $z$ range for the monopole
$P^s_0(k)$, and at $z \le 3$ for the quadrupole $P^s_2(k)$. At $z \ge 4$ the models underpredict $P^s_2(k)$
at large $k$, and the fit is restricted to $k < 0.15 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.
