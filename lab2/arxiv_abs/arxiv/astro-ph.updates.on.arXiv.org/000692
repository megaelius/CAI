We present spectral calculations of non-LTE accretion disk models appropriate for high luminosity
stellar mass black hole X-ray binary systems. We first use a dissipation profile based on scaling
the results of shearing box simulations of Hirose et al. (2009) to a range of annuli parameters. We
simultaneously scale the effective temperature, orbital frequency and surface density with luminosity
and radius according to the standard \alpha-model (Shakura & Sunyaev, 1973). This naturally
brings increased dissipation to the disk surface layers (around the photospheres) at small radii
and high luminosities. We find that the local spectrum transitions directly from a modified black
body to a saturated Compton scattering spectrum as we increase the effective temperature and orbital
frequency while decreasing midplane surface density. Next, we construct annuli models based on
the parameters of a L/L_Edd=0.8 disk orbiting a 6.62 solar mass black hole using two modified dissipation
profiles that explicitly put more dissipation per unit mass near the disk surface. The new dissipation
profiles are qualitatively similar to the one found by Hirose et al. (2009), but produce strong near
power-law spectral tails. Our models also include physically motivated magnetic acceleration
support based once again on scaling the Hirose et al. (2009) results. We present three full-disk
spectra each based on one of the dissipation prescriptions. Our most aggressive dissipation profile
results in a disk spectrum that is in approximate quantitative agreement with certain observations
of the steep power law (SPL) spectral states from some black hole X-ray binaries.
