Many decades of observations of active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries have shown that relativistic
jets are ubiquitous when compact objects accrete. One could therefore anticipate the launch of
a jet after a star is disrupted and accreted by a massive black hole. This birth of a relativistic jet
may have been observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which were discovered
in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has been detected from the tens of TDF candidates
that were discovered at optical to soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up
at radio frequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting, which reduces
the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing follow-up observation are mostly within
~10 months of the discovery, the non-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with
respect to the time of disruption. To test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets, we obtained 5
GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs. To avoid missing delayed jet
emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since the estimated time of disruption. None of the sources
are detected, with very deep upper limits at the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out
the hypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars. We also constrain the
possibility that the flares hosted a jet identical to Sw 1644+57, the first and best-sampled relativistic
TDF. We thus obtain evidence for a dichotomy in the stellar tidal disruption population, implying
that the jet launching mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the disruption.
