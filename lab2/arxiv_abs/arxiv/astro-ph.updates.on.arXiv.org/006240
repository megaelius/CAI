Young, rapidly spinning magnetars are invoked as central engines behind a diverse set of transient
astrophysical phenomena, including gamma-ray bursts (GRB), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe),
fast radio bursts (FRB), and binary neutron star (NS) mergers. However, a barrier to direct confirmation
of the magnetar hypothesis is the challenge of directly observing non-thermal emission from the
central engine at early times (when it is most powerful and thus detectable) due to the dense surrounding
ejecta. We present CLOUDY calculations of the time-dependent evolution of the temperature and
ionization structure of expanding supernova or merger ejecta due to photo-ionization by a magnetar
engine, in order to study the escape of X-rays (absorbed by neutral gas) and radio waves (absorbed
by ionized gas), as well as to assess the evolution of the local dispersion measure due to photo-ionization.
We find that ionization breakout does not occur if the engine's ionizing luminosity decays rapidly,
and that X-rays typically escape the oxygen-rich ejecta of SLSNe only on $\sim 100 \, {\rm yr}$ timescales,
consistent with current X-ray non-detections. We apply these results to constrain engine-driven
models for the binary NS merger GW170817 and the luminous transient ASASSN-15lh. In terms of radio
transparency and dispersion measure constraints, the repeating FRB 121102 is consistent with
originating from a young, $\gtrsim 30-100 \, {\rm yr}$, magnetar similar to those inferred to power
SLSNe. We further show that its high rotation measure can be produced within the same nebula that
is proposed to power the quiescent radio source observed co-located with FRB 121102. Our results
strengthen previous work suggesting that at least some FRBs may be produced by young magnetars,
and motivate further study of engine powered transients.
