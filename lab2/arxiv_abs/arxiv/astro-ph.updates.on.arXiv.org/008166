We report a comprehensive analysis of the global spectrophotometric properties of Ceres using
Dawn Framing Camera images collected from April to June 2015 during the RC3 and Survey mission phases.
The single-scattering albedo of Ceres at 555 nm is 0.14$\pm$0.04, the geometric albedo is 0.096$\pm$0.006,
and the Bond albedo is 0.037$\pm$0.002. The asymmetry factors calculated from the best-fit two-term
Henyey-Greenstein (HG) single-particle phase function (SPPF) show a wavelength dependence,
suggesting that the phase reddening of Ceres is dominated by single-particle scattering rather
than multiple scattering or small-scale surface roughness. The Hapke roughness parameter of Ceres
is derived to be 20$^\circ\pm$6$^\circ$ with no wavelength dependence. The phase function of Ceres
shows appreciably strong scattering around 90$^\circ$ phase angle that cannot be fitted with a
single-term HG SPPF, suggesting possible stronger forward scattering than other asteroids previously
analyzed with spacecraft data. We speculate that such a scattering characteristic of Ceres might
be related to its unique surface composition. We grouped the reflectance data into a 1$^\circ$ latitude-longitude
grid and fitted each grid independently to study the spatial variations of photometric properties.
The albedo and color maps are consistent with previous studies. The SPPF over the surface of Ceres
shows stronger backscattering associated with lower albedo and vice versa, consistent with the
general trend among asteroids. The Hapke roughness parameter does not vary much across the surface
of Ceres, except for the ancient Vendimia Planitia region that has a slightly higher roughness.
Based on the wavelength dependence of the SPPF of Ceres, we hypothesize that its regolith grains
either contain a considerable fraction of $\lessapprox\mu$m-sized particles, or are strongly
affected by internal scatterers of this size.
