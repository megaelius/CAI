% context We had detected J=1-0 HCO+ absorption in 12 directions lacking detected CO emission in
the outskirts of the Chamaeleon complex and on 1 sightline with integrated CO emission 2.4 K-\kms.
8 sightlines had a much larger mean column density of dark neutral medium (DNM)-gas not represented
in H I or CO emission-and were found to have much higher mean molecular column density. The 5 other
sightlines had little or no DNM and were found to have much smaller but still detectable N(HCO+).
% aims To determine N(CO) along previously-observed Chamaeleon sightlines and to determine why
CO emission was not detected in directions where molecular gas is present. % methods We took \cotw\
J=1-0 absorption profiles on 5 sightlines having higher DNM and HCO+ column densities and 1 sightline
with smaller N(DNM) and N(HCO+). We converted the integrated HCO+ optical depths to N(H2) in the
weak-excitation limit using N(HCO+)/N(H2)$=3\times10^{-9}$ and converted the integrated CO
optical depths \ICO\ to CO column density N(CO) $= 1.861\times 10^{15}\pcc \ICO^{1.131}$ as found
along comparable lines of sight previously studied in J=1-0 and J=2-1 CO absorption&emission.
%results CO absorption was detected along the 5 sightlines in the higher-DNM group, with CO column
densities $4\times 10^{13} \pcc<$ N(CO) $<10^{15}\pcc$ that are generally below the detectability
limit of CO emission surveys. %conclusions In the outskirts of the Chamaeleon complex, the presence
of molecular DNM resulted primarily from small CO column densities at the onset of CO formation around
the HI/\HH\ transition in diffuse molecular gas. CO relative abundances N(CO)/N(H2) $< 2\times
10^{-6}$ in the outskirts of Chamaeleon are comparable to those seen in UV absorption toward early-type
stars, including in Chamaeleon.
