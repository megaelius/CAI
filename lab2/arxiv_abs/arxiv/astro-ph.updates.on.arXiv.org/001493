Context. Observation of Balmer lines from the region around the forward shock of supernova remnants
(SNR) may provide valuable information on the shock dynamics and the efficiency of particle acceleration
at the shock. Aims. We calculated the Balmer line emission and the shape of the broad Balmer line for
parameter values suitable for SNR RCW 86 (G315.4-2.3) as a function of the cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration
efficiency and of the level of thermal equilibration between electrons and protons behind the shock.
This calculation aims at using the width of the broad Balmer-line emission to infer the CR acceleration
efficiency in this remnant. Methods. We used the recently developed nonlinear theory of diffusive
shock-acceleration in the presence of neutrals. The semianalytical approach we developed includes
a description of magnetic field amplification as due to resonant streaming instability, the dynamical
reaction of accelerated particles and the turbulent magnetic field on the shock, and all channels
of interaction between neutral hydrogen atoms and background ions that are relevant for the shock
dynamics. Results. We derive the CR acceleration efficiency in the SNR RCW 86 from the Balmer emission.
Since our calculation used recent measurements of the shock proper motion, the results depend on
the assumed distance to Earth. For a distance of 2 kpc the measured width of the broad Balmer line is
compatible with the absence of CR acceleration. For a distance of 2.5 kpc, which is a widely used value
in current literature, a CR acceleration efficiency of 5-30% is obtained, depending upon the electron-ion
equilibration and the ionization fraction upstream of the shock. By combining information on Balmer
emission with the measured value of the downstream electron temperature, we constrain the CR acceleration
efficiency to be ~20%.
