We present analysis of magnetic field and vertical electric currents (VECs) in seven solar flare
regions accompanied by pulsations of hard X-ray (HXR) emission. These flares were studied by Kuznetsov
et al. (2016) and chosen here because of the availability of the vector magnetograms for their parent
active regions (ARs) obtained with the SDO/HMI data. By extrapolation of magnetic field with the
non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) method we found that before each flare there was a magnetic
flux rope (MFR) elongated along and above a magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL) on the photosphere.
In two flare regions the sources of the HXR pulsations were located at footpoints of different magnetic
field lines wrapping around the central axis, and constituting an MFR by themselves. In five other
flares the parent field lines of the HXR pulsations were not a part of an MFR, but surrounded it in the
form of an arcade of magnetic loops. Also, we found that in three out of seven events the sources of
the HXR pulsations were located in vicinity of enhanced ($\gtrsim 10^{4}$~statampere~cm$^{-2}$)
regions of VECs on the photosphere, having the form of extended ribbons elongated ($\gtrsim 10$~Mm)
mainly along an MPIL. In four remaining events VECs are concentrated in multiple tiny ($\lesssim
5$~Mm) islands scattered around the MPIL. In general, the HXR sources are found to locate close but
out of the sites of the highest VECs on the photosphere. There are no significant correlations between
intensity of the HXR sources and characteristics of VECs and magnetic field components (as well
as of their evolution in time) on the photosphere beneath the HXR sources. All these observational
results are in favor of the concept that the HXR pulsations are a consequence of successive episodes
of energy release in different magnetic flux tubes of a complex AR triggered by non-uniform eruption
of an MFR.
