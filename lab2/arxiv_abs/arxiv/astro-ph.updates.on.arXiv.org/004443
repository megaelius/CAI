Using data from the GALAH pilot survey, we determined properties of the Galactic thin and thick disk
near the solar neighbourhood. The data cover a small range of Galactocentric radius ($7.9 \leq R_\mathrm{GC}
\leq 9.5$ kpc), but extends up to 4 kpc in height from the Galactic plane, and several kpc in the direction
of Galactic anti-rotation. This allows us to measure reliably the vertical density and abundance
profiles of the chemically and kinematically defined `thick' and `thin' disks of the Galaxy. We
found scale heights of $0.40 \pm 0.02$ kpc and $0.81 \pm 0.04$ kpc for the low- and high-$\alpha$ populations,
respectively. The thin disk (low-$\alpha$ population) exhibits a steep negative vertical metallicity
gradient, at d[M/H]/d$z=-0.18 \pm 0.01$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, which is broadly consistent with previous
studies. In contrast, its vertical $\alpha$-abundance profile is almost flat, with a gradient
of d[$\alpha$/M]/d$z$ = $0.008 \pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The steep metallicity gradient of the
low-$\alpha$ population seems consistent with various radial migration predictions and further
confirms that migration plays an important role in the evolution of the thin disk. The thick disk
(high-$\alpha$ population) has a weaker vertical metallicity gradient d[M/H]/d$z = -0.058 \pm
0.003$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The $\alpha$-abundance of the thick disk is nearly constant with height,
d[$\alpha$/M]/d$z$ = $0.007 \pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The negative gradient in metallicity and
the small gradient in [$\alpha$/M] indicate that the high-$\alpha$ population experienced a settling
phase, but also formed prior to the onset of major SNeIa enrichment. We explore the implications
of the distinct $\alpha$-enrichments and narrow [$\alpha$/M] range of the sub-populations in
the context of thick disk formation.
