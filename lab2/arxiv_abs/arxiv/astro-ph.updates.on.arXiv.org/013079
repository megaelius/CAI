Recent ALMA observations suggest that the highest velocity part of molecular protostellar jets
are launched from the dust-sublimation regions of the accretion disks (<0.3 au). However, formation
and survival of molecules in inner protostellar disk winds, in the presence of a harsh FUV radiation
field and the absence of dust, remain unexplored. We aim at determining if simple molecules can be
synthesized and spared in fast and collimated dust-free disk winds or if a fraction of dust is necessary
to explain the observed molecular abundances. This work is based on the Paris-Durham shock code
designed to model irradiated environments. Fundamental properties of the dust-free chemistry
are investigated from single point models. A laminar 1D disk wind model is then built using a parametric
flow geometry. This model includes time-dependent chemistry and the attenuation of the radiation
field by gas-phase photoprocesses. We show that a small fraction of H2 (< 1e-2), primarily formed
through the H- route, can efficiently initiate molecule synthesis such as CO and SiO above TK ~ 800
K. The attenuation of the radiation field by atomic species (eg. C, Si, S) proceeds through continuum
self-shielding. This process ensures efficient formation of CO, OH, SiO, H2O through neutral-neutral
reactions, and the survival of these molecules. Class 0 dust-free winds with high mass-loss rates
($\dot{M}_w >$ 2e-6 Msun/yr) are predicted to be rich in molecules if warm (TK > 800 K). The molecular
content of disk winds is very sensitive to the presence of dust and a mass-fraction of surviving dust
as small as 1e-5 significantly increases the H2O and SiO abundances. Chemistry of high-velocity
jets is a powerful tool to probe their content in dust and uncover their launching point. Models of
internal shocks are required to fully exploit the current (sub-)millimeter observations and prepare
future JWST observations.
