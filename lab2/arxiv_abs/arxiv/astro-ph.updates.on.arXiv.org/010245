Fluctuations of solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameters exhibit a typical turbulence power
spectrum with a spectral index ranging between $\sim -5/3$ and $\sim -3/2$. In particular, at $1$
AU, the magnetic field spectrum, observed within fast corotating streams, also shows a clear steepening
for frequencies higher than the typical proton scales, of the order of $\sim 3\times10^{-1}$ Hz,
and a flattening towards $1/f$ at frequencies lower than $\sim 10^{-3}$ Hz. However, the current
literature reports observations of the low-frequency break only for fast streams. Slow streams,
as observed to date, have not shown a clear break, and this has commonly been attributed to slow wind
intervals not being long enough. Actually, because of the longer transit time from the Sun, slow
wind turbulence would be older and the frequency break would be shifted to lower frequencies with
respect to fast wind. Based on this hypothesis, we performed a careful search for long-lasting slow
wind intervals throughout $12$ years of Wind satellite measurements. Our search, based on stringent
requirements not only on wind speed but also on the level of magnetic compressibility and Alfv\'enicity
of the turbulent fluctuations, yielded $48$ slow wind streams lasting longer than $7$ days. This
result allowed us to extend our study to frequencies sufficiently low and, for the first time in the
literature, we are able to show that the $1/f$ magnetic spectral scaling is also present in the slow
solar wind, provided the interval is long enough. However, this is not the case for the slow wind velocity
spectrum, which keeps the typical Kolmogorov scaling throughout the analysed frequency range.
After ruling out the possible role of compressibility and Alfv\'enicity for the 1/f scaling, a possible
explanation in terms of magnetic amplitude saturation, as recently proposed in the literature,
is suggested.
