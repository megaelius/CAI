Ultra-cool brown dwarfs offer a unique window into understanding substellar atmospheric physics
and chemistry. Their strong molecular absorption bands at infrared wavelengths, Jupiter-like
radii, cool temperatures, and lack of complicating stellar irradiation, make them ideal test-beds
for understanding Jovian-like atmospheres. Here we report the findings of a uniform atmospheric
retrieval analysis on a set of 14 Y and T-dwarfs observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field
Camera 3 instrument. From our retrieval analysis, we find the temperature-structures to be largely
consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium in most objects. We also determine the abundances
of water, methane, and ammonia and upper limits on the alkali metals sodium and potassium. The constraints
on water and methane are consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models, while those
of ammonia may be affected by vertical disequilibrium mixing, consistent with previous works.
Our key result stems from the constraints on the alkali metal abundances where we find their continued
depletion with decreasing effective temperature, consistent with the trend identified in a previous
retrieval analysis on a sample of slightly warmer late T-dwarfs in Line et al. (2017). These constraints
show that the previously observed Y-J color trend across the T/Y transition is most likely due to
the depletion of these metals in accordance with predictions from equilibrium condensate rainout
chemistry. Finally, we simulate future James Webb Space Telescope observations of ultra-cool
dwarfs and find that the NIRSpec PRISM offers the best chance at developing high-precision constraints
on fundamental atmospheric characteristics.
