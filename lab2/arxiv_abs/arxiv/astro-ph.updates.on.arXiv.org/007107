We constrain cosmological parameters by analysing the angular power spectra of the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey DR12 galaxies, a spectroscopic follow-up of around 1.3 million SDSS galaxies
over 9,376 deg$^2$ with an effective volume of $\sim 6.5$ (Gpc $h^{-1}$)$^3$ in the redshift range
$0.15 \leq z < 0.80$. We split this sample into 13 tomographic bins ($\Delta z = 0.05$); angular power
spectra were calculated using a Pseudo-$C_{\ell}$ estimator, and covariance matrices were estimated
using log-normal simulated maps. Cosmological constraints obtained from these data were combined
with constraints from Planck CMB experiment as well as the JLA supernovae compilation. Considering
a $w$CDM cosmological model measured on scales up to $k_{max} = 0.07h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we constrain
a constant dark energy equation-of-state with a $\sim 4\%$ error at the 1-$\sigma$ level: $w_0 =
-0.993^{+0.046}_{-0.043}$, together with $\Omega_m = 0.330\pm 0.012$, $\Omega_b = 0.0505 \pm
0.002$, $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3} = 0.863 \pm 0.016$, and $h = 0.661 \pm 0.012$.
For the same combination of datasets, but now considering a $\Lambda$CDM model with massive neutrinos
and the same scale cut, we find: $\Omega_m = 0.328 \pm 0.009$, $\Omega_b = 0.05017^{+0.0009}_{-0.0008}$,
$S_8 = 0.862 \pm 0.017$, and $h = 0.663^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ and a 95\% credible interval (CI) upper
limit of $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.14$ eV for a normal hierarchy. These results are competitive if not better
than standard analyses with the same dataset, and demonstrate this should be a method of choice for
future surveys, opening the door for their full exploitation in cross-correlations probes.
