Giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are well-studied in the local Universe, however, exactly how their
properties vary during galaxy evolution is poorly understood due to challenging resolution requirements,
both observational and computational. We present the first time-dependent analysis of giant molecular
clouds in a Milky Way-like galaxy and an LMC-like dwarf galaxy of the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic
Environments) simulation suite, which have sufficient resolution to predict the bulk properties
of GMCs in cosmological galaxy formation self-consistently. We show explicitly that the majority
of star formation outside the galactic center occurs within self-gravitating gas structures that
have properties consistent with observed bound GMCs. We find that the typical cloud bulk properties
such as mass and surface density do not vary more than a factor of 2 in any systematic way after the first
Gyr of cosmic evolution within a given galaxy from its progenitor. While the median properties are
constant, the tails of the distributions can briefly undergo drastic changes, which can produce
very massive and dense self-gravitating gas clouds. Once the galaxy forms, we identify only two
systematic trends in bulk properties over cosmic time: a steady increase in metallicity produced
by previous stellar populations and a weak decrease in bulk cloud temperatures. With the exception
of metallicity we find no significant differences in cloud properties between the Milky Way-like
and dwarf galaxies. These results have important implications for cosmological star and star cluster
formation and put especially strong constraints on theories relating the stellar initial mass
function to cloud properties.
