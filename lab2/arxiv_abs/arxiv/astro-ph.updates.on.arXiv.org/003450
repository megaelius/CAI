The eruption of a large quiescent prominence on 17 August 2013 and associated coronal mass ejection
(CME) were observed from different vantage points by Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Solar-Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO), and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Screening of
the quiet Sun by the prominence produced an isolated negative microwave burst. We estimated parameters
of the erupting prominence from a model of radio absorption and measured from 304 \AA\ images. Their
variations obtained by both methods are similar and agree within a factor of two. The CME development
was studied from the kinematics of the front and different components of the core and their structural
changes. The results are verified using movies in which the CME expansion was compensated according
to the measured kinematics. We found that the CME mass ($3.6 \times 10^{15}$ g) was mainly supplied
by the prominence ($\approx 6 \times 10^{15}$ g), while a considerable part drained back. The mass
of the coronal-temperature component did not exceed $10^{15}$ g. The CME was initiated by the erupting
prominence, which constituted its core and remained active. The structural and kinematical changes
started in the core and propagated outward. The CME structures continued to form during expansion,
which did not become self-similar up to $25 R_\odot$. The aerodynamic drag was insignificant. The
core formed until $4 R_\odot$. Some of its components were observed to straighten and stretch forward,
indicating the transformation of tangled structures of the core into a simpler flux rope, which
grew and filled the cavity as the CME expanded.
