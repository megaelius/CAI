Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 120729A was detected by Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM, and then rapidly observed
by Swift/XRT, Swift/UVOT, and ground-based telescopes. It had a single long and smooth \gamma-ray
emission pulse, which extends continuously to the X-rays. We report Lick/KAIT observations of
the source, and make temporal and spectral joint fits of the multiwavelength light curves of GRB
120729A. It exhibits achromatic light-curve behavior, consistent with the predictions of the
external shock model. The light curves are decomposed into four typical phases: onset bump (Phase
I), normal decay (Phase II), shallow decay (Phase III), and post-jet break (Phase IV). The spectral
energy distribution (SED) evolves from prompt \gamma-ray emission to the afterglow with photon
index from $\Gamma_{\rm \gamma}=1.36$ to $\Gamma \approx 1.75$. There is no obvious evolution
of the SED during the afterglow. The multiwavelength light curves from \gamma-ray to optical can
be well modeled with an external shock by considering energy injection, and a time-dependent microphysics
model with $\epsilon_B\propto t^{\alpha_B}$ for the emission at early times, $T < T_{\rm 0} + 157$~s.
Therefore, we conclude that both the prompt \gamma-ray emission and afterglow of GRB 120729A have
the same external shock physical origin. Our model indicates that the $\epsilon_B$ evolution can
be described as a broken power-law function with $\alpha_{\rm B,1} = 0.18 \pm 0.04$ and $\alpha_{\rm
B,2} = 0.84 \pm 0.04$. We also systematically investigate single-pulse GRBs in the Swift era, finding
that only a small fraction of GRBs (GRBs 120729A, 051111, and 070318) are likely to originate from
an external shock for both the prompt \gamma-ray emission and afterglow.
