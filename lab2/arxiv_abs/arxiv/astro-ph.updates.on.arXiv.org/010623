We investigate the accuracy of 4000\AA/Balmer-break based redshifts by combining Hubble Space
Telescope ({\it HST}) grism data with photometry. The grism spectra are from the Probing Evolution
And Reionization Spectroscopically (PEARS) survey with {\it HST} using the G800L grism on the Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS). The photometric data come from a compilation by the 3D-HST collaboration
of imaging from multiple surveys (notably CANDELS and 3D-HST). We show evidence that spectrophotometric
redshifts (SPZs) typically improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts by $\sim$17--60\%.
Our SPZ method is a template fitting based routine which accounts for correlated data between neighboring
points within grism spectra via the covariance matrix formalism and also accounts for galaxy morphology
along the dispersion direction. We show that the robustness of the SPZ is directly related to the
fidelity of the D4000 measurement. We also estimate the accuracy of continuum-based redshifts,
i.e., for galaxies that do not contain strong emission lines, based on the grism data alone ($\sigma^{\rm
NMAD}_{\Delta z/(1+z)}{\lesssim}0.06$). Given that future space-based observatories like
WFIRST and Euclid will spend a significant fraction of time on slitless spectroscopic observations,
we estimate number densities for objects with $\ | \mathrm{\Delta z/(1+z_{s})} \ | \leq 0.02$. We
predict $\sim$700--4400 galaxies/degree$^2$ for galaxies with D4000$>$1.1 and $\ | \mathrm{\Delta
z/(1+z_{s})} \ | \leq 0.02$ to a limiting depth of $i_{AB}$=24 mag. This is \emph{especially} important
in the absence of an accompanying rich photometric dataset like the existing one for the CANDELS
fields, where redshift accuracy from future surveys will rely only on the presence of a feature like
the 4000\AA/Balmer breaks or the presence of emission lines within the grism spectra.
