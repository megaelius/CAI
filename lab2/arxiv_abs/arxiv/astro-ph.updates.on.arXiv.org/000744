An X3.4 solar flare and a fast halo coronal mass ejection (CME) occurred on 2006 December 13, accompanied
by a high flux of energetic particles recorded both in near-Earth space and at ground level. Our purpose
is to provide evidence of flare acceleration in a major solar energetic particle (SEP) event. We
first present observations from ACE/EPAM, GOES, and the Apatity neutron monitor. It is found that
the initial particle release time coincides with the flare emission and that the spectrum becomes
softer and the anisotropy becomes weaker during particle injection, indicating that the acceleration
source changes from a confined coronal site to a widespread interplanetary CME-driven shock. We
then describe a comprehensive study of the associated flare active region. By use of imaging data
from HINODE/SOT and SOHO/MDI magnetogram, we infer the flare magnetic reconnection rate in the
form of the magnetic flux change rate. This correlates in time with the microwave emission, indicating
a physical link between the flare magnetic reconnection and the acceleration of nonthermal particles.
Combining radio spectrograph data from Huairou/NOAC, Culgoora/IPS, Learmonth/RSTN, and WAVES/WIND
leads to a continuous and longlasting radio burst extending from a few GHz down to several kHz. Based
on the photospheric vector magnetogram from Huairou/NOAC and the nonlinear force free field (NFFF)
reconstruction method, we derive the 3D magnetic field configuration shortly after the eruption.
Furthermore, we also compute coronal field lines extending to a few solar radii using a potential-field
source-surface (PFSS) model. Both the so-called type III-l burst and the magnetic field configuration
suggest that open-field lines extend from the flare active region into interplanetary space, allowing
the accelerated and charged particles escape.
