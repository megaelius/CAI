With an aim of investigating the nature of evolution-induced mixing in the envelope of evolved intermediate-mass
stars, we carried out an extensive spectroscopic study for 12 Cepheid variables of various pulsation
periods (~2-16 days) to determine the photospheric abundances of C, N, O, and Na, which are the key
elements for investigating how the H-burning products are salvaged from the interior, based on
122 high-dispersion echelle spectra (~10 per target) of wide wavelength coverage collected at
Bohyunsan Astronomical Observatory. Having established the relevant atmospheric parameters
corresponding to each phase spectroscopically from the equivalent widths of Fe I and Fe II lines,
we derived C, N, O, and Na abundances from C I, O I, N I, and Na I lines by using the spectrum-synthesis
fitting technique, while taking into account the non-LTE effect. The resulting abundances of these
elements for 12 program stars turned out to show remarkably small star-to-star dispersions (<~0.1-0.2dex)
without any significant dependence upon the pulsation period: near-solar Fe ([Fe/H] ~0.0), moderately
underabundant C ([C/H] -0.3), appreciably overabundant N ([N/H] ~+0.4-0.5), and mildly supersolar
Na ([Na/H] +0.2). We conclude the following implications from these observational facts: (1) These
CNO abundance trends can be interpreted mainly as due to the canonical dredge-up of CN-cycled material,
while any significant non-canonical deep mixing of ON-cycled gas is ruled out (though only a slight
mixing may still be possible). (2) The mild but definite overabundance of Na suggests that the NeNa-cycle
product is also dredged up. (3) The extent of mixing-induced peculiarities in the envelope of Cepheid
variables is essentially independent on the absolute magnitude; i.e., also on the stellar mass.
