Simpson's paradox, or the Yule-Simpson effect, arises when a trend appears in different subsets
of data but disappears or reverses when these subsets are combined. We describe here seven cases
of this phenomenon for chemo-kinematical relations believed to constrain the Milky Way disk formation
and evolution. We show that interpreting trends in relations, such as the radial and vertical chemical
abundance gradients, the age-metallicity relation, and the metallicity-rotational velocity
relation (MVR), can lead to conflicting conclusions about the Galaxy past if analyses marginalize
over stellar age and/or birth radius. It is demonstrated that the MVR in RAVE giants is consistent
with being always strongly negative, when narrow bins of [Mg/Fe] are considered. This is directly
related to the negative radial metallicity gradients of stars grouped by common age (mono-age populations)
due to the inside out disk formation. The effect of the asymmetric drift can then give rise to a positive
MVR trend in high-[alpha/Fe] stars, with a slope dependent on a given survey's selection function
and observational uncertainties. We also study the variation of lithium abundance, A(Li), with
[Fe/H] of AMBRE:HARPS dwarfs. A strong reversal in the positive A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend of the total
sample is found for mono-age populations, flattening for younger groups of stars. Dissecting by
birth radius shows strengthening in the positive A(Li)-[Fe/H] trend, shifting to higher [Fe/H]
with decreasing birth radius; these observational results suggest new constraints on chemical
evolution models. This work highlights the necessity for precise age estimates for large stellar
samples covering wide spatial regions.
