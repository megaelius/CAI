Study of exoplanets is one of the main goals of present research in planetary sciences and astrobiology.
Analysis of huge planetary data from space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler is directed ultimately
at finding a planet similar to Earth -- the Earth's twin, and answering the question of potential
exo-habitability. The Earth Similarity Index (ESI) is a first step in this quest, ranging from 1
(Earth) to 0 (totally dissimilar to Earth). It was defined for the four physical parameters of a planet:
radius, density, escape velocity and surface temperature. The ESI is further sub-divided into
interior ESI (geometrical mean of radius and density) and surface ESI (geometrical mean of escape
velocity and surface temperature). The challenge here is to determine which exoplanet parameter(s)
is important in finding this similarity; how exactly the individual parameters entering the interior
ESI and surface ESI are contributing to the global ESI. Since the surface temperature entering surface
ESI is a non-observable quantity, it is difficult to determine its value. Using the known data for
the Solar System objects, we established the calibration relation between surface and equilibrium
temperatures to devise an effective way to estimate the value of the surface temperature of exoplanets
for further analysis with our graphic methodology. A new approach, called Mars Similarity Index
(MSI), is introduced to identify planets that may be habitable to the extreme forms of life. MSI is
defined in the range between 1 (present Mars) and 0 (dissimilar to present Mars) and uses the same
physical parameters as ESI. We are interested in Mars-like planets to search for planets that may
host the extreme life forms, such as the ones living in extreme environments on Earth; for example,
methane on Mars may be a product of the methane-specific extremophile life form metabolism.
