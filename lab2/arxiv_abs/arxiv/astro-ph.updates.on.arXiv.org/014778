On 2018, April 29, a bright classical nova (CN) Per 2018 was discovered. Its progenitor is a well-known
dwarf nova V392 Per. In this contribution, we analyze $UBVR_{C}I_{C}$ photometry and optical spectroscopy
of the CN V392 Per. From the $V$ light curve (LC) we found the brightness decline times t$_{2,V}$ =
3 d, t$_{3,V}$ = 10 d and calculated absolute magnitude of the nova at maximum $MV_{max}$ = -9.30 ${\pm}$0.57
using the new $MV_{max}$ - t$_{3}$ "universal" decline law and $MV_{15}$ relations, adopting the
Gaia data for CNe. We determined the colour excess $E_{B-V}$ = 0.90$\pm$0.09 and distance to the
nova $d$ = 3.55$\pm$0.6 kpc. The optical spectrum obtained in brightness maximum resembles that
of the F2 supergiant. Its bolometric luminosity computed by fitting the continuum by atmospheric
and black-body models is in agreement with the luminosity, that we have found from photometry. We
estimated the mass of the ONe white dwarf in V392 Per as $M_{wd}$ = 1.21 M$_{\odot}$. The CN Per 2018
can be classified as a fast super-Eddington nova with an outburst LC of plateau type. Nova displayed
He/N spectrum classification, large expansion velocities, and triple-peaked emission-line
profiles during the decline, explained by equatorial ring seen nearly face on and a bipolar flow
aligned almost with the line of sight. The post maximum spectra of CN Per 2018 and available radio
data were used to estimate the inclination angle of the system as $i\sim$ 9$^{\circ}$. The difference
in intensity of redward and blueward emission bumps is possible to explain by about 1.5 times higher
density of the receding outtflow. The rapid increase of the bipolar outflow radial velocities by
$\sim$300 km/s around day 5 after the maximum was caused by the fast bipolar winds from the burning
white dwarf after shrinking of its pseudophotosphere.
