Stellar population synthesis is an important method in the galaxy and star-cluster studies. In
the stellar population synthesis models, stellar spectral library is necessary for the integrated
spectra of the stellar population. Usually, the stellar spectral library is used to the transformation
between the stellar atmospheric parameters and the stellar spectrum. The empirical stellar spectral
library has irreplaceable advantages than the theoretical library. However, for the empirical
spectral library, the distribution of stars is irregularly in the stellar atmospheric parameter
space, this makes the traditional interpolator difficult to get the accurate results. In this work,
we will provide an improved radial basis function interpolator which is used to obtain the interpolated
stellar spectra based on the empirical stellar spectral library. For this interpolator, we use
the relation between the standard variance {\sigma} in the Gaussian radial basis function and the
density distribution of stars in the stellar atmospheric parameter space to give the prior constraint
on this {\sigma}. Moreover, we also consider the anisotropic radius basis function by the advantage
of the local dispersion of stars in the stellar atmospheric parameter space. Furthermore, we use
the empirical stellar spectral library MILES to test this interpolator. On the whole, the interpolator
has a good performance except for the edge of the low-temperature region. At last, we compare this
interpolator with the work in Cheng et al. (2018), the interpolation result shows an obvious improvement.
Users can use this interpolator to get the interpolated spectra based on the stellar spectral library
quickly and easily.
