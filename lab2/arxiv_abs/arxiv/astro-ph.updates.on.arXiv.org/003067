Plate tectonics is a fundamental component for the habitability of the Earth. Yet whether it is a
recurrent feature of terrestrial bodies orbiting other stars or unique to the Earth is unknown.
The stagnant lid may rather be the most common tectonic expression on such bodies. To understand
whether a stagnant-lid planet can be habitable, i.e. host liquid water at its surface, we model the
thermal evolution of the mantle, volcanic outgassing of H$_2$O and CO$_2$, and resulting climate
of an Earth-like planet lacking plate tectonics. We used a 1D model of parameterized convection
to simulate the evolution of melt generation and the build-up of an atmosphere of H$_2$O and CO$_2$
over 4.5 Gyr. We then employed a 1D radiative-convective atmosphere model to calculate the global
mean atmospheric temperature and the boundaries of the habitable zone (HZ). The evolution of the
interior is characterized by the initial production of a large amount of partial melt accompanied
by a rapid outgassing of H$_2$O and CO$_2$. At 1 au, the obtained temperatures generally allow for
liquid water on the surface nearly over the entire evolution. While the outer edge of the HZ is mostly
influenced by the amount of outgassed CO$_2$, the inner edge presents a more complex behaviour that
is dependent on the partial pressures of both gases. At 1 au, the stagnant-lid planet considered
would be regarded as habitable. The width of the HZ at the end of the evolution, albeit influenced
by the amount of outgassed CO$_2$, can vary in a non-monotonic way depending on the extent of the outgassed
H$_2$O reservoir. Our results suggest that stagnant-lid planets can be habitable over geological
timescales and that joint modelling of interior evolution, volcanic outgassing, and accompanying
climate is necessary to robustly characterize planetary habitability.
