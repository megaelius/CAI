We present an extension of our previous research on the early-type galaxy population of the Antlia
cluster (d ~ 35 Mpc), achieving a total coverage of ~ 2.6 deg x deg and performing surface photometry
for ~300 galaxies, 130 of which are new uncatalogued ones. Such new galaxies mainly fall in the low
surface brightness (LSB) regime, but there are also some lenticulars (S0) which support the existence
of unique functions that connect bright and dwarf galaxies in the scaling relations. We analyse
the projected spatial distribution of galaxies up to a distance of ~800 kpc from NGC 3268, the adopted
centre, as well as the radial velocity distribution and the correlation between galaxy colour and
effective radius with the projected spatial distribution. We also obtain the luminosity function
of the early-type galaxies and the distribution of stellar masses using the T1-band magnitudes
and adopted mass-luminosity ratios. Additionally, we correlate the central galaxy distribution
with an X-ray emission map from the literature. Based on the analysis of the radial velocities and
galaxy colour distributions, we find that galaxies redder than the colour-magnitude relation
(CMR) have a velocity distribution strongly concentrated towards the values of the dominant galaxies
and are homogeneously distributed throughout the cluster. Those bluer than the CMR, in turn, have
a much more extended radial velocity distribution and are concentrated towards the centre of the
cluster. We also identify 12 candidates to ultra diffuse galaxies (UDG), that seem to be split into
two families, and speculate about their origins in the context of the cluster structure.
