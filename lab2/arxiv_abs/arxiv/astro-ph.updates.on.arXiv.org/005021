Magnetic fields pervade in the interstellar medium (ISM) and are believed to be important in the
process of star formation, yet probing magnetic fields in star formation regions is challenging.
We propose a new method to use Faraday rotation measurements in small scale star forming regions
to find the direction and magnitude of the component of magnetic field along the line-of-sight.
We test the proposed method in four relatively nearby regions of Orion A, Orion B, Perseus, and California.
We use rotation measure data from the literature. We adopt a simple approach based on relative measurements
to estimate the rotation measure due to the molecular clouds over the Galactic contribution. We
then use a chemical evolution code along with extinction maps of each cloud to find the electron column
density of the molecular cloud at the position of each rotation measure data point. Combining the
rotation measures produced by the molecular clouds and the electron column density, we calculate
the line-of-sight magnetic field strength and direction. In California and Orion A, we find clear
evidence that the magnetic fields at one side of these filamentary structures are pointing towards
us and are pointing away from us at the other side. Even though the magnetic fields in Perseus might
seem to suggest the same behavior, not enough data points are available to draw such conclusions.
In Orion B, as well, there are not enough data points available to detect such behavior. This behavior
is consistent with a helical magnetic field morphology. In the vicinity of available Zeeman measurements
in OMC-1, OMC-B, and the dark cloud Barnard 1, we find magnetic field values of $-23\pm38~\mu$G,
$-129\pm28~\mu$G, and $32\pm101~\mu$G, respectively, which are in agreement with the Zeeman
Measurements.
