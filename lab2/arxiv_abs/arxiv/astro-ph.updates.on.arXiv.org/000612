It has recently been discovered that the Galactic bulge is X-shaped, with the two southern arms of
the X both crossing the lines of sight at l=0 and |b|>4, hence producing a double red clump (RC)
in the bulge CMD. Dynamical models predict the formation of X-shaped bulges, as extreme cases of
boxy-peanut bulges. However, since X-shaped bulges were known to be present only in external galaxies,
models have never been compared to 3D kinematical data for individual stars. We study the orbital
motion of Galactic bulge stars, in the two arms of the X in the southern hemisphere. The goal is to provide
observational constraints to bulge formation models that predict the formation of X-shapes through
bar dynamical instabilities. Radial velocities have been obtained for a sample of 454 bulge giants,
roughly equally distributed between the bright and faint RC, in a field at (l,b)=(0,-6). Proper
motions were derived for all RC stars in the same field by combining images from two epochs obtained
11 years apart. The proper motions for the spectroscopic subsample are analyzed taking into account
the radial velocities and metallicities measured from near-IR Calcium triplet lines, for a subsample
of 352 stars. The radial velocity distribution of stars in the bright RC, tracing the closer overdensity
of bulge stars, shows an excess of stars moving towards the Sun. Similarly, an excess of stars receding
from the Sun is seen in the far overdensity, traced by faint RC stars. This is explained with the presence
of stars on elongated orbits, most likely streaming along the arms of the X-shaped bulge. Proper
motions for these stars are consistent with qualitative predictions of dynamical models of peanut-shaped
bulges. Surprisingly, stars on elongated orbits have preferentially metal poor metallicities,
while the metal rich ones, in both overdensities, are preferentially found in more axysimmetric
orbits.
