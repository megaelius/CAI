Context. Absorbing galaxies are selected via the detection of characteristic absorption lines
which their gas-rich media imprint in the spectra of distant light-beacons. The proximity of the
typically faint foreground absorbing galaxies to bright background sources makes it challenging
to robustly identify these in emission, and hence to characterise their relation to the general
galaxy population. Aims. We search for emission to confirm and characterise ten galaxies hosting
damped, metal-rich quasar absorbers at redshift z < 1. Methods. We identify the absorbing galaxies
by matching spectroscopic absorption -and emission redshifts and from projected separations.
Combining emission-line diagnostics with existing absorption spectroscopy and photometry of
quasar-fields hosting metal-rich, damped absorbers, we compare our new detections with reference
samples and place them on scaling relations. Results. We spectroscopically confirm seven galaxies
harbouring damped absorbers (a 70% success-rate). Our results conform to the emerging picture
that neutral gas on scales of tens of kpc in galaxies is what causes the characteristic Hi absorption.
Our key results are: (I) Absorbing galaxies with $\log _{10} [M_\star ~(M_\odot)] \gtrsim 10$ have
star formation rates that are lower than predicted for the main sequence of star formation. (II)
The distribution of impact parameter with Hi column density and with absorption-metallicity for
absorbing galaxies at $z\sim 2-3$ extends to $z\sim 0.7$ and to lower Hi column densities. (III)
A robust mean metallicity gradient of $\langle \Gamma \rangle = 0.022 \pm 0.001~[dex~kpc^{-1}]$.
(IV) By correcting absorption metallicities for $\langle \Gamma \rangle$ and imposing a truncation-radius
at $12~\mathrm{kpc}$, absorbing galaxies fall on top of predicted mass-metallicity relations,
with a statistically significant decrease in scatter.
