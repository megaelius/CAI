Different massive black hole mass - host galaxy scaling relations suggest that the growth of massive
black holes is entangled with the evolution of their host galaxies. The number of measured black
hole masses is still limited, and additional measurements are necessary to understand the underlying
physics of this apparent co-evolution. We add six new black hole mass (MBH) measurements of nearby
fast rotating early-type galaxies to the known black hole mass sample, namely NGC 584, NGC 2784,
NGC 3640, NGC 4570, NGC 4281 and NGC 7049. Our target galaxies have effective velocity dispersions
({\sigma}e) between 170 and 245 km s^(-1), and thus this work provides additional insight into the
black hole properties of intermediate-mass early-type galaxies. We combine high-resolution
adaptive-optics SINFONI data with large-scale MUSE, VIMOS and SAURON data from ATLAS3D to derive
two-dimensional stellar kinematics maps. We then build both Jeans Anisotropic Models and axisymmetric
Schwarzschild models to measure the central black hole masses. Our Schwarzschild models provide
black hole masses which are consistent with recent MBH-{\sigma}e scaling relations. NGC 3640 has
a velocity dispersion dip and NGC 7049 a constant velocity dispersion in the center, but we can clearly
constrain their lower black hole mass limit. We conclude our analysis with a test on NGC 4570 taking
into account a variable mass-to-light ratio (M/L) when constructing dynamical models. When considering
M/L variations linked mostly to radial changes in the stellar metallicity, we find that the dynamically
determined black hole mass from NGC 4570 decreases by 30%. Further investigations are needed in
the future to account for the impact of radial M/L gradients on dynamical modeling.
