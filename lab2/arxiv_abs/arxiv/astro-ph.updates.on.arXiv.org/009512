We explore a class of simple non-equilibrium star formation models within the framework of a feedback-regulated
model of the ISM, applicable to kiloparsec-scale resolved star formation relations (e.g. Kennicutt-Schmidt).
Combining a Toomre-Q-dependent local star formation efficiency per free-fall time with a model
for delayed feedback, we are able to match the normalization and scatter of resolved star formation
scaling relations. In particular, this simple model suggests that large ($\sim$dex) variations
in star formation rates (SFRs) on kiloparsec scales may be due to the fact that supernova feedback
is not instantaneous following star formation. The scatter in SFRs at constant gas surface density
in a galaxy then depends on the properties of feedback and when we observe its star-forming regions
at various points throughout their collapse/star formation "cycles". This has the following important
observational consequences: (1) the scatter and normalization of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
are relatively insensitive to the local (small-scale) star formation efficiency, (2) but gas depletion
times and velocity dispersions are; (3) the scatter in and normalization of the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation is a sensitive probe of the feedback timescale and strength; (4) even in a model where $\tilde
Q_{\rm gas}$ deterministically dictates star formation locally, time evolution, variation in
local conditions (e.g., gas fractions and dynamical times), and variations between galaxies can
destroy much of the observable correlation between SFR and $\tilde Q_{\rm gas}$ in resolved galaxy
surveys. Additionally, this model exhibits large scatter in SFRs at low gas surface densities,
in agreement with observations of flat outer HI disk velocity dispersion profiles.
