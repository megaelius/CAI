We report the discovery of six spatially extended (10-100 kpc) line-emitting nebulae in the z=0.57
galaxy group hosting PKS0405-123, one of the most luminous quasars at z<1. The discovery is enabled
by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and provides tantalizing evidence connecting
large-scale gas streams with nuclear activity on scales of <10 proper kpc (pkpc). One of the nebulae
exhibits a narrow, filamentary morphology extending over 50 pkpc toward the quasar with narrow
internal velocity dispersion (50 km/s) and is not associated with any detected galaxies, consistent
with a cool intragroup medium (IGrM) filament. Two of the nebulae are 10 pkpc North and South of the
quasar with tidal arm like morphologies. These two nebulae, along with a continuum emitting arm
extending 60 pkpc from the quasar are signatures of interactions which are expected to redistribute
angular momentum in the host interstellar medium (ISM) to facilitate star formation and quasar
fueling in the nucleus. The three remaining nebulae are among the largest and most luminous [O III]
emitting `blobs' known (1400-2400 pkpc^2) and correspond both kinematically and morphologically
with interacting galaxy pairs in the quasar host group, consistent with arising from stripped ISM
rather than large-scale quasar outflows. The presence of these large- and small-scale nebulae
in the vicinity of a luminous quasar bears significantly on the effect of large-scale environment
on galaxy and black hole fueling, providing a natural explanation for the previously known correlation
between quasar luminosity and cool circumgalactic medium (CGM).
