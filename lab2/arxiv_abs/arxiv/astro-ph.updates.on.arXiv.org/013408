Restarted radio galaxies represent a unique tool to investigate the duty cycle of the jet activity
in Active Galactic Nuclei. Due to a sharp discontinuity of the GHz spectral index distribution within
its lobes, the radio galaxy 3C388 has for long being claimed to be a peculiar example of AGN with multi-epoch
activity. In this work we have performed, for the first time, a spatially resolved study of the radio
spectrum of this source down to MHz-frequencies, aimed at investigating its radiative age and duty
cycle. We have used new low frequency observations at 144 MHz performed with LOFAR and at 350 MHz performed
with the VLA combined with archival data at higher frequencies. We find that the spectral indices
in the lower frequency range 144-614 MHz have flatter values ($\sim$0.55-1.14) than those observed
in the higher frequency range 1400-4850 MHz ($\sim$0.75-1.57) but follow the same distribution
across the lobes, with a systematic steepening towards the edges. However, the spectral shape throughout
the source is not uniform and often deviates from standard models. This suggests that mixing of different
particle populations is occurring, although it remains difficult to understand whether this is
caused by observational limitations (insufficient spatial resolution and/or projection effects)
or by the intrinsic presence of multiple particle populations, possibly related to the two different
outbursts. By using single-injection radiative models we compute that the total source age is $\lesssim$80
Myr and that the duty cycle is about $\rm t_{on}/t_{tot}\sim$ 60%, which is enough to prevent the
intracluster medium from cooling according to X-ray estimates. While to date the radio spectral
distribution of 3C388 remains a rare case among radio galaxies, upcoming multi-frequency surveys
will soon allow us to investigate whether more sources with the same characteristics do actually
exist.
