It is key to constrain the gas surface density distribution, Sigma_gas, as function of disk radius
in protoplanetary disks. In this work we investigate if spatially resolved observations of rarer
CO isotopologues may be good tracers of Sigma_gas. Physical-chemical models with different input
Sigma_gas(R) are run. The input disk surface density profiles are compared with the simulated 13CO
intensity radial profiles to check if and where the two follow each other. There is always an intermediate
region in the disk where the slope of the 13CO radial emission profile and Sigma_gas(R) coincide.
At small radii the line radial profile underestimates Sigma_gas, as 13CO emission becomes optically
thick. The same happens at large radii where the column densities become too low and 13CO is not able
to efficiently self-shield. If the gas surface density profile is a simple power-law of the radius,
the input power-law index can be retrieved within 20% uncertainty if one choses the proper radial
range. If instead Sigma_gas(R) follows the self-similar solution for a viscously evolving disk,
retrieving the input power-law index becomes challenging, in particular for small disks. Nevertheless,
it is found that the power-law index can be in any case reliably fitted at a given line intensity contour
around 6 K km/s, and this produces a practical method to constrain the slope of Sigma_gas(R). Application
of such a method is shown in the case study of the TW Hya disk. Spatially resolved 13CO line radial profiles
are promising to probe the disk surface density distribution, as they directly trace Sigma_gas(R)profile
at radii well resolvable by ALMA. There, chemical processes like freeze-out and isotope selective
photodissociation do not affect the emission, and, assuming that the volatile carbon does not change
with radius, no chemical model is needed when interpreting the observations.
