Context. Measuring how the physical properties of galaxies change across cosmic times is essential
to understand galaxy formation and evolution. With the advent of numerous ground-based and space-borne
instruments launched over the past few decades we now have exquisite multi-wavelength observations
of galaxies from the FUV to the radio domain. To tap into this mine of data and obtain new insight into
the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is essential that we are able to extract information
from their SED. Aims. We present a completely new implementation of CIGALE. Written in python, its
main aims are to easily and efficiently model the FUV to radio spectrum of galaxies and estimate their
physical properties such as star formation rate, attenuation, dust luminosity, stellar mass,
and many other physical quantities. Methods. To compute the spectral models, CIGALE builds composite
stellar populations from simple stellar populations combined with highly flexible star formation
histories, calculates the emission from gas ionised by massive stars, and attenuates both the stars
and the ionised gas with a highly flexible attenuation curve. Based on an energy balance principle,
the absorbed energy is then re-emitted by the dust in the mid- and far-infrared domains while thermal
and non-thermal components are also included, extending the spectrum far into the radio range.
A large grid of models is then fitted to the data and the physical properties are estimated through
the analysis of the likelihood distribution. Results. CIGALE is a versatile and easy-to-use tool
that makes full use of the architecture of multi-core computers, building grids of millions of models
and analysing samples of thousands of galaxies, both at high speed. Beyond fitting the SEDs of galaxies
and parameter estimations, it can also be used as a model-generation tool or serve as a library to
build new applications.
