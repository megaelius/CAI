We present a new Spitzer transit observation of K2$-$28b, a sub-Neptune ($R_{\rm p} = 2.45\pm0.28
R_{\rm Earth}$) orbiting a relatively bright ($V_{\rm mag} = 16.06$, $K_{\rm mag} = 10.75$) metal-rich
M4 dwarf (EPIC 206318379). This star is one of only seven with masses less than 0.2 M$_{\rm Sun}$ known
to host transiting planets, and the planet appears to be a slightly smaller analogue of GJ 1214b ($2.85\pm0.20
R_{\rm Earth}$; Harps{\o}e et al. 2013). Our new Spitzer observations were taken two years after
the original K2 discovery data and have a significantly higher cadence, allowing us to derive improved
estimates for this planet's radius, semi-major axis, and orbital period, which greatly reduce
the uncertainty in the prediction of near future transit times for the James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) observations. We also evaluate the system's suitability for atmospheric characterization
with JWST and find that it is currently the only small ($< 3 R_{\rm Earth}$) and cool ($< 600$ K) planet
aside from GJ 1214b with a potentially detectable secondary eclipse. We also note that this system
is a favorable target for near-infrared radial velocity instruments on larger telescopes (e.g.,
the Habitable Planet Finder on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope or the Infrared Doppler instrument for
the Subaru Telescope), making it one of only a handful of small, cool planets accessible with this
technique. We also compare our results with the simulated catalog of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS) and find K2$-$28b to be representative of the kind of mid-M systems that should
be detectible in the TESS sample. Finally, we find strengthened evidence for a previously noted
correlation that mid-M dwarfs hosting planets with radius $R_{\rm P} > 2R_{\rm Earth}$ tend to be
more metal-rich, based on a tripled sample size and our new results for K2$-$28b.
