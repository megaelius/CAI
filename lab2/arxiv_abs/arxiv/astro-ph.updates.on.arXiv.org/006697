Although the proximity of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) offers an opportunity to understand how mergers
affect galaxies, uncertainty remains about M31's most important mergers. Previous studies focused
individually on the giant stellar stream or the impact of M32 on M31's disk, thereby suggesting many
substantial satellite interactions. Yet models of M31's disk heating and the similarity between
the stellar populations of different tidal substructures in M31's outskirts both suggested a single
large merger. M31's stellar halo (its outer low-surface-brightness regions) is built up from the
tidal debris of satellites and provides information about its important mergers. Here we use cosmological
models of galaxy formation to show that M31's massive and metal-rich stellar halo, containing intermediate-age
stars, dramatically narrows the range of allowed interactions, requiring a single dominant merger
with a large galaxy (with stellar mass about 2.5 x 10^10 solar masses, the third largest member of
the Local Group) about 2 Gyr ago. This single event explains many observations that were previously
considered separately: M31's compact and metal-rich satellite M32 is likely to be the stripped
core of the disrupted galaxy, its rotating inner stellar halo contains most of the merger debris,
and the giant stellar stream is likely to have been thrown out during the merger. This interaction
may explain M31's global burst of star formation about 2 Gyr ago in which approximately a fifth of
its stars were formed. Moreover, M31's disk and bulge were already in place, suggesting that mergers
of this magnitude need not dramatically affect galaxy structure.
