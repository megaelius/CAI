We present full spectral scans from 200-670$\mu$m of 26 Class 0+I protostellar sources, obtained
with $Herschel$-SPIRE, as part of the "COPS-SPIRE" Open Time program, complementary to the DIGIT
and WISH Key programs. Based on our nearly continuous, line-free spectra from 200-670 $\mu$m, the
calculated bolometric luminosities ($L_{\rm bol}$) increase by 50% on average, and the bolometric
temperatures ($T_{\rm bol}$) decrease by 10% on average, in comparison with the measurements without
Herschel. Fifteen protostars have the same Class using $T_{\rm bol}$ and $L_{\rm bol}$/$L_{\rm
submm}$. We identify rotational transitions of CO lines from J=4-3 to J=13-12, along with emission
lines of $^{13}$CO, HCO$^+$, H$_{2}$O, and [CI]. The ratios of $^{12}$CO to $^{13}$CO indicate
that $^{12}$CO emission remains optically thick for $J_{\rm up}$ < 13. We fit up to four components
of temperature from the rotational diagram with flexible break points to separate the components.
The distribution of rotational temperatures shows a primary population around 100 K with a secondary
population at $\sim$350 K. We quantify the correlations of each line pair found in our dataset, and
find the strength of correlation of CO lines decreases as the difference between $J$-level between
two CO lines increases. The multiple origins of CO emission previously revealed by velocity-resolved
profiles are consistent with this smooth distribution if each physical component contributes
to a wide range of CO lines with significant overlap in the CO ladder. We investigate the spatial extent
of CO emission and find that the morphology is more centrally peaked and less bipolar at high-$J$
lines. We find the CO emission observed with SPIRE related to outflows, which consists two components,
the entrained gas and shocked gas, as revealed by our rotational diagram analysis as well as the studies
with velocity-resolved CO emission.
