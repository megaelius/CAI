We have obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of 19 dwarf galaxy candidates in the vicinity
of M101. Advanced Camera for Surveys HST photometry for 2 of these objects showed resolved stellar
populations and Tip of the Red Giant Branch derived distances consistent with M101 group membership.
The other 17 were found to have no resolved stellar populations, meaning they are background low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. It is notable that many LSB objects which had previously been
assumed to be M101 group members based on projection have been shown to be background objects, indicating
the need for future diffuse dwarf surveys to be careful in drawing conclusions about group membership
without robust distance estimates. In this work we update the satellite luminosity function of
M101 based on the presence of these new objects down to M_V=-8.2. M101 is a sparsely populated system
with only 9 satellites down to M_V~-8, as compared to 26 for M31 and 24.5\pm7.7 for the median local
Milky Way (MW)-mass host. This makes M101 the sparsest group probed to this depth, though M94 is even
sparser to the depth it has been examined (M_V=-9.1). M101 and M94 share several properties that
mark them as unusual compared to the other local MW-mass galaxies examined: they have a sparse satellite
population but also have high star forming fractions among these satellites; such properties are
also found in the galaxies examined as part of the SAGA survey. We suggest that these properties appear
to be tied to the galactic environment, with more isolated galaxies showing sparse satellite populations
which are more likely to have had recent star formation, while those in dense environments have more
satellites which tend to have no recent star formation. Overall our results show a level of halo-to-halo
scatter between galaxies of similar mass that is larger than is predicted in the \LambdaCDM model.
