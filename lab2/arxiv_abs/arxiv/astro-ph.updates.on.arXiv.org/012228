We carry out 2D viscous hydrodynamics simulations of circumbinary disk (CBD) accretion using {\footnotesize
AREPO}. We resolve the accretion flow from a large-scale CBD down to the streamers and disks around
individual binary components. Extending our recent studies \citep{mun19}, we consider circular
binaries with various mass ratios ($0.1\leq q_{\rm{b}}\leq1$) and study accretion from ``infinite'',
steady-supply disks and from finite-sized, viscously spreading tori. For ``infinite'' disks,
a global steady state can be reached, and the accretion variability has a dominant frequency ${\sim}0.2\Omega_{\rm{b}}$
for $q_{\rm{b}}>0.5$ and $\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ for $q_{\rm{b}}<0.5$, ($\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ is the
binary angular frequency). We find that the accretion ``eigenvalue'' $l_0$ -- the net angular momentum
transfer from the disk to the binary per unit accreted mass -- is always positive and falls in the range
($0.65$-$0.85)a_{\rm b}^2\Omega_{\rm{b}}$ (with $a_{\rm{b}}$ the binary separation), depending
weakly on the mass ratio and viscosity. This leads to binary expansion when $q_{\rm{b}}\gtrsim0.3$.
Accretion from a finite torus can be separated into two phases: an initial transient phase, corresponding
to the filling of the binary cavity, followed by a viscous pseudo-stationary phase, during which
the torus viscously spreads and accretes onto the binary. In the viscous phase, the net torque on
the binary per unit accreted mass is close to $l_0$, the value derived for ``infinite'' disks. We
conclude that similar-mass binaries accreting from CBDs gain angular momentum and expand over
long time scales. This result significantly impacts the coalescence of supermassive binary black
holes and newly formed binary stars. We offer a word of caution against conclusions drawn from simulations
of transient accretion onto empty circumbinary cavities.
