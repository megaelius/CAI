Recent observational work has indicated that mechanisms for accretion and outflow in Herbig Ae/Be
star-disk systems may differ from magnetospheric accretion (MA) as it is thought to occur in T Tauri
star-disk systems. In this work, we assess the temporal evolution of spectral lines probing accretion
and mass loss in Herbig Ae/Be systems and test for consistency with the MA paradigm. For two Herbig
Ae/Be stars, HD 98922 (B9e) and V1295 Aql (A2e), we have gathered multi-epoch (~years) and high-cadence
(~minutes) high-resolution optical spectra to probe a wide range of kinematic processes. Employing
a line equivalent width evolution correlation metric introduced here, we identify species co-evolving
(indicative of common line origin) via novel visualization. We interferometrically constrain
often problematically degenerate parameters, inclination and inner disk radius, allowing us
to focus on the structure of the wind, magnetosphere, and inner gaseous disk in radiative transfer
models. Over all timescales sampled, the strongest variability occurs within the blueshifted
absorption components of the Balmer series lines; the strength of variability increases with the
cadence of the observations. Finally, high-resolution spectra allow us to probe substructure
within the Balmer series' blueshifted absorption components: we observe static, low-velocity
features and time-evolving features at higher velocities. Overall, we find the observed line morphologies
and variability are inconsistent with a scaled-up T Tauri MA scenario. We suggest that as magnetic
field structure and strength change dramatically with increasing stellar mass from T Tauri to Herbig
Ae/Be stars, so too may accretion and outflow processes.
