We have conceived and implemented a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) code for the optimisation
of an array of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The algorithm takes as input a
series of cost functions (metrics) each describing a different objetive of the optimisation (such
as effective area, angular resolution, etc.), all of which are expressed in terms of the relative
position of the telescopes in the plane. The output of the algorithm is a family of geometrical arrangements
which correspond to the complete set of solutions to the array optimisation problem, and differ
from each other according to the relative weight given to each of the (maybe conflicting) objetives
of the optimisation. Since the algorithm works with parallel optimisation it admits as many cost
functions as desired, and can incorporate constraints such as budget (cost cap) for the array and
topological limitations of the terrain, like geographical accidents where telescopes cannot
be installed. It also admits different types of telescopes (hybrid arrays) and the number of telescopes
of each type can be treated as a parameter to be optimised - constrained, for example, by the cost of
each type or the energy range of interest. The purpose of the algorithm, which converges fast to optimised
solutions (if compared to the time for a complete Monte Carlo Simulation of a single configuration),
is to provide a tool to investigate the full parameter space of possible geometries, and help in designing
complex arrays. It does not substitute a detailed Monte Carlo study, but aims to guide it. In the examples
of arrays shown here we have used as metrics simple heuristic expressions describing the fundamentals
of the IAC technique, but these input functions can be made as detailed or complex as desired for a
given experiment.
