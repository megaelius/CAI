We aim to reveal the physical properties and the chemical composition of the cores in the California
Molecular Cloud (CMC), so as to better understand the initial conditions of star formation. We made
a high-resolution column density map (18.2") with Herschel data, and extracted a complete sample
of the cores in the CMC with the fellwalker algorithm. We performed new single-pointing observations
of molecular lines near 90 GHz with the IRAM 30m telescope along the main filament of the CMC. In addition,
we also performed a numerical modeling of chemical evolution for the cores under the physical condititons.
We extracted 300 cores, which include 33 protostellar and 267 starless cores. About 51\% (137/267)
of the starless cores are prestellar cores. Three cores have the potential to evolve into high-mass
stars. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) can be well fitted by a log-normal form. The high-mass
end of the prestellar CMF shows a power-law form with a index $\alpha=-0.9\pm 0.1$ that is shallower
than that of the Galactic field stellar mass function. Combining the mass transformation efficiency
($\varepsilon$) from the prestellar core to the star of $15\pm 1%$ and the core formation efficiency
(CFE) of 5.5%, we suggest an overall star formation efficiency of around 1\% in the CMC. In the single-pointing
observations with the IRAM 30m telescope, we find that 6 cores show blue-skewed profile while 4 cores
show red-skewed profile. The molecular line detection rates of $\rm C_{2}H (1-0)$, HCN, $\rm HCO^{+}
(1-0)$, HNC in the protostellar cores are higher than those in the prestellar cores. [$\rm {HCO}^{+}$]/[HNC]
and [$\rm {HCO}^{+}$]/$\rm [N_{2}H^{+}]$ can be used as "chemical clocks". The best-fit chemical
age of the cores with line observations is $\sim 5\times 10^4$~years.
