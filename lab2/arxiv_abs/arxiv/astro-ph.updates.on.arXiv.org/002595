Cosmic voids are effective cosmological probes to discriminate among competing world models.
Their precise and unbiased identification is a prerequisite to perform accurate observational
tests. The identification is generally based on density or geometry criteria that, because of their
very nature, are prone to shot noise errors. In this work we propose two new void finders that are based
on dynamical and clustering criteria to select voids in the Lagrangian coordinates and minimise
the impact of sparse sampling. The first approach exploits the Zeldovich approximation to trace
back in time the orbits of galaxies located in the voids and their surroundings, whereas the second
uses the observed galaxy-galaxy correlation function to relax the objects' spatial distribution
to homogeneity and isotropy. In both cases voids are defined as regions of the negative velocity
divergence in Lagrangian coordinates, that can be regarded as sinks of the back-in-time streamlines
of the mass tracers. To assess the performance of our methods we used a dark matter halo catalogue
extracted from an N-body simulation at z=0, and compared the results with those obtained with ZOBOV
void finder. We find that the void divergence profiles are less scattered than the density ones,
so their stacking constitutes a more accurate cosmological probe. The significance of the divergence
signal in the central part of voids obtained from both our finders is 60% higher than for overdensity
profiles in the ZOBOV case. Individual voids selected by both finders have similar tri-axial ellipsoidal
shapes. The ellipticity of the stacked void measured in the divergence field is significantly closer
to unity, as expected, than what is found when using halo positions. These results show that our new
void finders are complementary to the existing methods, that should contribute to improve the accuracy
of void-based cosmological tests.
