Using a compiled sample of 34 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with measured H$\beta$ time
lags from the reverberation mapping (RM) method and measured bulge stellar velocity dispersions
$\sigma_*$, we calculate the virial factor $f$ by assuming that the RM AGNs intrinsically obey the
same $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation as quiescent galaxies, where $M_{\rm BH}$ is the mass of the
supermassive black hole (SMBH). Considering four tracers of the velocity of the broad-line regions
(BLRs), i.e., the H$\beta$ line width or line dispersion from the mean or rms spectrum, there are
four kinds of the factor $f$. Using the \hb Full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) to trace the BLRs velocity,
we find significant correlations between the factor $f$ and some observational parameters, e.g.,
FWHM, the line dispersion. Using the line dispersion to trace the BLRs velocity, these relations
disappear or become weaker. It implies the effect of inclination in BLRs geometry. It also suggests
that the variable $f$ in $M_{\rm BH}$ estimated from luminosity and FWHM in a single-epoch spectrum
is not negligible. Using a simple model of thick-disk BLRs, we also find that, as the tracer of the
BLRs velocity, H$\beta$ FWHM has some dependence on the inclination, while the line dispersion
$\sigma_{\rm H\beta }$ is insensitive to the inclination. Considering the calibrated FWHM-based
factor $f$ from the mean spectrum, the scatter of the SMBH mass is 0.39 dex for our sample of 34 low redshift
RM AGNs. For a high redshift sample of 30 SDSS RM AGNs with measured stellar velocity dispersions,
we find that the SMBH mass scatter is larger than that for our sample of 34 low redshift RM AGNs. It implies
the possibility of evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relation from high-redshift to low-redshift
AGNs.
