Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars are evolved massive objects, previous to core-collapse supernova.
LBVs are characterized by photometric and spectroscopic variability, produced by strong and dense
winds, mass-loss events and very intense UV radiation. LBVs strongly disturb their surroundings
by heating and shocking, and produce important amounts of dust. The study of the circumstellar material
is therefore crucial to understand how these massive stars evolve, and also to characterize their
effects onto the interstellar medium. The versatility of NIKA2 is a key in providing simultaneous
observations of both the stellar continuum and the extended, circumstellar contribution. The
NIKA2 frequencies (150 and 260 GHz) are in the range where thermal dust and free-free emission compete,
and hence NIKA2 has the capacity to provide key information about the spatial distribution of circumstellar
ionized gas, warm dust and nearby dark clouds; non-thermal emission is also possible even at these
high frequencies. We show the results of the first NIKA2 survey towards five LBVs. We detected emission
from four stars, three of them immersed in tenuous circumstellar material. The spectral indices
show a complex distribution and allowed us to separate and characterize different components.
We also found nearby dark clouds, with spectral indices typical of thermal emission from dust. Spectral
indices of the detected stars are negative and hard to be explained only by free-free processes.
In one of the sources, G79.29+0.46, we also found a strong correlation of the 1mm and 2mm continuum
emission with respect to nested molecular shells at 0.1 pc from the LBV. The spectral index in this
region clearly separates four components: the LBV star, a bubble characterized by free-free emission,
and a shell interacting with a nearby infrared dark cloud.
