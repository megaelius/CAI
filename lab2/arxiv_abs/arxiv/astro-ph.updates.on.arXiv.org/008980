We present the first self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic simulation of hydrogen reionization
performed with AREPO-RT complemented by a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. We examine
how photoheating feedback, due to the reionization process, shapes the properties of galaxies.
Our fiducial model completes reionization by $z\approx6$ and matches the observed volume-averaged
neutral hydrogen fraction, the electron scattering optical depth of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons, the high-redshift ultraviolet (UV) continuum luminosity function, and stellar
mass function. Contrary to previous works, photoheating suppresses star formation rates by larger
than $50\%$ only in halos less massive than $\sim10^{8.4}\ M_\odot$ ($\sim10^{8.8}\ M_\odot$)
at $z=6$ $(z=5)$. By assuming a uniform UV background instead of self-consistently modelling the
patchiness of reionization yields an earlier onset of suppression of star formation, indicating
that such an approximation acts like an early reionization model. In the absence of stellar feedback,
photoheating alone is only able to quench halos less massive than $\sim10^9\ M_\odot$ at $z\gtrsim5$,
implying that photoheating feedback plays a sub-dominant role in regulating star formation compared
to stellar feedback. In addition, stellar feedback weakens the strength of photoheating feedback
by reducing the amount of stellar sources. Most importantly, photoheating does not generate any
observable flattening in the faint end slope of the UV luminosity function up to ${\rm M_{1500}}
= -15$ mag or in the low-mass end of the stellar mass function down to $10^6\ M_\odot$. We also do not
observe a dip in the cosmic star formation rate density caused by reionization. The feasibility
of using these observables to detect imprints of reionization therefore requires further investigation.
