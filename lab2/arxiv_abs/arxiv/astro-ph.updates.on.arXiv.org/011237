Our aim is to determine the distribution of stellar population parameters (extinction, age, metallicity,
and star formation rate) of quiescent galaxies within the rest-frame stellar mass$-$colour and
$UVJ$ colour$-$colour diagrams corrected for extinction up to $z\sim1$. These novel diagrams
reduce the contamination in samples of quiescent galaxies owing to dust-reddened galaxies, and
they provide useful constraints on stellar population parameters. We set constraints on the stellar
population parameters of quiescent galaxies combining the ALHAMBRA multi-filter photo-spectra
with our SED-fitting code MUFFIT, making use of composite stellar population models. The extinction
obtained by MUFFIT allowed us to remove dusty star-forming (DSF) galaxies from the sample of red
$UVJ$ galaxies. The distributions of stellar population parameters across these rest-frame diagrams
are revealed after the dust correction and are fitted by the LOESS method to reduce uncertainty effects.
Quiescent galaxy samples defined via classical $UVJ$ diagrams are typically contaminated by a
$\sim20$% fraction of DSF galaxies. A significant part of the galaxies in the green valley are actually
obscured star-forming galaxies ($\sim30-65$%). Consequently, the transition of galaxies from
the blue cloud to the red sequence, and hence the related mechanisms for quenching, seems to be much
more efficient and faster than previously reported. The rest-frame stellar mass$-$colour and
$UVJ$ colour$-$colour diagrams are useful for constraining the age, metallicity, extinction,
and star formation rate of quiescent galaxies by only their redshift, rest-frame colours, and/or
stellar mass. Dust correction plays an important role in understanding how quiescent galaxies
are distributed in these diagrams and is key to performing a pure selection of quiescent galaxies
via intrinsic colours.
