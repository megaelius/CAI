On the basis of various data such as ALMA, JVLA, Chandra, {\it Herschel}, and {\it Spitzer}, we confirmed
that two protostellar candidates in Oph-A are bona fide protostars or proto-brown dwarfs (proto-BDs)
in extremely early evolutionary stages. Both objects are barely visible across infrared (IR, i.e.,
near-IR to far-IR) bands. The physical nature of the cores is very similar to that expected in first
hydrostatic cores (FHSCs), objects theoretically predicted in the evolutionary phase prior to
stellar core formation with gas densities of $\sim$ 10$^{11-12}$ cm$^{-3}$. This suggests that
the evolutionary stage is close to the FHSC formation phase. The two objects are associated with
faint X-ray sources, suggesting that they are in very early phase of stellar core formation with
magnetic activity. In addition, we found the CO outflow components around both sources which may
originate from the young outflows driven by these sources. The masses of these objects are calculated
to be $\sim 0.01-0.03$ $M_\odot$ from the dust continuum emission. Their physical properties are
consistent with that expected from the numerical model of forming brown dwarfs. These facts (the
X-ray detection, CO outflow association, and FHSC-like spectral energy distributions) strongly
indicate that the two objects are proto-BDs or will be in the very early phase of protostars which
will evolve more massive protostars if they gain enough mass from the surroundings. The ages of these
two objects are likely to be within $\sim 10^3$ years after the protostellar core (or second core)
formation, taking into account the outflow dynamical times ($\lesssim$ 500 yrs).
