We present Chandra ACIS-S X-ray imaging spectroscopy for five dual active galactic nucleus (AGN)
candidates. Our targets were drawn from a sample of 1286 [O III]-selected AGN pairs systematically
selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release. Each of the targets contains two
nuclei separated by $\sim$3-9 kpc in projection, both of which are optically classified as Type
2 (obscured) AGNs based on diagnostic ratios of the narrow emission lines. Combined with independent,
empirical star formation rate estimates based on the host galaxy stellar continua, the new Chandra
X-ray observations allow us to evaluate the dual-AGN hypothesis for each merging system. We confirm
two (SDSS J0907+5203 and SDSS J1544+0446) of the five targets as bona-fide dual AGNs. For the other
three targets, the existing data are consistent with the dual-AGN scenario, but we cannot rule out
the possibility of stellar/shock heating and/or one AGN ionizing both gaseous components in the
merger. The average X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity ratio in our targets seems to be systematically
smaller than that observed in single AGNs but is higher than that seen in dual AGNs selected from AGNs
with double-peaked narrow emission lines. We suggest that the systematically smaller X-ray-to-[O
III] luminosity ratio observed in dual AGNs than in single AGNs is due to a high nuclear gas column
likely from strong merger-induced inflows. Unlike double-peaked-[O III]-selected dual AGNs,
the new sample selected from resolved galaxy pairs are not subject to the orientation bias caused
by the double-peak line-of-sight velocity splitting selection, which also contributes to lowering
the X-ray-to-[O III] luminosity ratio.
