We study the highly magnified arc SGAS J122651.3+215220 caused by a star-forming galaxy at $z_s=2.93$
crossing the lensing caustic cast by the galaxy cluster SDSS J1226+2152 ($z_l=0.43$), using Hubble
Space Telescope observations. We report in the arc several asymmetric surface brightness features
whose angular separations are a fraction of an arcsecond from the lensing critical curve and appear
to be highly but unequally magnified image pairs of underlying compact sources, with one brightest
pair having clear asymmetry consistently across four filters. One explanation of unequal magnification
is microlensing by intracluster stars, which induces independent flux variations in the images
of individual or groups of source stars in the lensed galaxy. For a second possibility, intracluster
dark matter subhalos invisible to telescopes effectively perturb lensing magnifications near
the critical curve and give rise to persistently unequal image pairs. Our modeling suggests, at
least for the most prominent identified image pair, that the microlensing hypothesis is in tension
with the absence of notable asymmetry variation over a six-year baseline, while subhalos of $\sim
10^6$--$10^8\,M_\odot$ anticipated from structure formation with Cold Dark Matter typically
produce stationary and sizable asymmetries. We judge that observations at additional times and
more precise lens models are necessary to stringently constrain temporal variability and robustly
distinguish between the two explanations. The arc under this study is a scheduled target of a Director's
Discretionary Early Release Science program of the James Webb Space Telescope, which will provide
deep images and a high-resolution view with integral field spectroscopy.
