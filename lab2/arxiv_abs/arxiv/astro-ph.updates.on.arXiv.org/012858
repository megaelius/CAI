We develop a kinematical model for the Milky Way Si IV-bearing gas to determine its density distribution
and kinematics. This model is constrained by a column density line shape sample extracted from the
{\it HST}/COS archival data, which contains 186 AGN sight lines. We find that the Si IV ion density
distribution is dominated by an extended disk along the $z$-direction (above or below the midplane),
i.e., $n(z)=n_0\exp(-(z/z_0)^{0.82})$, where $z_0$ is the scale height of $6.3_{-1.5}^{+1.6}$
kpc (northern hemisphere) and $3.6_{-0.9}^{+1.0}$ kpc (southern hemisphere). The density distribution
of the disk in the radial direction shows a sharp edge at $15-20$ kpc given by, $n(r_{\rm XY})=n_0\exp(-(r_{\rm
XY}/r_0)^{3.36})$, where $r_0 \approx 12.5\pm0.6$ kpc. The difference of density distributions
over $r_{\rm XY}$ and $z$ directions indicates that the warm gas traced by \ion{Si}{4} is mainly
associated with disk processes (e.g., feedback or cycling gas) rather than accretion. We estimate
the mass of the warm gas (within 50 kpc) is $\log (M(50 {\rm kpc})/M_\odot)\approx8.1$ (assuming
$Z\approx0.5Z_\odot$), and a $3\sigma$ upper limit of $\log (M(250 {\rm kpc})/M_\odot)\approx9.1$
(excluding the Magellanic system). Kinematically, the warm gas disk is nearly co-rotating with
the stellar disk at $v_{\rm rot}=215\pm3\rm~km~s^{-1}$, which lags the midplane rotation by about
$8\rm~km~s^{-1}~kpc^{-1}$ (within 5 kpc). Meanwhile, we note that the warm gas in the northern
hemisphere has significant accretion with $v_{\rm acc}$ of $69\pm 7\rm ~km~s^{-1}$ at 10 kpc (an
accretion rate of $-0.60_{-0.13}^{+0.11}~M_\odot\rm~yr^{-1}$), while in the southern hemisphere,
there is no measurable accretion, with an upper limit of $0.4~M_\odot\rm~yr^{-1}$.
