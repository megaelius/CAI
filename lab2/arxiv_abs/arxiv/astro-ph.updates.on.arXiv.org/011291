We compile and analyze ~200 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of molecular masers associated
with very young high-mass stars. These measurements strongly suggest that the Milky Way is a four-arm
spiral. Fitting log-periodic spirals to the locations of the masers, allows us to significantly
expand our view of the structure of the Milky Way. We present an updated model for its spiral structure
and incorporate it into our previously published parallax-based distance-estimation program
for sources associated with spiral arms. Modeling the three-dimensional space motions yields
estimates of the distance to the Galactic center, Ro = 8.15 +/- 0.15 kpc, the circular rotation speed
at the Sun's position, To = 236 +/- 7 km/s, and the nature of the rotation curve. Our data strongly constrain
the full circular velocity of the Sun, To + Vsun = 247 +/- 4 km/s, and its angular velocity, (To + Vsun)/Ro
= 30.32 +/- 0.27 km/s/kpc. Transforming the measured space motions to a Galactocentric frame which
rotates with the Galaxy, we find non-circular velocity components typically about 10 km/s. However,
near the Galactic bar and in a portion of the Perseus arm, we find significantly larger non-circular
motions. Young high-mass stars within 7 kpc of the Galactic center have a scale height of only 19 pc
and, thus, are well suited to define the Galactic plane. We find that the orientation of the plane
is consistent with the IAU-defined plane to within +/-0.1 deg., and that the Sun is offset toward
the north Galactic pole by Zsun = 5.5 +/- 5.8 pc. Accounting for this offset places the central supermassive
black hole, Sgr A*, in the midplane of the Galaxy. Using our improved Galactic parameters, we predict
the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar to be at a distance of 6.54 +/- 0.24 kpc, assuming its orbital decay
from gravitational radiation follows general relativity.
