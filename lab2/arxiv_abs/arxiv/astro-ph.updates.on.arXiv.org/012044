Extensive surveys with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) over the past decade, targeting
some of most massive clusters in the sky, have uncovered dozens of galaxy-cluster strong lenses.
The massive cluster strong-lens scale is typically $\theta_{E}\sim10"$ to $\sim30-35"$, with
only a handful of clusters known with Einstein radii $\theta_{E}\sim40"$ or above (for a source
at $z_{s}\sim2$, nominally). Here we report another very large cluster lens, RXC J0032.1+1808
(at $z=0.3956$), the second richest cluster in the redMapper cluster catalog and the 85th most massive
cluster in the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalog. With both our Light-Traces-Mass and fully parametric
(dPIEeNFW) approaches, we construct strong lensing models based on 18 multiple images of 5 background
galaxies in the \textit{HST} data from the \textit{Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey} (RELICS;
using also data also from a previous snapshot program), in addition to a previously found sextuply
imaged system in this cluster. Furthermore, we compare these models to the Lenstool and GLAFIC models,
which were produced independently as part of the RELICS program. All models reveal a large effective
Einstein radius of $\theta_{E}\simeq40"$ ($z_{s}=2$). The central region of the cluster shows
an obvious concentration of substructures, which together account for the large critical area.
Although RXC J0032.1+1808 has a very large critical area and lensing strength, only three magnified
high-redshift candidates are found within the field targeted by RELICS. Nevertheless, given its
exceptional lensing strength, we expect many more high-redshift candidates will be seen in an additional
coverage with \textit{HST}, and in deeper, longer-wavelength observations with \textit{JWST}.
