Standard spectroscopic analyses of Cepheid variables are based on hydrostatic one-dimensional
model atmospheres, with convection treated using various formulations of mixing-length theory.
This paper aims to carry out an investigation of the validity of the quasi-static approximation
in the context of pulsating stars. We check the adequacy of a two-dimensional time-dependent model
of a Cepheid-like variable with focus on its spectroscopic properties. With the radiation-hydrodynamics
code CO5BOLD, we construct a two-dimensional time-dependent envelope model of a Cepheid with $T_\mathrm{eff}=
5600$ K, $\log g=2.0$, solar metallicity, and a 2.8-day pulsation period. Subsequently, we perform
extensive spectral syntheses of a set of artificial iron lines in local thermodynamic equilibrium.
The set of lines allows us to systematically study effects of line strength, ionization stage, and
excitation potential. We evaluate the microturbulent velocity, line asymmetry, projection factor,
and Doppler shifts. The mean Doppler shift is non-zero and negative, -1 km/s, after averaging over
several full periods and lines. This residual line-of-sight velocity (related to the "K-term")
is primarily caused by horizontal inhomogeneities, and consequently we interpret it as the familiar
convective blueshift ubiquitously present in non-pulsating late-type stars. Limited statistics
prevent firm conclusions on the line asymmetries. Our two-dimensional model provides a reasonably
accurate representation of the spectroscopic properties of a short-period Cepheid-like variable
star. Some properties are primarily controlled by convective inhomogeneities rather than by the
Cepheid-defining pulsations.
