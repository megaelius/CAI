Optical transmission spectroscopy provides crucial constraints on the reference pressure levels
and scattering properties for hot Jupiter atmospheres. For certain planets, where alkali atoms
are detected in the atmosphere, their line profiles could serve as a good probe to link upper and lower
atmospheric layers. WASP-21b is a Saturn-mass hot Jupiter orbiting a thick disc star, with a low
density and an equilibrium temperature of 1333 K, which makes it a good target for transmission spectroscopy.
Here, we present a low-resolution transmission spectrum for WASP-21b based in one transit observed
by the OSIRIS spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and a high-resolution transmission
spectrum based in three transits observed by HARPS-N at Telescopio Nazinale Galileo (TNG) and HARPS
at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. We performed spectral retrieval analysis on GTC's low-resolution transmission
spectrum and report the detection of Na at a confidence level of $>$3.5-$\sigma$. The Na line exhibits
a broad line profile that can be attributed to pressure broadening, indicating a mostly clear planetary
atmosphere. The spectrum shows a tentative excess absorption at the K D$_1$ line. Using HARPS-N
and HARPS, we spectrally resolved the Na doublet transmission spectrum. An excess absorption at
the Na doublet is detected during the transit, and shows a radial velocity shift consistent with
the planet orbital motion. We proposed a metric to quantitatively distinguish hot Jupiters with
relatively clear atmospheres from others, and WASP-21b has the largest metric value among all the
characterized hot Jupiters. The detection of Na at both lower and upper atmosphere of WASP-21b reveals
that it is an ideal target for future follow-up observations, providing the opportunity to understand
the nature of its atmosphere across a wide range of pressure levels.
