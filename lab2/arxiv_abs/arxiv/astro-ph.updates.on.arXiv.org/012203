The problem of denoising a one-dimensional signal possessing varying degrees of smoothness is
ubiquitous in time-domain astronomy and astronomical spectroscopy. For example, in the time domain,
an astronomical object may exhibit a smoothly varying intensity that is occasionally interrupted
by abrupt dips or spikes. Likewise, in the spectroscopic setting, a noiseless spectrum typically
contains intervals of relative smoothness mixed with localized higher frequency components such
as emission peaks and absorption lines. In this work, we present trend filtering, a modern nonparametric
statistical tool that yields significant improvements in this broad problem space of denoising
$spatially$ $heterogeneous$ signals. When the underlying signal is spatially heterogeneous,
trend filtering is superior to any statistical estimator that is a linear combination of the observed
data---including kernels, LOESS, smoothing splines, Gaussian process regression, and many other
popular methods. In the spirit of illustrating the broad utility of trend filtering, we discuss
its relevance to a diverse set of spectroscopic and time-domain studies. The observations we discuss
are (1) the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra; (2) more general spectroscopy of quasars,
galaxies, and stars; (3) stellar light curves with transiting exoplanet(s); (4) eclipsing binary
light curves; and (5) supernova light curves. We study the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the greatest
detail---using trend filtering to map the large-scale structure of the intergalactic medium along
quasar-observer sightlines. The remaining studies broadly center around the themes of using trend
filtering to estimate observable parameters and generate spectral/light-curve templates.
