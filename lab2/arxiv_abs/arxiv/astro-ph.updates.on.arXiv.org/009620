Observations of Neptune, made in 2018 using the new Narrow Field Adaptive Optics mode of the Multi
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) from 0.48 - 0.93
micron, are analysed here to determine the latitudinal and vertical distribution of cloud opacity
and methane abundance in Neptune's observable troposphere (0.1 - ~3 bar). Previous observations
at these wavelengths in 2003 by HST/STIS (Karkoschka and Tomasko 2011, Icarus 205, 674-694) found
that the mole fraction of methane above the cloud tops (at ~2 bar) varied from ~4% at equatorial latitudes
to ~2% at southern polar latitudes, by comparing the observed reflectivity at wavelengths near
825 nm controlled primarily by either methane absorption or H2-H2/H2-He collision-induced absorption.
We find a similar variation in cloud-top methane abundance in 2018, which suggests that this depletion
of methane towards Neptune's pole is potentially a long-lived feature, indicative of long-term
upwelling at mid-equatorial latitudes and subsidence near the poles. By analysing these MUSE observations
along the central meridian with a retrieval model, we demonstrate that a broad boundary between
the nominal and depleted methane abundances occurs at between 20 - 40S. We also find a small depletion
of methane near the equator, perhaps indicating subsidence there, and a local enhancement near
60 - 70S, which we suggest may be associated with South Polar Features (SPFs) seen in Neptune's atmosphere
at these latitudes. Finally, by the use of both a reflectivity analysis and a principal component
analysis, we demonstrate that this depletion of methane towards the pole is apparent at all locations
on Neptune's disc, and not just along its central meridian.
