By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study whether the proton-to-electron
mass ratio $m_i/m_e$ influences the energy spectrum and underlying acceleration mechanism during
magnetic reconnection. While kinetic simulations are essential for studying particle acceleration
during magnetic reconnection, a reduced $m_i/m_e$ is often used to alleviate the demanding computing
resources, which leads to artificial scale separation between electron and proton scales. Recent
kinetic simulations with high-mass-ratio have suggested new regimes of reconnection, as electron
pressure anisotropy develops in the exhaust region and supports extended current layers. In this
work, we study whether different $m_i/m_e$ changes the particle acceleration processes by performing
a series of simulations with different mass ratio ($m_i/m_e=25-400$) and guide-field strength
in a low-$\beta$ plasma. We find that mass ratio does not strongly influence reconnection rate,
magnetic energy conversion, ion internal energy gain, plasma energization processes, ion energy
spectra, and the acceleration mechanisms for high-energy ions. Simulations with different mass
ratios are different in electron acceleration processes, including electron internal energy
gain, electron energy spectrum and the acceleration efficiencies for high-energy electrons.
We find that high-energy electron acceleration becomes less efficient when the mass ratio gets
larger because the \textit{Fermi}-like mechanism associated with particle curvature drift becomes
less efficient. These results indicate that when particle curvature drift dominates high-energy
particle acceleration, the further the particle kinetic scales are from the magnetic field curvature
scales ($\sim d_i$), the weaker the acceleration will be.
