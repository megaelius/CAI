The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) provided us with precise five-parameter astrometry for
1.3 billion of sources. As stars passing close to the Solar System are thought to be responsible for
influencing the dynamical history of long period comets, thanks to the increase of an amount of data,
we were able to study, with a better accuracy, the sample of stellar perturbers of a cometary motion.
We aim to add new objects to a list of stellar perturbers of long period comets motion and to revise
previously published lists. Special emphasis was placed on stellar systems as multiplicity of
the stars was almost never considered in this context before. Discussion on sources of masses and
perturber mass estimates are included. Using right ascensions, declinations, parallaxes, proper
motions, and radial velocities, preferably all from Gaia DR2, augmented with data from other sources
when needed, we calculate spatial positions and velocities for each star. To obtain minimal heliocentric
distances we numerically integrate motion of stars under the Galactic potential and their mutual
interactions. We present the updated list of stellar perturbers of cometary motion, including
masses of perturbers, ready to be used with data on the observed long period comets to study an individual
influence of a whole sample of perturbers, or specific stars, on a dynamical past or future of a specific
comet. 147 new perturbers were added in comparison to the previously published sources. Data provided
by Gaia DR2 facilitated an extension of the list of stellar perturbers with new objects and a verification
of these which were earlier classified as the pertubers of cometary motion. However, lack of radial
velocities for millions of stars still hinders our work. Almost no improvement is visible in a multiple
systems field, they have to be treated with extra diligence.
