The Juno mission has provided an accurate determination of Jupiter's gravitational field, which
has been used to obtain information about the planet's composition and internal structure. Several
models of Jupiter's structure that fit the probe's data suggest that the planet has a diluted core,
with a total heavy-element mass ranging from ten to a few tens of Earth masses (~5-15 % of the Jovian
mass), and that heavy elements (elements other than H and He) are distributed within a region extending
to nearly half of Jupiter's radius. Planet-formation models indicate that most heavy elements
are accreted during the early stages of a planet's formation to create a relatively compact core
and that almost no solids are accreted during subsequent runaway gas accretion. Jupiter's diluted
core, combined with its possible high heavy-element enrichment, thus challenges standard planet-formation
theory. A possible explanation is erosion of the initially compact heavy-element core, but the
efficiency of such erosion is uncertain and depends on both the immiscibility of heavy materials
in metallic hydrogen and on convective mixing as the planet evolves. Another mechanism that can
explain this structure is planetesimal enrichment and vaporization during the formation process,
although relevant models typically cannot produce an extended diluted core. Here we show that a
sufficiently energetic head-on collision (giant impact) between a large planetary embryo and
the proto-Jupiter could have shattered its primordial compact core and mixed the heavy elements
with the inner envelope. Models of such a scenario lead to an internal structure that is consistent
with a diluted core, persisting over billions of years. We suggest that collisions were common in
the young Solar system and that a similar event may have also occurred for Saturn, contributing to
the structural differences between Jupiter and Saturn.
