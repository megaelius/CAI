We constrain the temporal power spectrum of the sSFR(t) of star-forming galaxies, using a well-defined
sample of Main Sequence galaxies from MaNGA and our earlier measurements of the ratio of the SFR averaged
within the last 5 Myr to that averaged over the last 800 Myr. We explore the assumptions of stationarity
and ergodicity that are implicit in this approach. We assume a single power-law form of the PSD but
introduce an additional free parameter, the "intrinsic scatter", to try to account for any non-ergodicity
introduced from various sources. We analyze both an "integrated" sample consisting of global measurements
of all of the galaxies, and also 25 sub-samples obtained by considering five radial regions and five
bins of integrated stellar mass. Assuming that any intrinsic scatter is not the dominant contribution
to the Main Sequence dispersion of galaxies, we find that the PSDs have slopes between 1.0 and 2.0,
indicating that the power (per log interval of frequency) is mostly contributed by longer timescale
variations. We find a correlation between the returned PSDs and the inferred gas depletion times
($\tau_{\rm dep,eff}$) obtained from application of the extended Schmidt Law, in that regions
with shorter gas depletion times show larger integrated power and flatter PSD. Intriguingly, it
is found that shifting the PSDs by the inferred $\tau_{\rm dep,eff}$ causes all of the 25 PSDs to closely
overlap, at least in that region where the PSD is best constrained and least affected by uncertainties
about any intrinsic scatter. A possible explanation of these results is the dynamical response
of the gas regulator system of Lilly et al. 2013 to a uniform time-varying inflow, as previously proposed
in Wang et al. 2019.
