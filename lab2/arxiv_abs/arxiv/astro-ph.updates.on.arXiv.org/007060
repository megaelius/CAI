We explore the evolution of the time variability (in the optical $g$-band and on timescales of weeks
to years) of SDSS Stripe 82 quasars along the quasar main sequence. A parent sample of $1004$ quasars
within $0.5\leq z \leq 0.89$ are used for our statistical studies, we then make subsamples from our
parent sample: a subsample of $246$ quasars with similar luminosities, and a subsample of $399$
quasars with similar Rfe (i.e., the ratio of the equivalent width of FeII within $4435$--$4685\
\mathrm{\AA}$ to that of \Hbeta). We find the variability amplitude decreases with luminosity
($L_{\mathrm{bol}}$). The anti-correlation between the variability amplitude and Rfe is weak
but statistically significant. The characteristic timescale, $\tau$, correlates mostly with
quasar luminosity, its dependence on Rfe is statistically insignificant. After controlling luminosity
and Rfe, the high- and low-FWHM samples have similar structure functions. These results support
the framework that Rfe is governed by Eddington ratio and FWHM of Hbeta is mostly determined by orientation.
We then provide new empirical relations between variability parameters and quasar properties
(i.e., luminosity and Rfe). Our new relations are consistent with the scenario that quasar variability
is driven by the thermal fluctuations in the accretion disk, $\tau$ seems to correspond to the thermal
timescale. From our new relations, we find the short-term variability is mostly sensitive to $L_{\mathrm{bol}}$.
Basing on this, we propose that quasar short-term (a few months) variability might be a new type of
"Standard Candle" and can be adopted to probe cosmology.
