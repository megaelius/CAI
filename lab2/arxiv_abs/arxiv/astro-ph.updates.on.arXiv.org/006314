We have performed high resolution $3-$dimensional compressible hydrodynamics simulations to
investigate the effects of shocks and turbulence on energy transport into hot Jupiter atmospheres,
under a variety of shear gradients. We focus on a local atmospheric region to accurately follow the
small-scale structures of turbulence and shocks. We find that the effects of turbulence above and
below a shear layer are different in scale and magnitude: Below the shear layer, the effects of turbulence
on the vertical energy transfer are local, generally $\lesssim2~\times(\text{scale height})$.
However, turbulence can have a spatially and thermally-large influence on almost the entire region
above the shear layer. We also find that shock formation is local and transient. Once the atmosphere
becomes steady, the time-averaged heat energy flux at $P\sim 1$ bar is insignificant, on the order
of 0.001\% of the incoming stellar flux with a shear motion at $P\sim 1$ mbar, and 0.1\% with a deeper
shear layer at $P\sim 100$ mbar. Accordingly, the diffusion coefficient is higher for the deeper
shear layer. Therefore, our results suggest that turbulence near less dense regions ($P\sim 1$
mbar) does not cause a sufficiently deep and large penetration of thermal energy to account for radius
inflation in hot Jupiters, regardless of how violent the turbulence is. However, as the shear layer
gets deeper, heat energy transfer becomes more effective throughout the atmosphere (upwards and
downwards) due to a larger kinetic energy budget. Therefore, it is more important how deep turbulence
occurs in the atmosphere, than how unstable the atmosphere is for effective energy transfer.
