We study the distribution of central velocity dispersion, sigma, for >100000 galaxies in the SDSS
at 0.01 <= z <= 0.1. We construct the velocity dispersion function (VDF) from samples complete for
all sigma, where galaxies with sigma greater than the sigma-completeness limit of the SDSS spectroscopic
survey are included. We compare two different sigma estimates; one based on SDSS spectroscopy (sigma_spec)
and another on photometric estimates (sigma_mod). The sigma_spec for our sample is systematically
higher than sigma_mod for all ranges of sigma, implying that rotational velocity may affect sigma_spec
measurements. The VDFs measured from these quantities are remarkably similar for lower sigma values,
but the sigma_mod VDF falls faster than the sigma_spec VDF at log sigma > 2.35. Very few galaxies are
observed to have sigma > 350 km/s. Despite differences in sample selection and methods, our VDFs
are in close agreement with previous determinations for the local universe, and our results confirm
that complete sampling is necessary to accurately discern the shape of the VDF at all ranges. We also
find that both late and early type galaxies have sigma_spec > sigma_mod, suggesting that the rotation
component of most galaxies figure significantly into sigma_spec measurements. Early-type galaxies
dominate the population of high sigma galaxies, while late-type galaxies dominate the low sigma
statistic. Our results warrant a more thorough and cautious approach in using long-slit spectroscopy
to derive the statistics of local galaxies. Higher quality photometric measurements will enable
more accurate and less uncertain measurements of the sigma_mod VDF, as described here. A follow-up
paper uses the final samples from this work in conjunction with the MBH-sigma relation to derive
the z<=0.1 black hole mass function (BHMF).
