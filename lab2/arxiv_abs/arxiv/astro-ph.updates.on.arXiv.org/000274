We present an infrared study of a z=0.872 cluster, SpARCS J161314+564930, with the primary aim of
distinguishing the dynamical histories of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming members
to assess the role of cluster environment. We utilize deep MIPS imaging and a mass-limited sample
of 85 spectroscopic members to identify 16 24um-bright sources within the cluster, and measure
their 24um star formation rates (SFRs) down to ~6 Msolar/year. Based on their line-of-sight velocities
and stellar ages, MIPS cluster members appear to be an infalling population that was recently accreted
from the field with minimal environmental dependency on their star formation. However, we identify
a double-sequenced distribution of star-forming galaxies amongst the members, with one branch
exhibiting declining specific SFRs with mass. The members along this sub-main sequence contain
spectral features suggestive of passive galaxies. Using caustic diagrams, we kinematically identify
these galaxies as a virialized and/or backsplash population. Moreover, we find a mix of dynamical
histories at all projected radii, indicating that standard definitions of environment (i.e.,
radius and density) are contaminated with recently accreted interlopers, which could contribute
to a lack of environmental trends for star-forming galaxies. A cleaner narrative of their dynamical
past begins to unfold when using a proxy for accretion histories through profiles of constant (r/r_200)x(Delta
v/sigma_v); galaxies accreted at earlier times possess lower values of (r/r_200)x(Delta v/sigma_v)
with minimal contamination from the distinct infalling population. Therefore, adopting a time-averaged
definition for density (as traced by accretion histories) rather than an instantaneous density
yields a depressed specific SFR within the dynamical cluster core.
