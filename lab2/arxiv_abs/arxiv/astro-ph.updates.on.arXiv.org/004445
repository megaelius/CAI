We investigate the physical conditions of the CO gas near the young star cluster, Trumpler 14 of the
Carina Nebula. The observations presented in this work are taken with the Fourier Transform Spectrometer
(FTS) of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE) onboard the Herschel Space Observatory.
Our field of view covers the edge of a cavity carved by Trumpler 14 about $1\,\mathrm{Myr}$ ago and
marks the transition from HII regions to photo-dissociation regions. With the state-of-the-art
Meudon PDR code, we successfully derive the physical conditions, which include the thermal pressure
($P$) and the scaling factor of radiation fields ($G_{\mathrm{UV}}$), from the observed CO spectral
line energy distributions~(SLEDs) in the observed region. The derived $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$ values
generally show an excellent agreement with the UV radiation fields created by nearby OB-stars and
thus confirm that the main excitation source of the observed CO emission are the UV-photons provided
by the massive stars. The derived thermal pressure is between $0.5-3\,\times\,10^{8}\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}$
with the highest values found along the ionization front in Car I-E region facing Trumpler 14, hinting
that the cloud structure is similar to the recent observations of the Orion Bar. Comparing the derived
thermal pressure with the radiation fields, we report the first observationally-derived and spatially-resolved
$P \sim 2\times10^4\,G_{\mathrm{UV}}$ relationship. As direct comparisons of the modeling results
to the observed $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$, [OI] $63\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, and [CII] $158\,\mathrm{\mu
m}$ intensities are not straightforward, we urge the readers to be cautious when constraining the
physical conditions of PDRs with combinations of $^{12}\mathrm{CO}$, $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$, [CI],
[OI] $63\,\mathrm{\mu m}$, and [CII] $158\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ observations.
