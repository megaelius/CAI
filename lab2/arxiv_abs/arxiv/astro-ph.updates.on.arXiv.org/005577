In sunspot umbrae, convection is largely suppressed by the strong magnetic field. Previous measurements
reported on negligible convective flows in umbral cores. Based on this, numerous studies have taken
the umbra as zero reference to calculate Doppler velocities of the ambient active region. To clarify
the amount of convective motion in the darkest part of umbrae, we directly measured Doppler velocities
with an unprecedented accuracy and precision. We performed spectroscopic observations of sunspot
umbrae with the Laser Absolute Reference Spectrograph (LARS) at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope.
A laser frequency comb enabled the calibration of the high-resolution spectrograph and absolute
wavelength positions. A thorough spectral calibration, including the measurement of the reference
wavelength, yielded Doppler shifts of the spectral line Ti i 5713.9 {\AA} with an uncertainty of
around 5 m s-1. The measured Doppler shifts are a composition of umbral convection and magneto-acoustic
waves. For the analysis of convective shifts, we temporally average each sequence to reduce the
superimposed wave signal. Compared to convective blueshifts of up to -350 m s-1 in the quiet Sun,
sunspot umbrae yield a strongly reduced convective blueshifts around -30 m s-1. {W}e find that the
velocity in a sunspot umbra correlates significantly with the magnetic field strength, but also
with the umbral temperature defining the depth of the titanium line. The vertical upward motion
decreases with increasing field strength. Extrapolating the linear approximation to zero magnetic
field reproduces the measured quiet Sun blueshift. Simply taking the sunspot umbra as a zero velocity
reference for the calculation of photospheric Dopplergrams can imply a systematic velocity error.
