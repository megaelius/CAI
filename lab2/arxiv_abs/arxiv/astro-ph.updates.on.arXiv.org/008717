The objective of this work is to study how active galactic nuclei (AGN) influence star formation
in host galaxies. We present a detailed investigation of the star-formation history and conditions
of a $z=2.57$ massive radio galaxy based on VLT/X-SHOOTER and ALMA observations. The deep rest-frame
ultraviolet spectrum contains photospheric absorption lines and wind features indicating the
presence of OB-type stars. The most significantly detected photospheric features are used to characterize
the recent star formation: neither instantaneous nor continuous star-formation history is consistent
with the relative strength of the Si II $\lambda$1485 and S V $\lambda$1502 absorption. Rather,
at least two bursts of star formation took place in the recent past, at $6^{+1}_{-2}$ Myr and $\gtrsim20$
Myr ago, respectively. We deduce a molecular H$_{2}$ gas mass of $(3.9\pm1.0)\times10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$
based on ALMA observations of the [C I] $^3$P$_{2}$-$^3$P$_{1}$ emission. The molecular gas mass
is only 13 % of its stellar mass. Combined with its high star-formation rate of ($1020^{+190}_{-170}$)
Myr, this implies a high star-formation efficiency of $(26\pm8$) Gyr$^{-1}$ and a short depletion
time of $(38\pm12)$ Myr. We attribute the efficient star formation to compressive gas motions in
order to explain the modest velocity dispersions ($\leqslant$ 55 km s$^{-1}$) of the photospheric
lines and of the star-forming gas traced by [C I]. Because of the likely very young age of the radio
source, our findings suggest that vigorous star formation consumes much of the gas and works in concert
with the AGN to remove any residual molecular gas, and eventually quenching star formation in massive
galaxies.
