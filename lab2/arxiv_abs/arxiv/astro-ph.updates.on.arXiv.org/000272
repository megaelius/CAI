Bulk viscosity has been intrinsically existing in the observational cosmos evolution with various
effects for different cosmological evolution stages endowed with complicated cosmic media. Normally
in the idealized "standard cosmology" the physical viscosity effect is often negligent in some
extent by assumptions, except for galaxies formation and evolution or the like astro-physics phenomena.
Actually we have not fully understood the physical origin and effects of cosmic viscosity, including
its practical functions for the universe evolution in reality. In this present article we extend
the concept of temperature related viscosity from classical statistical physics to observational
cosmology, especially we examine the cosmological effects with possibility of the existence for
two kinds of viscosity forms, which are described by the Chapman's relation and Sutherland's formula
respectively. With that the unified dark fluid model and also a modification of standard model with
viscosity which is named as $\Lambda$CDM-V model are constructed physically. While the unified
dark fluid model constrained by observational data is closely related with bouncing phenomenon,
the $\Lambda$CDM-V model is supported more by data-sets fittings with results indicating that
temperature related viscosity could not totally explain the rich physics of dark energy phenomena.
In addition to the enhancement to cosmic age value, the $\Lambda$CDM-V model possesses another
two pleasing features: the prediction about the no-rip/singularity future and the mechanism of
smooth transition from imperfect cosmological models to perfect ones.
