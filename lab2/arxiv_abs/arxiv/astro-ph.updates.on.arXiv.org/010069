The open clusters NGC 2323 and NGC 2539 have been analysed using CCD UBV(RI)KC photometric data,
observed at the San Pedro Martir Observatory. Cluster memberships have been determined with the
proper motion and parallax measures from the GaiaDR2 astrometric data release. Photometric metal
and heavy element abundances have been obtained as (M/H, Z) = (-0.10, 0.012) (NGC 2323) and (-0.31,
0.007) (NGC 2539), from the delta(U-B) technique in the two colour diagrams, which are used to select
the appropriate PARSEC isochrones. The estimated reddening of NGC 2323 is E(B-V) = 0.23+-0.04 using
11 early type stars. For NGC 2539, we find E(B-V)= 0.02+-0.06. For (B-V) colour, distance moduli
and distances for NGC 2323 and NGC 2539 are derived as (V0-MV, d (pc)) = (10.00+-0.10, 1000+-50) and
(V0-MV, d (pc)) = (10.00+-0.04,1000+-20), respectively.The median GaiaDR2 distance d=1000+-140
pc (plx=0.998+-0.136 mas) for the likely members of NGC 2323 is in concordance with its four colour
photometric distances 910-1000 pc. For NGC 2539, its GaiaDR2 distance d=1330+-250 pc (plx=0.751+-0.139
mas) is close to its four colour photometric distances, 1000 pc. Fitting the PARSEC isochrones to
the colour magnitude diagrams (CMDs) gives an old age, 890+-110 Myr, for NGC 2539. Whereas NGC 2323
has an intermediate age, 200+-50 Myr. One Red Clump Red Giant candidate (BD 12 2380) in the CMDs of
NGC 2539 has been confirmed as a member in terms of the distances dI = 950+-50 pc and dV =910+-90 pc of
VI filters within the uncertainties, as compared to the distance, 1000+-20 pc of NGC 2539. This giant's
GaiaDR2 distance (d=1200+-70 pc) is not close to these photometric distances.
