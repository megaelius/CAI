Open Universe for blazars is a set of high-transparency data products for blazar science, and the
tools designed to generate them. Blazar astrophysics is becoming increasingly data driven, depending
on the integration and combined analysis of large quantities of data from the entire span of observational
astrophysics techniques. The project was therefore chosen as one of the pilot activities within
the United Nations Open Universe Initiative. In this work we developed a data analysis pipeline
called Swift_deepsky, based on the Swift XRTDAS software and the XIMAGE package, encapsulated
into a Docker container. Swift_deepsky, downloads and reads low-level data, generates higher-level
products, detects X-ray sources and estimates several intensity and spectral parameters for each
detection, thus facilitating the generation of complete and up-to-date science-ready catalogues
from an entire space-mission dataset. The Docker version of the pipeline and its derived products
is publicly available from the Open Universe Website at openuniverse.asi.it. We present the results
of a detailed X-ray image analysis based on Swift_deepsky on all Swift XRT observations including
a known blazar, carried out during the first 14 years of operations of the Swift Observatory. The
resulting database includes over 27,000 images integrated in different X-ray bands, and a catalogue,
called 1OUSXB, that provides intensity and spectral information for 33,396 X-ray sources, 8,896
of which are single or multiple detections of 2,308 distinct blazars. All the results can be accessed
on-line in a variety of ways: e.g., from the Open Universe portal at openuniverse.asi.it, through
Virtual Observatory services, via the VOU-Blazar tool and the SSDC SED builder. One of the most innovative
aspects of this work is that the results can be safely reproduced and extended by anyone.
