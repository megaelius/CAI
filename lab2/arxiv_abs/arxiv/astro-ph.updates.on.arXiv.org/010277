Using the 870 $\mu$m APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL) and the 850 $\mu$m
JCMT Plane Survey (JPS), we have associated 257 class II 6.7 GHz methanol masers from the Methanol
MultiBeam (MMB) survey with 246 submillimetre continuum sources in the Galactic region 20$^{\circ}$
< $\ell$ < 60$^{\circ}$ and $|b|$ < 1.5$^{\circ}$; this corresponds to 97% of methanol masers in
the region. We combine these with a sample of 700 methanol masers associated with dense clumps reported
in two previous studies. In total, we have identified the host clumps for 958 methanol masers across
the Galactic plane between the longitude range 186$^{\circ}$ $\leq \ell \leq$ 60$^{\circ}$ and
$|b|$ < 2$^{\circ}$; this corresponds to approximately 99% of the MMB catalogue. This sample is
over 30% larger than the most complete maser-dust association sample to date. We use distances and
physical properties drawn from the literature to investigate the correlations between the maser
and clump properties, and investigate how the phase in a clumps evolution in which it host maser emission
fits into the current theory of massive star formation. Clumps hosting methanol masers are significantly
more compact and have higher volume densities than the general population of clumps. We determine
a minimum volume density threshold of $n$(H$_2$)$ \geq$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$ for the efficient formation
of intermediate- and high-mass stars. We find 6.7 GHz methanol masers are associated with a distinct
part of the evolutionary process ($L_{\rm bol}$/$M_{\rm fwhm}$ ratios of between 10$^{0.6}$ and
10$^{2.2}$) and have well defined turning on and termination points. We estimate the lower limit
for the mass of embedded objects to be $\geq$6 M$_{\odot}$ and the statistical lifetime of the methanol
maser stage to be $\sim$3.3$\times$10$^{4}$ yrs, both of which are consistent with the results
of previous work.
