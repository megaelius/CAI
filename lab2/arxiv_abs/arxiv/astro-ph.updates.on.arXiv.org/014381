The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra of distant star-forming (SF) regions cannot be probed directly
using either ground- or space-based telescopes due to the high cross-section for interaction of
EUV photons with the interstellar medium. The mm/submm recombination lines of H and He, which can
be observed from the ground can serve as a reliable probe of the EUV. These lines are weekly impacted
by dust absorption, their fluxes are independent of metallicity, and depend linearly on the number
of EUV continuum photons. We present a study based on ALMA observations of three Galactic ultra-compact
HII regions and the starburst region Sgr B2(M), in which we reconstruct the key parameters of the
EUV spectra of these sources using mm recombination lines of HI, HeI and HeII. We find that the EUV
spectra between 13.6 and 54.4eV of the objects studied here have similar frequency dependence:
L_nu~nu^{-4.5 \pm 0.4}. We compare the inferred values of the EUV spectral slopes with the values
expected for a single stellar evolution model (Starburst99) and the Binary Population and Spectral
Synthesis code (BPASS v2.1). We find that the observed spectral slope gamma~4.5 \pm 0.4 differs
from the model predictions. For an instantaneous starburst model with age <5Myrs the observed spectral
slopes are consistently steeper than predictions of either of the models. For an instantaneous
starburst with age >5Myrs the observed spectral slope is in-between the values predicted by the
two models. This may imply that the fraction of interacting binaries in HII regions is substantially
lower than assumed in BPASS v2.1. The technique demonstrated here allows one to deduce the EUV spectra
of SF regions providing critical insight into photon production rates at lambda>912A and can serve
as calibration to starburst synthesis models, improving our understanding of SF and the properties
of ionizing flux during reionization.
