Aims: ARCiS, a novel code for the analysis of exoplanet transmission and emission spectra is presented.
The aim of the modelling framework is to provide a tool able to link observations to physical models
of exoplanet atmospheres. Methods: The modelling philosophy chosen in this paper is to use physical
and chemical models to constrain certain parameters while keeping free the parts where our physical
understanding is still more limited. This approach, in between full physical modelling and full
parameterisation, allows us to use the processes we understand well and parameterise those less
understood. A Bayesian retrieval framework is implemented and applied to the transit spectra of
a set of 10 hot Jupiters. The code contains chemistry and cloud formation and has the option for self
consistent temperature structure computations. Results: The code presented is fast and flexible
enough to be used for retrieval and for target list simulations for e.g. JWST or the ESA Ariel missions.
We present results for the retrieval of elemental abundance ratios using the physical retrieval
framework and compare this to results obtained using a parameterised retrieval setup. Conclusions:
We conclude that for most of the targets considered the current dataset is not constraining enough
to reliably pin down the elemental abundance ratios. We find no significant correlations between
different physical parameters. We confirm that planets in our sample with a strong slope in the optical
transmission spectrum are the planets where we find cloud formation to be most active. Finally,
we conclude that with ARCiS we have a computationally efficient tool to analyse exoplanet observations
in the context of physical and chemical models.
