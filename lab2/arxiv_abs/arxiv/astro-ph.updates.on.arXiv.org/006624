We have conducted a systematic survey for the X-ray properties of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Currently,
there are 47 MSPs with confirmed X-ray detections. We have also placed the upper limits for the X-ray
emission from the other 36 MSPs by using the archival data. We have normalized their X-ray luminosities
$L_{x}$ and their effective photon indices $\Gamma$ into a homogeneous data set, which enable us
to carry out a detailed statistical analysis. Based on our censored sample, we report a relation
of $L_{x}\simeq10^{31.05}\left(\dot{E}/10^{35}\right)^{1.31}$ erg/s (2-10 keV) for the MSPs.
The inferred X-ray conversion efficiency is found to be lower than previously reported estimate
that could be affected by selection bias. $L_{x}$ also correlates/anti-correlates with the magnetic
field strength at the light cylinder $B_{LC}$/characteristic age $\tau$. On the other hand, there
is no correlation between $L_{x}$ and their surface magnetic field strength $B_{s}$. We have further
divided the sample into four classes: (i) black-widows, (ii) redbacks, (iii) isolated MSPs and
(iv) other MSP binaries, and compare the properties among them. We noted that while the rotational
parameters and the orbital periods of redbacks and black-widow are similar, $L_{x}$ of redbacks
are significantly higher than those of black-widows in the 2-10 keV band. Also the $\Gamma$ of redbacks
are apparently smaller than those of black-widows, which indicates the X-ray emission of redbacks
are harder than that of black-widows. This can be explained by the different contribution of intrabinary
shocks in the X-ray emission of these two classes.
