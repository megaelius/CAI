We search for superflares from 4,068 cool stars in 2+ years of Evryscope photometry, focusing on
those with high-cadence data from both Evryscope and TESS. The Evryscope array of small telescopes
observed 575 flares from 284 stars, with a median energy of 10^34.0 erg. Since 2016, Evryscope has
enabled the detection of rare events from all stars observed by TESS through multi-year, high-cadence
continuous observing. We report ~2X the previous largest number of 10^34 erg high-cadence flares
from nearby cool stars. We find 8 flares with amplitudes of 3+ g' magnitudes, with the largest reaching
5.6 magnitudes and releasing 10^36.2 erg. We observe a 10^34 erg superflare from TOI-455 (LTT 1445),
a mid-M with a rocky planet candidate. We measure the superflare rate per flare-star and quantify
the average flaring of active stars as a function of spectral type, including superflare rates,
FFDs, and typical flare amplitudes in g'. We confirm superflare morphology is broadly consistent
with magnetic re-connection. We estimate starspot coverage necessary to produce superflares,
and hypothesize maximum-allowed superflare energies and waiting-times between flares corresponding
to 100% coverage of the stellar hemisphere. We observe decreased flaring at high galactic latitudes.
We explore the effects of superflares on ozone loss to planetary atmospheres: we observe 1 superflare
with sufficient energy to photo-dissociate all ozone in an Earth-like atmosphere in one event.
We find 17 stars that may deplete an Earth-like atmosphere via repeated flaring. Of the 1822 stars
around which TESS may discover temperate rocky planets, we observe 14.6% +/- 2% emit large flares.
