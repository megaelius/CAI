We report the discovery of a candidate z~8 galaxy lensed by a foreground z~1.7 group, found in the
pure-parallel HST images taken as part of the BoRG Survey. The system consists of a Y-dropout galaxy
with m=25.92 +/-0.14 which appears to be strongly lensed by a foreground group with a photometric
z~1.7, which would be the highest-z deflector discovered to date. Several pieces of circumstantial
evidence point toward the lensing hypothesis: 1) The z~8 dropout is close in projection to the foreground
group, 2) it is slightly elongated tangentially in the direction of the putative critical curve,
3) a possible counter image is marginally detected and 4) the Y-dropout is not clustered, implying
that it is intrinsically fainter that it appears, i.e. it has been magnified. We show that the configuration
can be accurately reproduced by an SIE deflector and a source with a Sersic surface brightness profile.
The best fit model has a deflector Einstein Radius of 1.49"+0.03"/-0.01", and the unlensed z~8 source
has a Sersic index n=0.92 +0.24/-0.16 and an effective radius of r_e=0.08" +/- 0.01" with mAB =27.4
+/-0.1 which has been magnified by a factor of 3.7 +/- 0.2. A non-parametric reconstruction of the
source with LENSVIEW corroborates the derived source parameters. The lens model yields a group
mass of 1.08 +0.10/-0.15*10^12 M_sun and a mass-to-light ratio of M/L_B=30.7 +3.7/-12.6 M_sun/L_sun
within the Einstein Radius. Assuming a standard dark matter fraction of 1/3, the main deflector
galaxy has a stellar mass-to-light ratio of M/L_B=2.2 +0.4/-1.1 M_sun/L_sun. If confirmed, the
system provides a unique opportunity to obtain spectroscopy of a typical z~8 galaxy and an absolute
measure of mass for a galaxy at z~1.7. The discovery of this candidate is qualitatively consistent
with the theoretical expectation that 10% of z~8 galaxies with luminosity L>2L* are significantly
magnified.
