Context. Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust ranging from micron
to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual grains of those sizes were collected
and assembled into planetesimals in the young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust
collection of a swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to $10^3$\,km
and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust drifting in the disk due to gas
drag by planetesimal accounting for several regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal,
dust, and orbital distance: the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also
include a hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be carried by the
gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions for the collision probability
of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard
turbulence conditions (i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to
be inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt of planetesimals
extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are eventually accreted by the central star
rather than colliding with planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$)
filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all smaller than about 10
km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary
embryos larger than about 1000 km in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller
than one tenth of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case most collisions
take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very different properties: we find that
the local filtering efficiency $x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital
distance) in the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime. This
implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur close to the central star
and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling
regime is expected to be more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust particles
much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the smallest planetesimals because
they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime.
Conclusions. Our results hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system
because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more efficiently close
to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally
captures inward-drifting dust and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered
by planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it has been assembled
into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly growth, capture into vortexes). Further
refinement of our work concerns, among other things: a quantitative description of the transition
region between the hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for collisions,
in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to a planetesimal formation model.
