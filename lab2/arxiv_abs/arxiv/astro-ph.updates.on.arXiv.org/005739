We performed the new JVLA full polarization observations at 40-48 GHz (6.3-7.5 mm) towards the nearby
($d$ $=$147$\pm$3.4 pc) Class 0 YSO IRAS 16293-2422, and compare with the previous SMA observations
reported by Rao et al. (2009; 2014). We observed the quasar J1407+2827 which is weakly polarized
and can be used as a leakage term calibrator for $<$9 GHz observations, to gauge the potential residual
polarization leakage after calibration. We did not detect Stokes Q, U, and V intensities from the
observations of J1407+2827, and constrain (3-$\sigma$) the residual polarization leakage after
calibration to be $\lesssim$0.3\%. We detect linear polarization from one of the two binary components
of our target source, IRAS\,16293-2422\,B. The derived polarization position angles from our
observations are in excellent agreement with those detected from the previous observations of
the SMA, implying that on the spatial scale we are probing ($\sim$50-1000 au), the physical mechanisms
for polarizing the continuum emission do not vary significantly over the wavelength range of $\sim$0.88-7.5
mm. We hypothesize that the observed polarization position angles trace the magnetic field which
converges from large scale to an approximately face-on rotating accretion flow. In this scenario,
magnetic field is predominantly poloidal on $>$100 au scales, and becomes toroidal on smaller scales.
However, this interpretation remains uncertain due to the high dust optical depths at the central
region of IRAS\,16293-2422\,B and the uncertain temperature profile. We suggest that dust polarization
at wavelengths comparable or longer than 7\,mm may still trace interstellar magnetic field. Future
sensitive observations of dust polarization in the fully optically thin regime will have paramount
importance for unambiguously resolving the magnetic field configuration.
