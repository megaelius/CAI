Metallic microstructures in slowly-cooled iron-rich meteorites reflect the thermal and magnetic
histories of their parent planetesimals. Of particular interest is the cloudy zone, a nanoscale
intergrowth of Ni-rich islands within a Ni-poor matrix that forms below 350{\deg}C by spinodal
decomposition. The sizes of the islands have long been recognized as reflecting the low-temperature
cooling rates of meteorite parent bodies. However, a model capable of providing quantitative cooling
rate estimates from island sizes has been lacking. Moreover, these islands are also capable of preserving
a record of the ambient magnetic field as they grew, but some of the key physical parameters required
for recovering reliable paleointensity estimates from magnetic measurements of these islands
have been poorly constrained. To address both of these issues, we present a numerical model of the
structural and compositional evolution of the cloudy zone as a function of cooling rate and local
composition. Our model produces island sizes that are consistent with present-day measured sizes.
This model enables a substantial improvement in the calibration of paleointensity estimates and
associated uncertainties. In particular, we can now accurately quantify the statistical uncertainty
associated with the finite number of islands and the uncertainty on their size at the time of the record.
We use this new understanding to revisit paleointensities from previous pioneering paleomagnetic
studies of cloudy zones. We show that these could have been overestimated but nevertheless still
require substantial magnetic fields to have been present on their parent bodies. Our model also
allows us to estimate absolute cooling rates for meteorites that cooled slower than 10000{\deg}C
My-1. We demonstrate how these cooling rate estimates can uniquely constrain the low-temperature
thermal history of meteorite parent bodies.
