Large-scale planetary or stellar magnetic fields generated by a dynamo effect are mostly attributed
to flows forced by buoyancy forces in electrically conducting fluid layers. However, these large-scale
fields may also be controlled by tides, as previously suggested for the star $\tau$-boo, Mars or
the Early Moon. By simulating a small local patch of a rotating fluid, \cite{Barker2014} have recently
shown that tides can drive small-scale dynamos by exciting a hydrodynamic instability, the so-called
elliptical (or tidal) instability. By performing global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
a rotating spherical fluid body, we investigate if this instability can also drive the observed
large-scale magnetic fields. We are thus interested by the dynamo threshold and the generated magnetic
field in order to test if such a mechanism is relevant for planets and stars. Rather than solving the
problem in a geometry deformed by tides, we consider a spherical fluid body and add a body force to
mimic the tidal deformation in the bulk of the fluid. This allows us to use an efficient spectral code
to solve the magnetohydrodynamic problem. We first compare the hydrodynamic results with theoretical
asymptotic results, and numerical results obtained in a truely deformed ellipsoid, which confirms
the presence of the elliptical instability. We then perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations,
and investigate the dynamo capability of the flow. Kinematic and self-consistent dynamos are finally
simulated, showing that the elliptical instability is capable of generating dipole dominated
large-scale magnetic field in global simulations of a fluid rotating sphere.
