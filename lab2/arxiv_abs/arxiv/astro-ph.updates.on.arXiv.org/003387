We present improved Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer (MONS) maps of near-surface Water-Equivalent
Hydrogen (WEH) on Mars that have intriguing implications for the global distribution of "excess"
ice, which occurs when the mass fraction of water ice exceeds the threshold amount needed to saturate
the pore volume in normal soils. We have refined the crossover technique of Feldman et al. (2011)
by using spatial deconvolution and Gaussian weighting to create the first globally self-consistent
map of WEH. At low latitudes, our new maps indicate that WEH exceeds 15% in several near-equatorial
regions, such as Arabia Terra, which has important implications for the types of hydrated minerals
present at low latitudes. At high latitudes, we demonstrate that the disparate MONS and Phoenix
Robotic Arm (RA) observations of near surface WEH can be reconciled by a three-layer model incorporating
dry soil over fully saturated pore ice over pure excess ice: such a three-layer model can also potentially
explain the strong anticorrelation of subsurface ice content and ice table depth observed at high
latitudes. At moderate latitudes, we show that the distribution of recently formed impact craters
is also consistent with our latest MONS results, as both the shallowest ice-exposing crater and
deepest non-ice-exposing crater at each impact site are in good agreement with our predictions
of near-surface WEH. Overall, we find that our new mapping is consistent with the widespread presence
at mid-to-high Martian latitudes of recently deposited shallow excess ice reservoirs that are
not yet in equilibrium with the atmosphere.
