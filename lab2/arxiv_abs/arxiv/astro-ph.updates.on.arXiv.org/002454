The [CII] 157.74 $\mu$m transition is the dominant coolant of the neutral interstellar gas, and
has great potential as a star formation rate (SFR) tracer. Using the Herschel KINGFISH sample of
46 nearby galaxies, we investigate the relation of [CII] surface brightness and luminosity with
SFR. We conclude that [CII] can be used for measurements of SFR on both global and kiloparsec scales
in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strong active galactic nuclei (AGN). The uncertainty
of the $\Sigma_{\rm [CII]}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. The main source of
scatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm IR colors, and we provide
an adjustment based on IR color that reduces the scatter. We show that the color-adjusted $\Sigma_{\rm[CII]}-\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, holding for
both normal star-forming galaxies and non-AGN luminous infrared galaxies. Using [CII] luminosity
instead of surface brightness to estimate SFR suffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting
SFR in luminous infrared galaxies even after IR color adjustment (although this depends on the SFR
measure employed). We suspect that surface brightness relations are better behaved than the luminosity
relations because the former are more closely related to the local far-UV field strength, most likely
the main parameter controlling the efficiency of the conversion of far-UV radiation into gas heating.
A simple model based on Starburst99 population-synthesis code to connect SFR to [CII] finds that
heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normal galaxies.
