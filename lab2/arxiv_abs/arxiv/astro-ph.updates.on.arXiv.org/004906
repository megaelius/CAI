We discuss the approach of searching low mass dwarf galaxies, $\lesssim10^6\textrm{ M}_{\odot}$,
in the general field, using integrated light surveys. By exploring the limiting surface brightness-spatial
resolution ($\mu_{\textrm{eff,lim}}-\theta$) parameter space, we suggest that faint field
dwarfs in the Local Volume, between $3$ and $10 \textrm{ Mpc}$, are expected to be detected effectively
and in large numbers using integrated light photometric surveys, complementary to the classical
star counts method. We use a sample of Local Group dwarf galaxies to construct relations between
their photometric and structural parameters, $\textrm{M}_{*}$-$\mu_{\textrm{eff,V}}$ and
$\textrm{M}_{*}$-$\textrm{R}_{\textrm{eff}}$. We use these relations, along with assumed
functional forms for the halo mass function and the stellar mass-halo mass relation, to calculate
the lowest detectable stellar masses in the Local Volume and the expected number of galaxies as a
function of the limiting surface brightness and spatial resolution. The number of detected galaxies
depends mostly on the limiting surface brightness for distances $>3\textrm{ Mpc}$ while spatial
resolution starts to play a role at distances $>8\textrm{ Mpc}$. Surveys with $\mu_{\textrm{eff,lim}}\sim30\textrm{
mag arcsec}^{-2}$ should be able to detect galaxies with stellar masses down to $\sim10^4 \textrm{
M}_{\odot}$ in the Local Volume. Depending on the assumed stellar mass-halo mass relation, the
expected number of galaxies between $3$ and $10\textrm{ Mpc}$ is $0.04-0.35\textrm{ deg}^{-2}$,
assuming a limiting surface brightness of $\sim29-30\textrm{ mag arcsec}^{-2}$ and a spatial
resolution $<4''$. We currently look for field dwarf galaxies by performing a blank wide-field
survey with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, optimized for the detection of ultra-low surface brightness
structures.
