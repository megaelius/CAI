Context. Convective regions in stellar models are always associated with uncertainties, for example
due to extra-mixing or the possible inaccurate position of the transition from convective to radiative
transport of energy. These have a strong impact on stellar models and their fundamental parameters.
The most promising method to reduce these uncertainties is to use asteroseismology to derive diagnostics
probing the structural characteristics of these regions. Aims. We wish to use custom-made integrated
quantities to improve the capabilities of seismology to probe convective regions in stellar interiors.
We hope to increase the number of indicators obtained with structural seismic inversions to provide
additional constraints on stellar models and the fundamental parameters determined from theoretical
modeling. Methods. First, we present new kernels associated with a proxy of the entropy in stellar
interiors. We then show how these kernels can be used to build custom-made integrated quantities
probing convective regions inside stellar models. We present two indicators suited to probe convective
cores and envelopes, respectively, and test them on artificial data. Results. We show that it is
possible to probe both convective cores and envelopes using appropriate indicators obtained with
structural inversion techniques. These indicators provide direct constraints on a proxy of the
entropy of the stellar plasma, sensitive to the characteristics of convective regions. These constraints
can then be used to improve the modeling of solar-like stars by providing an additional degree of
selection of models obtained from classical forward modeling approaches. We also show that in order
to obtain very accurate indicators, we need l = 3 modes for the envelope but that the core-conditions
indicator is more flexible in terms of the seismic data required for its use.
