The James Webb Space Telescope will allow to spectroscopically study an unprecedented number of
galaxies deep into the reionization era, notably by detecting [OIII] and H$\beta$ nebular emission
lines. To efficiently prepare such observations, we photometrically select a large sample of galaxies
at $z\sim8$ and study their rest-frame optical emission lines. Combining data from the GOODS Re-ionization
Era wide-Area Treasury from Spitzer (GREATS) survey and from HST, we perform spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting, using synthetic SEDs from a large grid of photoionization models. The deep Spitzer/IRAC
data combined with our models exploring a large parameter space enables to constrain the [OIII]+H$\beta$
fluxes and equivalent widths for our sample, as well as the average physical properties of $z\sim8$
galaxies, such as the ionizing photon production efficiency with $\log(\xi_\mathrm{ion}/\mathrm{erg}^{-1}\hspace{1mm}\mathrm{Hz})\geq25.77$.
We find a relatively tight correlation between the [OIII]+H$\beta$ and UV luminosity, which we
use to derive for the first time the [OIII]+H$\beta$ luminosity function (LF) at $z\sim8$. The $z\sim8$
[OIII]+H$\beta$ LF is higher at all luminosities compared to lower redshift, as opposed to the UV
LF, due to an increase of the [OIII]+H$\beta$ luminosity at a given UV luminosity from $z\sim3$ to
$z\sim8$. Finally, using the [OIII]+H$\beta$ LF, we make predictions for JWST/NIRSpec number
counts of $z\sim8$ galaxies. We find that the current wide-area extragalactic legacy fields are
too shallow to use JWST at maximal efficiency for $z\sim8$ spectroscopy even at 1hr depth and JWST
pre-imaging to $\gtrsim30$ mag will be required.
