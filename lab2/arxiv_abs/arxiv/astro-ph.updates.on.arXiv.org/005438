We investigate axisymmetric black hole~(BH) formation and its gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino
signals with self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations of a non-rotating $40~M_\odot$
progenitor star using the isotropic diffusion source approximation for the neutrino transport
and a modified gravitational potential for general relativistic effects. We consider four different
neutron star (NS) equations of state~(EoS): LS220, SFHo, BHB$\Lambda\phi$ and DD2, and study the
impact of the EoS on BH formation dynamics and GW emission. We find that the BH formation time is sensitive
to the EoS from 460 to $>1300$~ms and is delayed in multiple dimensions for $\sim~100-250$~ms due
to the finite entropy effects. Depending on the EoS, our simulations show the possibility that shock
revival can occur along with the collapse of the proto-neutron star~(PNS) to a BH. The gravitational
waveforms contain four major features that are similar to previous studies but show extreme values:
(1)~a low frequency signal ($\sim~300-500$~Hz) from core-bounce and prompt convection, (2)~a
strong signal from the PNS g-mode oscillation among other features, (3)~a high frequency signal
from the PNS inner-core convection, and (4)~signals from the standing accretion shock instability
and convection. The peak frequency at the onset of BH formation reaches to $\sim~2.3$~kHz. The characteristic
amplitude of a 10~kpc object at peak frequency is detectable but close to the noise threshold of the
Advanced~LIGO and KAGRA, suggesting that the next generation gravitational wave detector will
need to improve the sensitivity at the kHz domain to better observe stellar-mass BH formation from
core-collapse supernovae or failed supernovae.
