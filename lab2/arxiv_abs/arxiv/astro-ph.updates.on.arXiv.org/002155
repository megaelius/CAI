(Abridged) The abundances of alpha-elements are a powerful diagnostic of the star formation history
and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Sulphur, being moderately volatile, can be reliably measured
in the interstellar medium (ISM) of damped Ly-alpha galaxies and extragalactic HII regions. Measurements
in stars of different metallicity in our Galaxy can then be readily compared to the abundances in
external galaxies. Such a comparison is not possible for Si or Ca that suffer depletion onto dust
in the ISM. Furthermore, studying sulphur is interesting because it probes nucleosynthetic conditions
that are very different from those of O or Mg. The measurements in star clusters are a reliable tracers
of the Galactic evolution of sulphur. We find <A(S)>NLTE=6.11+/-0.04 for M 4, <A(S)>NLTE=7.17+/-0.02
for NGC 2477, and <A(S)>NLTE=7.13+/-0.06 for NGC 5822. For the only star studied in Trumpler
5 we find A(S)NLTE=6.43+/-0.03 and A(S)LTE=6.94+/-0.05. Our measurements show that, by and large,
the S abundances in Galactic clusters trace reliably those in field stars. The only possible exception
is Trumpler 5, for which the NLTE sulphur abundance implies an [S/Fe] ratio lower by roughly 0.4 dex
than observed in field stars of comparable metallicity, even though its LTE sulphur abundance is
in line with abundances of field stars. Moreover the LTE sulphur abundance is consistent only with
the abundance of another alpha-element, Mg, in the same star, while the low NLTE value is consistent
with Si and Ca. The S abundances in our sample of stars in clusters imply that the clusters are chemically
homogeneous for S within 0.05 dex.
