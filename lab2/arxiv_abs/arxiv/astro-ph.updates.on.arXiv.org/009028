The treatment of unknown foreground contaminations will be one of the major challenges for galaxy
clustering analyses of coming decadal surveys. These data contaminations introduce erroneous
large-scale effects in recovered power spectra and inferred dark matter density fields. In this
work, we present an effective solution to this problem in terms of a robust likelihood designed to
account for effects due to unknown foreground and target contaminations. Conceptually, this robust
likelihood marginalizes over the unknown large-scale contamination amplitudes. We showcase
the effectiveness of this novel likelihood via an application to a mock SDSS-III data set subject
to dust extinction contamination. In order to illustrate the performance of our proposed likelihood,
we infer the underlying dark matter density field and reconstruct the matter power spectrum while
being maximally agnostic about the foregrounds. These results are contrasted to an analysis with
a standard Poissonian likelihood, as typically used in modern large-scale structure analyses.
While the standard Poissonian analysis yields excessive power for large-scale modes and introduces
an overall bias in the power spectrum, our likelihood provides unbiased estimates of the matter
power spectrum over the entire range of Fourier modes considered in this work. Further, we demonstrate
that our approach accurately accounts for and corrects effects of unknown foreground contaminations
when inferring three-dimensional density fields. Robust likelihood approaches, as presented
in this work, will be crucial to control unknown systematics and maximize the outcome of the decadal
surveys.
