The formation and the evolution of protoplanetary disks are important stages in the lifetime of
stars. The processes of disk evolution and planet formation are intrinsically linked. We spatially
resolve with GRAVITY/VLTI in the K-band the sub au-scale region of 27 stars to gain statistical understanding
of their properties. We look for correlations with stellar parameters, such as luminosity, mass,
temperature and age. Our sample also cover a range of various properties in terms of reprocessed
flux, flared or flat morphology, and gaps. We developed semi-physical geometrical models to fit
our interferometric data. Our best models correspond to smooth and wide rings, implying that wedge-shaped
rims at the dust sublimation edge are favored, as found in the H-band. The closure phases are generally
non-null with a median value of ~10 deg, indicating spatial asymmetries of the intensity distributions.
Multi-size grain populations could explain the closure phase ranges below 20-25 deg but other scenarios
should be invoked to explain the largest ones. Our measurements extend the Radius-Luminosity relation
to ~1e4 Lsun and confirm the significant spread around the mean relation observed in the H-band.
Gapped sources exhibit a large N-to-K band size ratio and large values of this ratio are only observed
for the members of our sample that would be older than 1 Ma, less massive, and with lower luminosity.
In the 2 Ms mass range, we observe a correlation in the increase of the relative age with the transition
from group II to group I, and an increase of the N-to-K size ratio. However, the size of the current
sample does not yet permit us to invoke a clear universal evolution mechanism across the HAeBe mass
range. The measured locations of the K-band emission suggest that these disks might be structured
by forming young planets, rather than by depletion due to EUV, FUV, and X-ray photo-evaporation.
