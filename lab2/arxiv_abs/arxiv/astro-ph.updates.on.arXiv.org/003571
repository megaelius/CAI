We analyze spectropolarimetric sunspot umbra observations taken in the near-infrared Si i 1082.7
nm line taking NLTE effects into account. The data were obtained with the GRIS instrument installed
at the German GREGOR telescope. A point spread function (PSF) was constructed using prior Mercury
observations with GRIS and the information provided by the adaptive optics system of the GREGOR
telescope. The data were then deconvolved from the PSF using a principal component analysis deconvolution
method and were analyzed via the NICOLE inversion code. The Si i 1082.7 nm line seems to be in emission
in the umbra of the observed sunspot after the effects of scattered light are removed. We show how
the spectral line shape of umbral profiles changes dramatically with the amount of scattered light.
Indeed, the continuum levels range, on average, from 44% of the quiet Sun continuum intensity to
about 20%. The inferred levels are in line with current model predictions and empirical umbral models.
Current umbral empirical models are not able to reproduce the emission in the deconvolved umbral
Stokes profiles. The results of the NLTE inversions suggests that to obtain the emission in the Si
i 1082.7 nm line, the temperature stratification should first have a hump located at about log tau
-2 and start rising at lower heights when moving into the transition region. This is, to our knowledge,
the first time the Si i 1082.7 nm line is seen in emission in sunspot umbrae. The results show that the
temperature stratification of current umbral models may be more complex than expected with the
transition region located at lower heights above sunspot umbrae. Our finding might provide insights
into understanding why the sunspot umbra emission in the millimeter spectral range is less than
that predicted by current empirical umbral models.
