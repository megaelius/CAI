We present measurements of the X-ray observables of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), including
luminosity $L_X$, ICM mass $M_{ICM}$, emission-weighted mean temperature $T_X$, and integrated
pressure $Y_X$, that are derived from XMM-Newton X-ray observations of a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect
(SZE) selected sample of 59 galaxy clusters from the South Pole Telescope SPT-SZ survey that span
the redshift range of $0.20 < z < 1.5$. We constrain the best-fit power law scaling relations between
X-ray observables, redshift, and halo mass. The halo masses are estimated based on previously published
SZE observable to mass scaling relations, calibrated using information that includes the halo
mass function. Employing SZE-based masses in this sample enables us to constrain these scaling
relations for massive galaxy clusters ($M_{500}\geq 3 \times10^{14}$ $M_\odot$) to the highest
redshifts where these clusters exist without concern for X-ray selection biases. We find that the
mass trends are steeper than self-similarity in all cases, and with $\geq 2.5{\sigma}$ significance
in the case of $L_X$ and $M_{ICM}$. The redshift trends are consistent with the self-similar expectation,
but the uncertainties remain large. Core-included scaling relations tend to have steeper mass
trends for $L_X$. There is no convincing evidence for a redshift-dependent mass trend in any observable.
The constraints on the amplitudes of the fitted scaling relations are currently limited by the systematic
uncertainties on the SZE-based halo masses, however the redshift and mass trends are limited by
the X-ray sample size and the measurement uncertainties of the X-ray observables.
