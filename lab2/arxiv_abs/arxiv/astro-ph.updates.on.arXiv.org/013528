Forming gas giant planets by the accretion of 100 km diameter planetesimals, a typical size that
results from self-gravity assisted planetesimal formation, is often thought to be inefficient.
Many models therefore use small km-sized planetesimals, or invoke the accretion of pebbles. Furthermore,
models based on planetesimal accretion often use the ad hoc assumption of planetesimals distributed
radially in a minimum mass solar nebula fashion. We wish to investigate the impact of various initial
radial density distributions in planetesimals with a dynamical model for the formation of planetesimals
on the resulting population of planets. In doing so, we highlight the directive role of the early
stages of dust evolution into pebbles and planetesimals in the circumstellar disk on the following
planetary formation. We have implemented a two population model for solid evolution and a pebble
flux regulated model for planetesimal formation into our global model for planet population synthesis.
This framework is used to study the global effect of planetesimal formation on planet formation.
As reference, we compare our dynamically formed planetesimal surface densities with ad-hoc set
distributions of different radial density slopes of planetesimals. Even though required, it is
not solely the total planetesimal disk mass, but the planetesimal surface density slope and subsequently
the formation mechanism of planetesimals, that enables planetary growth via planetesimal accretion.
Highly condensed regions of only 100 km sized planetesimals in the inner regions of circumstellar
disks can lead to gas giant growth. Pebble flux regulated planetesimal formation strongly boosts
planet formation, because it is a highly effective mechanism to create a steep planetesimal density
profile. We find this to lead to the formation of giant planets inside 1 au by 100 km already by pure
planetesimal accretion.
