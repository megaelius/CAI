Understanding the nuclear growth and feedback processes in galaxies requires investigating their
often obscured central regions. One way to do this is to use (sub)millimeter line emission from vibrationally
excited HCN (HCN-vib). It has been suggested that the most intense HCN-vib emission from a galaxy
is connected to a phase of nuclear growth that occurs before the nuclear feedback processes have
been fully developed. We aim to investigate if there is a connection between the presence of strong
HCN-vib emission and the development of feedback in (U)LIRGs. We collected literature and archival
data to compare the luminosities of rotational lines of HCN-vib, normalized to the total infrared
luminosity, to the median velocities of 119 {\mu}m OH absorption lines, potentially indicating
outflows, in a total of 17 (U)LIRGs. The most HCN-vib luminous systems all lack signatures of significant
molecular outflows in the far-infrared OH absorption lines. However, at least some of the systems
with bright HCN-vib emission do have fast and collimated outflows that can be seen in spectral lines
at longer wavelengths. We conclude that the galaxy nuclei with the highest L(HCN-vib)/L(IR) do
not drive wide-angle outflows detectable using the median velocities of far-infrared OH absorption
lines. It is possible that this is due to an orientation effect where sources which are oriented in
such a way that their outflows are not along our line of sight also radiate a smaller proportion of
their infrared luminosity in our direction. It could also be that massive wide-angle outflows destroy
the deeply embedded regions responsible for bright HCN-vib emission, so that the two phenomena
cannot coexist. This would strengthen the idea that vibrationally excited HCN traces a heavily
obscured stage of evolution before nuclear feedback mechanisms are fully developed.
