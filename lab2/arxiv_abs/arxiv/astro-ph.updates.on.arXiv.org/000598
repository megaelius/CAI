We derive rotation curves from optical emission lines of 182 disk galaxies (96 in the cluster and
86 in the field) in the region of Abell 901/902 located at $z\sim 0.165$. We focus on the analysis of
B-band and stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relations. We examine possible environmental dependencies
and differences between normal spirals and "dusty red" galaxies, i.e. disk galaxies that have red
colors due to relatively low star formation rates. We find no significant differences between the
best-fit TF slope of cluster and field galaxies. At fixed slope, the field population with high-quality
rotation curves (57 objects) is brighter by $\Delta M_{B}=-0\fm42\pm0\fm15$ than the cluster
population (55 objects). We show that this slight difference is at least in part an environmental
effect. The scatter of the cluster TFR increases for galaxies closer to the core region, also indicating
an environmental effect. Interestingly, dusty red galaxies become fainter towards the core at
given rotation velocity (i.e. total mass). This indicates that the star formation in these galaxies
is in the process of being quenched. The luminosities of normal spiral galaxies are slightly higher
at fixed rotation velocity for smaller cluster-centric radii. Probably these galaxies are gas-rich
(compared to the dusty red population) and the onset of ram-pressure stripping increases their
star-formation rates. The results from the TF analysis are consistent with and complement our previous
findings. Dusty red galaxies might be an intermediate stage in the transformation of infalling
field spiral galaxies into cluster S0s, and this might explain the well-known increase of the S0
fraction in galaxy clusters with cosmic time.
