We present \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} variability monitoring observations of three low-gravity
L dwarfs with previous detections of variability in the near-IR, 2MASS J0045+16, 2MASS J0501-00
and 2MASS J1425-36. We detect significant, periodic variability in two of our targets, 2MASS J0045+16
and 2MASS J0501-00. We do not detect variability in 2MASS J1425-36. Combining our new rotation periods
with rotational velocities, we calculate inclination angles of $22\pm1^{\circ}$, ${60^{+13
}_{-8}} ^{\circ}$ and $52^{+19}_{-13}~^{\circ}$ for 2MASS J0045+16, 2MASS J0501-00 and 2MASS
J1425-36 respectively. Our three new objects are consistent with the tentative relations between
inclination, amplitude and color anomaly previously reported. Objects with the highest variability
amplitudes are inclined equator-on, while the maximum observed amplitude decreases as the inclination
angle decreases. We also find a correlation between the inclination angle and $(J-K)_{\mathrm{2MASS}}$
color anomaly for the sample of objects with measured inclinations. Compiling the entire sample
of brown dwarfs with \textit{Spitzer} variability detections, we find no enhancement in amplitude
for young, early-L dwarfs compared to the field dwarf population. We find a possible enhancement
in amplitude of low-gravity late-L dwarfs at $4.5~\mu$m. We do not find a correlation between amplitude
ratio and spectral type for field dwarfs or for the young population. Finally, we compile the rotation
periods of a large sample of brown dwarfs with ages 1 Myr to 1 Gyr and compare the rotation rates predicted
by evolutionary models assuming angular momentum conservation. We find that the rotation rates
of the current sample of brown dwarfs fall within the expected range set by evolutionary models and
breakup limits.
