(Abridged) Using the Zwicky Transient Facility alert stream, we are conducting a large campaign
to spectroscopically classify all transients occurring in galaxies in the Census of the Local Universe
(CLU) catalog. The aim of the experiment is to construct a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited
sample of transients coincident within 100" of CLU galaxies out to 200 Mpc, and to a depth of 20 mag.
We describe the survey design and spectroscopic completeness from the first 16 months of operations.
We present results from a systematic search for Calcium rich gap transients in the sample of 22 low
luminosity (peak absolute magnitude $M > -17$), hydrogen poor events found in the experiment (out
of 754 spectroscopically classified SNe). We report the detection of eight Calcium rich gap transients,
and constrain their volumetric rate to be at least $\approx 15\pm5$% of the SN Ia rate. Combining
this sample with ten events from the literature, we find a likely continuum of spectroscopic properties
ranging from events with SN Ia-like features (Ca-Ia objects) to SN Ib/c-like features (Ca-Ib/c
objects) at peak light. Within the Ca-Ib/c events, we find two populations of events distinguished
by their red ($g - r \approx 1.5$ mag) or green ($g - r \approx 0.5$ mag) spectral colors at $r$-band
peak, wherein redder events show strong line blanketing signatures, slower light curves, weaker
He lines and lower [Ca II]/[O I] in the nebular phase. Together, we find that the spectroscopic continuum,
volumetric rates and striking old environments are consistent with the explosive burning of He
shells on low mass white dwarfs. We posit that Ca-Ia and red Ca-Ib/c objects are consistent with the
double detonation of He shells with high He burning efficiency, while green Ca-Ib/c objects could
arise from less efficient He burning scenarios such as detonations in low density He shells or He
shell deflagrations.
