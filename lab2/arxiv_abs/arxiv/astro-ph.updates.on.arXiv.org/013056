The synchrotron cooling of relativistic electrons is one of the most effective radiation mechanisms
in astrophysics. It not only accompanies the process of particle acceleration but also has feedback
on the formation of the energy distribution of the parent electrons. The radiative cooling time
of electrons decreases with energy as $t_{\rm syn} \propto 1/E$; correspondingly the overall radiation
efficiency increases with energy. On the other hand, this effect strictly limits the maximum energy
of individual photons. Even in the so-called extreme accelerators, where the acceleration proceeds
at the highest possible rate, $t_{\rm acc} = E/eBc$, the synchrotron radiation cannot extend well
beyond the characteristic energy determined by the electron mass and the fine-structure constant:
$h \nu_{\rm max} \sim m_e c^2/\alpha \sim 100 \rm\,MeV$. In a highly turbulent medium with a broad
magnetic field distribution, this limit is shifted towards higher energies. However, for any realistic
distribution of the magnetic field, it cannot significantly exceed $ h \nu_{\rm max}$. In this paper,
we propose a model in which the formation of synchrotron radiation takes place in compact magnetic
blobs located inside the particle accelerator. We develop a formalism for calculations of synchrotron
radiation emerging from such systems. We demonstrate that for certain combinations of parameters
characterizing the accelerator and the magnetic blobs, the synchrotron radiation can extend into
the very high energy (VHE) domain, $h \nu_{\rm max} \geq 100 \ \rm GeV$. We briefly outline the possible
astrophysical implications of the results in the context of VHE radiation of blazars and gamma-ray
bursts.
