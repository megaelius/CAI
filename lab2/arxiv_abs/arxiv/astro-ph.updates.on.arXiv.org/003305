In this paper we analyse the pre-explosion spectrum of SN2015bh by performing radiative transfer
simulations using the CMFGEN code. This object has attracted significant attention due to its remarkable
similarity to SN2009ip in both its pre- and post-explosion behavior. They seem to belong to a class
of events for which the fate as a genuine core-collapse supernova or a non-terminal explosion is
still under debate. Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of SN2015bh had an effective temperature
between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity ~2.7e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,
and half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN2015bh generated an
extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3 Msun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined
that the wind extended to at least 7e14 cm and lasted for at least 81 days prior to the observations,
releasing 2.2e-4 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we propose that this
is the material that the explosive ejecta will interact at late epochs. We conclude that the progenitor
of SN2015bh was most likely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 60 Msun before the explosion.
Considering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the progenitor was a
Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption, similar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode.
If the star survived, late-time spectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star,
depending on the mass of the H envelope before the explosion. If the star exploded as a genuine SN,
2015bh would be a remarkable case of a successful explosion after black-hole formation in a star
with 60 Msun at the pre-SN stage.
