The most accurate method for modelling planetary migration and hence the formation of resonant
systems is using hydrodynamical simulations. Usually, the force (torque) acting on a planet is
calculated using the forces from the gas disc and the star, while the gas accelerations are computed
using the pressure gradient, the star, and the planet's gravity, ignoring its own gravity. For the
non-migrating the neglect of the disc gravity results in a consistent torque calculation while
for the migrating case it is inconsistent. We aim to study how much this inconsistent torque calculation
can affect the final configuration of a two-planet system. Our focus will be on low-mass planets
because most of the multi-planetary systems, discovered by the Kepler survey, have masses around
10 Earth masses. Performing hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disc interaction, we measure
the torques on non-migrating and migrating planets for various disc masses as well as density and
temperature slopes with and without considering the disc self-gravity. Using this data, we find
a relation that quantifies the inconsistency, use it in an N-body code, and perform an extended parameter
study modelling the migration of a planetary system with different planet mass ratios and disc surface
densities, in order to investigate the impact of the torque inconsistency on the architecture of
the planetary system. Not considering disc self-gravity produces an artificially larger torque
on the migrating planet that can result in tighter planetary systems. The deviation of this torque
from the correct value is larger in discs with steeper surface density profiles. In hydrodynamical
modelling of multi-planetary systems, it is crucial to account for the torque correction, otherwise
the results favour more packed systems.
