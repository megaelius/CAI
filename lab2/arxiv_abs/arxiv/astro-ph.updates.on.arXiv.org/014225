We present cosmological parameter measurements from the publicly available Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data on anisotropic galaxy clustering in Fourier space. Compared
to previous studies, our analysis has two main novel features. First, we use a complete perturbation
theory model that properly takes into account the non-linear effects of dark matter clustering,
short-scale physics, galaxy bias, redshift-space distortions, and large-scale bulk flows. Second,
we employ a Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo technique and consistently reevaluate the full power spectrum
likelihood as we scan over different cosmologies. Our baseline analysis assumes minimal $\Lambda$CDM,
varies the neutrino masses within a reasonably tight range, fixes the primordial power spectrum
tilt, and uses the big bang nucleosynthesis prior on the physical baryon density $\omega_b$. In
this setup, we find the following late-Universe parameters: Hubble constant $H_0=(67.9\pm 1.1)$
km$\,$s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.295\pm 0.010$, and the mass
fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8=0.721\pm 0.043$. These parameters were measured directly from
the BOSS data and independently of the Planck cosmic microwave background observations. Scanning
over the power spectrum tilt or relaxing the other priors do not significantly alter our main conclusions.
Finally, we discuss the information content of the BOSS power spectrum and show that it is dominated
by the location of the baryon acoustic oscillations and the power spectrum shape. We argue that the
contribution of the Alcock-Paczynski effect is marginal in $\Lambda$CDM, but becomes important
for non-minimal cosmological models.
