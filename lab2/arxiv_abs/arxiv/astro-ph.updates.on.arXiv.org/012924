This work employs high-quality {\em Hubble Space Telescope} ({\em HST}) Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS) F606W and F814W photometry to correct for the differential reddening affecting the colour-magnitude
diagram (CMD) of the poorly-studied globular cluster (GC) Palomar\,2. Differential reddening
is taken into account by assuming that morphological differences among CMDs extracted across the
field of view of Palomar\,2 correspond essentially to shifts (quantified in terms of $\delta E(B-V)$)
along the reddening vector due to a non-uniform dust distribution. The average reddening difference
over all partial CMDs is $\overline{\delta E(B-V)}=0.24\pm0.08$, with the highest reaching $\delta
E(B-V) =0.52$. The corrected CMD displays well-defined and relatively narrow evolutionary sequences,
especially for the evolved stars, i.e. the red-giant, horizontal and asymptotic giant branches
(RGB, HB and AGB, respectively). The average width of the upper main sequence and RGB profiles of
the corrected CMD corresponds to 56\% of the original one. Parameters measured on this CMD show that
Palomar\,2 is $\approx13.25$\,Gyr old, has the mass $M\sim1.4\times10^5\,m_\odot$ stored in
stars, is affected by the foreground $E(B-V)\approx0.93$, is located at $d_\odot\approx26$\,Kpc
from the Sun, and is characterized by the global metallicity $Z/Zo\approx0.03$, which corresponds
to the range $-1.9\leq [Fe/H] \leq-1.6$ (for $0.0\leq[\alpha/Fe]\leq+0.4$), quite consistent
with other outer halo GCs. Additional parameters are the absolute magnitude $M_V\approx-7.8$,
and the core and half-light radii $r_C\approx2.6$\,pc and $R_{HL}\approx4.7$\,pc, respectively.
