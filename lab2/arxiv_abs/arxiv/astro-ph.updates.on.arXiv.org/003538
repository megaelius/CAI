We use Chandra X-ray data to measure the metallicity of the intracluster medium (ICM) in 245 massive
galaxy clusters selected from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys, spanning redshifts
$0<z<1.2$. Metallicities were measured in three different radial ranges, spanning cluster cores
through their outskirts. We explore trends in these measurements as a function of cluster redshift,
temperature, and surface brightness "peakiness" (a proxy for gas cooling efficiency in cluster
centers). The data at large radii (0.5--1 $r_{500}$) are consistent with a constant metallicity,
while at intermediate radii (0.1-0.5 $r_{500}$) we see a late-time increase in enrichment, consistent
with the expected production and mixing of metals in cluster cores. In cluster centers, there are
strong trends of metallicity with temperature and peakiness, reflecting enhanced metal production
in the lowest-entropy gas. Within the cool-core/sharply peaked cluster population, there is a
large intrinsic scatter in central metallicity and no overall evolution, indicating significant
astrophysical variations in the efficiency of enrichment. The central metallicity in clusters
with flat surface brightness profiles is lower, with a smaller intrinsic scatter, but increases
towards lower redshifts. Our results are consistent with other recent measurements of ICM metallicity
as a function of redshift. They reinforce the picture implied by observations of uniform metal distributions
in the outskirts of nearby clusters, in which most of the enrichment of the ICM takes place before
cluster formation, with significant later enrichment taking place only in cluster centers, as
the stellar populations of the central galaxies evolve.
