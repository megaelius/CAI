Context. It is possible to accurately measure the masses of the white dwarfs (WDs) in the Hyades cluster
using gravitational redshift, because the radial velocity of the stars can be obtained independently
of spectroscopy from astrometry and the cluster has a low velocity dispersion. Aims. We aim to obtain
an accurate measurement of the Hyades WD masses by determining the mass-to-radius ratio (M/R) from
the observed gravitational redshift, and to compare them with masses derived from other methods.
Methods. We analyse archive high-resolution UVES-VLT spectra of six WDs belonging to the Hyades
to measure their Doppler shift, from which M/R is determined after subtracting the astrometric
radial velocity. We estimate the radii using Gaia photometry as well as literature data. Results.
The M/R error associated to the gravitational redshift measurement is about 5%. The radii estimates,
evaluated with different methods, are in very good agreement, though they can differ by up to 4% depending
on the quality of the data. The masses based on gravitational redshift are systematically smaller
than those derived from other methods, by a minimum of $\sim 0.02$ up to 0.05 solar masses. While this
difference is within our measurement uncertainty, the fact that it is systematic indicates a likely
real discrepancy between the different methods. Conclusions. We show that the M/R derived from
gravitational redshift measurements is a powerful tool to determine the masses of the Hyades WDs
and could reveal interesting properties of their atmospheres. The technique can be improved by
using dedicated spectrographs, and can be extended to other clusters, making it unique in its ability
to accurately and empirically determine the masses of WDs in open clusters. At the same time we prove
that gravitational redshift in WDs agrees with the predictions of stellar evolution models to within
a few percent.
