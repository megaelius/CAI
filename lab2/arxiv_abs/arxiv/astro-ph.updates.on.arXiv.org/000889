We present an analysis of the levels and evolution of star formation activity in a representative
sample of 30 massive galaxy clusters at 0.15<z<0.30 from the Local Cluster Substructure
Survey (LoCuSS), combining wide-field Spitzer 24um data with extensive spectroscopy of cluster
members. The specific-SFRs of massive (M>10^10 M_sun) star-forming cluster galaxies within
r200 are found to be systematically 28% lower than their counterparts in the field at fixed stellar
mass and redshift, a difference significant at the 8.7-sigma level. This is the unambiguous signature
of star formation in most (and possibly all) massive star-forming galaxies being slowly quenched
upon accretion into massive clusters, their SFRs declining exponentially on quenching time-scales
in the range 0.7-2.0 Gyr. We measure the mid-infrared Butcher-Oemler effect over the redshift range
0.0-0.4, finding rapid evolution in the fraction (f_SF) of massive (M_K<-23.1) cluster galaxies
within r200 with SFRs>3M_sun/yr, of the form f_SF (1+z)^7.6. We dissect the origins of the Butcher-Oemler
effect, revealing it to be due to the combination of a ~3x decline in the mean specific-SFRs of star-forming
cluster galaxies since z~0.3 with a ~1.5x decrease in number density. Two-thirds of this reduction
in the specific-SFRs of star-forming cluster galaxies is due to the steady cosmic decline in the
specific-SFRs among those field galaxies accreted into the clusters. The remaining one-third
reflects an accelerated decline in the star formation activity of galaxies within clusters. The
slow quenching of star-formation in cluster galaxies is consistent with a gradual shut down of star
formation in infalling spiral galaxies as they interact with the intra-cluster medium via ram-pressure
stripping or starvation mechanisms. We find no evidence for the build-up of cluster S0 bulges via
major nuclear star-burst episodes.
