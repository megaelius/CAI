In the framework of understanding the gas and stellar kinematics and their relations to AGNs and
galaxy evolution scenarios, we present spatially resolved distributions and kinematics of the
stars and gas in the central $\sim 800$-pc radius of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365. We obtained
$H+K$- and $K$-band near-infrared (NIR) integral-field observations from VLT/SINFONI. Our results
reveal strong broad and narrow emission-line components of ionized gas (hydrogen recombination
lines Pa$\alpha $ and Br$\gamma$) in the nuclear region, as well as hot dust with a temperature of
$\sim 1300$ K, both typical for type-1 AGNs.From $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-\sigma_*$ and the broad components
of hydrogen recombination lines, we find a black-hole mass of $(5-10)\times 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$.
In the central $\sim 800$ pc, we find a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 615$ M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds
to a cold molecular gas reservoir of $(2-8)\times 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$. However, there is a molecular
gas deficiency in the nuclear region.The gas and stellar-velocity maps both show rotation patterns
consistent with the large-scale rotation of the galaxy. However, the gaseous and stellar kinematics
show deviations from pure disk rotation, which suggest streaming motions in the central $< 200$
pc and a velocity twist at the location of the ring which indicates deviations in disk and ring rotation
velocities in accordance with published CO kinematics. We detect a blueshifted emission line split
in Pa$\alpha$, associated with the nuclear region only. We investigate the star-formation properties
of the hot spots in the circumnuclear ring which have starburst ages of $\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{Myr}$
and find indications for an age gradient on the western side of the ring. In addition, our high-resolution
data reveal further substructure within this ring which also shows enhanced star forming activity
close to the nucleus.
