Large pristine samples of red clump stars are highly sought after given that they are standard candles
and give precise distances even at large distances. However, it is difficult to cleanly select red
clumps stars because they can have the same T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ as red giant branch stars.
Recently, it was shown that the asteroseismic parameters, $\rm{\Delta}$P and $\rm{\Delta\nu}$,
which are used to accurately select red clump stars, can be derived from spectra using the change
in the surface carbon to nitrogen ratio ([C/N]) caused by mixing during the red giant branch. This
change in [C/N] can also impact the spectral energy distribution. In this study, we predict the $\rm{\Delta}$P,
$\rm{\Delta\nu}$, T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ using 2MASS, AllWISE, \gaia, and Pan-STARRS
data in order to select a clean sample of red clump stars. We achieve a contamination rate of $\sim$20\%,
equivalent to what is achieved when selecting from T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and log $g$ derived from
low resolution spectra. Finally, we present two red clump samples. One sample has a contamination
rate of $\sim$ 20\% and $\sim$ 405,000 red clump stars. The other has a contamination of $\sim$ 33\%
and $\sim$ 2.6 million red clump stars which includes $\sim$ 75,000 stars at distances $>$ 10 kpc.
For |b|>30 degrees we find $\sim$ 15,000 stars with contamination rate of $\sim$ 9\%. The scientific
potential of this catalog for studying the structure and formation history of the Galaxy is vast
given that it includes millions of precise distances to stars in the inner bulge and distant halo
where astrometric distances are imprecise.
