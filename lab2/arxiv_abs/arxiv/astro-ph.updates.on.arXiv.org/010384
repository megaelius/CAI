The second Gaia data release (DR2, spring 2018) included a unique all-sky catalogue of large-amplitude
long-period variables (LPVs) containing Miras and semi-regular variables. These stars are on
the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), and are characterized by high luminosity, changing surface
composition, and intense mass loss, that make them of paramount importance for stellar, galactic,
and extra-galactic studies. An initial investigation of LPVs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
from the DR2 catalog of LPVs has revealed the possibility to disentangle O-rich and C-rich stars
using a combination of optical Gaia and infrared 2MASS photometry. The so-called Gaia-2MASS diagram
constructed to achieve this has further been shown to enable the identification of sub-groups of
AGB stars among the O-rich and C-rich LPVs. Here, we extend this initial study of the Gaia-2MASS diagram
to the Small Magellanic Cloud and the Galaxy, and use a variability amplitude proxy to identify LPVs
from the full Gaia DR2 archive. We show that the remarkable properties found in the LMC also apply
to these other stellar systems. Interesting features, moreover, emerge as a result of the different
metallicities between the three stellar environments, which we highlight in this exploratory
presentation of Gaia's potential to study stellar populations harboring LPVs. Finally, we look
ahead to the future, and highlight the power of the exploitation of Gaia RP spectra for the identification
of carbon stars using solely Gaia data in forthcoming data releases, as revealed in an Image of the
Week published by the Gaia consortium on the European Space Agency's web site. These proceedings
include three animated images that can be used as outreach material.
