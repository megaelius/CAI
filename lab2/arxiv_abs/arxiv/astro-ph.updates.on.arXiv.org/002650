The Hubble sequence is a common classification scheme for the structure of galaxies. Despite the
tremendous usefulness of this diagnostic, we still do not fully understand when, where, and how
this morphological ordering was put in place. Here, we investigate the morphological evolution
of a sample of 22 high redshift ($z\geq3$) galaxies extracted from the Argo simulation. Argo is a
cosmological zoom-in simulation of a group-sized halo and its environment. It adopts the same high
resolution ($\sim10^4$ M$_\odot$, $\sim100$ pc) and sub-grid physical model that was used in the
Eris simulation but probes a sub-volume almost ten times bigger with as many as 45 million gas and
star particles in the zoom-in region. Argo follows the early assembly of galaxies with a broad range
of stellar masses ($\log M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\sim8-11$ at $z\simeq3$), while resolving
properly their structural properties. We recover a diversity of morphologies, including late-type/irregular
disc galaxies with flat rotation curves, spheroid dominated early-type discs, and a massive elliptical
galaxy, already established at $z\sim3$. We identify major mergers as the main trigger for the formation
of bulges and the steepening of the circular velocity curves. Minor mergers and non-axisymmetric
perturbations (stellar bars) drive the bulge growth in some cases. The specific angular momenta
of the simulated disc components fairly match the values inferred from nearby galaxies of similar
$M_{\star}$ once the expected redshift evolution of disc sizes is accounted for. We conclude that
morphological transformations of high redshift galaxies of intermediate mass are likely triggered
by processes similar to those at low redshift and result in an early build-up of the Hubble sequence.
