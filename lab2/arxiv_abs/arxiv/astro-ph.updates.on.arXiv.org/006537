We publicly release a new sample of $34$ medium resolution quasar spectra at $5.77\leq z_{\rm em}\leq6.54$
observed with the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the Keck telescope. This quasar sample
represents an ideal laboratory to study the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the end stages of
the epoch of reionization, and constrain the timing and morphology of the phase transition. For
a subset of $23$ of our highest signal-to-noise ratio spectra (S/N$>7$, per $10\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$
pixel), we present a new measurement of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest opacity spanning
the redshift range $4.8\lesssim z\lesssim6.3$. We carefully eliminate spectral regions that
could be causing biases in our measurements due to additional transmitted flux in the proximity
zone of the quasars, or extra absorption caused by strong intervening absorption systems along
the line of sight. We compare the observed evolution of the IGM opacity with redshift to predictions
from a hydrodynamical simulation with uniform ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation, as well
as two semi-numerical patchy reionization models, one with a fluctuating UVB and another with a
fluctuating temperature field. Our measurements show a steep rise in opacity at $z\gtrsim5.0$
and an increased scatter and thus support the picture of a spatially inhomogeneous reionization
process, consistent with previous work. However, we measure significantly higher optical depths
at $5.3\lesssim z\lesssim5.7$ than previous studies, which reduces the contrast between the highest
opacity Gunn-Peterson troughs and the average opacity trend of the IGM, which may relieve some of
the previously noted tension between these measurements and reionization models.
