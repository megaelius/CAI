The stellar content of the intracluster light (ICL) provides unique insight into the hierarchical
assembly process of galaxy clusters.However, the ICL is difficult to study due to its low surface
brightness and large physical extent. We present optical spectra of three ICL regions in the Coma
cluster, located between 100-180kpc from their nearest BCGs: NGC4889 and NGC4874. The mean surface
brightness of the three ICL regions are {\mu}$_g$~25.3-26.2mag arcsec$^{-2}$. IFU spectroscopy
with 13.5 hr on-source integration time were acquired as part of an ancillary program within the
SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We stacked the 127 individual fiber spectra in each IFU in order to achieve
a 1{\sigma} limiting surface brightness of 27.9mag arcsec$^{-2}$, corresponding to a mean S/N
in the optical of 21.6,9.6,and 11.6\AA$^{-1}$. We apply stellar population models to the stacked
spectra, and measure the recession velocities, velocity dispersions ($\sigma$), stellar ages,
and [Fe/H]. Our results show that the $\sigma$ of ICL regions are very high, indicating the stars
are tracing the gravitational potential of the cluster, instead of any individual galaxy. The line-of-sight
velocities of the three ICL regions are different from each other by ~700km/s, while the velocity
of each region is similar to the closest BCG. This suggests that the ICL regions are associated with
two distinct subclusters centered on NGC4889 and NGC4874.The stellar populations of these regions
are old and metal poor, with ages of 7-12Gyr, and [Fe/H] of -0.8 to -0.6 dex. From the derived age and
[Fe/H], the build-up of ICL in Coma is likely to be through the accretion of low mass galaxies or the
tidal stripping of the outskirts of massive galaxies that have ended their star formation early
on, instead of directly from major mergers of massive galaxies.
