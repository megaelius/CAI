Stellar bars are the most common non-axisymmetric structures in galaxies and their impact on the
evolution of disc galaxies at all cosmological times can be significant. Classical theory predicts
that stellar discs are stabilized against bar formation if embedded in massive spheroidal dark
matter halos. However, dark matter halos have been shown to alleviate the growth of bars through
resonant gravitational interaction. Still, it remains unclear why some galaxies are barred and
some are not. In this study, we demonstrate that co-rotating dark matter halos with spin parameters
in the range of $0 \le \lambda_{\mathrm{dm}} \le 0.07$ - which are a definite prediction of modern
cosmological models - promote the formation of bars and boxy bulges and therefore can play an important
role in the formation of pseudobulges in a kinematically hot dark matter dominated disc galaxies.
We find continuous trends for models with higher halo spins: bars form more rapidly, the forming
slow bars are stronger, and the final bars are longer. After 2 Gyrs of evolution the amplitude of the
bar mode in a model with $\lambda_{\mathrm{dm}} = $ 0.05 is a factor of $\sim$ times higher, $A_2/A_0
= 0.55$, than in the non-rotating halo model. After 5 Gyrs the bar is $\sim$ 2.5 times longer. The origin
of this trend is that more rapidly spinning (co-rotating) halos provide a larger fraction of trailing
dark matter particles that lag behind the disc bar and help growing the bar by taking away its angular
momentum by resonant interactions. A counter-rotating halos suppresses the formation of a bar
in our models. We discuss potential consequences for forming galaxies at high-redshift and present
day low mass galaxies which have converted only a small fraction of their baryons into stars.
