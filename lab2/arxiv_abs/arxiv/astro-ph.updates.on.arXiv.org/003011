The localization of the repeating FRB 121102 to a low-metallicity dwarf galaxy at $z=0.193$, and
its association with a quiescent radio source, suggests the possibility that FRBs originate from
magnetars, formed by the unusual supernovae in such galaxies. We investigate this via a comparison
of magnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We calculate average
volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production channels such as superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via
core-collapse supernovae. For each channel we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics
using their known properties. We determine for the first time the number density of FRB emitters
(the product of their volumetric birthrate and lifetime), $R_{\rm FRB}\tau\approx 10^4$Gpc$^{-3}$,
assuming that FRBs are predominantly emitted from repetitive sources similar to FRB 121102 and
adopting a beaming factor of 0.1. By comparing rates we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe,
GRBs) implies a typical FRB lifetime of $\approx$30-300 yr, in good agreement with other lines of
argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent with the available energy stored
in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any relation to magnetars produced via normal core-collapse
supernovae leads to a very short lifetime of $\approx$0.5yr, in conflict with both theory and observation.
We demonstrate that due to the diverse host galaxy distributions of the different progenitor channels,
many possible sources of FRB birth can be ruled out with $\lesssim 10$ host galaxy identifications.
Conversely, targeted searches of galaxies that have previously hosted decades-old SLSNe and GRBs
may be a fruitful strategy for discovering new FRBs and related quiescent radio sources, and determining
the nature of their progenitors.
