Population studies of the orbital characteristics of exoplanets in multi-planet systems have
highlighted the existence of an anticorrelation between the average orbital eccentricity of planets
and the number of planets of their host system, that is, its multiplicity. This effect was proposed
to reflect the varying levels of violence in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. Previous
work suggested that the relative violence of the dynamical evolution of planetary systems with
similar orbital architectures can be compared through the computation of their angular momentum
deficit (AMD). We investigated the possibility of using a more general metric to perform analogous
comparisons between planetary systems with different orbital architectures. We considered a
modified version of the AMD, the normalized angular momentum deficit (NAMD), and used it to study
a sample of 99 multi-planet systems containing both the currently best-characterized extrasolar
systems and the solar system, that is, planetary systems with both compact and wide orbital architectures.
We verified that the NAMD allows us to compare the violence of the dynamical histories of multi-planet
systems with different orbital architectures. We identified an anticorrelation between the NAMD
and the multiplicity of the planetary systems, of which the previously observed eccentricity-multiplicity
anticorrelation is a reflection. Our results seem to indicate that phases of dynamical instabilities
and chaotic evolution are not uncommon among planetary systems. They also suggest that the efficiency
of the planetary formation process in producing high-multiplicity systems is likely to be higher
than that suggested by their currently known population.
