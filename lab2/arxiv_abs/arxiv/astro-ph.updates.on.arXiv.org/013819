The Global-Multi Conjugated Adaptive Optics (GMCAO) approach offers an alternative way to correct
an adequate scientific Field of View (FoV) using only natural guide stars (NGSs) to extremely large
ground-based telescopes. Thus, even in the absence of laser guide stars, a GMCAO-equipped ELT-like
telescope can achieve optimal performance in terms of Strehl Ratio (SR), retrieving impressive
results in studying star-poor fields, as in the cases of the deep field observations. The benefits
and usability of GMCAO have been demonstrated by studying 6000 mock high redshift galaxies in the
Chandra Deep Field South region. However, a systematic study simulating observations in several
portions of the sky is mandatory to have a robust statistic of the GMCAO performance. Technical,
tomographic and astrophysical parameters, discussed here, are given as inputs to GIUSTO, an IDL-based
code that estimates the SR over the considered field, and the results are analyzed with statistical
considerations. The best performance is obtained using stars that are relatively close to the Scientific
FoV; therefore, the SR correlates with the mean off-axis position of NGSs, as expected, while their
magnitude plays a secondary role. This study concludes that the SRs correlate linearly with the
galactic latitude, as also expected. Because of the lack of natural guide stars needed for low-order
aberration sensing, the GMCAO confirms as a promising technique to observe regions that can not
be studied without the use of laser beacons. It represents a robust alternative way or a risk mitigation
strategy for laser approaches on the ELTs.
