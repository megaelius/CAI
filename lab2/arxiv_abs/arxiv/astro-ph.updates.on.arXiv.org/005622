The European Space Agency Gaia satellite was launched into orbit around L2 in December 2013. This
ambitious mission has strict requirements on residual systematic errors resulting from instrumental
corrections in order to meet a design goal of sub-10 microarcsecond astrometry. During the design
and build phase of the science instruments, various critical calibrations were studied in detail
to ensure that this goal could be met in orbit. In particular, it was determined that the video-chain
offsets on the analogue side of the analogue-to-digital conversion electronics exhibited instabilities
that could not be mitigated fully by modifications to the flight hardware. We provide a detailed
description of the behaviour of the electronic offset levels on microsecond timescales, identifying
various systematic effects that are known collectively as offset non-uniformities. The effects
manifest themselves as transient perturbations on the gross zero-point electronic offset level
that is routinely monitored as part of the overall calibration process. Using in-orbit special
calibration sequences along with simple parametric models, we show how the effects can be calibrated,
and how these calibrations are applied to the science data. While the calibration part of the process
is relatively straightforward, the application of the calibrations during science data processing
requires a detailed on-ground reconstruction of the readout timing of each charge-coupled device
(CCD) sample on each device in order to predict correctly the highly time-dependent nature of the
corrections. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our offset non-uniformity models in mitigating
the effects in Gaia data. We demonstrate for all CCDs and operating instrument and modes on board
Gaia that the video-chain noise-limited performance is recovered in the vast majority of science
samples.
