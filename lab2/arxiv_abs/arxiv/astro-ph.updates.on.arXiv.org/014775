We study the spin and eccentricity evolution of black-hole (BH) binaries that are perturbed by tertiary
masses and experience the Lidov-Kozai (LK) excitation. We focus on three aspects. Firstly, we study
the spin-orbit alignment of the inner binary following the approach outlined by Antonini et al.
[MNRAS 480, L58 (2018)] and Liu and Lai [ApJ 863, 68 (2018)], yet allowing the spins to have random
initial orientations. We confirm the existence of a dynamical attractor that drives the spin-orbit
angle at the end of the LK evolution to a value given by the initial angle between the spin and the outer
orbital angular momentum (instead of to a specific value of the effective spin). Secondly, we follow
the (inner) binary's evolution further to the merger to study the final spin-spin alignment. We
generalize the effective potential theory to include orbital eccentricity, which allows us to
efficiently evolve the system in the early inspiral stages. We further find that the spin-spin and
spin-orbit alignments are correlated and the correlation is determined by the initial spin-orbit
angle. For systems with the spin vectors initially in the orbital plane, the final spins tend to be
anti-aligned and could lead to a greater expected value of the GW recoil than a uniform spin-spin
alignment would predict. Lastly, we study the maximum eccentricity excitation that can be achieved
during the LK process, including the effects of gravitational-wave radiation. We find that when
the tertiary mass is a super-massive BH and the inner binary is massive, then even with the maximum
LK excitation, the residual eccentricity is typically less than 0.1 when the binary's orbital frequency
reaches 10 Hz, and a decihertz detector would be necessary to follow such a system's orbital evolution.
