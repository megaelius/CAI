Aims. We aim to investigate and characterise the photoionised X-ray emission line regions within
NGC 7469. Methods. We apply the photoionisation model, PION, within the spectral fitting code SPEX
to analyse the 640 ks RGS spectrum of NGC 7469 gathered during an XMM-Newton observing campaign in
2015. Results. We find the emission line region in NGC 7469 to be multiphased, consisting of two narrow
components with ionisation parameters of $\log \xi = 0.4$ and 1.6. A third, broad emission component,
with a broadening velocity of $v_b \sim 1400$ km s\textsuperscript{-1} and an outflow velocity
of $v_{out} \sim -4500$ km s\textsuperscript{-1}, is required to fit the residuals in the O VII triplet,
at around 22 \AA. Assuming a volume filling factor of 0.1, the lower distance limits of the narrow
emission line region components are estimated for the first time at 2.6 and 2.5 pc from the central
black hole, whereas the broad component has an estimated lower bound distance between 0.004 to 0.03
pc, depending on the assumed plasma parameters. The collisionally ionised plasma from the star
burst region in NGC 7469 has a plasma temperature of 0.32 keV and outflow velocity of $-280$ km s\textsuperscript{-1},
consistent with previous results in this campaign. In addition, we model the photoionised plasma
of the warm absorber (WA) in NGC 7469, and find that it consists of three photoionised phases, with
different values of $\xi$, $N_H$ and $v_{out}$. The upper bound distances of these WA components
are 1.9, 0.3 and 0.6 pc, respectively, consistent with archival results. Conclusions. The environment
of NGC 7469 is a complex mix of plasma winds absorbing and emitting X-rays. We find the picture painted
by our results can be attributed to line emitting plasma located at distances ranging from near the
black hole to the torus and beyond the ionised outflows.
