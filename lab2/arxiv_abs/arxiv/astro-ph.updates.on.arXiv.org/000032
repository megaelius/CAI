Based on optical and X-ray data for a sample of 34 relaxed rich clusters of galaxies with redshifts
of 0.1-0.9, we studied relative spatial distributions of the two major baryon contents, the cluster
galaxies and the hot plasmas. Using multi-band photometric data taken with the UH88 telescope,
we determined the integrated (two dimensional) radial light profiles of member galaxies in each
cluster using two independent approaches, i.e., the background subtraction and the color-magnitude
filtering. The ICM mass profile of each cluster in our sample, also integrated in two dimensions,
was derived from a spatially-resolved spectral analysis using XMM-Newton and Chandra data. Then,
the radially-integrated light profile of each cluster was divided by its ICM mass profile, to obtain
a profile of "galaxy light vs. ICM mass ratio". The ratio profiles over the central 0.65 R500 regions
were found to steepen from the higher- to lower- redshift subsamples, meaning that the galaxies
become more concentrated in the ICM sphere towards lower redshifts. The evolution is also seen in
galaxy number vs. ICM mass ratio profiles. A range of systematic uncertainties in the galaxy light
measurements, as well as many radius-/redshift- dependent biases to the galaxy vs. ICM profiles
have been assessed, but none of them is significant against the observed evolution. Besides, the
galaxy light vs. total mass ratio profiles also exhibit gradual concentration towards lower redshift.
We interpret in the context that the galaxies, the ICM, and the dark matter components followed a
similar spatial distribution in the early phase (z>0.5), while the galaxies have fallen towards
the center relative to the others at a later phase.
