We have carried out a dedicated transient survey of 300 deg$^2$ of the SDSS Stripe 82 region using
the Giant Meterwavelength Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 150 MHz. Our multi-epoch observations, together
with the TGSS survey, allow us to probe variability and transient activity on four different timescales,
beginning with 4 hours, and up to 4 years. Data calibration, RFI flagging, source finding and transient
search were carried out in a semi-automated pipeline incorporating the SPAM recipe. This has enabled
us to produce superior-quality images and carry out reliable transient search over the entire survey
region in under 48 hours post-observation. Among the few thousand unique point sources found in
our 5$\sigma$ single-epoch catalogs (flux density thresholds of about 24 mJy, 20 mJy, 16 mJy and
18 mJy on the respective timescales), we find $<$0.08%, 0.01%, $<$0.06% and 0.05% to be variable
(beyond a significance of 4$\sigma$ and fractional variability of 30%) on timescales of 4 hours,
1 day, 1 month and 4 years respectively. This is substantially lower than that in the GHz sky, where
$\sim$1% of the persistent point sources are found to be variable. Although our survey was designed
to probe a superior part of the transient phase space, our transient sources did not yield any significant
candidates. The transient (preferentially extragalactic) rate at 150 MHz is therefore $<$0.005
on timescales of 1 month and 4 years, and $<$0.002 on timescales of 1 day and 4 hours, beyond 7$\sigma$
detection threshold. We put these results in the perspective with the previous studies and give
recommendations for future low-frequency transient surveys.
