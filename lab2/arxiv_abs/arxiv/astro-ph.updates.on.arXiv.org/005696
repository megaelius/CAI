A proper understanding of the Milky Way (MW) dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context requires knowledge
of their 3D velocities and orbits. However, proper motion (PM) measurements have generally been
of limited accuracy and available only for more massive dwarfs. We therefore present a new study
of the kinematics of the MW dwarf galaxies. We use the Gaia DR2 for those dwarfs that have membership
information available from literature spectroscopy. We derive the PMs for 39 galaxies out to 420
kpc, and generally find good consistency for the subset with measurements available from other
studies. We derive the implied Galactocentric velocities, and calculate orbits in canonical MW
halo potentials of "low" ($0.8 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$) and "high" mass ($1.6 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$).
Comparison of the distributions of orbital apocenters and 3D velocities to the halo virial radius
and escape velocity, respectively, suggests that the satellite kinematics are best explained
in the high-mass halo. Tuc~III, Segue~2, Crater~II, and additional candidates have orbital pericenters
small enough to imply significant tidal influences. Relevant to the missing satellite problem,
the fact that fewer galaxies are observed to be near apocenter than near pericenter implies that
there must be a population of distant dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered. Of the 39 dwarfs: 12 have
orbital poles that do not align with the MW plane of satellites (given reasonable assumptions about
its intrinsic thickness); 11 have insufficient PM accuracy to establish whether they align; and
16 satellites align, of which 11 are co-orbiting and (somewhat surprisingly, in view of prior knowledge)
5 are counter-orbiting. Group infall might have contributed to this, but no definitive association
is found for the members of the Crater-Leo group.
