We present the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics implementation SPHGal which incorporates several
recent developments into the GADGET code. This includes a pressure-entropy formulation of SPH
with a Wendland kernel, a higher order estimate of velocity gradients, a modified artificial viscosity
switch with a strong limiter, and artificial conduction of thermal energy. We conduct a series of
idealized hydrodynamic tests and show that while the pressure-entropy formulation is ideal for
resolving fluid mixing at contact discontinuities, it performs conspicuously worse when strong
shocks are involved due to the large entropy discontinuities. Including artificial conduction
at shocks greatly improves the results. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability can be resolved properly
and dense clouds in the blob test dissolve qualitatively in agreement with other improved SPH implementations.
We further perform simulations of an isolated Milky Way like disk galaxy and find a feedback-induced
instability developing if too much artificial viscosity is introduced. Our modified artificial
viscosity scheme not only prevents this instability but also shows efficient shock capturing capability
in the Sedov explosion test. We also investigate the star formation rate and the galactic outflow
of the MW disk as well as a gas-rich disk. The star formation rates vary slightly for different SPH
schemes while the mass loading is quite sensitive to the SPH scheme. The galactic outflows are reduced
due to more efficient fluid mixing. Finally, we compare the accretion behavior of of hot halo gas.
The formation of cold blobs, an artifact of simple SPH implementations, can be eliminated efficiently
with proper fluid mixing, either by conduction and/or by using a pressure-entropy formulation.
Based on the performed tests we consider the SPHGal hydrodynamics sufficiently accurate for galaxy
formation simulations.
