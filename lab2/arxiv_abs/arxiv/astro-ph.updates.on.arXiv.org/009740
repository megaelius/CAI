Phase curves and secondary eclipses of gaseous exoplanets are diagnostic of atmospheric composition
and meteorology, and the long observational baseline and high photometric precision from the Kepler
Mission make its dataset well-suited for exploring phase curve variability, which provides additional
insights into atmospheric dynamics. Observations of the hot Jupiter Kepler-76b span more than
1,000 days, providing an ideal dataset to search for atmospheric variability. In this study, we
find that Kepler-76b's secondary eclipse, with a depth of $87 \pm 6$ parts-per-million (ppm), corresponds
to an effective temperature of 2,830$^{+50}_{-30}$ K. Our results also show clear indications
of variability in Kepler-76b's atmospheric emission and reflectivity, with the phase curve amplitude
typically $50.5 \pm 1.3$ ppm but varying between 35 and 70 ppm over tens of days. As is common for hot
Jupiters, Kepler-76b's phase curve shows a discernible offset of $\left( 9 \pm 1.3 \right)^\circ$
eastward of the sub-stellar point and varying in concert with the amplitude. These variations may
arise from the advance and retreat of thermal structures and cloud formations in Kepler-76b's atmosphere;
the resulting thermal perturbations may couple with the super-rotation expected to transport
aerosols, giving rise to a feedback loop. Looking forward, the TESS Mission can provide new insight
into planetary atmospheres, with good prospects to observe both secondary eclipses and phase curves
among targets from the mission. TESS's increased sensitivity in red wavelengths as compared to
Kepler means that it will probably probe different aspects of planetary atmospheres.
