We propose a probabilistic framework for performing simultaneous estimation of source structure
and fringe-fitting parameters in Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. As a
first step, we demonstrate this technique through the analysis of synthetic short-duration Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of various geometric source models at 230 GHz, in the presence
of baseline-dependent thermal noise. We perform Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection
between the different source models to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates and correlations
between various source and fringe-fitting related model parameters. We also compare the Bayesian
posteriors with those obtained using widely-used VLBI data reduction packages such as CASA and
AIPS, by fringe-fitting 200 Monte Carlo simulations of each source model with different noise realisations,
to obtain distributions of the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates. We find that, in the presence
of resolved asymmetric source structure and a given array geometry, the traditional practice of
fringe-fitting with a point source model yields appreciable offsets in the estimated phase residuals,
potentially biasing or limiting the dynamic range of the starting model used for self-calibration.
Simultaneously estimating the source structure earlier in the calibration process with formal
uncertainties improves the precision and accuracy of fringe-fitting and establishes the potential
of the available data especially when there is little prior information. We also note the potential
applications of this method to astrometry and geodesy for specific science cases and the planned
improvements to the computational performance and analyses of more complex source distributions.
