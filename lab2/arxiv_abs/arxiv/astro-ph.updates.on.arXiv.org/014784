We report ground-based transmission spectroscopy of the highly irradiated and ultra-short period
hot-Jupiter WASP-103b covering the wavelength range $\approx$ 400-600 nm using the FORS2 instrument
on the Very Large Telescope. The light curves show significant time-correlated noise which is mainly
invariant in wavelength and which we model using a Gaussian process. The precision of our transmission
spectrum is improved by applying a common-mode correction derived from the white light curve, reaching
typical uncertainties in transit depth of $\approx$ 2x10$^{-4}$ in wavelength bins of 15 nm. After
correction for flux contamination from a blended companion star, our observations reveal a featureless
spectrum across the full range of the FORS2 observations and we are unable to confirm the Na absorption
previously inferred using Gemini/GMOS or the strong Rayleigh scattering observed using broad-band
light curves. We performed a Bayesian atmospheric retrieval on the full optical-infrared transmission
spectrum using the additional data from Gemini/GMOS, HST/WFC3 and Spitzer observations and recover
evidence for H$_2$O absorption at the 4.0$\sigma$ level. However, our observations are not able
to completely rule out the presence of Na, which is found at 2.0$\sigma$ in our retrievals. This may
in part be explained by patchy/inhomogeneous clouds or hazes damping any absorption features in
our FORS2 spectrum, but an inherently small scale height also makes this feature challenging to
probe from the ground. Our results nonetheless demonstrate the continuing potential of ground-based
observations for investigating exoplanet atmospheres and emphasise the need for the application
of consistent and robust statistical techniques to low-resolution spectra in the presence of instrumental
systematics.
