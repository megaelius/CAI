This rapport summarizes the cosmic-ray indirect (CRI) session of the 36th ICRC conference. Updated
measurements from several air-shower arrays with higher precision lead to the discovery of new
features in the energy spectrum: HAWC measures a softening of the light component (p+He) around
$10^{13.5}\,$eV; measurements of the Pierre Auger Observatory show that the second knee is a smooth
feature extending at least over the range of $100-200\,$PeV and that the energy spectrum between
the ankle and the cut-off cannot be described by a simple broken power law. Measurements of the mass
composition confirm that the composition is a varying mixture of protons and nuclei at least up to
several $10\,$EeV. A joint effort of several collaborations helps to better assess deficiencies
of hadronic interaction models, e.g., by quantifying the muon deficit in the models over the shower
energy. Anisotropy measurements with higher precision generally confirm earlier results. A change
of the amplitude and phase of the equatorial dipole indicates that in the energy range between the
second knee and the ankle there likely is a transition from Galactic to extragalactic sources. However,
neither the most energetic Galatic nor the extragalactic sources have been discovered, which remains
a primary science goal. Next to more exposure, an increase of measurement accuracy and decrease
of systematic uncertainties will provide future progress. It is particularly exciting that new
experiments are built and existing experiments upgraded to increase the measurement accuracy
of the energy and mass composition, e.g., by combining radio antennas with particle detectors.
Last but not least, there is a trend that experiments are designed such that they can target cosmic
rays, photons, and neutrinos at the same time, which will facilitate multi-messenger astrophysics
at the highest energies.
