Magnetars are young, rotating neutron stars that possess larger magnetic fields ($B$ $\approx$
$10^{13}$-$10^{15}$ G) and longer rotational periods ($P$ $\approx$ 1-12 s) than ordinary pulsars.
In contrast to rotation-powered pulsars, magnetar emission is thought to be fueled by the evolution
and decay of their powerful magnetic fields. They display highly variable radio and X-ray emission,
but the processes responsible for this behavior remain a mystery. We report the discovery of bright,
persistent individual X-ray pulses from XTE J1810-197, a transient radio magnetar, using the Neutron
star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) following its recent radio reactivation. Similar
behavior has only been previously observed from a magnetar during short time periods following
a giant flare. However, the X-ray pulses presented here were detected outside of a flaring state.
They are less energetic and display temporal structure that differs from the impulsive X-ray events
previously observed from the magnetar class, such as giant flares and short X-ray bursts. Our high
frequency radio observations of the magnetar, carried out simultaneously with the X-ray observations,
demonstrate that the relative alignment between the X-ray and radio pulses varies on rotational
timescales. No correlation was found between the amplitudes or temporal structure of the X-ray
and radio pulses. The magnetar's 8.3 GHz radio pulses displayed frequency structure, which was
not observed in the pulses detected simultaneously at 31.9 GHz. Many of the radio pulses were also
not detected simultaneously at both frequencies, which indicates that the underlying emission
mechanism producing these pulses is not broadband. We find that the radio pulses from XTE J1810-197
share similar characteristics to radio bursts detected from fast radio burst (FRB) sources, some
of which are now thought to be produced by active magnetars.
