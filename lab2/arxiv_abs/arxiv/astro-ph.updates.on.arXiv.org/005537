Stellar activity is the ultimate source of radial-velocity (RV) noise in the search for Earth-mass
planets orbiting late-type main-sequence stars. We analyse the performance of four different
indicators and the chromospheric index $\log R'_{\rm HK}$ in detecting RV variations induced by
stellar activity in 15 slowly rotating ($v\sin i \leq 5$ km/s), weakly active ($\log R'_{\rm HK}
\leq -4.95$) solar-like stars observed with the high-resolution spectrograph HARPS-N. We consider
indicators of the asymmetry of the cross-correlation function (CCF) between the stellar spectrum
and the binary weighted line mask used to compute the RV, that is the bisector inverse span (BIS),
$\Delta V$, and a new indicator $V_{\rm asy(mod)}$ together with the full width at half maximum (FWHM)
of the CCF. We present methods to evaluate the uncertainties of the CCF indicators and apply a kernel
regression (KR) between the RV, the time, and each of the indicators to study their capability of
reproducing the RV variations induced by stellar activity. The considered indicators together
with the KR prove to be useful to detect activity-induced RV variations in $47 \pm 18$ percent of the
stars over a two-year time span when a significance (two-sided p-value) threshold of one percent
is adopted. In those cases, KR reduces the standard deviation of the RV time series by a factor of approximately
two. The BIS, the FWHM, and the newly introduced $V_{\rm asy(mod)}$ are the best indicators, being
useful in $27 \pm 13$, $13 \pm 9$, and $13 \pm 9$ percent of the cases, respectively. The relatively
limited performances of the activity indicators are related to the very low activity level and $v\sin
i$ of the considered stars. For the application of our approach to sun-like stars, a spectral resolution
of at least $10^5$ and highly stabilized spectrographs are recommended.
