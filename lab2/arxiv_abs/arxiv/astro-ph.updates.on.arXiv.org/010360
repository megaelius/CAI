Jupiter's upper troposphere and stratosphere is host to a rich dynamical and chemical activity,
modulating the thermal structure and distribution of trace species and aerosols, which in turn
impact the radiative budget and dynamics. We detail a computationally efficient 1-D radiative-convective
model of Jupiter's atmosphere taking into account radiative forcings from the main hydrocarbons
(methane, ethane, acetylene), ammonia, collision-induced absorption, several tropospheric
and stratospheric cloud and haze layers and an internal heat flux. Sensitivity studies to several
parameters are presented and we discuss the expected seasonal, vertical and meridional temperature
variations in Jupiter's atmosphere. We compare the resulting thermal structure with that derived
from thermal infrared observations by Fletcher et al., 2016. The modeled temperature is in excellent
agreement with observations at and near the 10-mbar pressure level, where auroral aerosols warm
the atmosphere by up to 20K at latitudes 45-60{\deg}. Those aerosols act to shorten the radiative
timescales, estimated to 100 (Earth) days at the 10-mbar level. At pressures lower than 3 mbar, our
modeled temperatures are underestimated by ~5K compared to observations, suggesting that other
processes, such as dynamical heating by gravity wave breaking, eddies, or thermospheric circulation,
play an important role. We then exploit knowledge of heating and cooling rates to diagnose the residual-mean
circulation in Jupiter's stratosphere, under the assumption that the eddy heat flux convergence
term is negligible. In the lower stratosphere (1-30 mbar), the residual-mean circulation is characterized
by upwelling at high latitudes with vertical velocities of 0.3 mm.s-1 and subsidence at 10{\deg}S.
In the middle and upper stratosphere, the circulation features rising motion at the equator and
subsidence at both poles.
