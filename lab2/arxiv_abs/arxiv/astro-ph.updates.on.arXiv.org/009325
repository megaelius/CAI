We discuss the problem of the third black hole parameter, an electric charge. While the mass and the
spin of black holes are frequently considered in the majority of publications, the charge is often
neglected and implicitly set identically to zero. However, both classical and relativistic processes
can lead to a small non-zero charge of black holes. When dealing with neutral particles and photons,
zero charge is a good approximation. On the other hand, even a small charge can significantly influence
the motion of charged particles, in particular cosmic rays, in the vicinity of black holes. Therefore,
we stress that more attention should be paid to the problem of a black-hole charge and hence, it should
not be neglected a priori, as it is done in most astrophysical studies nowadays. The paper looks at
the problem of the black-hole charge mainly from the astrophysical point of view, which is complemented
by a few historical as well as philosophical notes when relevant. In particular, we show that a cosmic
ray or in general elementary charged particles passing a non-neutral black hole can experience
an electromagnetic force as much as sixteen times the gravitational force for the mass of the Galactic
centre black hole and its charge being seventeen orders of magnitude less than the extremal value.
Furthermore, a Kerr-Newman rotating black hole with the maximum likely charge of 1 Coulomb per solar
mass can have the position of its innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) moved by both rotation and
charge in ways that can enhance or partly cancel each other, putting the ISCO not far from the gravitational
radius or out at more than 6 gravitational radii. An interpretation of X-ray radiation from near
the ISCO of a black hole in X-ray binaries is then no longer unique.
