The quasar lifetime $t_{\rm\,Q}$ is one of the most fundamental quantities for understanding quasar
evolution and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), but remains uncertain by several
orders of magnitude. In a recent study we uncovered a population of very young quasars ($t_{\rm Q}\lesssim10^4-10^5$
yr), based on the sizes of their proximity zones, which are regions of enhanced Ly$\alpha$ forest
transmission near the quasar resulting from its own ionizing radiation. The presence of such young
objects poses significant challenges to models of SMBH formation, which already struggle to explain
the existence of SMBHs at such early cosmic epochs. We conduct the first comprehensive spectroscopic
study of the youngest quasar known, $\rm SDSS\,J1335+3533$ at $z=5.9012$, whose lifetime is $t_{\rm
Q}<10^4$ yr ($95\%$ confidence). A careful search of our deep optical and near-infrared spectra
for HI and metal absorption lines allows us to convincingly exclude that its small proximity zone
results from an associated absorption system rather than a short lifetime. We use the MgII emission
line to measure its black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=(4.09\pm0.58)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$, implying
an Eddington ratio of $0.30\pm0.04$ -- comparable to other co-eval quasars. We similarly find that
the relationship between its black hole mass and dynamical mass are consistent with other $z\sim6$
quasars. The only possible anomaly associated with youth are its weak emission lines, but larger
samples are needed to shed light on a potential causal connection. We discuss the implications of
short lifetimes for various SMBH growth scenarios, and argue that future observations of young
quasars with JWST could distinguish between them.
