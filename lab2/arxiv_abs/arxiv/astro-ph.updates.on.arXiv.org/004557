Clues to the physical conditions in radio cores of blazars come from measurements of brightness
temperatures as well as effects produced by intrinsic opacity. We study the properties of the ultra
compact blazar AO 0235+164 with RadioAstron ground-space radio interferometer, multi-frequency
VLBA, EVN and single-dish radio observations. We employ visibility modeling and image stacking
for deriving structure and kinematics of the source, and use Gaussian process regression to find
the relative multi-band time delays of the flares. The multi-frequency core size and time lags support
prevailing synchrotron self absorption. The intrinsic brightness temperature of the core derived
from ground-based VLBI is close to the equipartition regime value. In the same time, there is evidence
for ultra-compact features of the size of less than 10 $\mu$as in the source, which might be responsible
for the extreme apparent brightness temperatures of up to $10^{14}$ K as measured by RadioAstron.
In 2007--2016 the VLBI components in the source at 43 GHz are found predominantly in two directions,
suggesting a bend of the outflow from southern to northern direction. The apparent opening angle
of the jet seen in the stacked image at 43 GHz is two times wider than that at 15 GHz, indicating a collimation
of the flow within the central 1.5 mas. We estimate the Lorentz factor $\Gamma = 14$, the Doppler factor
$\delta=21$, and the viewing angle $\theta = 1.7^\circ$ of the apparent jet base, derive the gradients
of magnetic field strength and electron density in the outflow, and the distance between jet apex
and the core at each frequency.
