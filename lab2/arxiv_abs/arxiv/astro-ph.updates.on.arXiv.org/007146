We have exploited the very precise parallaxes, proper motions and photometry of \textit{Gaia}\,
Data Release~2 to study white dwarf members of the Hyades star cluster. Gaia photometry and parallaxes
for the eight DA white dwarfs confirmed members have been then used to compute absolute magnitudes
and colours. These were compared to three independent sets of white dwarf evolutionary tracks,
to derive cooling times and white dwarf (final) masses. All sets of models provide the same mass values,
with only small differences in the cooling ages. The precision in the derived masses and cooling
ages is typically 1-3%. Our derived masses are generally consistent with spectroscopic estimates
from the literature, whilst cooling ages are generally larger. The recent estimate of the cluster
age from the Gaia Data Release~2 main sequence turn off colour-magnitude-diagram (790Myr) has
been employed to derive progenitor (initial) masses. We find a slope of the initial-final mass relation
for the Hyades white dwarfs (masses between ~0.67 and ~0.84 Mo) steeper than that derived for the
same mass range from global estimates --averaged over the whole spectrum of white dwarf masses--
irrespectively of the cooling models adopted. However, when considering the error in this age estimate
(+160 -100 Myr), a definitive conclusion on this issue cannot be reached yet. The lower limit of 690Myr
(closer to the classical Hyades age of 600-650Myr) would provide a slope of the initial-final mass
relation closer to the global determinations. We also find hints of an intrinsic spread of the cluster
initial-final mass relation for the cluster.
