New space missions, such as NASA TESS or ESA PLATO, will focus on bright stars, which have been largely
ignored by modern large surveys, especially in the northern sky. Spectroscopic information is
of paramount importance in characterising the stars and analysing planets possibly orbiting them,
and in studying the Galactic disc evolution. The aim of this work was to analyse all bright (V < 8 mag)
F, G, and K dwarf stars using high-resolution spectra in the selected sky fields near the northern
celestial pole. The observations were carried out with the 1.65 m diameter telescope at the Mol\.{e}tai
Astronomical Observatory and a fibre-fed high-resolution spectrograph covering a full visible
wavelength range (400-850 nm). The atmospheric parameters were derived using the classical equivalent
width approach while the individual chemical element abundances were determined from spectral
synthesis. For both tasks the one-dimensional plane-parallel LTE MARCS stellar model atmospheres
were applied. Results. We determined the main atmospheric parameters, kinematic properties,
orbital parameters, and stellar ages for 109 newly observed stars and chemical abundances of 23
chemical species for 249 F, G, and K dwarf stars observed in the present study and in our previous study.
The [MgI/FeI] ratio was adopted to define the thin-disc ($\alpha$-poor) and thick-disc ($\alpha$-rich)
stars in our sample. We explored the behaviour of 21 chemical species in the [El/FeI] versus [FeI/H]
and [El/FeI] versus age planes, and compared the results with the latest Galactic chemical evolution
models. We also explored [El/FeI] gradients according to the mean Galactocentric distances and
maximum height above the Galactic plane.
