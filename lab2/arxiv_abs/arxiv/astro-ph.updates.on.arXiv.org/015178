Inflation Gravity Waves B-Modes polarization detection is the ultimate goal of modern large angular
scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments around the world. A big effort is undergoing
with the deployment of many ground-based, balloon-borne and satellite experiments using different
methods to separate this faint polarized component from the incoming radiation. One of the largely
used technique is the Stokes Polarimetry that uses a rotating half-wave plate (HWP) and a linear
polarizer to separate and modulate the polarization components with low residual cross-polarization.
This paper describes the QUBIC Stokes Polarimeter highlighting its design features and its performances.
A common systematic with these devices is the generation of large spurious signals synchronous
with the rotation and proportional to the emissivity of the optical elements. A key feature of the
QUBIC Stokes Polarimeter is to operate at cryogenic temperature in order to minimize this unwanted
component. Moving efficiently this large optical element at low temperature constitutes a big
engineering challenge in order to reduce friction power dissipation. Big attention has been given
during the designing phase to minimize the differential thermal contractions between parts. The
rotation is driven by a stepper motor placed outside the cryostat to avoid thermal load dissipation
at cryogenic temperature. The tests and the results presented in this work show that the QUBIC polarimeter
can easily achieve a precision below 0.1{\deg} in positioning simply using the stepper motor precision
and the optical absolute encoder. The rotation induces only few mK of extra power load on the second
cryogenic stage (~ 8 K).
