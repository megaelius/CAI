The spectrum of radiation emitted following shock breakout from a star's surface with a power-law
density profile $\rho \propto x^n$ is investigated. Assuming planar geometry, local Compton equilibrium
and bremsstrahlung emission as the dominant photon production mechanism, numerical solutions
are obtained for the photon number density and temperature profiles as a function of time, for hydrogen-helium
envelopes. The temperature solutions are determined by the breakout shock velocity $v_0$ and the
pre-shock breakout density $\rho_0$, and depend weakly on the value of n. Fitting formulas for the
peak surface temperature at breakout as a function of $v_0$ and $\rho_0$ are provided, with $T_{peak}\approx
9.44\exp{[12.63(v_0/c)^{1/2}]}$ eV, and the time dependence of the surface temperature is tabulated.
The time integrated emitted spectrum is a robust prediction of the model, determined by $\mathcal{T}_{\rm
peak}$ and $v_0$ alone and insensitive to details of light travel time or slight deviations from
spherical symmetry. Adopting commonly assumed progenitor parameters, breakout luminosities
of ~10^45 erg/s and ~10^44 erg/s in the 0.3-10 keV band are expected for BSG and RSG/He-WR progenitors
respectively (T_{peak} is well below the band for RSGs, unless their radius is ~10^13 cm). >30
detections of SN1987A-like (BSG) breakouts are expected over the lifetime of ROSAT and XMM-Newton.
An absence of such detections would imply that either the typical parameters assumed for BSG progenitors
are grossly incorrect or that their envelopes are not hydrostatic. The observed spectrum and duration
of XRF 080109/SN2008D are in tension with a non-relativistic breakout from a stellar surface interpretation.
