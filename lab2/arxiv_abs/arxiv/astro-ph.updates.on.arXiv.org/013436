Galactic discs are known to have a complex multilayer structure. An in-depth study of the stellar
population properties of the thin and thick components can elucidate the formation and evolution
of disc galaxies. Even though thick discs are ubiquitous, their origin is still debated. Here we
probe the thick disc formation scenarios by investigating NGC7572, an enormous edge-on galaxy
having $R_{25}\approx 25$ kpc and $V_{\rm rot} \approx 370$ km s$^{-1}$, which substantially exceeds
the Milky Way size and mass. We analysed DECaLS archival imaging and found that the disc of NGC7572
contains two flaring stellar discs (a thin and a thick disc) with similar radial scales. We collected
deep long-slit spectroscopic data using the 6m Russian BTA telescope and analysed them with a novel
technique. We first reconstructed a non-parametric stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution
along the radius of the galaxy and then fitted it with two kinematic components accounting for the
orbital distribution of stars in thin and thick discs. The old thick disc turned out to be 2.7 times
as massive as the intermediate-age thin component, $1.6\times 10^{11}$ $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$
vs. $5.9\times10^{10}$ $\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is very unusual. The different duration
of the formation epochs evidenced by the [Mg/Fe] values of +0.3 and +0.15 dex for the thick and thin
discs respectively, their kinematics and the mass ratio suggest that in NGC7572 we observe a rapidly
formed very massive thick disc and an underdeveloped thin disc, whose growth ended prematurely
due to the exhaustion of the cold gas likely because of environmental effects.
