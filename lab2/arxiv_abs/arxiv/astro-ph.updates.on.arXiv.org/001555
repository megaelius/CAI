We present a new approach for estimating the 3.6 micron stellar mass-to-light ratio in terms of the
[3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations. Our approach avoids several of the largest sources
of uncertainty in existing techniques. By focusing on mid-IR wavelengths, we gain a virtually dust
extinction-free tracer of the old stars, avoiding the need to adopt a dust model to correctly interpret
optical or optical/NIR colors normally leveraged to assign M/L. By calibrating a new relation between
NIR and mid-IR colors of GLIMPSE giant stars we also avoid discrepancies in model predictions for
the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations due to uncertainties in molecular line opacities.
We find that the [3.6]-[4.5] color, which is driven primarily by metallicity, provides a tight constraint
on M/L_3.6, which varies intrinsically less than at optical wavelengths. The uncertainty on M/L_3.6
of ~0.07 dex due to unconstrained age variations marks a significant improvement on existing techniques
for estimating the stellar M/L with shorter wavelength data. A single M/L_3.6=0.6 (assuming a Chabrier
IMF), independent of [3.6]-[4.5] color, is also feasible as it can be applied simultaneously to
old, metal-rich and young, metal-poor populations, and still with comparable (or better) accuracy
(~0.1 dex) as alternatives. We expect our M/L_3.6 to be optimal for mapping the stellar mass distributions
in S4G galaxies, for which we have developed an Independent Component Analysis technique to first
isolate the old stellar light at 3.6 micron from non-stellar emission (e.g. hot dust and the 3.3 PAH
feature). Our estimate can also be used to determine the fractional contribution of non-stellar
emission to global (rest-frame) 3.6 micron fluxes, e.g. in WISE imaging, and establishes a reliable
basis for exploring variations in the stellar IMF.
