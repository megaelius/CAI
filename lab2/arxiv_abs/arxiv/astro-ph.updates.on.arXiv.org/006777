Little is known about how high-mass stars form. Around 30\% of the young high-mass stars in the Galaxy
are observed at the edges of ionized (HII) regions. Therefore these are places of choice to study
the earliest stages of high-mass star formation, especially towards the most massive condensations.
High-spatial resolution observations in the millimeter range might reveal how these stars form
and how they assemble their mass. We want to study the fragmentation process down to the 0.01~pc scale
in the most massive condensation observed at the south-western edge of the HII region RCW~120 where
the most massive Herschel cores ($\sim$124~$M_{\odot}$ in average) could form high-mass stars.
Using ALMA 3~mm continuum observations towards the densest and most massive millimetric condensation
(Condensation 1) of RCW~120, we used the getimages and getsources algorithms to extract the sources
detected with ALMA and obtained their physical parameters. The fragmentation of the hersche cores
is discussed through their Jeans mass to understand the properties of the future stars. We extracted
18 fragments from the ALMA continuum observation at 3~mm towards 8 cores detected with Herschel,
whose mass and deconvolved size range from 2~$M_{\odot}$ to 32~$M_{\odot}$ and from 1.6~mpc to
28.8~mpc, respectively. The low degree of fragmentation observed, regarding to the thermal Jeans
fragmentation, suggests that the observed fragmentation is inconsistent with ideal gravitational
fragmentation and other ingredients such as turbulence or magnetic fields should be added in order
to explain it. Finally, the range of fragments' mass indicates that the densest condensation of
RCW~120 is a favourable place for the formation of high-mass stars with the presence of a probable
UCHII region associated with the 27~$M_{\odot}$ Fragment 1 of Core 2.
