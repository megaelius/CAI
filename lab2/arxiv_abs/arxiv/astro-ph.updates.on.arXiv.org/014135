We present a detailed abundance analysis of the three brightest member stars at the top of the giant
branch of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Grus~II. All stars exhibit a higher than expected $\mathrm{[Mg/Ca]}$
ratio compared to metal-poor stars in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way halo.
Nucleosynthesis in high mass ($\geqslant 20$M$_\odot$) core-collapse supernovae has been shown
to create this signature. The abundances of this small sample (3) stars suggest the chemical enrichment
of Grus~II could have occurred through substantial high-mass stellar evolution and is consistent
with the framework of a top-heavy initial mass function. However, with only three stars it can not
be ruled out that the abundance pattern is the result of a stochastic chemical enrichment at early
times in the galaxy. The most metal-rich of the three stars also possesses a small enhancement in
rapid neutron-capture ($r$-process) elements. The abundance pattern of the $r$-process elements
in this star matches the scaled $r$-process pattern of the solar system and $r$-process enhanced
stars in other dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way halo, hinting at a common origin for these elements
across a range of environments. All current proposed astrophysical sites of $r$-process element
production are associated with high-mass stars, thus the possible top-heavy initial mass function
of Grus~II would increase the likelihood of any of these events occurring. The time delay between
the $\alpha$ and $r$-process element enrichment of the galaxy favors a neutron star merger as the
origin of the $r$-process elements in Grus~II.
