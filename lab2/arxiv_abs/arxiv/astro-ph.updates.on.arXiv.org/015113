For searching beyond Standard Model physics, stars are laboratories which complement terrestrial
experiments. Massless neutrinos in the Standard Model of particle physics cannot have a magnetic
moment, but massive neutrinos have a finite magnetic moment in the minimal extension of the Standard
Model. Large extra dimensions are a possible solution of the hierarchy problem. Both of these provide
additional energy loss channels in stellar interiors via the electromagnetic interaction and
radiation into extra dimensions, respectively, and thus affect stellar evolution. We perform
simulations of stellar evolution with such additional energy losses and find that they eliminate
the blue loops in the evolution of intermediate-mass stars. The existence of Cepheid stars can be
used to constrain the neutrino magnetic moment and large extra dimensions. In order for Cepheids
to exist, the neutrino magnetic moment should be smaller than the range ~2x10^{-10} to 4x10^{-11}mu_B,
where mu_B is the Bohr magneton, and the fundamental scale in the (4+2)-spacetime should be larger
than ~2 to 5 TeV, depending on the rate of the ^{12}C(alpha, gamma)^{16}O reaction. The fundamental
scale also has strong dependence on the metallicity. This value of the magnetic moment is in the range
explored in the reactor experiments, but higher than the limit inferred from globular clusters.
Similarly the fundamental scale value we constrain corresponds to a size of the compactified dimensions
comparable to those explored in the torsion balance experiments, but is smaller than the limits
inferred from collider experiments and low-mass stars.
