Cosmological constraints from clusters rely on accurate gravitational mass estimates, which
strongly depend on cluster gas temperature measurements. Therefore, systematic calibration
differences may result in biased, instrument-dependent cosmological constraints. This is of
special interest in the light of the tension between the Planck results of the primary temperature
anisotropies of the CMB and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich plus X-ray cluster counts analyses. We quantify
in detail the systematics and uncertainties of the cross-calibration of the effective area between
five X-ray instruments, EPIC-MOS1/MOS2/PN onboard XMM-Newton and ACIS-I/S onboard Chandra,
and the influence on temperature measurements. Furthermore, we assess the impact of the cross calibration
uncertainties on cosmology. Using the HIFLUGCS sample, consisting of the 64 X-ray brightest galaxy
clusters, we constrain the ICM temperatures through spectral fitting in the same, mostly isothermal,
regions and compare them. Our work is an extension to a previous one using X-ray clusters by the IACHEC.
Performing spectral fitting in the full energy band we find that best-fit temperatures determined
with XMM-Newton/EPIC are significantly lower than Chandra/ACIS temperatures. We demonstrate
that effects like multitemperature structure and different relative sensitivities of the instruments
at certain energy bands cannot explain the observed differences. We conclude that using XMM-Newton/EPIC,
instead of Chandra/ACIS to derive full energy band temperature profiles for cluster mass determination
results in an 8% shift towards lower OmegaM values and <1% shift towards higher sigma8 values
in a cosmological analysis of a complete sample of galaxy clusters. Such a shift is insufficient
to significantly alleviate the tension between Planck CMB anisotropies and SZ plus XMM-Newton
cosmological constraints.
