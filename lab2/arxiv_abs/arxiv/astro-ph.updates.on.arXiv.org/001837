The structure of inner region of protoplanetary disks around young pre-main-sequence stars is
still poorly understood. This part of the disk is shaped by various forces influencing dust and gas
dynamics and by dust sublimation, which creates abrupt drops in the dust density. This region also
emits a strong near-infrared excess that cannot be explained by classical accretion disk models,
which suggests the existence of some unusual dust distribution or disk shape. The most prevalent
explanation to date is the puffed-up inner disk rim model, where the disk exhibits an optically thin
cavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation. The critical parameter in this model
is the inner disk rim height $z_{\rm max}$ relative to the rim's distance from the star $R_{\rm in}$.
Observations often require $z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}\gtrsim0.2$ to reproduce the near-infrared
excess in the spectra. In this paper we put together a comprehensive list of processes that can shape
the inner disk rim and combined them together into a self-consistent model. Two of them, radiation
pressure force and the gas velocity profile, have never been applied in this context before. The
aim was to find the most plausible theoretical values of $z_{\rm max}/R_{\rm in}$. The results show
that this value is $\lesssim$0.13 for Herbig Ae stars, $\lesssim$0.11 for T Tau stars and $\lesssim$0.10
for young brown dwarfs. This is below the observational requirements for Herbig Ae stars. We argue
that the same problem exists also in T Tau stars. We conclude that the puffed-up inner rim model cannot
be the sole explanation for the near-infrared excess in young pre-main-sequence stars.
