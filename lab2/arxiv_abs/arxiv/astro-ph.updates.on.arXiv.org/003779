Pulsars and neutron stars are generally more massive than the Sun, whereas black holes have unlimited
mass-spectrum, though the mass-gap between 2 - 5$M_\odot$, which applies for both classes, is evident
and remains puzzling. Based on the solution of the TOV equation modified to include a universal scalar
field $\phi$ at the background of supranuclear densities, we claim that pulsars must be born with
embryonic super-baryons (SBs), that form through the merger of individual neutrons at their centers.
The cores of SBs are made of purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids (henceforth
SuSu-fluids). Such quantum fluids have a uniform supranuclear density and governed by the critical
EOSs for baryonic matter $P_b = \mathcal{E}_b$ and for $\phi-$induced dark energy $P_\phi= -\mathcal{E}_\phi.$
The incompressibility here ensures that particles communicate on the shortest possible timescale,
superfluidity and superconductivity enforce SBs to spin-down promptly as dictated by the Onsager-Feynman
equation, whereas their lowest energy state grants SBs lifetimes that are comparable to those of
protons. The extraordinary long lifetimes suggests that conglomeration of SuSu-objects would
evolve over several big bang events to possibly form dark matter halos that embed the galaxies in
the observable universe. Having pulsars been converted into SuSu-objects, which is predicted
to last for one Gyr or even shorter, then they become extraordinary compact and turn invisible. It
turns out that recent observations on the quantum, stellar and cosmological scales remarkably
support the present scenario.
