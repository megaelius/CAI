The origin of the blue supergiant (BSG) progenitor of Supernova (SN) 1987A has long been debated,
along with the role that its sub-solar metallicity played. We now have a sample of 1987A-like SNe
that arise from the core collapse (CC) of BSGs. The metallicity of the explosion sites of the known
BSG SNe is investigated, as well as their association to star-forming regions. Both indirect and
direct metallicity measurements of 13 BSG SN host galaxies are presented, and compared to those
of other CC SN types. Indirect measurements are based on the known luminosity-metallicity relation
and on published metallicity gradients of spiral galaxies. To provide direct estimates based on
strong line diagnostics, we obtained spectra of each BSG SN host both at the SN explosion site and
at the positions of other HII regions. Continuum-subtracted Ha images allowed us to quantify the
association between BSG SNe and star-forming regions. BSG SNe explode either in low-luminosity
galaxies or at large distances from the nuclei of luminous hosts. Therefore, their indirectly measured
metallicities are typically lower than those of SNe IIP and Ibc. This is confirmed by the direct estimates,
which show slightly sub-solar values (12+log(O/H)=8.3-8.4 dex), similar to that of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), where SN 1987A exploded. However, two SNe (1998A and 2004em) were found at near solar
metallicity. SNe IIb have a metallicity distribution similar to that of BSG SNe. Finally, the association
to star-forming regions is similar among BSG SNe, SNe IIP and IIn. Our results suggest that LMC metal
abundances play a role in the formation of some 1987A-like SNe. This would naturally fit in a single
star scenario for the progenitors. However, the existence of two events at nearly solar metallicity
suggests that also other channels, e.g. binarity, contribute to produce BSG SNe.
