We present ground-based infrared transit observations for four dynamically interacting \textit{Kepler}
planets, including Kepler-29b, Kepler-36c, KOI-1783.01, and Kepler-177c, obtained using the
Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Hale 200" telescope at Palomar Observatory. By utilizing an engineered
diffuser and custom guiding software, we mitigate time-correlated telluric and instrumental
noise sources in these observations. We achieve an infrared photometric precision comparable
to or better than that of space-based observatories such as the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope},
and detect transits with greater than 3$\sigma$ significance for all planets. For Kepler-177c
($J=13.9$) our measurement uncertainties are only $1.2\times$ the photon noise limit and 1.9 times
better than the predicted photometric precision for \textit{Spitzer} IRAC photometry of this
same target. We find that a single transit observation obtained $4-5$ years after the end of the original
\textit{Kepler} mission can reduce dynamical mass uncertainties by as much as a factor of three
for these systems. Additionally, we combine our new observations of KOI-1783.01 with information
from the literature to confirm the planetary nature of this system. We discuss the implications
of our new mass and radius constraints in the context of known exoplanets with low incident fluxes,
and we note that Kepler-177c may be a more massive analog to the currently known super-puffs given
its core mass (3.8$\pm0.9M_\Earth$) and large gas-to-core ratio (2.8$\pm0.7$). Our demonstrated
infrared photometric performance opens up new avenues for ground-based observations of transiting
exoplanets previously thought to be restricted to space-based investigation.
