In this paper we estimate diffuse foreground minimized Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Stokes
Q and U polarization maps based upon the fundamental concept of Gaussian nature of CMB and strong
non-Gaussian nature of astrophysical polarized foregrounds using WMAP nine year published polarization
maps. We excise regions of the sky that define position of the known point sources, regions that are
strongly contaminated by either the detector noise or by the diffuse foregrounds or both, and then
perform foreground minimizations over the surviving sky regions that constitute approximately
$50\%$ of the full sky area. We critically evaluate performance of foreground minimizations in
several ways and show that our foreground minimization method removes significant foregrounds
from input maps. The cleaned Stokes \{Q, U\} polarization maps have less EE and BB power from relevant
sky region compared to WMAP foreground-reduced Stokes \{Q, U\} polarization maps at different
multipole ranges. We validate our methodology by performing detailed Monte Carlo simulations.
The main driving machinery of our method is an internal-linear-combination (ILC) approach, however,
unlike simple variance minimization performed in usual ILC method, the core of the method being
dependent on the theoretically well motivated concept of Gaussianity of CMB polarization a direct
connection is established between observations and models of inflation. Additionally, the method,
like the usual ILC method, is independent on modeling uncertainties of polarized foregrounds.
It will be useful to apply our method in future generation low-noise CMB polarization experiments.
