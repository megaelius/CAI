Most optical and IR spectra are now acquired using detectors with finite-width pixels in a square
array. This paper examines the effects of such pixellation, using computed simulations to illustrate
the effects which most concern the astronomer end-user. Coarse sampling increases the random noise
errors in wavelength by typically 10 - 20% at 2 pixels/FWHM, but with wide variation depending on
the functional form of the instrumental Line Spread Function (LSF) and on the pixel phase. Line widths
are even more strongly affected at low sampling frequencies. However, the noise in fitted peak amplitudes
is minimally affected. Pixellation has a substantial but complex effect on the ability to see a relative
minimum between two closely-spaced peaks (or relative maximum between two absorption lines).
The consistent scale of resolving power presented by Robertson (2013) is extended to cover pixellated
spectra. The systematic bias errors in wavelength introduced by pixellation are examined. While
they may be negligible for smooth well-sampled symmetric LSFs, they are very sensitive to asymmetry
and high spatial frequency substructure. The Modulation Transfer Function for sampled data is
shown to give a useful indication of the extent of improperly sampled signal in an LSF. The common
maxim that 2 pixels/FWHM is the Nyquist limit is incorrect and most LSFs will exhibit some aliasing
at this sample frequency. While 2 pixels/FWHM is often an acceptable minimum for moderate signal/noise
work, it is preferable to carry out simulations for any actual or proposed LSF to find the effects
of sampling frequency. Where end-users have a choice of sampling frequencies, through on-chip
binning and/or spectrograph configurations, the instrument user manual should include an examination
of their effects. (Abridged)
