In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The
formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form.
The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided
a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here
we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties
that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical
galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models
using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review
techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these
approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function
of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10^12 Msun, less than 20% of the available
baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is
small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar
mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow
region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos
are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection
of these properties to galaxy clustering.
