We study the z=0 gas kinematics, morphology, and angular momentum content of isolated galaxies
in a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations from the FIRE project spanning $M_{\star}=10^{6-11}M_{\odot}$.
Gas becomes increasingly rotationally supported with increasing galaxy mass. In the lowest-mass
galaxies ($M_{\star}<10^{8}M_{\odot}$), gas fails to form a morphological disk and is primarily
dispersion and pressure supported. At intermediate masses ($M_{\star}=10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$),
galaxies display a wide range of gas kinematics and morphologies, from thin, rotating disks, to
irregular spheroids with negligible net rotation. All the high-mass ($M_{\star}=10^{10-11}M_{\odot}$)
galaxies form rotationally supported gas disks. Many of the halos whose galaxies fail to form disks
harbor high angular momentum gas in their circumgalactic medium. The ratio of the specific angular
momentum of gas in the central galaxy to that of the dark-matter halo increases significantly with
galaxy mass, from $j_{\rm gas}/j_{\rm DM}\sim0.1$ at $M_{\star}=10^{6-7}M_{\odot}$ to $j_{\rm
gas}/j_{\rm DM}\sim2$ at $M_{\star}=10^{10-11}M_{\odot}$. The reduced rotational support
in the lowest-mass galaxies owes to (a) stellar feedback and the UV background suppressing the accretion
of high-angular momentum gas at late times, and (b) stellar feedback driving large non-circular
gas motions. We broadly reproduce the observed scaling relations between galaxy mass, gas rotation
velocity, size, and angular momentum, but may somewhat underpredict the incidence of disky, high-angular
momentum galaxies at the lowest observed masses ($M_{\star}=(10^{6}-2\times10^{7})M_{\odot}$).
In our simulations, stars are uniformly less rotationally supported than gas. The common assumption
that stars follow the same rotation curve as gas thus substantially overestimates galaxies' stellar
angular momentum, particularly at low masses.
