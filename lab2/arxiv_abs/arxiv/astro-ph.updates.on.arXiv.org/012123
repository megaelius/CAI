During lunar eclipse of January 21, 2019 a meteoroid impacted the Moon producing a visible light
flash. The impact was witnessed by casual observers offering an opportunity to study the phenomenon
from multiple geographical locations. We use images and videos collected by observers in 7 countries
to estimate the location, impact parameters (speed and incoming direction) and energy of the meteoroid.
Using parallax, we achieve determining the impact location at lat. $-29.43^{+0.30}_{-0.21}$,
lon. $-67.89^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$ and geocentric distance as 356553 km. After devising and applying
a photo-metric procedure for measuring flash standard magnitudes in multiple RGB images having
different exposure times, we found that the flash, had an average G-magnitude $\langle G\rangle
= 6.7\pm0.3$. We use gravitational ray tracing (GRT) to estimate the orbital properties and likely
radiant of the impactor. We find that the meteoroid impacted the moon with a speed of $14^{+7}_{-6}$
km/s (70% C.L.) and at a shallow angle, $\theta < 38.2$ degrees. Assuming a normal error for our estimated
flash brightness, educated priors for the luminous efficiency and object density, and using the
GRT-computed probability distributions of impact speed and incoming directions, we calculate
posterior probability distributions for the kinetic energy (median $K_{\rm med}$ = 0.8 kton),
body mass ($M_{\rm med}$ = 27 kg) and diameter ($d_{\rm med}$ = 29 cm), and crater size ($D_{\rm med}$
= 9 m). If our assumptions are correct, the crater left by the impact could be detectable by prospecting
lunar probes. These results arose from a timely collaboration between professional and amateur
astronomers which highlight the potential importance of citizen science in astronomy.
