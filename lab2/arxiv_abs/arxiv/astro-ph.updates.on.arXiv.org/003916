INTEGRAL/SPI is a space-based coded mask telescope featuring a 19-element Germanium detector
array for high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, encapsulated in a scintillation detector
assembly that provide a veto for background from charged particles. In space, cosmic rays irradiate
spacecraft and instrument, which results in a large instrumental background from activation of
those materials, and leads to deterioration of the charge collection properties of the Ge detectors.
We use 13.5 years of INTEGRAL/SPI spectra for each detector and for each pointing of the satellite.
Spectral fits provide us with details about separated background components. From the strongest
background lines, we first determine how the spectral response changes with time. We then determine
how the instrumental background components change in intensities and other characteristics,
most-importantly their relative distribution among detectors. Spectral resolution of Ge detectors
in space degrades with time, up to 15% within half a year, consistently for all detectors, and across
the SPI energy range. Semi-annual annealing operations recover these losses, yet there is a small
long-term degradation. The intensity of instrumental background varies anti-correlated to solar
activity, in general. There are significant differences among different lines and with respect
to continuum. Background lines are found to have a characteristic, well-defined and long-term
consistent intensity ratio among detectors. We use this to categorise lines in groups of similar
behaviour. The dataset of spectral-response and background parameters as fitted across the INTEGRAL
mission allows studies of SPI spectral response and background behaviour in a broad perspective,
and efficiently supports precision modelling of instrumental background.
