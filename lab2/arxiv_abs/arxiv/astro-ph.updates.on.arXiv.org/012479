We generalize our earlier work on neutron stars (arXiv:1903.04981), which assumed spherical Wigner-Seitz
cells in the inner crust, to admit the possibility of pasta phases, i.e., non-spherical cell shapes.
Full fourth-order extended Thomas-Fermi calculations using the density functional BSk24 are
performed for cylindrical and plate-like cells. Unlike in our spherical-cell calculations, we
do not include shell and pairing corrections, but there are grounds for expecting these corrections
for pasta to be significantly smaller. It is therefore meaningful to compare the ETF pasta results
with the full spherical-cell results, i.e., with shell and pairing corrections included. However,
in view of the many previous studies in which shell and pairing corrections were omitted entirely,
it is of interest to compare our pasta results with the ETF part of the corresponding spherical calculations.
Making this latter comparison we find that as the density increases the cell shapes pass through
the usual sequence sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ plate before the transition to the homogeneous core.
The filling fractions found at the phase transitions are in close agreement with expectations based
on the liquid-drop model. On the other hand, when we compare with the full spherical-cell results,
we find the sequence to be sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ plate. In neither
case do any "inverted", i.e., bubble-like, configurations appear. We provide accurate fitting
formulas to all our essential numerical results for each of the three phases, designed especially
for the density range where the nonspherical shapes are expected, which enable one to capture not
only the general behavior of the fitted functions, but also the differences between them in different
phases.
