Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are understood to be the final fate for a subset of massive,
stripped envelope, rapidly rotating stars. Beyond this, our knowledge of the progenitor systems
is limited. Using the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis) stellar evolution models,
we investigate the possibility that some massive stars in binaries can maintain the angular momentum
required for jet production, while still loosing their outer envelope through winds or binary interactions.
We find that a total hydrogen mass of less than 0.0005 Msun and a helium ejecta mass fraction of less
than 0.20 provide the best thresholds for the supernova type II/Ibc and Ib/Ic divisions respectively.
Tidal interactions in binaries are accounted for by applying a tidal algorithm to post-process
the stellar evolution models output by BPASS. We show that the observed volumetric gamma-ray burst
rate evolution can be recreated using two distinct pathways and plausible distributions for burst
parameters. In the first pathway, stars are spun up by mass accretion into a quasi-homogeneous state.
In the second, tides maintain rotation where otherwise the star would spin down. Both lead to type
Ic supernova progenitors, and a metallicity distribution consistent with the GRB host galaxy population.
The inferred core angular momentum threshold for jet production is consistent with theoretical
requirements for collapsars, given the assumptions made in our model. We can therefore reproduce
several aspects of core collapse supernova/GRB observation and theory simultaneously. We discuss
the predicted observable properties of GRB progenitors and their surviving companions.
