We have obtained extensive high-quality spectroscopic observations of the OGLE-LMC-CEP-1718
eclipsing binary system in the Large Magellanic Cloud which Soszynski et al. (2008) had identified
as a candidate system for containing two classical Cepheids in orbit. Our spectroscopic data clearly
demonstrate binary motion of the Cepheids in a 413-day eccentric orbit, rendering this eclipsing
binary system the first ever known to consist of two classical Cepheid variables. After disentangling
the four different radial velocity variations in the system we present the orbital solution and
the individual pulsational radial velocity curves of the Cepheids. We show that both Cepheids are
extremely likely to be first overtone pulsators and determine their respective dynamical masses,
which turn out to be equal to within 1.5 %. Since the secondary eclipse is not observed in the orbital
light curve we cannot derive the individual radii of the Cepheids, but the sum of their radii derived
from the photometry is consistent with overtone pulsation for both variables. The existence of
two equal-mass Cepheids in a binary system having different pulsation periods (1.96 and 2.48 days,
respectively) may pose an interesting challenge to stellar evolution and pulsation theories,
and a more detailed study of this system using additional datasets should yield deeper insight about
the physics of stellar evolution of Cepheid variables. Future analysis of the system using additional
near-infrared photometry might also lead to a better understanding of the systematic uncertainties
in current Baade-Wesselink techniques of distance determinations to Cepheid variables.
