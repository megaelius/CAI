We have reinvestigated the A$^1\Pi$$(v=0)$ level of $^{13}$C$^{18}$O\ using new high-resolution
spectra obtained via multi-photon laser excitation as well as with synchrotron-based Fourier-transform
absorption spectroscopy of the A$^1\Pi -\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$$(0, 0)$, e$^3\Sigma^--\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$$(1,
0)$, d$^3\Delta-\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$$(4, 0)$, a$'^3\Sigma^+-\textrm{X}^1\Sigma^+$$(9,
0)$, and \atX$(11, 0)$ bands. In addition, Fourier-transform emission spectroscopy in the visible
range is performed on the ${\rm B}^1\Sigma^+-{\rm A}^1\Pi$$(0, 0)$ band. Spectra of the \BX$(0,
0)$ band are measured in order to tie information from the latter emission data to the level structure
of A$^1\Pi$$(v=0)$. The high pressures in the absorption cell at the synchrotron and the high temperatures
in the emission discharge permitted monitoring of high rotational quantum levels in A$^1\Pi$$(v=0)$
up to $J=43$. All information, in total over 900 spectral lines, was included in an effective-Hamiltonian
analysis of the A$^1\Pi(v=0, J)$ levels that are directly perturbed by the e$\,^3\Sigma^-$$(v=1)$,
d$^3\!\Delta$$(v=4)$, a$'^3\Sigma^+$$(v=9)$, d$^3\!\Delta$$(v=0)$, I$\,^1\Sigma^-$$(v=0,
1)$ close-lying levels and the e$\,^3\Sigma^-$$(v=0,2)$, d$^3\!\Delta$$(v=3,5)$, a$'^3\Sigma^+$$(v=8,10)$
remote levels, as well being indirectly influenced by the a$^3\Pi$$(v=10, 11)$ state. The influence
of nine further perturber levels and their interactions was investigated and are not significant
for reproducing the present experimental data. This analysis leads to a much improved description
in terms of molecular constants and interaction parameters, compared to previous studies of the
same energy region for other CO isotopologues.
