We report photometry and spectroscopy of the outburst of the young stellar object ESO-Halpha 99.
The outburst was first noticed in Gaia alert Gaia18dvc and later by ATLAS. We have established the
outburst light curve with archival ATLAS ``Orange'' filter photometry, Gaia data, new V-band photometry,
and J, H, and K_s photometry from IRIS and UKIRT. The brightness has fluctuated several times near
the light curve maximum. The TESS satellite observed ESO-Halpha 99 with high cadence during one
of these minor minima and found brightness fluctuations on timescales of days and hours. Imaging
with UKIRT shows the outline of an outflow cavity, and we find one knot of H_2 1-0 S(1) emission, now
named MHO 1520, on the symmetry axis of this nebula, indicating recent collimated outflow activity
from ESO-Halpha 99. Its pre-outburst SED shows a flat FIR spectrum, confirming its early evolutionary
state and its similarity to other deeply embedded objects in the broader EXor class. The pre-outburst
luminosity is 34 L_sun, a much higher luminosity than typical EXors, indicating that ESO-Halpha
99 may be a star of intermediate mass. Infrared and optical spectroscopy show a rich emission line
spectrum, including HI lines, strong red CaII emission, as well as infrared CO bandhead emission,
all characteristic EXors in the broadest sense. Comparison of the present spectra with an optical
spectrum obtained in 1993, presumably in the quiescent state of the object, shows that during the
present outburst the continuum component of the spectrum has increased notably more than the emission
lines. The Halpha equivalent width during the outburst is down to one half of its 1993 level, and shock-excited
emission lines are much less prominent.
