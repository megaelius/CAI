The discovery of a large number of supermassive black holes (SMBH) at redshifts $z > 6$, when the Universe
was only 900 million years old, raises the question of how such massive compact objects could form
in a cosmologically short time interval. Each of the standard scenarios proposed, involving rapid
accretion of seed black holes or black hole mergers, faces severe theoretical difficulties in explaining
the short-time formation of supermassive objects. In this work we propose an alternative scenario
for the formation of SMBH in the early Universe, in which energy transfer from superconducting cosmic
strings piercing small seed black holes is the main physical process leading to rapid mass increase.
As a toy model, the accretion rate of a seed black hole pierced by two antipodal strings carrying constant
current is considered. Using an effective action approach, which phenomenologically incorporates
a large class of superconducting string models, we estimate the minimum current required to form
SMBH with masses of order $M = 2 \times 10^{9}M_{\odot}$ by $z = 7.085$. This corresponds to the mass
of the central black hole powering the quasar ULAS J112001.48+064124.3 and is taken as a test case
scenario for early-epoch SMBH formation. For GUT scale strings, the required fractional increase
in the string energy density, due to the presence of the current, is of order $10^{-7}$, so that their
existence remains consistent with current observational bounds on the string tension. In addition,
we consider an "exotic" scenario, in which an SMBH is generated when a small seed black hole is pierced
by a higher-dimensional $F-$string, predicted by string theory. We find that both topological
defect strings and fundamental strings are able to carry currents large enough to generate early-epoch
SMBH via our proposed mechanism.
