X-ray lines of helium-like calcium (\ion{Ca}{19}) between 3.17~\AA\ and 3.21~\AA\ and associated
\ion{Ca}{18} dielectronic satellites have previously been observed in solar flare spectra, and
their excitation mechanisms are well established. Dielectronic satellites of lower ionization
stages (\ion{Ca}{17}~--~\ion{Ca}{15}) are not as well characterized. Several spectra during
a large solar flare in 2001 by the DIOGENESS X-ray spectrometer on the {\em CORONAS-F}\/ spacecraft
show the \ion{Ca}{17} and \ion{Ca}{16} satellites as well as lines of ionized argon (\ion{Ar}{17},
\ion{Ar}{16}) including dielectronic satellites. The DIOGENESS spectra are compared with spectra
from a synthesis code developed here based on an isothermal assumption with various atomic sources
including dielectronic satellite data from the Cowan Hartree--Fock code. Best-fit comparisons
are made by varying the temperature as the code's input (Ar/Ca abundance ratio fixed at 0.33); close
agreement is achieved although with adjustments to some ion fractions. The derived temperature
is close to that derived from the two {\em GOES}\/ X-ray channels, $T_{\rm GOES}$. Some lines are
identified for the first time. Similar spectra from the {\em P78-1}\/ spacecraft and the Alcator
C-Mod tokamak have also been analyzed and similar agreement obtained. The importance of blends
of calcium and argon lines is emphasized, affecting line ratios used for temperature diagnostics.
This analysis will be applied to the {\em Solar Maximum Mission}\/ Bent Crystal Spectrometer archive
and to X-ray spectra expected from the ChemiX instrument on the Sun-orbiting {\em Interhelioprobe}\/
spacecraft, while the relevance to X-ray spectra from non-solar sources is indicated.
