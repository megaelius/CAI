The importance of the Jovian thermosphere with regard to magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is
often neglected in magnetospheric physics. We present the first study to investigate the response
of the Jovian thermosphere to transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure, using an azimuthally
symmetric global circulation model coupled to a simple magnetosphere and fixed auroral conductivity
model. In our simulations, the Jovian magnetosphere encounters a solar wind shock or rarefaction
region and is subsequently compressed or expanded. We present the ensuing response of the coupling
currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling terms, and the aurora to these transient events.
Transient compressions cause the reversal, with respect to steady state, of magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling currents and momentum transfer between the thermosphere and magnetosphere. They also
cause at least a factor of two increase in the Joule heating rate. Ion drag significantly changes
the kinetic energy of the thermospheric neutrals depending on whether the magnetosphere is compressed
or expanded. Local temperature variations appear between ~ -45 and 175 K for the compression scenario
and ~ -20 and 50 K for the expansion case. Extended regions of equatorward flow develop in the wake
of compression events - we discuss the implications of this behaviour for global energy transport.
Both compressions and expansions lead to a ~ 2000 TW increase in the total power dissipated or deposited
in the thermosphere. In terms of auroral processes, transient compressions increase main oval
UV emission by a factor of 4.5 whilst transient expansions increase this main emission by a more modest
37%. Both types of transient event cause shifts in the position of the main oval, of up to 1 deg latitude.
