We present two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf
(WD) models for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the turbulent deflagration model with deflagration-detonation
transition (DDT). We perform a parameter survey for 41 models to study the effects of the initial
central density (i.e., WD mass), metallicity, flame shape, DDT criteria, and turbulent flame formula
for a much wider parameter space than earlier studies. The final isotopic abundances of $^{11}$C
to $^{91}$Tc in these simulations are obtained by post-process nucleosynthesis calculations.
The survey includes SNe Ia models with the central density from $5 \times 10^8$ g cm$^{-3}$ to $5 \times
10^9$ g cm$^{-3}$ (WD masses of 1.30 - 1.38 $M_\odot$), metallicity from 0 to 5 $Z_{\odot}$, C/O mass
ratio from 0.3 - 1.0 and ignition kernels including centered and off-centered ignition kernels.
We present the yield tables of stable isotopes from $^{12}$C to $^{70}$Zn as well as the major radioactive
isotopes for 33 models. Observational abundances of $^{55}$Mn, $^{56}$Fe, $^{57}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni
obtained from the solar composition, well-observed SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants are used to constrain
the explosion models and the supernova progenitor. The connection between the pure turbulent deflagration
model and the subluminous SNe Iax is discussed. We find that dependencies of the nucleosynthesis
yields on the metallicity and the central density (WD mass) are large. To fit these observational
abundances and also for the application of galactic chemical evolution modeling, these dependencies
on the metallicity and WD mass should be taken into account.
