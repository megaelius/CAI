One-zone models constructed to match observed stellar abundance patterns have been used extensively
to constrain the sites of nucleosynthesis with sophisticated libraries of stellar evolution and
stellar yields. The metal mixing included in these models is usually highly simplified, although
it is likely to be a significant driver of abundance evolution. In this work we use high-resolution
hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how metals from individual enrichment events with varying
source energies $E_{\rm ej}$ mix throughout the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) of a low-mass
($M_{\rm gas}=2\times 10^{6}$~M$_{\odot}$), low-metallicity, isolated dwarf galaxy. These
events correspond to the characteristic energies of both common and exotic astrophysical sites
of nucleosynthesis, including: asymptotic giant branch winds ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{46}$~erg),
neutron star-neutron star mergers ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{49}$~erg), supernovae ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{51}$~erg),
and hypernovae ($E_{\rm ej}\sim$10$^{52}$~erg). We find the mixing timescales for individual
enrichment sources in our dwarf galaxy to be long (100~Myr--1~Gyr), with a clear trend of increasing
homogeneity for the more energetic events. Given these timescales, we conclude that the spatial
distribution and frequency of events are important drivers of abundance homogeneity on large scales;
rare, low $E_{\rm ej}$ events should be characterized by particularly broad abundance distributions.
The source energy $E_{\rm ej}$ also correlates with the fraction of metals ejected in galactic winds,
ranging anywhere from 60\% at the lowest energy to 95\% for hypernovae. We conclude by examining
how the radial position, local ISM density, and global star formation rate influence these results.
