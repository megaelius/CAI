Time-domain spectroscopy of the classical accreting T Tauri star, TW Hya, covering a decade and
spanning the far UV to the near-infrared spectral regions can identify the radiation sources, the
atmospheric structure produced by accretion,and properties of the stellar wind. On time scales
from days to years, substantial changes occur in emission line profiles and line strengths. Our
extensive time-domain spectroscopy suggests that the broad near-IR, optical, and far-uv emission
lines, centered on the star, originate in a turbulent post-shock region and can undergo scattering
by the overlying stellar wind as well as some absorption from infalling material. Stable absorption
features appear in H-alpha, apparently caused by an accreting column silhouetted in the stellar
wind. Inflow of material onto the star is revealed by the near-IR He I 10830A line, and its free-fall
velocity correlates inversely with the strength of the post-shock emission, consistent with a
dipole accretion model. However, the predictions of hydrogen line profiles based on accretion
stream models are not well-matched by these observations. Evidence of an accelerating warm to hot
stellar wind is shown by the near-IR He I line, and emission profiles of C II, C III, C IV, N V, and O VI.
The outflow of material changes substantially in both speed and opacity in the yearly sampling of
the near-IR He I line over a decade. Terminal outflow velocities that range from 200 km/s to almost
400 km/s in He I appear to be directly related to the amount of post- shock emission, giving evidence
for an accretion-driven stellar wind. Calculations of the emission from realistic post- shock
regions are needed.
