Shanks et al. (2018) arXiv:1810.02595 make two claims that they argue bring the local measurement
and early Universe prediction of H0 into agreement: A) they claim that Gaia DR2 parallax measurements
show the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance scale used to measure H0 to be grossly in error
and B) that we live near the middle of an enormous void, further biasing the local measurement of the
Hubble constant. We show that the first claim is caused by five erroneous uses of the data: in decreasing
order of importance: 1) the use of a distance indicator, main sequence fitting of cluster stars,
which is unrelated to the calibration of Cepheids and therefore has no bearing on current measurements
of H0; 2) the use of Gaia data for Cepheids that fully saturate the detector, producing unreliable
parallaxes; 3) the use of a fixed parallax offset which is known to depend on source magnitude and
color but which is derived for sources with extremely different colors and magnitudes; 4) ignoring
the uncertainty in this offset; and 5) ignoring the other geometric sources of Cepheid calibration,
the distance of the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries and the masers in NGC 4258, which are independent
of Milky Way parallaxes. Just resolving the first two of these issues by not using unrelated or saturated
data leads to no inconsistency between Gaia parallaxes and the current Cepheid distance scale.
The second claim can be refuted 6) because of the increase in chi-squared that the alleged void would
entail in SN measurements in the Hubble flow, and 7) because it would represent a 6 sigma fluctuation
of cosmic variance between the local and globally measured expansion, requiring us to live in an
exceedingly special location.
