The upcoming $\textit{James Webb Space Telescope}$ ($\textit{JWST}$) will allow observations
of high-redshift galaxies at fainter detection levels than ever before, and $\textit{JWST}$ surveys
targeting gravitationally lensed fields are expected to bring $z\gtrsim 6$ objects with very low
star formation rate (SFR) within reach of spectroscopic studies. As galaxies at lower and lower
star formation activity are brought into view, many of the standard methods used in the analysis
of integrated galaxy spectra are at some point bound to break down, due to violation of the assumptions
of a well-sampled stellar initial mass function (IMF) and a slowly varying SFR. We argue that galaxies
with SFR$\sim 0.1\ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are likely to turn up at the spectroscopic detection limit
of $\textit{JWST}$ in lensed fields, and investigate to what extent star formation sampling may
affect the spectral analysis of such objects. We use the $\small{\text{SLUG}}$ spectral synthesis
code to demonstrate that such effects are likely to have significant impacts on spectral diagnostics
of, for example, the Balmer emission lines. These effects are found to stem primarily from SFRs varying
rapidly on short ($\sim$ Myr) timescales due to star formation in finite units (star clusters),
whereas the effects of an undersampled IMF is deemed insignificant in comparison. In contrast,
the ratio between the HeII- and HI-ionizing flux is found to be sensitive to IMF-sampling as well
as ICMF-sampling (sampling of the stellar initial cluster mass function), which may affect interpretations
of galaxies containing Population III stars or other hot ionizing sources.
