Finding the sources responsible for the hydrogen reionization is one of the most pressing issues
in cosmology. Bright QSOs are known to ionize their surrounding neighborhood, but they are too few
to ensure the required HI ionizing background. A significant contribution by faint AGNs, however,
could solve the problem, as recently advocated on the basis of a relatively large space density of
faint active nuclei at z>4. We have carried out an exploratory spectroscopic program to measure
the HI ionizing emission of 16 faint AGNs spanning a broad U-I color interval, with I~21-23 and 3.6<z<4.2.
These AGNs are three magnitudes fainter than the typical SDSS QSOs (M1450<~-26) which are known
to ionize their surrounding IGM at z>~4. The LyC escape fraction has been detected with S/N ratio
of ~10-120 and is between 44 and 100% for all the observed faint AGNs, with a mean value of 74% at 3.6<z<4.2
and -25.1<M1450<-23.3, in agreement with the value found in the literature for much brighter QSOs
(M1450<~-26) at the same redshifts. The LyC escape fraction of our faint AGNs does not show any dependence
on the absolute luminosities or on the observed U-I colors. Assuming that the LyC escape fraction
remains close to ~75% down to M1450~-18, we find that the AGN population can provide between 16 and
73% (depending on the adopted luminosity function) of the whole ionizing UV background at z~4, measured
through the Lyman forest. This contribution increases to 25-100% if other determinations of the
ionizing UV background are adopted. Extrapolating these results to z~5-7, there are possible indications
that bright QSOs and faint AGNs can provide a significant contribution to the reionization of the
Universe, if their space density is high at M1450~-23.
