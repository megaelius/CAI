Context: The protostellar envelopes, outflow and large-scale chemistry of Class~0 and Class~I
objects have been well-studied, but while previous works have hinted at or found a few Keplerian
disks at the Class~0 stage, it remains to be seen if their presence in this early stage is the norm.
Likewise, while complex organics have been detected toward some Class~0 objects, their distribution
is unknown as they could reside in the hottest parts of the envelope, in the emerging disk itself or
in other components of the protostellar system, such as shocked regions related to outflows. Aims:
In this work, we aim to address two related issues regarding protostars: when rotationally supported
disks form around deeply embedded protostars and where complex organic molecules reside in such
objects. Methods: We observed the deeply embedded protostar, L483, using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) Band~7 data from Cycles~1 and 3 with a high angular resolution down to $\sim$~0.1$^{\prime\prime}$
(20~au) scales. Results: We find that the kinematics of CS~$J=7$--$6$ and H$^{13}$CN~$J=4$--$3$
are best fitted by the velocity profile from infall under conservation of angular momentum and not
by a Keplerian profile. The spatial extents of the observed complex organics are consistent with
an estimated ice sublimation radius of the envelope at $\sim$~50~au, suggesting that the complex
organics exist in the hot corino of L483. Conclusions: We find that L483 does not harbor a Keplerian
disk down to at least $15$~au in radius. Instead, the innermost regions of L483 are undergoing a rotating
collapse. This result highlights that some Class~0 objects contain only very small disks, or none
at all, with the complex organic chemistry taking place on scales inside the hot corino of the envelope,
in a region larger than the emerging disk.
