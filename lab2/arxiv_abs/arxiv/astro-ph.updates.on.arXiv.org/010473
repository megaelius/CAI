We investigate the stellar and dust properties of massive (log$(M_*/M_\odot) \ge 10.5$) and dusty
($A_V \ge 1$) galaxies at $1 \le z \le 4$ by modeling their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) obtained
from the combination of UltraVISTA DR3 photometry and \textit{Herschel} PACS-SPIRE data using
MAGPHYS. Although the rest-frame U-V vs V-J (UVJ) diagram traces well the star-formation rates
(SFR) and dust obscuration (A$_V$) out to $z \sim 3$, $\sim$15-20\% of the sample surprisingly resides
in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while $\sim50$\% at $3<z<4$ fall in the unobscured star-forming
region. The median SED of massive dusty galaxies exhibits weaker MIR and UV emission, and redder
UV slopes with increasing cosmic time. The IR emission for our sample has a significant contribution
($>20\%$) from dust heated by evolved stellar populations rather than star formation, demonstrating
the need for panchromatic SED modeling. The local relation between dust mass and SFR is followed
only by a sub-sample with cooler dust temperatures, while warmer objects have reduced dust masses
at a given SFR. Most star-forming galaxies in our sample do not follow local IRX-$\beta$ relations,
though IRX does strongly correlate with A$_V$. Our sample follows local relations, albeit with
large scatter, between ISM diagnostics and sSFR. We show that FIR-detected sources represent the
extreme of a continuous population of dusty galaxies rather than a fundamentally different population.
Finally, using commonly adopted relations to derive SFRs from the combination of the rest-frame
UV and the observed 24$\mu$m is found to overestimate the SFR by a factor of 3-5 for the galaxies in
our sample.
