Our Galactic Center contains young stars, including the few million year old clockwise disk of O
and B stars between 0.05 pc to 0.5 pc from the Galactic Center, and the S--star cluster of early B--type
stars at a galactocentric distance of ~0.01 pc. Recent observations suggest the S--stars are remnants
of tidally disrupted binaries from the clockwise disk. In particular, Koposov et al. 2020 recently
discovered a hypervelocity star that was ejected from the Galactic Center five million years ago
with a velocity vector that is consistent with this disk. We perform a detailed study of this scenario.
First, we quantify the plausible range of binary semi--major axes in the clockwise disk. We find
that the dynamical evaporation of such binaries is dominated by other disk stars rather than more
numerous old, isotropic stellar population. For the expected range of binary semi--major axes
in the clockwise disk, binary tidal disruptions (also known as the Hills mechanism) can reproduce
the observed S--star semi--major axis distribution. Reproducing the observed thermal eccentricity
distribution of the S--stars requires an additional relaxation process. The flight time of the
recently discovered hypervelocity star from the Galactic Center and the most recent constraints
on the S--stars' ages both suggest this process has to be effective within ten million years. We consider
three possibilities: (i) scalar resonant relaxation from the surrounding isotropic star cluster
(ii) torques from the clockwise disk, and (iii) an intermediate mass black hole. We conclude that
only the latter would be fast enough to reproduce the observed S--star eccentricity distribution.
Finally, we show that the primary star from an unequal mass binary would be deposited at larger semi--major
axes than the secondary, possibly explaining the dearth of O stars among the S--stars.
