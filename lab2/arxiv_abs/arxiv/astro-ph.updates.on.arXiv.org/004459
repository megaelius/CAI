We update the capabilities of the software instrument Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
(MESA) and enhance its ease of use and availability. Our new approach to locating convective boundaries
is consistent with the physics of convection, and yields reliable values of the convective core
mass during both hydrogen and helium burning phases. Stars with $M<8\,{\rm M_\odot}$ become white
dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled,
a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent
heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are
extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves
energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the
effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version
of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernovae
properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernova,
pulsational pair-instability supernova, and the formation of stellar mass black holes. The applicability
of MESA is now widened by the capability of importing multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models into
MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling floating point exceptions and stellar
model optimization, and four new software tools -- MESAWeb, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and mesastar.org
-- to enhance MESA's education and research impact.
