The full-sky Planck polarization data at 850um revealed unexpected properties of the E and B mode
power spectra of dust emission in the interstellar medium (ISM). The positive cross-correlation
between the total dust intensity, T, with the B modes has raised new questions about the physical
mechanisms that affect dust polarization, such as the Galactic magnetic-field structure. This
is key both to better understanding ISM dynamics and to accurately describing Galactic foregrounds
to the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). In this theoretical paper we investigate
the possibility that the observed cross-correlations in the dust polarization power spectra,
and specifically between T and B, can be related to a parity-odd quantity in the ISM such as the magnetic
helicity. We produce synthetic dust polarization data, derived from 3D analytical toy models of
density structures and helical magnetic fields, to compare with the E and B modes of observations.
Focusing on the observed T-B correlation, we propose a new line of interpretation of the Planck observations
based on a large-scale helical component of the Galactic magnetic field in the solar neighborhood.
Our analysis shows that: I) the sign of magnetic helicity does not affect E and B modes for isotropic
magnetic-field configurations; II) helical magnetic fields threading interstellar filaments
cannot reproduce the Planck results; III) a weak helical left-handed magnetic field structure
in the solar neighborhood may explain the T-B correlation seen in the Planck data. This work suggests
a new perspective for the interpretation of the dust polarization power spectra, which strongly
supports the imprint of a large-scale structure of the Galactic magnetic field in the solar neighborhood.
