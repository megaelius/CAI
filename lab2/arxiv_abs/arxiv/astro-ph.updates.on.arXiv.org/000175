The Kepler satellite mission delivers single band-pass light curves of a huge number of stars observed
in the Cygnus-Lyra region opening a new window for asteroseismology. In order to accomplish one
of the preconditions for the asteroseismic modelling of the stars, we aim to derive fundamental
parameters and individual abundances for a sample of 18 Gamma Dor (GD)/Delta Sct (DSct) and 8 SPB/beta
Cep candidate stars in the Kepler satellite field of view. We use the spectral synthesis method to
model newly obtained, high-resolution spectra of 26 stars in order to derive their fundamental
parameters and individual abundances. The stars are then placed into the log(Teff)-log(g) diagram
and the obtained spectroscopic classification is compared to the existing photometric one. For
hot stars, the KIC temperatures appear to be systematically underestimated, in agreement with
previous findings. We also find that the temperatures derived from our spectra agree reasonably
well with those derived from the SED fitting. According to their position in the log(Teff)-log(g)
diagram, two stars are expected GD stars, four stars are expected DSct stars, and four stars are possibly
DSct stars at the blue edge of the instability strip. Two stars are confirmed SPB variables, and one
star falls into the SPB instability region but its parameters might be biased by binarity. Two of
the four stars that fall into the DSct instability region show GD-type oscillation in their light
curves implying that GD-like oscillations are much more common among the DSct stars than is theoretically
expected. Moreover, one of the stars located at the hot border of the DSct instability strip is classified
as DSct-GD hybrid pulsator from its light curve analysis. Given that these findings are fully consistent
with recent investigations, we conclude that a revision of the GD and DSct instability strips is
essential.
