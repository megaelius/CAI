I present the discovery of the first wide M + L extreme subdwarf binary system Gaia J0452$-$36AB.
The binary is located at a distance of 137.27$^{+0.68}_{-0.67}$ pc with a projected separation
of 15828$\pm$78 au. I classified Gaia J0452$-$36AB as esdM1 and esdL0 subdwarfs, respectively.
Gaia J0452$-$36AB have typical halo kinematics, metallicity of [Fe/H] $\approx -1.4$, and temperature
of $\sim$ 3550 and 2600 K, respectively. Gaia J0452$-$36AB is a pair of very low-mass stars with masses
of 0.151$^{+0.029}_{-0.019}$ and 0.0855$^{+0.0014}_{-0.0010}$ M$_{\odot}$, and is a gravitationally
bound system. I tested the metallicity consistency of existing M subdwarf classification schemes
with Gaia J0452$-$36AB and a sample of M and L subdwarfs with known metallicity. I found that the metallicity
of each M subclass defined by the the metallicity index $\zeta_{\rm CaH/TiO}$ is not consistent
from mid to late M subtypes. Because late-type M and L subdwarfs have dusty atmospheres and high surface
gravity which have significant impacts on CaH and TiO indices that used in the classification. The
metallicity scale of late-type M subdwarfs would be overestimated by the $\zeta_{\rm CaH/TiO}$
index. I discussed the mass range of M subdwarfs, and explained the lack of late-type M extreme and
ultra subdwarfs, and decreasing binary fraction from sdM, to esdM, and usdM subclasses. The four
M subclasses have different mass ranges. The comparison between M subclasses is between populations
in different mass ranges. I also present the discovery of Ruiz 440-469B, an M8 dwarf wide companion
to a cool DA white dwarf, Ruiz 440-469.
