We present the global structure of magnetized advective accretion flow around the rotating black
holes in presence of dissipation. By considering accretion flow to be threaded by toroidal magnetic
fields and by assuming synchrotron radiative mechanism to be the dominant cooling process, we obtain
global transonic accretion solutions in terms of dissipation parameters, such as viscosity ($\alpha_B$),
accretion rate (${\dot m}$) and plasma-$\beta$, respectively. In the rotating magnetized accretion
flow, centrifugal barrier is developed in the nearby region of the black hole that triggers the discontinuous
shock transition in the flow variables. Evidently, the shock properties and the dynamics of the
post-shock flow (hereafter post-shock corona (PSC)) are being governed by the flow parameters.
We study the role of dissipation parameters in the formation of standing shock wave and find that
global shocked accretion solutions exist both in gas pressure dominated flows and in magnetic pressure
dominated flows. In addition, we observe that standing shock continues to form around the rapidly
rotating black holes as well. We identify the range of dissipation parameters that permits shocked
accretion solutions and find that standing shocks continue to form even in presence of high dissipation
limit, although the likelihood of shock formation diminishes with the increase of dissipation.
Further, we compute the critical accretion rate (${\dot m}^{\rm cri}$) that admits shock and observe
that standing shock exists in a magnetically dominated accretion flow when the accretion rate lies
in general in the sub-Eddington domain. At the end, we calculate the maximum dissipated energy that
may be escaped from the PSC and indicate its possible implication in the astrophysical context.
