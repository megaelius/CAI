In addition to their jet-like dynamic behaviour, spicules usually exhibit strong transverse speeds,
multi-stranded structure and heating from chromospheric to transition region temperatures.
In this work we first analyse \textit{Hinode} \& \textit{IRIS} observations of spicules and find
different behaviours in terms of their Doppler velocity evolution and collective motion of their
sub-structure. Some have a Doppler shift sign change that is rather fixed along the spicule axis,
and lack coherence in the oscillatory motion of strand-like structure, matching rotation models
or long wavelength torsional Alfv\'en waves. Others exhibit a Doppler shift sign change at maximum
displacement and coherent motion of their strands, suggesting a collective MHD wave. By comparing
with an idealised 3-D MHD simulation combined with radiative transfer modelling, we analyse the
role of transverse MHD waves and associated instabilities in spicule-like features. We find that
Transverse Wave Induced Kelvin-Helmholtz (TWIKH) rolls lead to coherence of strand-like structure
in imaging and spectral maps, as seen in some observations. The rapid transverse dynamics and the
density and temperature gradients at the spicule boundary lead to ring-shaped \ion{Mg}{2} k and
\ion{Ca}{2} H source functions in the transverse cross-section, potentially allowing IRIS to
capture the KHI dynamics. Twists and currents propagate along the spicule at Alfv\'enic speeds,
and the temperature variations within TWIKH rolls produce sudden appearance / disappearance of
strands seen in Doppler velocity and in \ion{Ca}{2} H intensity. However, only a mild intensity
increase in higher temperature lines is obtained, suggesting there is an additional heating mechanism
at work in spicules.
