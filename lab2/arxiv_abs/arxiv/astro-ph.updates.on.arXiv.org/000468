In the strong lensing regime non-parametric lens models struggle to achieve sufficient angular
resolution for a meaningful derivation of the central cluster mass distribution. The problem lies
mainly with cluster members which perturb lensed images and generate additional images, requiring
high resolution modeling, even though we mainly wish to understand the relatively smooth cluster
component. The required resolution is not achievable because the separation between lensed images
is several times larger than the deflection angles by member galaxies, even for the deepest data.
Here we bypass this limitation by incorporating a simple physical prior for member galaxies, using
their observed positions and their luminosity scaled masses. This galaxy contribution is added
to a relatively coarse Gaussian pixel grid for modeling the cluster mass distribution, extending
our established WSLAP code (Diego et al. 2007). We test this new code with a simulation based on A1689,
using the pixels belonging to multiply-lensed images and the observed member galaxies. Dealing
with the cluster members this way leads to convergent solutions, without resorting to regularization,
reproducing well the input cluster and substructures. We highlight the ability of this method to
recover dark sub-components of the cluster, unrelated to member galaxies. Such anomalies can provide
clues to the nature of invisible dark matter, but are hard to discover using parametrized models
where substructures are defined by the visible data. With our increased resolution and stability
we show, for the first time, that non-parametric models can be made sufficiently precise to locate
multiply-lensed systems, thereby achieving fully self-consistent solutions without reliance
on input systems from less objective means.
