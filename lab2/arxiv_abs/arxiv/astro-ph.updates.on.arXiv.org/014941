Superthin galaxies are a class of bulgeless, low surface brightness galaxies with strikingly high
values of planar-to-vertical axes ratio $\rm(b/a> 10 - 20)$, possibly indicating the presence
of an ultra-cold stellar disc. Using a multi-component galactic disc model of gravitationally-coupled
stars and gas in the force field of the dark matter halo, we determine the vertical velocity dispersion
of stars as a function of galacto-centric radius for five superthin galaxies (UGC 7321, IC 5249,
FGC 1540, IC2233, UGC711) using observed stellar and atomic hydrogen (HI) scale heights as constraints,
using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method. We find that the central vertical velocity dispersion for
the stellar disc in the optical band varies between $\sigma_{0s}$ $\sim$ $10.2 - 18.4$ $\rm{kms}^{-1}$
and falls off with an exponential scale length ${\alpha}_s$ = $2.6$ to $3.2$ in units of $R_{d}$ where
$R_{d}$ is the exponential stellar disc scale length. In the 3.6 $\mu$m band, the same, averaged
over the 2 components of the stellar disc, varies between $5.9$ to $11.8$ $\rm{kms}^{-1}$, both
of which confirm the presence of "ultra-cold" stellar discs in superthins. Further, our multi-component
model results are consistent with those obtained by calculating the moments of the stellar distribution
function in the external potential due to all the disc components and the dark matter halo implemented
using the stellar dynamical code AGAMA (Action-based Galaxy Modelling Architecture) . Our calculated
values of the multi-component disc stability parameter lies between $1.7 - 5.7$, mostly confirming
the dynamical stability of the superthin galactic discs inspite of being ultra-cold.
