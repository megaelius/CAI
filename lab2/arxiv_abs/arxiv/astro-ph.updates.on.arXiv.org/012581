The thermal history of cosmic gas in the Dark Ages remains largely unknown. It is important to quantify
the impact of relevant physics on the IGM temperature between $z=10$ and $z \sim 30$, in order to interpret
recent and oncoming observations, including results reported by EDGES. We revisit the gas heating
due to structure formation shocks in this era, using a set of fixed grid cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations performed by three different codes. In all our simulations, the cosmic gas is predicted
to be in multiphase state since $z>30$. The gas surrounding high density peaks gradually develops
a relation more sharp than $T \propto \rho^{2/3}$, approximately $T \propto \rho^{2}$, from $z=30$
to $z=11$, might due to shock heating. Meanwhile, the gas in void region tends to have a large local
mach number, and their thermal state varies significantly from code to code. In the redshift range
$11-20$, the mass fraction of gas shock heated above the CMB temperature in our simulations is larger
than previous semi-analytical results by a factor of 2 to 8. At $z=15$, the fraction varies from $\sim
19\%$ to $52 \%$ among different codes. Between $z=11$ and $z=20$, the gas temperature $<1/T_{\rm{K}}>_M^{-1}$
is predicted to be $\sim 10-20$ K by two codes, much higher than the adiabatic cooling model and some
previous works. However, in our simulations performed by RAMSES, $<1/T_{\rm{K}}>_M^{-1}$ is
predicted to be even below the temperature required to explain result of the EDGES. Given the fact
that different codes give different predictions, currently, it seems a challenge to make solid
prediction on the temperature of gas at $z \sim 17$ in simulations.
