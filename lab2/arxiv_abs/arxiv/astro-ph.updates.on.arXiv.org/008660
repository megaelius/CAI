Pebble accretion has become a popular component to core accretion models of planet formation, and
is especially relevant to the formation of compact, resonant terrestrial planetary systems. Pebbles
initially form in the inner protoplanetary disc, sweeping outwards in a radially expanding front,
potentially forming planetesimals and planetary cores via migration and the streaming instability.
This pebble front appears at early times, in what is typically assumed to be a low mass disc. We argue
this picture is in conflict with the reality of young circumstellar discs, which are massive and
self-gravitating. We apply standard pebble accretion and streaming instability formulae to self-gravitating
protostellar disc models. Fragments will open a gap in the pebble disc, but they will likely fail
to open a gap in the gas, and continue rapid inward migration. If this does not strongly perturb the
pebble disc, our results show that disc fragments will accrete pebbles efficiently. We find that
in general the pebble-to-gas-density ratio fails to exceed 0.01, suggesting that the streaming
instability will struggle to operate. It may be possible to activate the instability if 10 cm grains
are available, and spiral structures can effectively concentrate them in regions of low gravito-turbulence.
If this occurs, lunar mass cores might be assembled on timescales of a few thousand years, **but this
is likely to be rare, and is far from proven**. In any case, this work highlights the need for study
of how self-gravitating protostellar discs define the distribution and properties of solid bodies,
for future planet formation by core accretion.
