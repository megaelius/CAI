Luminous high-redshift QSOs are thought to exist within the most massive dark matter haloes in the
young Universe. As a consequence they are likely to be markers for biased, over-dense regions where
early galaxies cluster, regions that eventually grow into the groups and clusters seen in the lower
redshift universe. In this paper we explore the clustering of galaxies around z ~ 5 QSOs as traced
by Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We target the fields of three QSOs using the same optical imaging
and spectroscopy techniques used in the ESO Remote Galaxy Survey (ERGS, Douglas et al. 2009, 2010),
which was successful in identifying individual clustered structures of LBGs. We use the statistics
of the redshift clustering in ERGS to show that two of the three fields show significant clustering
of LBGs at the QSO redshifts. Neither of these fields is obviously over-dense in LBGs from the imaging
alone; a possible reason why previous imaging-only studies of high-redshift QSO environments
have given ambiguous results. This result shows that luminous QSOs at z ~ 5 are typically found in
over-dense regions. The richest QSO field contains at least nine spectroscopically confirmed
objects at the same redshift including the QSO itself, seven LBGs and a second fainter QSO. While
this is a very strong observational signal of clustering at z ~ 5, it is of similar strength to that
seen in two structures identified in the 'blank sky' ERGS fields. This indicates that, while over-dense,
the QSO environments are not more extreme than other structures that can be identified at these redshifts.
The three richest structures discovered in this work and in ERGS have properties consistent with
that expected for proto-clusters and likely represent the early stages in the build-up of massive
current-day groups and clusters.
