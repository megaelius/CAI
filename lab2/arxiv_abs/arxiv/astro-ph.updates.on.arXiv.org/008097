We present a new catalog of high-redshift candidate Herschel sources. Our sample is obtained after
applying a multifrequency filtering method (matched multifilter), which is designed to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of faint extragalactic point sources. The method is tested against
already-detected sources from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS)
and used to search for new high-redshift candidates. The multifilter technique produces also an
estimation of the photometric redshift of the sources. When compared with a sample of sources with
known spectroscopic redshift, the photometric redshift returned from the multifilter is unbiased
in the redshift range 0.8 < z < 4.3. Using simulated data we reproduce the same unbiased result in roughly
the same redshift range and determined the error (and bias above $z\approx4$) in the photometric
redshifts. Based on the multifilter technique, and a selection based on color, flux, and agreement
of fit between the observed photometry and assumed SED, we find 370 robust candidates to be relatively
bright high-redshift sources. A second sample with 237 objects focuses on the faint end at high-redshift.
These 237 sources were previously near the H-ATLAS detection limit but are now confirmed with our
technique as high significance detections. Finally, we look for possible lensed Herschel sources
by cross-correlating the first sample of 370 objects with two different catalogs of known low-redshift
objects, the redMaPPer Galaxy Cluster Catalog and a catalog of galaxies with spectroscopic redshift
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14. Our search renders a number of candidates to be
lensed systems from the SDSS cross-correlation but none from the redMaPPeR confirming the more
likely galactic nature of the lenses.
