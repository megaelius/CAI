has been shown that galactic potentials can be kinematically linked to the observed red/blue shifts
of the corresponding galactic rotation curves under a minimal set of assumptions: the emitted photons
come from stable timelike circular geodesic orbits of stars in a static spherically symmetric gravitational
field, and propagate to us along null geodesics. It is remarkable that this relation can be established
without appealing at all to a concrete theory of gravitational interaction. Here we generalize
this kinematical spherically symmetric approach to the galactic rotation curves problem to the
stationary axisymmetric realm since this is precisely the symmetry that spiral galaxies possess.
Thus, by making use of the most general stationary axisymmetric metric, we also consider stable
circular orbits of stars that emit signals which travel to a distant observer along null geodesics
and express the galactic red/blue shifts in terms of three arbitrary metric functions, clarifying
the contribution of the rotation as well as the dragging of the gravitational field. This stationary
axisymmetric approach distinguishes between red and blue shifts emitted by circularly orbiting
receding and approaching stars, respectively, even when they are considered with respect to the
center of a spiral galaxy, indicating the need of precise measurements in order to confront predictions
with observations. We also point out the difficulties one encounters in the attempt of determining
the metric functions from observations and list some possible strategies to overcome them.
