We study properties of gravitational waves (GWs) from rotating core-collapse of a 15M_odot star
by performing three-dimensional general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations with an approximate
neutrino transport. By parametrically changing the precollapse angular momentum, we focus on
the effects of rotation on the GW signatures in the early postbounce evolution. Regarding three-flavor
neutrino transport, we solve the energy-averaged set of radiation energy and momentum based on
the Thorne's momentum formalism. In addition to the gravitational quadrupole radiation from matter
motions, we take into account GWs from anisotropic neutrino emission. With these computations,
our results present several supporting evidences for the previous anticipation that non-axisymmetric
instabilities play an essential role in determining the postbounce GW signatures. During prompt
convection, we find that the waveforms show narrow-band and highly quasi-periodic signals which
persist until the end of simulations. We point out that such feature reflects the growth of the one-armed
spiral modes. The typical frequency of the quasi-periodic waveforms can be well explained by the
propagating acoustic waves between the stalled shock and the rotating proto-neutron star surface,
which suggests the appearance of the standing-accretion-shock instability. Although the GW signals
exhibit strong variability between the two polarizations and different observer directions,
they are within the detection limits of next generation detectors such as by KAGRA and Advanced LIGO,
if the source with sufficient angular momentum is located in our Galaxy.
