The accretion history of protostars remains widely mysterious even though it represents one of
the best ways to understand the protostellar collapse that leads to the formation of stars. Molecular
outflows are here used to characterize the protostellar accretion phase in W43-MM1. The W43-MM1
protocluster host a sufficient number of protostars to statistically investigate molecular outflows
in a single, homogeneous region. We used the CO(2-1) and SiO(5-4) line datacubes, taken as part of
an ALMA mosaic with a 2000 AU resolution, to search for protostellar outflows, evaluate the influence
that the environment has on these outflows' characteristics and put constraints on outflow variability
in W43-MM1. We discovered a rich cluster of 46 outflow lobes, driven by 27 protostars with masses
of 1-100 Msun. The complex environment inside which these outflow lobes develop has a definite influence
on their length, limiting the validity of using outflows' dynamical timescales as a proxy of the
ejection timescale in clouds with high dynamics and varying conditions. We performed a detailed
study of Position-Velocity (PV) diagrams of outflows that revealed clear events of episodic ejection.
The time variability of W43-MM1 outflows is a general trend and is more generally observed than in
nearby, low- to intermediate-mass star-forming regions. The typical timescale found between
two ejecta, about 500 yr, is consistent with that found in nearby protostars. If ejection episodicity
reflects variability in the accretion process, either protostellar accretion is more variable
or episodicity is easier to detect in high-mass star-forming regions than in nearby clouds. The
timescale found between accretion events could be resulting from disk instabilities, associated
with bursts of inflowing gas arising from the dynamical environment of high-mass star-forming
cores.
