[Abridged.] It is conceivable that no single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all forms
and levels of non-Gaussianity that may be present in observed CMB data. In recent works a statistical
procedure based upon the calculation of the skewness and kurtosis of the patches of CMB sky-sphere
has been proposed and used to find out significant large-angle deviation from Gaussianity in the
foreground-reduced WMAP maps. Here we address the question as to how the analysis of Gaussianity
of WMAP maps is modified if the foreground-cleaned Planck maps are used, therefore extending and
complementing the previous analyses in several regards. We carry out a new analysis of Gaussianity
with the available nearly full-sky foreground-cleaned Planck maps. As the foregrounds are cleaned
through different component separation procedures, each of the resulting Planck maps is then tested
for Gaussianity. We determine quantitatively the effects for Gaussianity of masking the foreground-cleaned
Planck maps with the INPMASK, VALMASK, and U73 Planck masks. We show that although the foreground-cleaned
Planck maps present significant deviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when the less
severe INPMASK and VALMASK are used, they become consistent with Gaussianity as detected by our
indicator $S$ when masked with the union U73 mask. A slightly smaller consistency with Gaussianity
is found when the $K$ indicator is employed, which seems to be associated with large-angle anomalies
reported by the Planck team. Finally, we examine the robustness of the Gaussianity analyses with
respect to the noise pixel's as given by the Planck team, and show that no appreciable changes arise
when is incorporated into the maps. The results of our analyses provide important information about
the suitability of the foreground-cleaned Planck maps as Gaussian reconstructions of the CMB sky.
