As part of the QUADROS project to quantify the impact of AGN-driven outflows in rapidly evolving
galaxies in the local universe, we present observations of 8 nearby ULIRGs ($0.04 < z < 0.2$) taken
with the ISIS spectrograph on the \textit{William Herschel Telescope} (WHT), and also summarise
the results of the project as a whole. Consistent with \cite{Rose2018}, we find that the outflow
regions are compact (0.08 < $R_{[OIII]}$ < 1.5 kpc), and the electron densities measured using the
[SII], [OII] trans-auroral emission-line ratios are relatively high (2.5 < log n$_{e}$(cm$^{-3}$)
< 4.5, median log n$_{e}$(cm$^{-3})\sim 3.1$). Many of the outflow regions are also significantly
reddened (median E(B-V) $\sim$ 0.5). Assuming that the de-projected outflow velocities are represented
by the 5$\rm^{th}$ percentile velocities ($v_{05}$) of the broad, blueshifted components of [OIII]$\lambda$5007,
we calculate relatively modest mass outflow rates ($0.1 < \dot{M} < 20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
median $\dot{M}$ $\sim$ 2 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$), and find kinetic powers as a fraction of the AGN
bolometric luminosity ($\dot{F} = \dot{E}/L_{bol}$) in the range 0.02 < $\dot{F}$ < 3 \%, median
$\dot{F}$ $\sim$ 0.3 \%). The latter estimates are in line with the predictions of multi-stage outflow
models, or single-stage models in which only a modest fraction of the initial kinetic power of the
inner disk winds is transferred to the larger-scale outflows. Considering the QUADROS sample as
a whole, we find no clear evidence for correlations between the properties of the outflows and the
bolometric luminosities of the AGN, albeit based on a sample that covers a relatively small range
in $L_{bol}$. Overall, our results suggest that there is a significant intrinsic scatter in outflow
properties of ULIRGs for a given AGN luminosity.
