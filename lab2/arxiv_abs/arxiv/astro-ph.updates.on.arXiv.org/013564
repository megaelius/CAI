We present observations from the short-term intensive optical campaign (from Sep2019 to Jan2020)
of the changing-look Seyfert NGC 3516. This active galactic nucleus is known to have strong optical
variability and has changed its type in the past. It has been in the low-activity state in the optical
since 2013, with some rebrightening from the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2016, after which it remained
dormant. We aim to study the photometric and spectral variability of NGC 3516 from the new observations
in U- and B-bands and examine the profiles of the optical broad emission lines in order to demonstrate
that this object may be entering a new state of activity. NGC 3516 has been monitored intensively
for the past 4 months with an automated telescope in U and B filters, enabling accurate photometry
of 0.01 precision. Spectral observations were triggered when an increase in brightness was spotted.
We support our analysis of past-episodes of violent variability with the UV and X-ray long-term
light curves constructed from the archival Swift data. An increase of the photometric magnitude
is seen in both U and B filters to a maximum amplitude of 0.25mag and 0.1 mag, respectively. During
the flare, we observe stronger forbidden high-ionization iron lines than reported before, as well
as the complex broad Ha and Hb lines. This is especially seen in Ha which appears to be double-peaked.
It seems that a very broad component of ~10,000 km/s in width in the Balmer lines is appearing. The
trends in the optical, UV, and X-ray light curves are similar, with the amplitudes of variability
being significantly larger in the case of UV and X-ray bands. The increase of the continuum emission,
the variability of the coronal lines, and the very broad component in the Balmer lines may indicate
that the AGN of NGC 3516 is finally leaving the low-activity state in which it has been for the last
~3 years.
