The distance of NGC1316, the brightest galaxy in Fornax, is an interesting test for the cosmological
distance scale. First, because Fornax is the 2nd largest cluster of galaxies at <~25 Mpc after
Virgo and, in contrast to Virgo, has a small line-of-sight depth; and second, because NGC1316 is
the galaxy with the largest number of detected SNeIa, giving the opportunity to test the consistency
of SNeIa distances internally and against other indicators. We measure SBF mags in NGC1316 from
ground and space-based imaging data, providing a homogeneous set of measurements over a wide wavelength
interval. The SBF, coupled with empirical and theoretical calibrations, are used to estimate the
distance to the galaxy. We present the first B-band SBF measurements of NGC1316 and use them together
with the optical and near-IR SBF data to analyze the properties of field stars. Our distance modulus
m-M=31.59 +-0.05(stat) +-0.14(sys), when placed in a consistent Cepheid distance scale, agrees
with the results from other indicators. However, our result is ~17% larger than the most recent estimate
based on SNeIa. Possible explanations for this disagreement are the uncertainties on internal
extinction, or calibration issues. Concerning the stellar population analysis, we confirm earlier
results from other indicators: the field stars in NGC1316 are dominated by a solar metallicity,
intermediate age component. A substantial mismatch exists between B-band SBF models and data,
a behavior that can be accounted for by an enhanced percentage of hot horizontal branch stars. Our
study of the SBF distance to NGC1316, and the comparison with distances from other indicators, raises
some concern about the homogeneity between the calibrations of different indicators. If not properly
placed in the same reference scale, significant differences can occur, with dramatic impact on
the cosmological distance ladder.
