We present a revision to the visual orbit of the young, directly-imaged exoplanet 51 Eridani b using
four years of observations with the Gemini Planet Imager. The relative astrometry is consistent
with an eccentric ($e=0.53_{-0.13}^{+0.09}$) orbit at an intermediate inclination ($i=136_{-11}^{+10}$\,deg),
although circular orbits cannot be excluded due to the complex shape of the multidimensional posterior
distribution. We find a semi-major axis of $11.1_{-1.3}^{+4.2}$\,au and a period of $28.1_{-4.9}^{+17.2}$\,yr,
assuming a mass of 1.75\,M$_{\odot}$ for the host star. We find consistent values with a recent analysis
of VLT/SPHERE data covering a similar baseline. We investigated the potential of using absolute
astrometry of the host star to obtain a dynamical mass constraint for the planet. The astrometric
acceleration of 51~Eri derived from a comparison of the {\it Hipparcos} and {\it Gaia} catalogues
was found to be inconsistent at the 2--3$\sigma$ level with the predicted reflex motion induced
by the orbiting planet. Potential sources of this inconsistency include a combination of random
and systematic errors between the two astrometric catalogs or the signature of an additional companion
within the system interior to current detection limits. We also explored the potential of using
{\it Gaia} astrometry alone for a dynamical mass measurement of the planet by simulating {\it Gaia}
measurements of the motion of the photocenter of the system over the course of the extended eight-year
mission. We find that such a measurement is only possible ($>98$\% probability) given the most optimistic
predictions for the {\it Gaia} scan astrometric uncertainties for bright stars, and a high mass
for the planet ($\gtrsim3.6$\,M$_{\rm Jup}$).
