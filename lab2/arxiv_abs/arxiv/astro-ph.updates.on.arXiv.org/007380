The growing wealth of cosmological observations places increasingly more stringent constraints
on dark energy and alternative gravity models. Particularly successful in efficiently probing
the vast model space has been the effective field theory of dark energy and modified gravity, providing
a unified framework for generalised cosmological predictions. However, the optimal parametrisation
of the free time-dependent functions inherent to the formalism is still unresolved. It should respect
a multitude of requirements, ranging from simplicity, generality, and representativity of known
theories to computational efficiency. But in particular, for theoretical soundness, the parameter
space should adhere to strict stability requirements. We have recently proposed an inherently
stable effective field theory with physical basis of Planck mass evolution, sound speed of the scalar
field fluctuation, kinetic coefficient, and background expansion, which covers Horndeski models
with luminal speed of gravity. Here we devise a parametrisation of these basis functions that can
straightforwardly be configured to evade theoretical pathologies such as ghost or gradient instabilities
or to accommodate further theoretical priors such as (sub)luminal scalar sound speed. The parametrisation
is simple yet general, conveniently represents a broad range of known dark energy and gravitational
theories, and with a simple additional approximation can be rendered numerically highly efficient.
Finally, by operating in our new basis, we show that there are no general limitations from stability
requirements on the current values that can be assumed by the phenomenological modification of
the Poisson equation and the gravitational slip besides the exclusion of anti-gravity. The inherently
stable effective field theory is ready for implementation in parameter estimation analyses employing
linear cosmological observations.
