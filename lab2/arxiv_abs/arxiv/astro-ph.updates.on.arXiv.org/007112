Effective stellar feedback is used in models of galaxy formation to drive realistic galaxy evolution.
Models typically include energy injection from supernovae as the dominant form of stellar feedback,
often in some form of sub-grid recipe. However, it has been recently suggested that pre-SN feedback
(stellar winds or radiation) is necessary in high-resolution simulations of galaxy evolution
to properly regulate star formation and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). Following
these processes is computationally challenging, so many prescriptions model this feedback approximately,
accounting for the local destruction of dense gas clouds around newly formed stars in lieu of a full
radiative transfer calculation. In this work we examine high resolution simulations (1.8~pc)
of an isolated dwarf galaxy with detailed stellar feedback tracked on a star-by-star basis. By following
stellar ionizing radiation with an adaptive ray-tracing radiative transfer method, we test its
importance in regulating star formation and driving outflows in this galaxy. We find that including
ionizing radiation reduces the star formation rate (SFR) by over a factor of 5, and is necessary to
produce the ISM conditions needed for supernovae to drive significant outflows. We find that a localized
approximation for radiation feedback is sufficient to regulate the SFR on short timescales, but
does not allow significant outflows. Short and long range radiation effects are both important
in driving the evolution of our low-metallicity, low-mass dwarf galaxy. Generalizing these results
to more massive galaxies would be a valuable avenue of future research.
