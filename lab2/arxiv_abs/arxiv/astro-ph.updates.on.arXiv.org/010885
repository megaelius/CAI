We investigate the distribution of companion galaxies around quasars using {\em Hubble Space Telescope}
({\em HST}) Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Camera (ACS/WFC) archival images. Our master
sample contains 532 quasars which have been observed by {\em HST} ACS/WFC, spanning a wide range
of luminosity $(-31<M_i(z=2)<-23)$ and redshift ($0.3<z<3$). We search for companions around
the quasars with projected distance of $10\text{ kpc}<d<100\text{ kpc}$. PSF subtraction is performed
to enhance the completeness for close companions. The completeness is estimated to be high $(>90\%)$
even for the faintest companions of interest. The number of physical companions is estimated by
subtracting a background density from the number density of projected companions. We divide all
the companions into three groups (faint, intermediate and bright) according to their fluxes. A
control sample of galaxies is constructed to have similar redshift distribution and stellar mass
range as the quasar sample using the data from {\em HST} deep fields. We find that quasars and control
sample galaxies have similar numbers of faint and bright companions, while quasars show a $3.7\sigma$
deficit of intermediate companions compared to galaxies. The numbers of companions in all three
groups do not show strong evolution with redshift, and the number of intermediate companions around
quasars decreases with quasar luminosity. Assuming that merger-triggered quasars have entered
the final coalescence stage during which individual companions are no longer detectable at large
separations, our result is consistent with a picture in which a significant fraction of quasars
is triggered by mergers.
