The discovery of rapidly variable Very High Energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emission from
4C +21.35 (PKS 1222+216) by MAGIC on 2010 June 17, triggered by the high activity detected by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) in high energy (HE; E > 100 MeV) gamma-rays, poses intriguing questions
on the location of the gamma-ray emitting region in this flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ). We present
multifrequency data of 4C +21.35 collected from centimeter to VHE during 2010 to investigate the
properties of this source and discuss a possible emission model. The first hint of detection at VHE
was observed by MAGIC on 2010 May 3, soon after a gamma-ray flare detected by Fermi-LAT that peaked
on April 29. The same emission mechanism may therefore be responsible for both the HE and VHE emission
during the 2010 flaring episodes. Two optical peaks were detected on 2010 April 20 and June 30, close
in time but not simultaneous with the two gamma-ray peaks, while no clear connection was observed
between the X-ray an gamma-ray emission. An increasing flux density was observed in radio and mm
bands from the beginning of 2009, in accordance with the increasing gamma-ray activity observed
by Fermi-LAT, and peaking on 2011 January 27 in the mm regime (230 GHz). We model the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of 4C +21.35 for the two periods of the VHE detection and a quiescent state,
using a one-zone model with the emission coming from a very compact region outside the broad line
region. The three SEDs can be fit with a combination of synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton
emission of seed photons from a dust torus, changing only the electron distribution parameters
between the epochs. The fit of the optical/UV part of the spectrum for 2010 April 29 seems to favor
an inner disk radius of <6 gravitational radii, as one would expect from a prograde-rotating
Kerr black hole.
