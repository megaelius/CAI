Several nearby protoplanetary disks have been observed to display large scale crescents in the
(sub)millimeter dust continuum emission. One interpretation is that these structures correspond
to anticyclonic vortices generated by the Rossby wave instability within the gaseous disk. Such
vortices have local gas over-densities and are expected to concentrate dust particles with Stokes
number around unity. This process might catalyze the formation of planetesimals. Whereas recent
observations showed that dust crescent are indeed regions where millimeter-size particles have
abnormally high concentration relative to the gas and smaller grains, no observations have yet
shown that the gas within the crescent region counter-rotates with respect to the protoplanetary
disk. Here we investigate the detectability of anticyclonic features through measurement of the
line-of-sight component of the gas velocity obtained with ALMA. We carry out 2D hydrodynamic simulations
and 3D radiative transfer calculation of a protoplanetary disk characterized by a vortex created
by the tidal interaction with a massive planet. As a case study, the disk parameters are chosen to
mimic the IRS 48 system, which has the most prominent crescent observed to date. We generate synthetic
ALMA observations of both the dust continuum and 12CO emission around the frequency of 345 GHz. We
find that the anticyclonic features of vortex are weak but can be detected if both the source and the
observational setup are properly chosen. We provide a recipe for maximizing the probability to
detect such vortex features and present an analysis procedure to infer their kinematic properties.
