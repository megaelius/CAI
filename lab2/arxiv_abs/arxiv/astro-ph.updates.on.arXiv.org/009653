Two studies utilizing sparse aperture masking (SAM) interferometry and $H_{\rm \alpha}$ differential
imaging have reported multiple jovian companions around the young solar-mass star, LkCa 15 (LkCa
15 bcd): the first claimed direct detection of infant, newly-formed planets ("protoplanets").
We present new near-infrared direct imaging/spectroscopy from the SCExAO system coupled with
the CHARIS integral field spectrograph and multi-epoch thermal infrared imaging from Keck/NIRC2
of LkCa 15 at high Strehl ratios. These data provide the first direct imaging look at the same wavelengths
and in the same locations where previous studies identified the LkCa 15 protoplanets and thus offer
the first decisive test of their existence. The data do not reveal these planets. Instead, we resolve
extended emission tracing a dust disk with a brightness and location comparable to that claimed
for LkCa 15 bcd. Forward-models attributing this signal to orbiting planets are inconsistent with
the combined SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2 data. An inner disk provides a more compelling explanation
for the SAM detections and perhaps also the claimed $H_{\alpha}$ detection of LkCa 15 b. We conclude
that there is currently no clear, direct evidence for multiple protoplanets orbiting LkCa 15, although
the system likely contains at least one unseen jovian companion. To identify jovian companions
around LkCa 15 from future observations, the inner disk should be detected and its effect modeled,
removed, and shown to be distinguishable from planets. Protoplanet candidates identified from
similar systems should likewise be clearly distinguished from disk emission through modeling.
