Context: The anomalously large radii of hot Jupiters has long been a mystery. However, by combining
both theoretical arguments and 2D models, a recent study has suggested that the vertical advection
of potential temperature leads to an adiabatic temperature profile in the deep atmosphere hotter
than the profile obtained with standard 1D models. Aims: In order to confirm the viability of that
scenario, we extend this investigation to three dimensional, time-dependent, models. Methods:
We use a 3D GCM, DYNAMICO to perform a series of calculations designed to explore the formation and
structure of the driving atmospheric circulations, and detail how it responds to changes in both
upper and deep atmospheric forcing. Results: In agreement with the previous, 2D, study, we find
that a hot adiabat is the natural outcome of the long-term evolution of the deep atmosphere. Integration
times of order $1500$ years are needed for that adiabat to emerge from an isothermal atmosphere,
explaining why it has not been found in previous hot Jupiter studies. Models initialised from a hotter
deep atmosphere tend to evolve faster toward the same final state. We also find that the deep adiabat
is stable against low-levels of deep heating and cooling, as long as the Newtonian cooling time-scale
is longer than $\sim 3000$ years at $200$ bar. Conclusions: We conclude that the steady-state vertical
advection of potential temperature by deep atmospheric circulations constitutes a robust mechanism
to explain hot Jupiter inflated radii. We suggest that future studies of hot Jupiters are evolved
for a longer time than currently done, and, when possible, include models initialised with a hot
deep adiabat. We stress that this mechanism stems from the advection of entropy by irradiation induced
mass flows and does not require (finely tuned) dissipative process, in contrast with most previously
suggested scenarios.
