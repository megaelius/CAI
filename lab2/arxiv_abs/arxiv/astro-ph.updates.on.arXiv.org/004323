Radio galaxies are intensively discussed as the sources of cosmic rays observed above about $3\,{\times}\,10^{18}\,\text{eV}$,
called ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We present a first, systematic approach that takes
the individual characteristics of these sources into account, as well as the impact of the extragalactic
magnetic-field structures up to a distance of 120 Mpc. We use a mixed simulation setup, based on 3D
simulations of UHECRs ejected by observed, individual radio galaxies taken out to a distance of
120 Mpc, and on 1D simulations over a continuous source distribution contributing from beyond 120
Mpc. Additionally, we include the ultra-luminous radio galaxy Cygnus A at a distance of about $250\,$Mpc,
as its contribution is so strong that it must be considered as an individual point source. The implementation
of the UHECR ejection in our simulation setup is based on a detailed consideration of the physics
of radio jets and standard first-order Fermi acceleration. We show that the average contribution
of radio galaxies taken over a very large volume cannot explain the observed features of UHECRs measured
at Earth. However, we obtain excellent agreement with the spectrum, composition, and arrival-direction
distribution of UHECRs measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, if we assume that most UHECRs observed
arise from only two sources: The ultra-luminous radio galaxy Cygnus A, providing a mostly light
composition of nuclear species dominating up to about $6\,{\times}\,10^{19}\,$eV, and the nearest
radio galaxy Centaurus A, providing a heavy composition dominating above $6\,{\times}\,10^{19}\,$eV.
Here we have to assume that extragalactic magnetic fields out to 250 Mpc, which we did not include
in the simulation, are able to isotropize the UHECR events arriving from Cygnus A.
