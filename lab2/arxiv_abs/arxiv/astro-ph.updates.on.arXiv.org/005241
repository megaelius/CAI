We study five sequential solar flares (SOL2015-08-07) occurring in Active Region 12396 observed
with the Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the BBSO, complemented by IRIS and SDO observations. The
main flaring region is an arch filament system (AFS) consisting of multiple bundles of dark filament
threads enclosed by semi-circular flare ribbons. We study the magnetic configuration and evolution
of the active region by constructing coronal magnetic field models based on SDO/HMI magnetograms
using two independent methods, i.e., the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation and
the flux rope insertion method. The models consist of multiple flux ropes with mixed signs of helicity,
i.e., positive (negative) in the northern (southern) region, which is consistent with the GST observations
of multiple filament bundles. The footprints of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) derived from the
extrapolated NLFFF compare favorably with the observed flare ribbons. An interesting double-ribbon
fine structure located at the east border of the AFS is consistent with the fine structure of the QSL's
footprint. Moreover, magnetic field lines traced along the semi-circular footprint of a dome-like
QSL surrounding the AFS are connected to the regions of significant helicity and Poynting flux injection.
The maps of magnetic twist show that positive twist became dominant as time progressed, which is
consistent with the injection of positive helicity before the flares. We hence conclude that these
circular shaped flares are caused by 3D magnetic reconnection at the QSLs associated with the AFS
possessing mixed signs of helicity.
