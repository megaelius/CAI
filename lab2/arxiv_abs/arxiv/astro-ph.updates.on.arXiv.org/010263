Galaxy clusters are known to be reservoirs of Cosmic Rays (CRs), as inferred from theoretical calculations
or detection of CR-derived observables. CR acceleration in clusters is mostly attributed to the
dynamical activity that produces shocks. Shocks in clusters emerge out of merger or accretion,
but which one is more effective in producing CRs? at which dynamical phase? and why? To this aim, we
study the production or injection of CRs through shocks and its evolution in the galaxy clusters
using cosmological simulations with the {\sc enzo} code. Particle acceleration model considered
here is primarily the Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of thermal particles, but we also report
a tentative study with pre-existing CRs. Defining appropriate dynamical states using the concept
of virialization, we studied a sample of merging and non-merging clusters. We report that the merger
shocks (with Mach number $\mathcal{M}\sim2-5$) are the most effective CR producers, while high-Mach
peripheral shocks (i.e. $\mathcal{M}>5$) are mainly responsible for the brightest phase of CR
injection in clusters. Clusters once merged, permanently deviate from CR and X-ray mass scaling
of non-merging systems, enabling us to use it as a tool to determine the state of merger. Through a
temporal and spatial evolution study, we found a strong correlation between cluster merger dynamics
and CR injection. We observed that the brightest phase of X-ray and CR injection from clusters occur
respectively at about 1.0 and 1.5 Gyr after every mergers, and CR injection peaks near to the cluster
virial radius (i.e $r_{200}$). Delayed CR injection peaks found in this study deserve further investigation
for possible impact on the evolution of CR-derived observables from galaxy clusters.
