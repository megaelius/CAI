We have conducted nineteen state-of-the-art 3D core-collapse supernova simulations spanning
a broad range of progenitor masses. This is the largest collection of sophisticated 3D supernova
simulations ever performed. We have found that while the majority of these models explode, not all
do, and that even models in the middle of the available progenitor mass range may be less explodable.
This does not mean that those models for which we did not witness explosion would not explode in Nature,
but that they are less prone to explosion than others. One consequence is that the "compactness"
measure is not a metric for explodability. We find that lower-mass massive star progenitors likely
experience lower-energy explosions, while the higher-mass massive stars likely experience higher-energy
explosions. Moreover, most 3D explosions have a dominant dipole morphology, have a pinched, wasp-waist
structure, and experience simultaneous accretion and explosion. We reproduce the general range
of residual neutron-star masses inferred for the galactic neutron-star population. The most massive
progenitor models, however, in particular vis \`a vis explosion energy, need to be continued for
longer physical times to asymptote to their final states. We find that while the majority of the inner
ejecta have Y$_e = 0.5$, there is a substantial proton-rich tail. This result has important implications
for the nucleosynthetic yields as a function of progenitor. Finally, we find that the non-exploding
models eventually evolve into compact inner configurations that experience a quasi-periodic
spiral SASI mode. We otherwise see little evidence of the SASI in the exploding models.
