Context. Gaia DR2 offers unparalleled precision on stars' parallaxes and proper motions. This
allows the prediction of microlensing events for which the lens stars (and any planets they possess)
are nearby and may be well studied and characterised. Aims. We identify a number of potential microlensing
events that will occur before the year 2035.5, 20 years from the Gaia DR2 reference epoch. Methods.
We query Gaia DR2 for potential lenses within 100 pc, extract parallaxes and proper motions of the
lenses and background sources, and identify potential lensing events. We estimate the lens masses
from Priam effective temperatures, and use these to calculate peak magnifications and the size
of the Einstein radii relative to the lens stars' habitable zones. Results. We identify 7 future
events with a probability > 10% of an alignment within one Einstein radius. Of particular interest
is DR2 5918299904067162240 (WISE J175839.20-583931.6), magnitude G = 14.9, which will lens a G
= 13.9 background star in early 2030, with a median 23% net magnification. Other pairs are typically
fainter, hampering characterisation of the lens (if the lens is faint) or the ability to accurately
measure the magnification (if the source is much fainter than the lens). Of timely interest is DR2
4116504399886241792 (2MASS J17392440-2327071), which will lens a background star in July 2020,
albeit with weak net magnification (0.03%). Median magnifications for the other 5 high-probability
events range from 0.3% to 5.3%. The Einstein radii for these lenses are 1-10 times the radius of the
habitable zone, allowing these lensing events to pick out cold planets around the ice line, and filling
a gap between transit and current microlensing detections of planets around very low-mass stars.
Conclusions. We provide a catalogue of the predicted events to aid future characterisation efforts...
