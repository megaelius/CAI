For the study of the gravitational coupling of electromagnetism and the equivalence principle,
we have used the spacetime constitutive tensor density {chi}ijkl, and discovered the nonmetric
(axion) part (A){chi}ijkl (equal to {phi}eijkl) of {chi}ijkl worthy investigation. Since we have
used Lagrangian formalism, {chi}ijkl is effectively symmetric under the interchange of index
pairs, ij and kl, and has 21 independent degrees of freedom. Hehl, Obukhov and Rubilar have started
from charge-flux formalism to study electromagnetism, discovered the antisymmetric part (Sk){chi}ijkl
(15 degrees of freedom) of {chi}ijkl under the interchange of index pairs ij and kl worthy investigation,
and called it skewon field. In this paper, we study the propagation of the Hehl-Obukhov-Rubilar
skewon field in weak gravity field/dilute matter or with weak violation of the Einstein Equivalence
Principle (EEP), and further classify it into Type I and Type II skewons. From the dispersion relation
we show that no dissipation/no amplification condition implies that the additional skewon field
must be of Type II. For Type I skewon field, the dissipation/amplification is proportional to the
frequency and the CMB spectrum would deviate from Planck spectrum. From the high precision agreement
of the CMB spectrum to 2.755 K Planck spectrum, we constrain the Type I cosmic skewon field (SkI){chi}ijkl
to less than a few x 10-35. The skewon part of constitutive tensor constructed from asymmetric metric
is of Type II, hence is allowed. This study may also find applications in macroscopic electrodynamics
in the case of laser pumped medium or dissipative medium.
