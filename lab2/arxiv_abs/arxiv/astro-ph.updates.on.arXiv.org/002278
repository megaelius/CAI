One of the primary objectives for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is to detect a stochastic background
generated by the incoherent superposition of gravitational waves (GWs), in particular from the
cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries. Current stochastic background searches
assume that pulsars in a PTA are separated from each other and the Earth by many GW wavelengths. As
more millisecond pulsars are discovered and added to PTAs, some may be separated by only a few radiation
wavelengths or less, resulting in correlated GW phase changes between close pulsars in the array.
Here we investigate how PTA overlap reduction functions (ORFs), up to quadrupole order, are affected
by these additional correlated phase changes, and how they are in turn affected by relaxing the assumption
that all pulsars are equidistant from the solar system barycenter. We find that in the low frequency
GW background limit of $f\sim10^{-9}$~Hz, and for pulsars at varying distances from the Earth,
that these additional correlations only affect the ORFs by a few percent for pulsar pairs at large
angular separations, as expected. However when nearby (order 100 pc) pulsars are separated by less
than a few degrees, the correlated phase changes can introduce variations of a few tens of percent
in the magnitude of the isotropic ORF, and much larger fractional differences in the anisotropic
ORFs-- up to 188 in the $m=0$, $l=2$ ORF for equidistant pulsars separated by 3 degrees. In fact, the
magnitude of most of the anisotropic ORFs is largest at small, but non-zero, pulsar separations.
Finally, we write down a small angle approximation for the correlated phase changes which can easily
be implemented in search pipelines, and for completeness, examine the behavior of the ORFs for pulsars
which lie at a radiation wavelength from the Earth.
