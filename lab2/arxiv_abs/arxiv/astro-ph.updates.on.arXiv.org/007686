We present new measurements for the nuclear stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\ast}$ within
sub-arcsecond apertures for 28 nearby galaxies. Our data consist of Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) long-slit spectra obtained with the G750M grating centred on the H$\alpha$ spectral range.
We fit the spectra using a library of single stellar population models and Gaussian emission lines,
while constraining in most cases the stellar-population content from an initial fit to G430L STIS
spectra. We illustrate how these $\sigma_{\ast}$ measurements can be useful for constraining
the mass $M_{\bullet}$ of supermassive black holes (SBHs) by concentrating on the cases of the lenticular
galaxies NGC4435 and NGC4459. These are characterized by similar ground-based half-light radii
stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm e}$ values but remarkably different $M_{\bullet}$
as obtained from modelling their central ionised-gas kinematics, where NGC4435 appears to host
a significantly undermassive SBH compared to what is expected from the $M_{\bullet}-\sigma_{\rm
e}$ relation. For both galaxies, we build Jeans axisymmetric dynamical models to match the ground-based
stellar kinematics obtained with SAURON integral-field spectrograph, including a SBH with $M_{\bullet}$
value as predicted by the $M_{\bullet}-\sigma_{\rm e}$ relation and using high-resolution HST
images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys to construct the stellar-mass model. By mimicking
the HST observing conditions we use such reference models to make a prediction for the nuclear $\sigma_{\ast}$
value. Whereas this was found to agree with our nuclear $\sigma_{\ast}$ measurement for NGC4459,
for NGC4435 the observed $\sigma_{\ast}$ is remarkably smaller than the predicted one, which further
suggests that this galaxy could host an undermassive SBH.
