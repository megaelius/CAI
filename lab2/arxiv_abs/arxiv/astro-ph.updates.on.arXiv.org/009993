In various fields of physics and astronomy, access to experimental facilities or to telescopes
is becoming more and more competitive and limited. It becomes therefore important to optimize the
type of measurements and their scheduling to reach a given scientific objective and to increase
the chances of success of a scientific project. In this communication, extending the work of Ford
(2008) and of Loredo et al. (2012), we present an efficient adaptive scheduling tool aimed at prioritzing
measurements in order to reach a scientific goal. The algorithm, based on the Fisher matrix, can
be applied to a wide class of measurements. We present this algorithm in detail and discuss some practicalities
such as systematic errors or measurements losses due to contigencies (such as weather, experimental
failure, ...). As an illustration, we consider measurements of the short-period star S0-2 in our
Galactic Center. We show that the radial velocity measurements at the two turning points of the radial
velocity curve are more powerful for detecting the gravitational redshift than measurements at
the maximal relativistic signal. We also explicitly present the methodology that was used to plan
measurements in order to detect the relativistic redshift considering systematics and possible
measurements losses. For the future, we identify the astrometric turning points to be highly sensitive
to the relativistic advance of the periastron. Finally, we also identify measurements particularly
sensitive to the distance to our Galactic Center: the radial velocities around periastron and the
astrometric measurements just before closest approach and at the maximal right ascension astrometric
turning point.
