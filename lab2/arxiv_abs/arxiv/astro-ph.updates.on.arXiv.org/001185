Recent results of Planck data reveal that the power in the low multipoles of the CMB angular power
spectrum, approximately up to $l=30$, is significantly lower than the theoretically predicted
in the best fit $\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper we investigate the possibility of invoking the
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect to explain this power deficit at low multipoles. The ISW effect
that originates from the late time expansion history of the universe is rich in possibilities given
the limited understanding of the origin of dark energy (DE). It is a common understanding that the
ISW effect adds to the power at the low multipoles of the CMB angular power spectrum. In this paper
we carry out an analytic study to show that there are some expansion histories in which the ISW effect,
instead of adding power, provides negative contribution to the power at low multipoles. Guided
by the analytic study, we present examples of the features required in the late time expansion history
of the universe that could explain the power deficiency through the ISW effect. We also show that
an ISW origin of power deficiency is consistent, at present, with other cosmological observations
that probe the expansion history such as distance modulus, matter power spectrum and the evolution
of cluster number count. We also show that the ISW effect may be distinguished from power deficit
originating from features in the PPS using the measurements of the CMB polarization spectrum at
low multipoles expected from Planck. We conclude that the power at low multipoles of the CMB anisotropy
could well be closely linked to Dark Energy puzzle in cosmology and this observation could be actually
pointing to richer phenomenology of DE beyond the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. (abbreviated)
