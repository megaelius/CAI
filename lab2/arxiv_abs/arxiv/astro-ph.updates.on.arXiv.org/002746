Aims: We re-evaluate the correlation between planetary surface gravity and stellar host activity
as measured by the index log($R'_{HK}$). This correlation, previously identified by Hartman (2010),
is now analyzed in light of an extended measurements dataset, roughly 3 times larger than the original
one. Methods: We calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between the two quantities
and its associated p-value. The correlation coefficient was calculated for both the full dataset
and the star-planet pairs that follow the conditions proposed by Hartman (2010). In order to do so,
we considered effective temperatures both as collected from the literature and from the SWEET-Cat
catalog, which provides a more homogeneous and accurate effective temperature determination.
Results: The analysis delivers significant correlation coefficients, but with a lower value than
those obtained by Hartman (2010). Yet, the two datasets are compatible, and we show that a correlation
coefficient as large as previously published can arise naturally from a small-number statistics
analysis of the current dataset. The correlation is recovered for star-planet pairs selected using
the different conditions proposed by Hartman (2010). Remarkably, the usage of SWEET-Cat temperatures
leads to larger correlation coefficient values. We highlight and discuss the role of the correlation
betwen different parameters such as effective temperature and activity index. Several additional
effects on top of those discussed previously were considered, but none fully explains the detected
correlation. In light of the complex issue discussed here, we encourage the different follow-up
teams to publish their activity index values in the form of log($R'_{HK}$) index so that a comparison
across stars and instruments can be pursued.
