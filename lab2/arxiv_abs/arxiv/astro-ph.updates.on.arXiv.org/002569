We investigate the effectiveness of a blind galaxy cluster survey that will use the OCRA-f (four-pair,
beam-switched) radiometer on the 32-metre radio telescope in Poland to detect the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect (TSZE) at 30~GHz. We also calculate flux-density limits for the associated radio source
survey. The reliability of the surveys is tested using mock maps that include the cosmic microwave
background, TSZEs from from hydrodynamical simulations of large scale structure formation, and
unresolved radio sources. We validate the mock maps against observational data, and examine the
limitations imposed by the assumed physics. Using the Planck-selected cluster candidates and
the NVSS survey we estimate the effects of source clustering towards galaxy clusters and include
appropriate correlations in our mock maps. We quantify the effects of halo line-of-sight alignments,
source confusion, and telescope angular resolution on the TSZE-detectable cluster count. We perform
a similar analysis for the planned 100-m Hevelius radio telescope (RTH) equipped with a 49-beam
radio camera and operating at frequencies up to 22 GHz. We find that RT32/OCRA-f will be suitable
for small-field blind radio source surveys, and will detect $33^{+17}_{-11}$ new radio sources
brighter than 0.87 mJy at 30~GHz in a $1 \rm deg^2$ field at >5\sigma CL during a one-year, non-continuous,
observing campaign, taking account of Polish weather conditions. It is unlikely that a blind TSZE
survey would detect any galaxy cluster at 3\sigma CL in the field. A similar survey, with field coverage
of $1.5^2$ beams per pixel, at~15 GHz with the RTH, would find $4^{+2}_{-2}$ galaxy clusters per
year above 6 $\mu$Jy in a $1 \rm deg^2$ field at 3\sigma CL and <1.5 clusters per year brighter than
60 $\mu$Jy (at 3\sigma CL) in a survey of a $60 \rm deg^2$ field. The same survey will detect...[ABRIDGED]
