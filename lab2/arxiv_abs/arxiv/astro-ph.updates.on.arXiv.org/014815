We report the results of optical follow-up observations of 29 gravitational-wave triggers during
the first half of the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) O3 run with the Gravitational-wave Optical
Transient Observer (GOTO) in its prototype 4-telescope configuration (GOTO-4). While no viable
electromagnetic counterpart candidate was identified, we estimate our 3D (volumetric) coverage
using test light curves of on- and off-axis gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae. In cases where the source
region was observable immediately, GOTO-4 was able to respond to a GW alert in less than a minute.
The average time of first observation was $8.79$ hours after receiving an alert ($9.90$ hours after
trigger). A mean of $732.3$ square degrees were tiled per event, representing on average $45.3$
per cent of the LVC probability map, or $70.3$ per cent of the observable probability. This coverage
will further improve as the facility scales up alongside the localisation performance of the evolving
gravitational-wave detector network. Even in its 4-telescope prototype configuration, GOTO
is capable of detecting AT2017gfo-like kilonovae beyond 200~Mpc in favourable observing conditions.
We cannot currently place meaningful electromagnetic limits on the population of distant ($\hat{D}_L
= 1.3$~Gpc) binary black hole mergers because our test models are too faint to recover at this distance.
However, as GOTO is upgraded towards its full 32-telescope, 2 node (La Palma \& Australia) configuration,
it is expected to be sufficiently sensitive to cover the predicted O4 binary neutron star merger
volume, and will be able to respond to both northern and southern triggers.
