We study small-scale brightenings in Ca II 8542 \AA\ line-core images to determine their nature
and effect on localized heating and mass transfer in active regions. High-resolution 2D spectroscopic
observations of an active region in the Ca II 8542 \AA\ line were acquired with the GFPI attached to
the 1.5-meter GREGOR telescope. Inversions of the spectra were carried out using NICOLE. We identified
three brightenings of sizes up to 2"x2". We found evidence that the brightenings belonged to the
footpoints of a microflare (MF). The properties of the observed brightenings disqualified the
scenarios of Ellerman bombs or IRIS bombs. However, this MF shared some common properties with flaring
active-region fibrils or flaring arch filaments (FAFs): (1) FAFs and MFs are both apparent in chromospheric
and coronal layers according to the AIA channels, and (2) both show flaring arches with lifetimes
of about 3.0-3.5 min and lengths of about 20". The inversions revealed heating by 600 K at the footpoint
location in the ambient chromosphere during the impulsive phase. Connecting the footpoints, a
dark filamentary structure appeared in the Ca II line-core images. Before the start of the MF, the
spectra of this structure already indicated average blueshifts, meaning upward motions of the
plasma along the LOS. During the impulsive phase, these velocities increased up to -2.2 km/s. Downflows
dominated at the footpoints. However, in the upper photosphere, slight upflows occurred during
the impulsive phase. Hence, bidirectional flows are present in the footpoints of the MF. Conclusions:
We detected Ca II brightenings that coincided with the footpoint location of an MF. The MF event led
to a rise of plasma in the upper photosphere, both before and during the impulsive phase. Excess mass,
previously raised to at most chromospheric layers, slowly drained downward along arches toward
the footpoints of the MF.
