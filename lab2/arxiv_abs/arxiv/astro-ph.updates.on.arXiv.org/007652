We investigate the evolution of the horizontal flow field around sunspots during their decay by
analysing its extension and horizontal velocity around eight spots using SDO/HMI Doppler maps.
By assuming a radially symmetrical flow field, the applied analysis method determines the radial
dependence of the azimuthally averaged flow field. For comparison, we studied the flow in supergranules
using the same technique. All investigated, fully fledged sunspots are surrounded by a flow field
whose horizontal velocity profile decreases continuously from 881 m s$^{-1}$ at 1.1 Mm off the spot
boundary, down to 199 m s$^{-1}$ at a mean distance of 11.9 Mm to that boundary. Once the penumbra is
fully dissolved, however, the velocity profile of the flow changes: The horizontal velocity increases
with increasing distance to the spot boundary until a maximum value of about 398 m s$^{-1}$ is reached.
Then, the horizontal velocity decreases for farther distances to the spot boundary. In supergranules,
the horizontal velocity increases with increasing distance to their centre up to a mean maximum
velocity of 355 m s$^{-1}$. For larger distances, the horizontal velocity decreases. We thus find
that the velocity profile of naked sunspots resembles that of supergranular flows. The evolution
of the flow field around individual sunspots is influenced by the way the sunspot decays and by the
interplay with the surrounding flow areas. Observations of the flow around eight decaying sunspots
suggest that as long as penumbrae are present, sunspots with their moat cell are embedded in network
cells. The disappearance of the penumbra (and consequently the moat flow) and the competing surrounding
supergranular cells, both have a significant role in the evolution of the flow field: The moat cell
transforms into a supergranule, which hosts the remaining naked spot.
