The recent discovery and characterization of the diversity of the atmospheres of exoplanets and
brown dwarfs calls for the development of fast and accurate analytical models. We quantify the accuracy
of the analytical solution derived in paper I for an irradiated, non-grey atmosphere by comparing
it to a state-of-the-art radiative transfer model. Then, using a grid of numerical models, we calibrate
the different coefficients of our analytical model for irradiated solar-composition atmospheres
of giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. We show that the so-called Eddington approximation used to
solve the angular dependency of the radiation field leads to relative errors of up to 5% on the temperature
profile. We show that for realistic non-grey planetary atmospheres, the presence of a convective
zone that extends to optical depths smaller than unity can lead to changes in the radiative temperature
profile on the order of 20% or more. When the convective zone is located at deeper levels (such as for
strongly irradiated hot Jupiters), its effect on the radiative atmosphere is smaller. We show that
the temperature inversion induced by a strong absorber in the optical, such as TiO or VO is mainly
due to non-grey thermal effects reducing the ability of the upper atmosphere to cool down rather
than an enhanced absorption of the stellar light as previously thought. Finally, we provide a functional
form for the coefficients of our analytical model for solar-composition giant exoplanets and brown
dwarfs. This leads to fully analytical pressure-temperature profiles for irradiated atmospheres
with a relative accuracy better than 10% for gravities between 2.5m/s^2 and 250 m/s^2 and effective
temperatures between 100 K and 3000 K. This is a great improvement over the commonly used Eddington
boundary condition.
