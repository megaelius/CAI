We describe the completed VIMOS VLT Deep Survey, and the final data release of 35016 galaxies and
type-I AGN with measured spectroscopic redshifts up to redshift z~6.7, in areas 0.142 to 8.7 square
degrees, and volumes from 0.5x10^6 to 2x10^7h^-3Mpc^3. We have selected samples of galaxies based
solely on their i-band magnitude reaching i_{AB}=24.75. Spectra have been obtained with VIMOS
on the ESO-VLT, integrating 0.75h, 4.5h and 18h for the Wide, Deep, and Ultra-Deep nested surveys.
A total of 1263 galaxies have been re-observed independently within the VVDS, and from the VIPERS
and MASSIV surveys. They are used to establish the redshift measurements reliability, to assess
completeness, and to provide a weighting scheme taking into account the survey selection function.
We describe the main properties of the VVDS samples, and the VVDS is compared to other spectroscopic
surveys. In total we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34594 galaxies, 422 type-I AGN,
and 12430 Galactic stars. The survey has enabled to identify galaxies up to very high redshifts with
4669 redshifts in 1<=z_{spec}<=2, 561 in 2<=z_{spec}<=3 and 468 with z_{spec}>3,
and specific populations like LAE have been identified out to z=6.62. We show that the VVDS occupies
a unique place in the parameter space defined by area, depth, redshift coverage, and number of spectra.
The VVDS provides a comprehensive survey of the distant universe, covering all epochs since z, or
more than 12 Gyr of cosmic time, with a uniform selection, the largest such sample to date. A wealth
of science results derived from the VVDS have shed new light on the evolution of galaxies and AGN,
and their distribution in space, over this large cosmic time. A final public release of the complete
VVDS spectroscopic redshift sample is available at this http URL
