Using telescopes at the Canary Island observatories, we conducted the long-term observational
programme 128-MULTIPLE-16/15B (LP15), a large and complete optical follow-up campaign of all
the unidentified PSZ2 sources in the northern sky (Dec>-15 deg) and no correspondence in the first
Planck catalogue PSZ1. We perform this optical validation of SZ clusters in order to contribute
to the characterization of the actual purity and completeness of full Our validation procedure
combines this optical information with SZ emission as traced by the publicly available Planck Compton
y-maps. The clusters counterparts are classified according to redshift, velocity dispersion
and richness of the clusters. This paper presents the detailed study of 106 objects out of the LP15
sample, corresponding to all the observations carried out during the first year of the programme.
We confirmed the optical counterpart for 41 new PSZ2 sources, being 31 of them validated using also
velocity dispersion based on our spectroscopic information. This is the largest dataset of newly
confirmed PSZ2 sources without any previous optical information. All the confirmed counterparts
are rich structures (i.e. they show high velocity dispersion), and are well aligned with the nominal
Planck coordinates (~70% of them are located at less than 3 arcmin distance). In total, 65 SZ sources
are classified as unconfirmed, being 57 of them due to the absence of an optical over-density, and
8 of them due to a weak association with the observed SZ decrement. Most of the sources with no optical
counterpart are located at low galactic latitudes and present strong galactic cirrus in the optical
images, being the dust contamination the most probable explanation for their inclusion in the PSZ2
catalogue.
