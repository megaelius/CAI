The collapse of a collisionless self-gravitating system, with the fast achievement of a quasi-stationary
state, is driven by violent relaxation, with a typical particle interacting with the time-changing
collective potential. It is traditionally assumed that this evolution is governed by the Vlasov-Poisson
equation, in which case entropy must be conserved. We run N-body simulations of isolated self-gravitating
systems, using three simulation codes: NBODY-6 (direct summation without softening), NBODY-2
(direct summation with softening) and GADGET-2 (tree code with softening), for different numbers
of particles and initial conditions. At each snapshot, we estimate the Shannon entropy of the distribution
function with three different techniques: Kernel, Nearest Neighbor and EnBiD. For all simulation
codes and estimators, the entropy evolution converges to the same limit as N increases. During violent
relaxation, the entropy has a fast increase followed by damping oscillations, indicating that
violent relaxation must be described by a kinetic equation other than the Vlasov-Poisson, even
for N as large as that of astronomical structures. This indicates that violent relaxation cannot
be described by a time-reversible equation, shedding some light on the so-called "fundamental
paradox of stellar dynamics". The long-term evolution is well described by the orbit-averaged
Fokker-Planck model, with Coulomb logarithm values in the expected range 10-12. By means of NBODY-2,
we also study the dependence of the 2-body relaxation time-scale on the softening length. The approach
presented in the current work can potentially provide a general method for testing any kinetic equation
intended to describe the macroscopic evolution of N-body systems.
