We present ~400ks NuSTAR observations of the northeast (NE) and southwest (SW) non-thermal limbs
of the Galactic SNR SN1006. We discovered three sources with X-ray emission detected at >50keV.
Two of them are identified as background AGN. We extract the NuSTAR spectra from a few regions along
the non-thermal limbs and jointly analyze them with the XMM-Newton spectra and the radio data. The
broad-band radio/X-ray spectra can be well described with a synchrotron emission model from a single
population of CR electrons with a power law energy distribution and an exponential cutoff. The power
law index of the electron particle distribution function (PDF) is ~1.88-1.95 for both the NE and
SW limbs, and we do not find significant evidence for a variation of this index at different energy
(curvature). There are significant spatial variations of the synchrotron emission parameters.
The highest energy electrons are accelerated in regions with the lowest expansion velocity, which
is opposite to what has been found in the Tycho's SNR. In addition to a gradual steepening of synchrotron
emission from the center of the non-thermal limbs to larger azimuthal angles, we also find that both
the emission spectrum and the PDF are significantly flatter in three regions in the SW limb where
the shock encounters higher density ambient medium. The NE limb also shows significantly higher
cutoff energy in the PDF than the SW limb. By comparing with the roughly symmetric TeV emission and
largely asymmetric GeV emission from the two non-thermal limbs, we conclude that the asymmetry
in the ambient medium and magnetic fields may have largely modified the acceleration and emission
of CR leptons.
