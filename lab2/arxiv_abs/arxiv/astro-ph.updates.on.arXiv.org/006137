The magnetically polarized matter in astrophysical systems may be relevant in some magnetically
dominated regions. For instance, the funnel that is generated in some highly magnetized disks configurations
whereby relativistic jets are thought to spread, or in pulsars where the fluids are subject to very
intense magnetic fields. With the aim of dealing with magnetic media in the astrophysical context,
we present for the first time the conservative form of the GRMHD equations with a non-zero magnetic
polarization vector $m^{\mu}$. Then, we follow the Anile method to compute the eigenvalue structure
in the case where the magnetic polarization is parallel to the magnetic field, and it is parametrized
by the magnetic susceptibility $\chi_m$. This approximation allows us to describe diamagnetic
fluids, for which $\chi_m<0$, and paramagnetic fluids where $\chi_m>0$. The theoretical results
were implemented in the CAFE code to study the role of the magnetic polarization in some 1D Riemann
problems. We found that independently of the initial condition, the first waves that appear in the
numerical solutions are faster in diamagnetic materials than in paramagnetic ones. Moreover,
the constant states between the waves change notably for different magnetic susceptibilities.
All these effects are more appreciable if the magnetic pressure is much bigger than the fluid pressure.
Additionally, with the aim of analysing a magnetic media in a strong gravitational field, we carry
out for the first time the magnetized Michel accretion of a magnetically polarized fluid. With this
test, we found that the numerical solution is effectively maintained over time ($t>4000$), and
that the global convergence of the code is $\gtrsim$ 2 for $\chi_{m}\lesssim 0.005$, for all the
magnetic field strength $\beta$ we considered.
