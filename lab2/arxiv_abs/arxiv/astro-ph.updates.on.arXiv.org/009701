Context. Earlier work suggests that slowly rotating asteroids should have higher thermal inertias
than faster rotators because the heat wave penetrates deeper into the sub-surface. However, thermal
inertias have been determined mainly for fast rotators due to selection effects in the available
photometry used to obtain shape models required for thermophysical modelling (TPM). Aims. Our
aims are to mitigate these selection effects by producing shape models of slow rotators, to scale
them and compute their thermal inertia with TPM, and to verify whether thermal inertia increases
with the rotation period. Methods. To decrease the bias against slow rotators, we conducted a photometric
observing campaign of main-belt asteroids with periods longer than 12 hours, from multiple stations
worldwide, adding in some cases data from WISE and Kepler space telescopes. For spin and shape reconstruction
we used the lightcurve inversion method, and to derive thermal inertias we applied a thermophysical
model to fit available infrared data from IRAS, AKARI, and WISE. Results. We present new models of
11 slow rotators that provide a good fit to the thermal data. In two cases, the TPM analysis showed
a clear preference for one of the two possible mirror solutions. We derived the diameters and albedos
of our targets in addition to their thermal inertias, which ranged between 3$^{+33}_{-3}$ and 45$^{+60}_{-30}$
Jm$^{-2}$s$^{-1/2}$K$^{-1}$. Conclusions. Together with our previous work, we have analysed
16 slow rotators from our dense survey with sizes between 30 and 150 km. The current sample thermal
inertias vary widely, which does not confirm the earlier suggestion that slower rotators have higher
thermal inertias.
