Enstatite chondrites and aubrites are meteorites that show the closest similarities to the Earth
in many isotope systems that undergo mass-independent and mass-dependent isotope fractionations.
Due to the analytical challenges to obtain high-precision K isotopic compositions in the past,
potential differences in K isotopic compositions between enstatite meteorites and the Earth remained
uncertain. We report the first high-precision K isotopic compositions of eight enstatite chondrites
and four aubrites and find that there is a significant variation of K isotopic compositions among
enstatite meteorites (from -2.34 permil to -0.18 permil). However, K isotopic compositions of
nearly all enstatite meteorites scatter around the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value. The average
K isotopic composition of the eight enstatite chondrites (-0.47 +/- 0.57 permil) is indistinguishable
from the BSE value (-0.48 +/- 0.03 permil), thus further corroborating the isotopic similarity
between Earth' building blocks and enstatite meteorite precursors. We found no correlation of
K isotopic compositions with the chemical groups, petrological types, shock degrees, and terrestrial
weathering conditions; however, the variation of K isotopes among enstatite meteorite can be attributed
to the parent body processing. Our sample of the main group aubrite MIL 13004 is exceptional and has
an extremely light K isotopic composition (delta 41K= -2.34 +/- 0.12 permil). We attribute this
unique K isotopic feature to the presence of abundant djerfisherite inclusions in our sample because
this K-bearing sulfide mineral is predicted to be enriched in 39K during equilibrium exchange with
silicates.
