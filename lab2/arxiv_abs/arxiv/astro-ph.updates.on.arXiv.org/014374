We analyzed multiwavelength observations of the previously identified Galactic center X-ray
binary CXO 174528.79-290942.8 (XID 6592) and determine that the near-infrared counterpart is
a red supergiant based on its spectrum and luminosity. Scutum X-1 is the only previously known X-ray
binary with a red supergiant donor star and closely resembles XID 6592 in terms of X-ray luminosity
(L$_{\mathrm{X}}$), absolute magnitude, and IR variability (L$_{\mathrm{IR,var}}$), supporting
the conclusion that XID 6592 contains a red supergiant donor star. The XID 6592 infrared counterpart
shows variability of $\sim$0.5 mag in the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-1 band (3.4 $\mu$m)
on timescales of a few hours. Other infrared data sets also show large-amplitude variability from
this source at earlier epochs but do not show significant variability in recent data. We do not expect
red supergiants to vary by $\sim50\%$ in luminosity over these short timescales, indicating that
the variability should be powered by the compact object. However, the X-ray luminosity of this system
is typically $\sim1000\times$ less than the variable luminosity in the infrared and falls below
the Chandra detection limit. While X-ray reprocessing can produce large-amplitude fast infrared
variability, it typically requires L$_{{\mathrm{X}}} >> $ L$_{\mathrm{IR,var}}$ to do so, indicating
that another process must be at work. We suggest that this system may be a supergiant fast X-ray transient
(SFXT), and that a large ($\sim10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), fast ($10^{2-4}$ s) X-ray flare could explain
the rapid IR variability and lack of a long-lasting X-ray outburst detection. SFXTs are normally
associated with blue supergiant companions, so if confirmed, XID 6592 would be the first red supergiant
SFXT, as well as the second X-ray red supergiant binary.
