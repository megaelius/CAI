We present hydrodynamic simulations of spherically symmetric super-Eddington winds from radius
expansion type I X-ray bursts. Previous studies assumed a steady-state wind and treated the mass-loss
rate as a free parameter. Using MESA, we follow the multi-zone time-dependent burning, the convective
and radiative heating of the atmosphere during the burst rise, and the launch and evolution of the
optically thick radiation-driven wind as the photosphere expands outward to radii $r_{\rm ph}
\gtrsim 100\text{ km}$. We focus on neutron stars accreting pure helium and study bursts over a range
of ignition depths. We find that the wind ejects $\approx 0.2\%$ of the accreted layer, nearly independent
of ignition depth. This implies that $\approx 30\%$ of the nuclear energy release is used to unbind
matter from the neutron star surface. We show that ashes of nuclear burning are ejected in the wind
and dominate the wind composition for bursts that ignite at column depths $\gtrsim 10^9\text{ g
cm}^{-2}$. The ejecta is composed primarily of elements with mass number $A> 40$, which we find should
imprint photoionization edges on the burst spectra. Evidence of heavy-element edges has been reported
in the spectra of strong radius expansion bursts. We find that after $\approx 1\text{ s}$ the wind
composition transitions from mostly light elements ($^4$He and $^{12}$C), which sit at the top
of the atmosphere, to mostly heavy elements ($A>40$), which sit deeper down. This may explain why
the photospheric radii of all superexpansion bursts show a transition after $\approx 1\text{ s}$
from a superexpansion ($r_{\rm ph}>10^3\text{ km}$) to a moderate expansion ($r_{\rm ph}\sim
50\text{ km}$).
