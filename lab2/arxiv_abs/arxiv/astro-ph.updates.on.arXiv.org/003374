We present new photometric data of 11 hot Jupiter transiting exoplanets (CoRoT-12b, HAT-P-5b,
HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-33b, HAT-P-37b, WASP-2b, WASP-24b, WASP-60b, WASP-80b, WASP-103b, XO-3b)
in order to update their planetary parameters and to constrain information about their atmospheres.
These observations of CoRoT-12b, HAT-P-37b and WASP-60b are the first follow-up data since their
discovery. Additionally, the first near-UV transits of WASP-80b and WASP-103b are presented.
We compare the results of our analysis with previous work to search for transit timing variations
(TTVs) and a wavelength dependence in the transit depth. TTVs may be evidence of a third body in the
system and variations in planetary radius with wavelength can help constrain the properties of
the exoplanet's atmosphere. For WASP-103b and XO-3b, we find a possible variation in the transit
depths that may be evidence of scattering in their atmospheres. The B-band transit depth of HAT-P-37b
is found to be smaller than its near-IR transit depth and such a variation may indicate TiO/VO absorption.
These variations are detected from 2-4.6$\sigma$, so follow-up observations are needed to confirm
these results. Additionally, a flat spectrum across optical wavelengths is found for 5 of the planets
(HAT-P-5b, HAT-P-12b, WASP-2b, WASP-24b, WASP-80b), suggestive that clouds may be present in
their atmospheres. We calculate a refined orbital period and ephemeris for all the targets, which
will help with future observations. No TTVs are seen in our analysis with the exception of WASP-80b
and follow-up observations are needed to confirm this possible detection.
