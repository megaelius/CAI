To add to the growing collection of well-studied double periodic variables (DPVs) we have carried
out the first spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the eclipsing binary DQ Velorum to obtain
its main physical stellar and orbital parameters. Combining spectroscopic and photometric observations
that cover several orbital cycles allows us to estimate the stellar properties of the binary components
and the orbital parameters. We also searched for circumstellar material around the more massive
star. We separated DQ Velorum composite spectra and measured radial velocities with an iterative
method for double spectroscopic binaries. We obtained the radial velocity curves and calculated
the spectroscopic mass ratio. We compared our single-lined spectra with a grid of synthetic spectra
and estimated the temperature of the stars. We modeled the V-band light curve with a fitting method
based on the simplex algorithm, which includes an accretion disc. To constrain the main stellar
parameters we fixed the mass ratio and donor temperature to the values obtained by our spectroscopic
analysis. We obtain donor and gainer masses, the radii, and temperatures for the stellar components.
We find that DQ Vel is a semi-detached system consisting of a B3V gainer and an A1III donor star plus
an extended accretion disc around the gainer. The disc is filling 89% of the gainer Roche lobe and
it has a concave shape that is thicker at its edge than at its centre. We find a significant sub-orbital
frequency of 0.19 d^{-1} in the residuals of the V-band light curve, which we interpret as a pulsation
of an slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) of a gainer star. We also estimate the distance to the binary (3.1
kpc) using the absolute radii, apparent magnitudes, and effective temperatures of the components
found in our study.
