Some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit blueshifted broad absorption lines (BALs) in their
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectra, while others display broad emission lines (BELs). Similar
phenomenology is observed in quasars and accreting white dwarfs, where it can be interpreted as
an orientation effect associated with line formation in an accretion disc wind.We propose and explore
a similar unification scheme for TDEs. We present synthetic UV spectra for disc and wind-hosting
TDEs, produced by a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. Our models
cover a wide range of disc wind geometries and kinematics. Such winds naturally reproduce both BALs
and BELs. In general, sight lines looking into the wind cone preferentially produce BALs, while
other orientations preferentially produce BELs. We also study the effect of wind clumping and CNO-processed
abundances on the observed spectra. Clumpy winds tend to produce stronger UV emission and absorption
lines, because clumping increases both the emission measure and the abundances of the relevant
ionic species, the latter by reducing the ionization state of the outflow. The main effect of adopting
CNO-processed abundances is a weakening of C~{\sc iv}~1550~\AA~ and an enhancement of N \textsc{v}~1240~\AA~
in the spectra. We conclude that line formation in an accretion disc wind is a promising mechanism
for explaining the diverse UV spectra of TDEs. If this is correct, the relative number of BAL and BEL
TDEs can be used to estimate the covering factor of the outflow. The models in this work are publicly
available online and upon request.
