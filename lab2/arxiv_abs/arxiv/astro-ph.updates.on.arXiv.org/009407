Up to now, the largest sample of galaxy clusters selected in X-rays comes from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey
(RASS). Although there have been many interesting clusters discovered with the RASS data, the broad
point spread function (PSF) of the ROSAT satellite limits the amount of spatial information of the
detected objects. This leads to the discovery of new cluster features when a re-observation is performed
with higher resolution X-ray satellites. Here we present the results from XMM-Newton observations
of three clusters: RXCJ2306.6-1319, ZwCl1665 and RXCJ0034.6-0208, for which the observations
reveal a double or triple system of extended components. These clusters belong to the extremely
expanded HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster Sample (eeHIFLUGCS), which is a flux-limited cluster
sample ($f_\textrm{X,500}\geq 5\times10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the $0.1-2.4$ keV
energy band). For each structure in each cluster, we determine the redshift with the X-ray spectrum
and find that the components are not part of the same cluster. This is confirmed by an optical spectroscopic
analysis of the galaxy members. Therefore, the total number of clusters is actually 7 and not 3. We
derive global cluster properties of each extended component. We compare the measured properties
to lower-redshift group samples, and find a good agreement. Our flux measurements reveal that only
one component of the ZwCl1665 cluster has a flux above the eeHIFLUGCS limit, while the other clusters
will no longer be part of the sample. These examples demonstrate that cluster-cluster projections
can bias X-ray cluster catalogues and that with high-resolution X-ray follow-up this bias can be
corrected.
