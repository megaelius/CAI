We have extended and refined the existing young stellar object (YSO) catalogs for the Orion A molecular
cloud, the closest massive star-forming region to Earth. This updated catalog is driven by the large
spatial coverage (18.3 deg$^2$, $\sim$950 pc$^2$), seeing limited resolution ($\sim$0.7$"$),
and sensitivity ($K_s<19$ mag) of the ESO-VISTA near-infrared survey of the Orion A cloud (VISION).
Combined with archival mid- to far-infrared data, the VISTA data allow for a refined and more robust
source selection. We estimate that among previously known protostars and pre-main-sequence stars
with disks, source contamination levels (false positives) are at least $\sim$6.4% and $\sim$2.3%,
respectively, mostly due to background galaxies and nebulosities. We identify 274 new YSO candidates
using VISTA/Spitzer based selections within previously analyzed regions, and VISTA/WISE based
selections to add sources in the surroundings, beyond previously analyzed regions. The WISE selection
method recovers about 59% of the known YSOs in Orion A's low-mass star-forming part L1641, which
shows what can be achieved by the all-sky WISE survey in combination with deep near-infrared data
in regions without the influence of massive stars. The new catalog contains 2980 YSOs, which were
classified based on the de-reddened mid-infrared spectral index into 188 protostars, 185 flat-spectrum
sources, and 2607 pre-main-sequence stars with circumstellar disks. We find a statistically significant
difference in the spatial distribution of the three evolutionary classes with respect to regions
of high dust column-density, confirming that flat-spectrum sources are at a younger evolutionary
phase compared to Class IIs, and are not a sub-sample seen at particular viewing angles.
