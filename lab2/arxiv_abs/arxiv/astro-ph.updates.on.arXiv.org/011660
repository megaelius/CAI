We study the co-evolution of galaxies and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) through cosmic time by
correlating $\sim60,000$ MgII absorbers, tracers of cool gas ($\sim 10^{4}$ K), detected in the
SDSS quasar spectra with galaxies detected in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. By doing so, we extract
the properties of galaxies associated with absorbers from redshift 0.4 to 1.3 with effectively
$\sim 15,000$ pairs and explore the covering fraction of MgII absorbers as a function of galaxy type,
stellar mass, impact parameter, and redshift. We find that the gas covering fraction increases
with stellar mass of galaxies by $\sim M_{*}^{0.4}$. However, after we normalize the impact parameter
by the virial radius of dark matter halos, the gas profiles around galaxies with masses ranging from
$10^{9}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$ become consistent with each other. In addition, the gas distribution
depends on galaxy type: the covering fraction within $0.3 \, r_{vir}$ around star-forming galaxies
is 2-4 times higher than that around passive galaxies at all redshifts. We find that the covering
fraction of strong absorbers ($W_{\lambda2796}>1$ Angstrom) around both types of galaxies evolves
significantly with redshift, similarly to the evolution of star-formation rate of galaxies, while
such an evolution is not detected for weak absorbers ($W_{\lambda2796}<1$ Angstrom). We quantify
the HI mass traced by strong absorbers connected to the star-formation activity of galaxies and
show that the mass is proportional to the star-formation rate of galaxies at all redshifts. This
result demonstrates that galaxies and their CGM co-evolve through cosmic time. Finally, we discuss
the origins of strong absorbers around passive galaxies and argue that its redshift evolution may
track the star-formation activity of satellite galaxies.
