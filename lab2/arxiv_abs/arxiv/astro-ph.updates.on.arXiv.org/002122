The highest energy (contained) neutrino events in ICECUBE did provide within three years as many
as 32 signals, at tens-hundred TeV energy and an additional 3 rarest PeV cascade shower. Their flux
clearly favored the birth of a long waited extraterrestrial neutrino astronomy injection. The
majority (28) of all these events are indeed spherical cascade shower and their exact timing in shining
provided an approximate arrival direction. However their consequent smeared map are inconclusive:
their wide arrival angle spread signal, their paucity do not allow yet to define any meaning-full
source correlation or anisotropy. The additional rarest 7 muon tracks while being sharp in arrival
directions are too few and they did not offer any correlated clustering nor any overlapping within
known sources. Larger sample of UHE neutrino signals and their most accurate directionality is
needed. We recently suggested the highest energy (tens-TeV) crossing muon along the ICECUBE, mostly
at horizons or upcoming, being mostly extraterrestrial, are the ideal tool able to reveal, by their
mps, soon such clustering or even any narrow angle pointing to known (IR, X, Radio or AGN) sources
or self-correlation in rare doublet or triplet: a last hope for a soon neutrino Astronomy. Any crossing
muons clustering along galactic sources or within UHECR arrivals might also probe rarest transient
UHECR event made by nuclei and-or neutrons. Within three years of ICECUBE data all the un-contained
crossing highest energy muons above few tens TeV maybe several dozens, possibly around five dozen,
mostly enhanced along horizontal edges painting known sources and-or self correlating in doublets
or rarest triplet, offering a first solution of the UHE neutrino source puzzle. Very recent preliminary
ICECUBE presentation on crossing muons during two years are consistent with our preliminary muon
rate estimate.
