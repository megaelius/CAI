We present Bayesian Analysis for Nearby Young AssociatioNs II (BANYAN II), a modified Bayesian
analysis for assessing the membership of later-than-M5 objects to any of several Nearby Young Associations
(NYAs). In addition to using kinematic information (from sky position and proper motion), this
analysis exploits 2MASS-WISE color-magnitude diagrams in which old and young objects follow distinct
sequences. As an improvement over our earlier work, the spatial and kinematic distributions for
each association are now modelled as ellipsoids whose axes need not be aligned with the Galactic
coordinate axes, and we use prior probabilities matching the expected populations of the NYAs considered
versus field stars. We present an extensive contamination analysis to characterize the performance
of our new method. We find that Bayesian probabilities are generally representative of contamination
rates, except when both radial velocity and parallax are considered. In this case contamination
rates become significantly smaller and hence Bayesian probabilities for NYA memberships are pessimistic.
We apply this new algorithm to a sample of 158 objects from the literature that are either known to
display spectroscopic signs of youth or have unusually red NIR colors for their spectral type. Based
on our analysis, we identify 24 objects as new highly probable candidates to NYAs, including a new
M7.5 bona fide member to Tucana-Horologium, making it the latest-type member. In addition, we reveal
that a known L2{\gamma} dwarf is co-moving with a bright M5 dwarf, and we show for the first time that
two of the currently known ultra red L dwarfs are strong candidates to the AB Doradus moving group.
Several objects identified here as highly probable members to NYAs could be free-floating planetary-mass
objects if their membership is confirmed.
