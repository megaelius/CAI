NGC6240 is a well studied nearby galaxy system in the process of merging. It has been claimed to harbor
two active nuclei based on optical, X-ray and radio observations. We carried out a detailed optical
3D spectroscopic study to investigate the inner region of this system in connection with existing
MERLIN/VLBA data. We observed NGC6240 with very high spatial resolution using the MUSE instrument
in the Narrow-Field Mode with the four-laser GALACSI adaptive optics system on the ESO VLT under
seeing conditions of 0.49 arcsec. Our 3D spectra cover the wavelength range 4725 to 9350 AA at a spatial
resolution of ~75 mas. We report the discovery of three nuclei in the final state of merging within
a region of only 1 kpc in the NGC6240 system.Thanks to MUSE we are able to show that the formerly unresolved
southern component actually consists of two distinct nuclei separated by 198 pc only. In combination
with Gaia data we reach an absolute positional accuracy of only 30 mas that is essential to compare
optical spectra with MERLIN/VLBA radio positions. The verification and detailed study of a system
with three nuclei -- two of them being active and each with a mass in excess of $9\times10^{7} M_{\odot}$
-- is of great importance for the understanding of hierarchical galaxy formation via merging processes
since multiple mergers lead to a faster evolution of massive galaxies in comparison to binary mergers.
So far it has been suggested that the formation of galactic nuclei with multiple SMBHs is expected
to be rare in the local universe.Triple massive black hole systems might be of fundamental importance
for the coalescence of massive black hole binaries in less than a Hubble time leading to the loudest
sources of gravitational waves in the mHz regime.
