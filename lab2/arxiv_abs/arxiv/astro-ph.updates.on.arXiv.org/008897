While the upcoming telescopes will reveal correspondingly fainter, more distant galaxies, a question
will persist: what more is there that these telescopes cannot see? One answer is the source-subtracted
Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). The CIB is comprised of the collective light from all sources
remaining after known, resolved sources are accounted for. Ever-more-sensitive surveys will
identify the brightest of these, allowing them to be removed, and - like peeling layers off an onion
- reveal deeper layers of the CIB. In this way it is possible to measure the contributions from populations
not accessible to direct telescopic observation. Measurement of fluctuations in the source-subtracted
CIB, i.e., the spatial power spectrum of the CIB after subtracting resolved sources, provides a
robust means of characterizing its faint, and potentially new, populations. Studies over the past
15 years have revealed source-subtracted CIB fluctuations on scales out to ~100' which cannot be
explained by extrapolating from known galaxy populations. Moreover, they appear highly coherent
with the unresolved Cosmic X-ray Background, hinting at a significant population of accreting
black holes among the CIB sources. Characterizing the source-subtracted CIB with high accuracy,
and thereby constraining the nature of the new populations, is feasible with upcoming instruments
and would produce critically important cosmological information in the next decade. New coextensive
deep and wide-area near-infrared, X-ray, and microwave surveys will bring decisive opportunities
to examine, with high fidelity, the spatial spectrum and origin of the CIB fluctuations and their
cross-correlations with cosmic microwave and X-ray backgrounds, and determine the formation
epochs and the nature of the new sources (stellar nucleosynthetic or accreting black holes).
