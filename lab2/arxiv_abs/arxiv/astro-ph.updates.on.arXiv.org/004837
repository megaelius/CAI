The seven approximately Earth-sized transiting planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system provide a unique
opportunity to explore habitable zone and non-habitable zone small planets within the same system.
Its habitable zone exoplanets -- due to their favorable transit depths -- are also worlds for which
atmospheric transmission spectroscopy is within reach with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and
with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We present here an independent reduction and analysis
of two HST Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-infrared transit spectroscopy datasets for six planets
(b through g). Utilizing our physically-motivated detector charge trap correction and a custom
cosmic ray correction routine we confirm the general shape of the transmission spectra presented
by deWit2016 for planets b and c. Our data reduction approach leads to a 25\% increase in the usable
data and reduces the risk of confusing astrophysical brightness variations (e.g., flares) with
instrumental systematics. No prominent absorption features are detected in any individual planet's
transmission spectra; by contrast, the combined spectra of the planets show a clear inverted water
absorption feature. We show that this feature -- along with the Spitzer transit depth measurements
-- are fully consistent with stellar contamination, as predicted by Rackham2017b. These spectra
demonstrate how stellar contamination can overwhelm planetary absorption features in low-resolution
exoplanet transit spectra obtained by HST and JWST and also highlight the challenges in combining
multi-epoch observations for planets around rapidly rotating spotted stars.
