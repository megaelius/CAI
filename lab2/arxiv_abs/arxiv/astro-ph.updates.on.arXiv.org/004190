Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are amongst the fastest object in our Milky Way. These stars are predicted
to come from the Galactic center (GC) and travel along unbound orbits across the whole Galaxy. In
the following years, the ESA satellite Gaia will provide the most complete and accurate catalogue
of the Milky Way, with full astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motions) for
more than 1 billion stars. In this paper, we present the expected sample size and properties (mass,
magnitude, spatial, velocity distributions) of HVSs in the Gaia stellar catalogue. We build three
Gaia mock catalogues of HVSs anchored to current observations, each one exploring different assumptions
on the ejection mechanism and the stellar population in the GC. In all cases, we find numbers ranging
from several hundreds to several thousands. The mass distribution of observable HVSs peaks at ~1
M$_\odot$ for stars with a relative error in total proper motion below 10%, and will therefore probe
a different mass range compared to the few observed HVS candidates discovered in the past. In particular,
we show that a few hundreds to a few thousands of HVSs will be bright enough to have a precise measurement
of the three-dimensional velocity from Gaia alone. Finally, we also show that Gaia will provide
more precise proper motion measurements for the current sample of HVS candidates. This will help
identifying their birthplace narrowing down their ejection location, and confirming or rejecting
their nature as HVSs. Overall, our forecasts are extremely encouraging in terms of quantity and
quality of HVS data that can be potentially exploited to constrain both the Milky Way potential and
the GC properties.
