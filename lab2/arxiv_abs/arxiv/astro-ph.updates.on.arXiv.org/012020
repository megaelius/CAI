The central super-massive black hole of the Milky Way, Sgr A*, accretes at a very low rate making it
a very underluminous galactic nucleus. Despite the tens of Wolf-Rayet stars present within the
inner parsec supplying ${\sim}10^{-3}\rm\ M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$ in stellar winds, only a negligible
fraction of this material ($<10^{-4}$) ends up being accreted onto Sgr A*. The recent discovery
of cold gas (${\sim}10^4\rm\ K$) in its vicinity raised questions about how such material could
settle in the hostile (${\sim}10^7\rm\ K$) environment near Sgr A*. In this work we show that the
system of mass-losing stars blowing winds can naturally account for both the hot, inefficient accretion
flow, as well as the formation of a cold disk-like structure. We run hydrodynamical simulations
using the grid-based code Ramses starting as early in the past as possible to observe the state of
the system at the present time. Our results show that the system reaches a quasi-steady state in about
${\sim}500\rm\ yr$ with material being captured at a rate of ${\sim}10^{-6}\rm\ M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$
at scales of ${\sim}10^{-4}\rm\ pc$, consistent with the observations and previous models. However,
on longer timescales ($\gtrsim3000\rm\ yr$) the material accumulates close to the black hole in
the form of a disk. Considering the duration of the Wolf-Rayet phase (${\sim}10^5\rm\ yr$), we conclude
that this scenario likely has already happened, and could be responsible for the more active past
of Sgr A*, and/or its current outflow. We argue that the hypothesis of the mass-losing stars being
the main regulator of the activity of the black hole deserves further consideration.
