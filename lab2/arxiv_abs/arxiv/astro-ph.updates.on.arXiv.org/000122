Mergers are suspected to be reliable triggers of both starformation and AGN activity. However,
the exact timing of this process remains poorly understood. Here, we present deep imaging and long
slit spectroscopy data of a sample of four double-peaked [OIII] emitting AGN. These sources are
often believed to host binary AGN, or at least be currently undergoing major mergers. The sample
presented here either have previous IFU and high resolution imaging data that show double-nuclei
in the IR as well as kinematicly and spatially distinct line emitting regions. Two sources have detections
of double point sources in either the X-ray or radio. The sources studied are therefore likely binary
AGN. The AGN in this sample are luminous, radio-quiet and at low redshift. The $u/r/z$ imaging data
show host galaxies in a wide range of merger stages, with the majority (3/4) showing tidal tails or
complex kinematics and morphologies clearly indicating a recent merger. One source however -hosting
a double X-ray source- shows quiescent morphologies with no clear signs of interaction from imaging
data. The spectroscopy in this case reveals a gas disk counter-rotating with respect to the stellar
component. Spectroscopy of the other sources reveal disturbed kinematics further confirming
their status as ongoing mergers. Our data show that AGN triggering in mergers may happen over a wide
time span and that sinking of black holes to the center of a merged system might take considerable
time in some cases. A detailed analysis will be published in an upcoming paper. Further studies of
AGN in merging galaxies will show how the hosts of those AGN differ from normal mergers without AGN
activity.
