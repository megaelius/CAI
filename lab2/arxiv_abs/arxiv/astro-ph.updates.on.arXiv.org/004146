It is well known that the dust properties of the diffuse interstellar medium exhibit variations
towards different sight-lines on a large scale. We have investigated the variability of the dust
characteristics on a small scale, and from cloud-to-cloud. We use low-resolution spectro-polarimetric
data obtained in the context of the Large Interstellar Polarisation Survey (LIPS) towards 59 sight-lines
in the Southern Hemisphere, and we fit these data using a dust model composed of silicate and carbon
particles with sizes from the molecular to the sub-micrometre domain. Large (> 6 nm) silicates of
prolate shape account for the observed polarisation. For 32 sight-lines we complement our data
set with UVES archive high-resolution spectra, which enable us to establish the presence of single-cloud
or multiple-clouds towards individual sight-lines. We find that the majority of these 35 sight-lines
intersect two or more clouds, while eight of them are dominated by a single absorbing cloud. We confirm
several correlations between extinction and parameters of the Serkowski law with dust parameters,
but we also find previously undetected correlations between these parameters that are valid only
in single-cloud sight-lines. We find that interstellar polarisation from multiple-clouds is
smaller than from single-cloud sight-lines, showing that the presence of a second or more clouds
depolarises the incoming radiation. We find large variations of the dust characteristics from
cloud-to-cloud. However, when we average a sufficiently large number of clouds in single-cloud
or multiple-cloud sight-lines, we always retrieve similar mean dust parameters. The typical dust
abundances of the single-cloud cases are [C]/[H] = 92 ppm and [Si]/[H] = 20 ppm.
