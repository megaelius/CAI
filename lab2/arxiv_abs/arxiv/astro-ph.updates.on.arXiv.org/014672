We test whether the population of "extreme" trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs) detected in the Y4
Dark Energy Survey (DES) data exhibit azimuthal asymmetries which might be evidence of gravitational
perturbations from an unseen super-Earth in a distant orbit. By rotating the orbits of the detected
eTNOs, we construct a synthetic population which, when subject to the DES selection function, reproduces
the detected distribution of eTNOs in the orbital elements $a,e,$ and $i$ as well as absolute magnitude
$H$, but has uniform distributions in mean anomaly $M$, longitude of ascending node $\Omega,$ and
argument of perihelion $\omega.$ We then compare the detected distributions in each of $\Omega,
\omega,$ and $\varpi\equiv\Omega+\omega$ to those expected from the isotropic population, using
Kuiper's variant of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The three angles are tested for each of 4 definitions
of the eTNO population, choosing among $a>(150,250)$ AU and perihelion $q>(30,37)$ AU. These choices
yield 3--7 eTNOs in the DES Y4 sample. Among the twelve total tests, two have the likelihood of drawing
the observed angles from the isotropic population at $p<0.05.$ The 3 detections at $a>250, q>37$
AU, and the 4 detections at $a>250, q>30$ AU, have $\Omega$ distribution with $p=0.03$ of coming
from the isotropic construction, but this is not strong evidence of anisotropy given the 12 different
tests. The DES data taken on their own are thus consistent with azimuthal isotropy and do not require
a "Planet 9" hypothesis. The limited sky coverage and object count mean, however, that the DES data
by no means falsify this hypothesis.
