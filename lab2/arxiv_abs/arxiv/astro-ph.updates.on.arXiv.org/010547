We measure photometric rotation periods and starspot amplitudes in Evryscope light curves for
113 cool stars selected to have strong flaring. The Evryscope array of small telescopes has observed
all bright nearby stars in the Southern sky, producing two minute cadence light curves since 2016.
Long-term, high-cadence observations allow detection of rare flare events and long-term periodic
variability, and provide tools to probe the complex relationship between stellar rotation, starspots,
and superflares. We detect precise rotation periods from 0.3487 to 104 days with a median period
uncertainty of 0.0024 days. We observe sinusoidal amplitudes from 0.008 to 0.216 g' magnitudes.
We fold the TESS light curves of each target to the Evryscope-detected period and compare rotational
amplitudes. TESS amplitudes are less than or equal to Evryscope amplitudes. We compute the Rossby
number (R_o) for each star, finding 25 of our flare stars to be fast rotators (R_o<0.04), 55 to be intermediate-period
rotators (0.04<R_o<0.4), and 33 to be slow rotators (R_o>0.44). We measure the photometric starspot
coverage of each flare star, and find a median spot coverage of 14% of the stellar hemisphere. We constrain
the minimum surface magnetic field strength consistent with our flare energies and spot coverage
fraction to be 500 G, with later-type stars exhibiting lower minimum field strengths than earlier-type
stars. We observe a possible change in starspot coverage at intermediate periods. However, we do
not conclusively confirm the increased activity of intermediate rotators seen in previous studies.
We then split all rotators at R_o ~ 0.2 into P_Rot<10 d and P_Rot>10 d bins and confirm short-period
rotators exhibit higher superflare rates, larger flare energies observed, and higher starspot
coverage fractions than do long-period rotators, at p-values of 7.3 X 10^-5, 1.2 X 10^-6 and 0.0097,
respectively.
