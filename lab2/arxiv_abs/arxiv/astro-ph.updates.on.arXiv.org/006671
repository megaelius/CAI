In 1844 Schwabe discovered that the number of sunspots increased and decreased over a period of about
11 years, that variation became known as the sunspot cycle. Almost eighty years later, Hale described
the nature of the Sun's magnetic field, identifying that it takes about 22 years for the Sun's magnetic
polarity to cycle. It was also identified that the latitudinal distribution of sunspots resembles
the wings of a butterfly showing migration of sunspots in each hemisphere that abruptly start at
mid-latitudes towards the Sun's equator over the next 11 years. These sunspot patterns were shown
to be asymmetric across the equator. In intervening years, it was deduced that the Sun (and sun-like
stars) possess magnetic activity cycles that are assumed to be the physical manifestation of a dynamo
process that results from complex circulatory transport processes in the star's interior. Understanding
the Sun's magnetism, its origin and its variation, has become a fundamental scientific objective
\-- the distribution of magnetism, and its interaction with convective processes, drives various
plasma processes in the outer atmosphere. In the past few decades, a range of diagnostic techniques
have been employed to systematically study finer scale magnetized objects, and associated phenomena.
The patterns discerned became known as the ``Extended Solar Cycle'' (ESC). The patterns of the ESC
appeared to extend the wings of the activity butterfly back in time, nearly a decade before the formation
of the sunspot pattern, and to much higher solar latitudes. In this short review, we describe their
observational patterns of the ESC and discuss possible connections to the solar dynamo as we depart
on a multi-national collaboration to investigate the origins of solar magnetism through a blend
of archived and contemporary data analysis with the goal of improving solar dynamo understanding
and modeling.
