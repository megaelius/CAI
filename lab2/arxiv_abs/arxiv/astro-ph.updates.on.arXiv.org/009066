We investigate the physical properties of a sample of 52 Ly{\alpha} emitting galaxies in the VANDELS
survey, with particular focus on the role of kinematics and neutral hydrogen column density in the
escape and spatial distribution of Ly{\alpha} photons. For these galaxies, we derive different
physical properties and characterize the Ly{\alpha} emission in terms of kinematics, EW, FWHM
and spatial extension and then estimate the velocity of the neutral outflowing gas. We reproduce
some of the well known correlations between Ly{\alpha} EW and stellar mass, dust extinction and
UV \b{eta} slope, in the sense that the emission line appears brighter in lower mass, less dusty and
bluer galaxies. We do not find any correlation with the SED-derived star formation rate, while we
find that galaxies with brighter Ly{\alpha} tend to be more compact both in UV and in Ly{\alpha}.
Our data reveal a new interesting correlation between the Ly{\alpha} velocity and the offset of
the inter-stellar absorption lines with respect to the systemic redshift, in the sense that galaxies
with larger inter-stellar medium (ISM) out-flow velocities show smaller Ly{\alpha} velocity
shifts. We interpret this relation in the context of the shell-model scenario, where the velocity
of the ISM and the HI column density contribute together in determining the Ly{\alpha} kinematics.
In support to our interpretation, we observe that galaxies with high HI column densities have much
more extended Ly{\alpha} spatial profiles, a sign of increased scattering. However, we do not find
any evidence that the HI column density is related to any other physical properties of the galaxies,
although this might be due in part to the limited range of parameters that our sample spans.
