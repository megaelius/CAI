Information on the spectral shape of prompt emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRB) is mostly available
only at energies $\gtrsim10$ keV, where the main instruments for GRB detection are sensitive. The
origin of this emission is still very uncertain because of the apparent inconsistency with synchrotron
radiation, which is the most obvious candidate, and the resulting need for considering less straightforward
scenarios. The inclusion of data down to soft X-rays ($\sim$ 0.5 keV), which are available only in
a small fraction of GRBs, has firmly established the common presence of a spectral break in the low-energy
part of prompt spectra, and the consistency of the overall spectral shape with synchrotron radiation
in the moderately fast-cooling regime, the low-energy break being identified with the cooling
frequency. In this work we further extend the range of investigation down to the optical band. In
particular, we test the synchrotron interpretation by directly fitting a theoretically derived
synchrotron spectrum and making use of optical to gamma-ray data. Secondly, we test an alternative
model that considers the presence of a black-body component at $\sim$keV energies, in addition
to a non-thermal component that is responsible for the emission at the spectral peak (100 keV-1 MeV).
We find that synchrotron radiation provides a good description of the broadband data, while models
composed of a thermal and a non-thermal component require the introduction of a low-energy break
in the non-thermal component in order to be consistent with optical observations. Motivated by
the good quality of the synchrotron fits, we explore the physical parameter space of the emitting
region. In a basic prompt emission scenario we find quite contrived solutions for the magnetic field
strength (5 G $<B^\prime<40$ G) and for the location of the region where the radiation is produced
($R_\gamma>10^{16}$ cm).
