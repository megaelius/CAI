Natural satellite systems present a large variety of orbital configurations in the solar system.
While some are clearly the result of known processes, others still have largely unexplained eccentricity
and inclination values. Iapetus has a still unexplained 3% orbital eccentricity and its orbital
plane is tilted with respect to its local Laplace plane. On the other hand, astrometric measurements
of saturnian moons have revealed high tidal migration rates, corresponding to a quality factor
Q of Saturn of around 1600 for the mid-sized icy moons. We show how a past crossing of the 5:1 mean motion
resonance between Titan and Iapetus may be a plausible scenario to explain Iapetus' orbit. We have
carried out numerical simulations of the resonance crossing using an N-Body code as well as using
averaged equations of motion. A large span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus
was started on its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can trigger
a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus. The outcome of the resonance
is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a quality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic
evolution of Iapetus in the resonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with
a quality factor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with post-resonant eccentricities
spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations capable of reaching 11 degrees. Usually high inclinations
come with high eccentricities but some simulations show elements compatible with Iapetus' current
orbit. A quality factor between 100 and 2000 at the frequency of Titan would bring Titan and Iapetus
into a 5:1 resonance, which would perturb Iapetus' eccentricity and inclination to values observed
today. Such rapid tidal migration would have avoided Iapetus' ejection around 40 to 800 million
years ago.
