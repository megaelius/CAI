Aims. We present the second AGILE-GRID Catalog (2AGL) of {\gamma}-ray sources in the 100 MeV-10
GeV energy range. Methods. With respect to previous AGILE-GRID catalogs, the current 2AGL Catalog
is based on the first 2.3 years of science data from the AGILE mission (the so called 'pointing mode')
and incorporates more data and several analysis improvements, including better calibrations
at the event reconstruction level, an updated model for the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission,
a refined procedure for point-like source detection, and the inclusion of a search for extended
{\gamma}-ray sources. Results. The 2AGL Catalog includes 175 high-confidence sources (above
4{\sigma} significance) with their location regions and spectral properties, and a variability
analysis with 4-day light curves for the most significant ones. Relying on the error region of each
source position, including systematic uncertainties, 121 sources are considered as positionally
associated with known couterparts at different wavelengths or detected by other {\gamma}-ray
instruments. Among the identified or associated sources, 62 are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs)
of the blazar class. Pulsars represent the largest Galactic source class, with 40 associated pulsars,
7 of them with detected pulsation; 8 Supernova Remnants and 4 high-mass X-ray binaries have also
been identified. A substantial number of 2AGL sources are unidentified: for 54 sources no known
counterpart is found at different wavelengths. Among these sources, we discuss a sub-class of 29
AGILE-GRID-only {\gamma}-ray sources that are not present in 1FGL, 2FGL or 3FGL catalogs; the remaining
sources are unidentified in both 2AGL and 3FGL Catalogs. We also present an extension of the analysis
of 2AGL sources detected in the 50-100 MeV energy range.
