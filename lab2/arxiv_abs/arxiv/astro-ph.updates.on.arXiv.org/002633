Observational studies of halo stars during the last two decades have placed some limits on the quantity
and nature of accreted dwarf galaxy contributions to the Milky Way stellar halo by typically utilizing
stellar phase-space information to identify the most recent halo accretion events. In this study
we tested the prospects of using 2-D chemical abundance ratio distributions (CARDs) found in stars
of the stellar halo to determine its formation history. First, we used simulated data from eleven
"MW-like" halos to generate satellite template sets of 2-D CARDs of accreted dwarf satellites which
are comprised of accreted dwarfs from various mass regimes and epochs of accretion. Next, we randomly
drew samples of $\sim10^{3-4}$ mock observations of stellar chemical abundance ratios ([$\alpha$/Fe],
[Fe/H]) from those eleven halos to generate samples of the underlying densities for our CARDs to
be compared to our templates in our analysis. Finally, we used the expectation-maximization algorithm
to derive accretion histories in relation to the satellite template set (STS) used and the sample
size. For certain STS used we typically can identify the relative mass contributions of all accreted
satellites to within a factor of 2. We also find that this method is particularly sensitive to older
accretion events involving low-luminous dwarfs e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs - precisely those events
that are too ancient to be seen by phase-space studies of stars and too faint to be seen by high-z studies
of the early Universe. Since our results only exploit two chemical dimensions and near-future surveys
promise to provide $\sim6-9$ dimensions, we conclude that these new high-resolution spectroscopic
surveys of the stellar halo will allow us to recover its accretion history - and the luminosity function
of infalling dwarf galaxies - across cosmic time.
