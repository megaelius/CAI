The kinematics of the Milky Way disc as a function of age are well measured at the solar radius, but
have not been studied over a wider range of Galactocentric radii. Here, we measure the kinematics
of mono-age, mono-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ populations in the low and high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$
discs between $4 \lesssim R \lesssim 13$ kpc and $|z| \lesssim 2$ kpc using 65,719 stars in common
between APOGEE DR14 and $\it{Gaia}$ DR2 for which we estimate ages using a Bayesian neural network
model trained on asteroseismic ages. We determine the vertical and radial velocity dispersions,
finding that the low and high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ discs display markedly different age--velocity-dispersion
relations (AVRs) and shapes $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc has roughly
flat AVRs and constant $\sigma_z/\sigma_R = 0.64\pm 0.04$, whereas the low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$
disc has large variations in this ratio which positively correlate with the mean orbital radius
of the population at fixed age. The high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ disc component's flat AVRs and
constant $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ clearly indicates an entirely different heating history. Outer
disc populations also have flatter radial AVRs than those in the inner disc, likely due to the waning
effect of spiral arms. Our detailed measurements of AVRs and $\sigma_z/\sigma_R$ across the disc
indicate that low $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$, inner disc ($R \lesssim 10\,\mathrm{kpc}$) stellar
populations are likely dynamically heated by both giant molecular clouds and spiral arms, while
the observed trends for outer disc populations require a significant contribution from another
heating mechanism such as satellite perturbations. We also find that outer disc populations have
slightly positive mean vertical and radial velocities, likely because they are part of the warped
disc.
