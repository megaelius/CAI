Rings and radial gaps are ubiquitous in protoplanetary disks, yet their possible connection to
planet formation is currently subject to intense debates. In principle, giant planet formation
leads to wide gaps which separate the gas and dust mass reservoir in the outer disk, while lower mass
planets lead to shallow gaps which are manifested mainly on the dust component. We used the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to observe the star HD169142, host to a prominent
disk with deep wide gaps that sever the disk into inner and outer regions. The new ALMA high resolution
images allow for the outer ring to be resolved as three narrow rings. The HD169142 disk thus hosts
both the wide gaps trait of transition disks and a narrow ring system similar to those observed in
the TW Hya and HL Tau systems. The mass reservoir beyond a deep gap can thus host ring systems. The observed
rings are narrow in radial extent (width/radius of 1.5/57.3, 1.8/64.2 and 3.4/76.0, in au) and have
asymmetric mutual separations: the first and middle ring are separated by 7 au while the middle and
outermost ring are distanced by ~12 au. Using hydrodynamical modeling we found that a simple explanation,
involving a single migrating low mass planet (10 M$_\oplus$), entirely accounts for such an apparently
complex phenomenon. Inward migration of the planet naturally explains the ring's asymmetric mutual
separation. The isolation of HD169142's outer rings thus allows a proof of concept to interpret
the detailed architecture of the outer region of protoplanetary disks with low mass planet formation
of mini-Neptune's size, i.e. as in the protosolar nebula.
