We analyse the clustering of 22,361 quasars between redshift 2.2 < z < 2.9 observed with the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which are
included in the ninth data release (DR9). We fit the clustering results with a LCDM model to calculate
the linear bias of the quasar sample, b=3.74\pm 0.12. The measured value of bias is consistent with
the findings of White et al. (2012), where they analyse almost the same quasar sample, although only
in the range, s < 40 Mpc/h. Fitting the standard cosmological model at small and intermediate
scales (3-120 Mpc/h) of the quasar clustering produces a rejection at the 2.2 sigma significance
level. At larger scales we observe an excess or plateau in the clustering correlation function.
Including this large-scale feature in the fit produces a rejection of LCDM at the 2.7 sigma level.
By fitting a model that incorporates a scale dependent additional term in the bias introduced by
primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, we calculate the amplitude of the deviation from
the Gaussian initial conditions as 70< f_NL <190 at the 95% confidence level. We apply stricter
cuts on Galactic extinction, where after keeping regions with A_r < 0.14 mag we measure, 81<
f_NL < 170 at 95% CL. In this case the goodness-of-fit of LCDM shows a rejection of the model at a
significance level of 1.7 sigma. Investigating systematics further, we make corrections according
to the methods of Ross et al. (2011); Ho et al. (2012) and Ross et al. (2011, 2012b), with the f_NL measurements
after the application of the two methods being consistent with each other. We consider as our final
results on non-Gaussianity those originating after the correction of the sample with the weights
method of Ross et al. (2011, 2012b), giving 46< f_NL <158 at 95% confidence. The rejection
value of LCDM in this case is at the 2.3 sigma level.
