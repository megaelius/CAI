We have obtained deep images of the highly isolated (d = 1 Mpc) Aquarius dwarf irregular galaxy (DDO
210) with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The resulting color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) reaches more than a magnitude below the oldest main-sequence turnoff, allowing us
to derive the star formation history (SFH) over the entire lifetime of the galaxy with a timing precision
of ~10% of the lookback time. Using a maximum likelihood fit to the CMD we find that only ~10% of all
star formation in Aquarius took place more than 10 Gyr ago (lookback time equivalent to redshift
z ~2). The star formation rate increased dramatically ~6-8 Gyr ago (z ~ 0.7-1.1) and then declined
until the present time. The only known galaxy with a more extreme confirmed delay in star formation
is Leo A, a galaxy of similar M(HI)/M(stellar), dynamical mass, mean metallicity, and degree of
isolation. The delayed stellar mass growth in these galaxies does not track the mean dark matter
accretion rate from CDM simulations. The similarities between Leo A and Aquarius suggest that if
gas is not removed from dwarf galaxies by interactions or feedback, it can linger for several gigayears
without cooling in sufficient quantity to form stars efficiently. We discuss possible causes for
the delay in star formation including suppression by reionization and late-time mergers. We find
reasonable agreement between our measured SFHs and select cosmological simulations of isolated
dwarfs. Because star formation and merger processes are both stochastic in nature, delayed star
formation in various degees is predicted to be a characteristic (but not a universal) feature of
isolated small galaxies.
