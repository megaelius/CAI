Exoplanet discoveries have reached into the realm of terrestrial planets that are becoming the
subject of atmospheric studies. One such discovery is LHS 3844b, a 1.3 Earth radius planet in a 0.46
day orbit around an M4.5-5 dwarf star. Follow-up observations indicate that the planet is largely
devoid of substantial atmosphere. This lack of significant atmosphere places astrophysical and
geophysical constraints on LHS 3844b, primarily the degree of volatile outgassing and the rate
of atmosphere erosion. We estimate the age of the host star as $7.8\pm1.6$ Gyrs and find evidence
of an active past comparable to Proxima Centauri. We use geodynamical models of volcanic outgassing
and atmospheric erosion to show that the apparent lack of atmosphere is consistent with a volatile-poor
mantle for LHS 3844b. We show the core is unlikely to host enough C to produce a sufficiently volatile-poor
mantle, unless the bulk planet is volatile-poor relative to Earth. While we cannot rule out a giant
impact stripping LHS 3844b's atmosphere, we show this mechanism would require significant mantle
stripping, potentially leaving LHS 3844b as an Fe-rich "super-Mercury". Atmospheric erosion
by smaller impacts is possible, but only if the planet has already begun degassing and is bombarded
by $10^3$ impactors of radius 500-1000 km traveling at escape velocity. We discuss formation and
migration scenarios that could account for a volatile poor origin, including the potential for
an unobserved massive companion planet. A relatively volatile-poor composition of LHS 3844b suggests
that the planet formed interior to the system snow-line.
