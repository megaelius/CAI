Proxima b is a terrestrial-mass planet in the habitable-zone of Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri's
high stellar activity however casts doubt on the habitability of Proxima b: sufficiently bright
and frequent flares and any associated proton events may destroy the planet's ozone layer, allowing
lethal levels of UV flux to reach its surface. In March 2016, the Evryscope observed the first naked-eye-visible
superflare detected from Proxima Centauri. Proxima increased in brightness by a factor of ~68 during
the superflare and released a bolometric energy of 10^33.5 erg, ~10X larger than any previously-detected
flare from Proxima. Over the last two years the Evryscope has recorded 23 other large Proxima flares
ranging in bolometric energy from 10^30.6 erg to 10^32.4 erg; coupling those rates with the single
superflare detection, we predict at least five superflares occur each year. Simultaneous high-resolution
HARPS spectroscopy during the Evryscope superflare constrains the superflare's UV spectrum and
any associated coronal mass ejections. We use these results and the Evryscope flare rates to model
the photochemical effects of NOx atmospheric species generated by particle events from this extreme
stellar activity, and show that the repeated flaring is sufficient to reduce the ozone of an Earth-like
atmosphere by 90% within five years. We estimate complete depletion occurs within several hundred
kyr. The UV light produced by the Evryscope superflare therefore reached the surface with ~100X
the intensity required to kill simple UV-hardy microorganisms, suggesting that life would struggle
to survive in the areas of Proxima b exposed to these flares.
