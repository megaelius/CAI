We use mid-infrared Spitzer spectroscopy and far-infrared Herschel photometry for a sample of
twenty main sequence O9--B2 stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with strong 24 micron excesses
to investigate the origin of the mid-IR emission. Either debris disks around the stars or illuminated
patches of dense interstellar medium (ISM) can cause such mid-IR emission. In a companion paper,
Paper I, we use optical spectroscopy to show that it is unlikely for any of these sources to be classical
Be stars or Herbig Ae/Be stars. We focus our analysis on debris disks and cirrus hot spots. We find
three out of twenty stars to be significantly extended in the mid-IR, establishing them as cirrus
hot spots. We then fit the IR spectral energy distributions to determine dust temperatures and masses.
We find the dust masses in the SMC stars to be larger than for any known debris disks, although this
evidence against the debris disk hypothesis is circumstantial. Finally, we created a local comparison
sample of bright mid-IR OB stars in the Milky Way (MW) by cross-matching the WISE and Hipparcos catalogs.
All such local stars in the appropriate luminosity range that can be unambiguously classified are
young stars with optical emission lines or are spatially resolved by WISE with sizes too large to
be plausible debris disk candidates. We conclude that the very strong mid-IR flux excesses are most
likely explained as cirrus hot spots, although we cannot rigorously rule out that a small fraction
of the sample is made up of debris disks or transition disks. We present suggestive evidence that
bow-shock heating around runaway stars may be a contributing mechanism to the interstellar emission.
These sources, interpreted as cirrus hot spots, offer a new localised probe of diffuse interstellar
dust in a low metallicity environment. (Abridged)
