Aims. We examined the characteristics of isolated intermediate drift bursts (IMDs) and their morphologies
on dynamic spectra, in particular the positioning of emission and absorption ridges and the repetition
rate of fiber groups. These were compared with a model in order to determine the conditions under
which the IMDs appear and exhibit the above characteristics. Methods. We analyzed sixteen metric
type IV events with embedded IMDs. The events were recorded with the Artemis-JLS/SAO high resolution
(10 ms cadence) receiver in the 270-450MHz range with a frequency resolution of 1.4 MHz. We developed
cross- and autocorrelation techniques to measure the duration, spectral width, and frequency
drift of fiber bursts in 47 IMD groups. We also developed a semi-automatic algorithm to track fibers
on dynamic spectra. Results. We distinguish six morphological groups of fibers, based on the relative
position of the emission and absorption ridges. These included fibers with emission or absorption
ridges only, fibers with the absorption ridge at lower or higher frequency than the emission, or
with two absorption ridges above and below the emission or with two emission ridges were separated
by an absorption ridge. Some borderline cases of IMDs with very high drift rate (~0.30 s-1) or very
narrow total bandwidth (~8 MHz) were recorded; among them a group of rope-like IMDs with fast repetition
rate and relatively narrow total frequency extent. The whistler hypothesis leads to reasonable
magnetic field (~4.6 G), but the Alfven-wave hypothesis requires much higher field. We estimated
the ratio of the whistler to the cyclotron frequency, x, to be ~ 0.3 to 0.6 and the average frequency
scale along the loop of ~220Mm. We present empirical relations between fiber burst parameters and
discuss their possible origin.
