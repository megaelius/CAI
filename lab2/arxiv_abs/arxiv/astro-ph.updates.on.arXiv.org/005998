We present a detailed morphological study of TeV gamma rays, synchrotron radiation, and interstellar
gas in the young Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 86. We find that the interstellar atomic gas shows
good spatial correlation with the gamma rays, indicating that the TeV gamma rays from RCW 86 are likely
to be dominantly of hadronic origin. In contrast, the spatial correlation between the interstellar
molecular cloud and the TeV gamma rays is poor in the southeastern shell of the SNR. We argue that this
poor correlation can be attributed to the low-energy cosmic rays (~ 1 TeV) not penetrating into the
dense molecular cloud due to an enhancement of the turbulent magnetic field around the dense cloud
of ~ 10-100 $\mu$G. We also find that the southwestern shell, which is bright in both synchrotron
X-ray and radio continuum radiation, shows a significant gamma-ray excess compared with the interstellar
proton column density, suggesting that leptonic gamma rays via inverse Compton scattering possibly
contributes along with hadronic gamma rays. The total cosmic-ray energies of the young TeV gamma-ray
SNRs$-$RX J1713.7$-$3946, Vela Jr, HESS J1731$-$347, and RCW 86$-$are roughly similar, which
indicates that cosmic rays can be accelerated in both the core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae.
The total energy of cosmic rays derived using the gas density, ~ 10$^{48}$-10$^{49}$ erg, gives
a safe lower limit due mainly to the low filling factor of interstellar gas within the shell. We also
note that the index of the proton spectrum is possibly related with the abundance ratio of atomic
to molecular gases, which corresponds to the inhomogeneity of interstellar gas.
