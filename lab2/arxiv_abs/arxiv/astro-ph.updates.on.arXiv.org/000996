Biosignature gas detection is one of the ultimate future goals for exoplanet atmosphere studies.
We have created a framework for linking biosignature gas detectability to biomass estimates, including
atmospheric photochemistry and biological thermodynamics. The new framework is intended to liberate
predictive atmosphere models from requiring fixed, Earth-like biosignature gas source fluxes.
New biosignature gases can be considered with a check that the biomass estimate is physically plausible.
We have validated the models on terrestrial production of NO, H2S, CH4, CH3Cl, and DMS. We have applied
the models to propose NH3 as a biosignature gas on a "cold Haber World," a planet with a N2-H2 atmosphere,
and to demonstrate why gases such as CH3Cl must have too large of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature
gas on planets with Earth or early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a Sun-like star. To construct
the biomass models, we developed a functional classification of biosignature gases, and found
that gases (such as CH4, H2S, and N2O) produced from life that extracts energy from chemical potential
energy gradients will always have false positives because geochemistry has the same gases to work
with as life does, and gases (such as DMS and CH3Cl) produced for secondary metabolic reasons are
far less likely to have false positives but because of their highly specialized origin are more likely
to be produced in small quantities. The biomass model estimates are valid to one or two orders of magnitude;
the goal is an independent approach to testing whether a biosignature gas is plausible rather than
a precise quantification of atmospheric biosignature gases and their corresponding biomasses.
