We investigate the statistical dependence of the peak intrinsic colors of Type Ia supernovae (SN
Ia) on their expansion velocities at maximum light, measured from the Si II 6355 spectral feature.
We construct a new hierarchical Bayesian regression model, accounting for the random effects of
intrinsic scatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust, and implement a Gibbs
sampler and deviance information criteria to estimate the correlation. The method is applied to
the apparent colors from BVRI light curves and Si II velocity data for 79 nearby SNe Ia. The apparent
color distributions of high (HV) and normal velocity (NV) supernovae exhibit significant discrepancies
for B-V and B-R, but not other colors. Hence, they are likely due to intrinsic color differences originating
in the B-band, rather than dust reddening. The mean intrinsic B-V and B-R color differences between
HV and NV groups are 0.06 +/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 mag, respectively. A linear model finds significant
slopes of -0.021 +/- 0.006 and -0.030 +/- 0.009 mag/(1000 km/s) for intrinsic B-V and B-R colors versus
velocity, respectively. Since the ejecta velocity distribution is skewed towards high velocities,
these effects imply non-Gaussian intrinsic color distributions with skewness up to +0.3. Accounting
for the intrinsic color-velocity correlation results in corrections to A_V extinction estimates
as large as -0.12 mag for HV SNe Ia and +0.06 mag for NV events. Velocity measurements from SN Ia spectra
have potential to diminish systematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust
reddening affecting supernova distances.
