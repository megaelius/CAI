Stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that the brightest clusters in
the Galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. If the present Galactic
globular clusters formed within larger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal
halos and/or tails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems. The stellar
surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the best places to look for the remnants
of an ancient dwarf galaxy. Here an attempt is made to search for tidal debris around the supernovae
enriched globular clusters M22 and NGC 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster NGC 3201.
The stellar parameters from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) are used to identify stars with
RAVE metallicities, radial velocities and elemental-abundances consistent with the abundance
patterns and properties of the stars in M22, NGC 1851 and NGC 3201. The discovery of RAVE stars that
may be associated with M22 and NGC 1851 are reported, some of which are at projected distances of ~10
degrees away from the core of these clusters. Numerous RAVE stars associated with NGC 3201 suggest
that either the tidal radius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound stars
extending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. No further extra-tidal stars associated
with NGC 3201 could be identified. The bright magnitudes of the RAVE stars make them easy targets
for high resolution follow-up observations, allowing an eventual further chemical tagging to
solidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidal debris. In both our radial
velocity histograms of the regions surrounding NGC 1851 and NGC 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is
seen, consistent with extended tidal debris from omega Centauri.
