Spectra for 2D stars in the 1.5D approximation are created from synthetic spectra of 1D non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) spherical model atmospheres produced by the PHOENIX code. The
1.5D stars have the spatially averaged Rayleigh-Jeans flux of a K3-4 III star, while varying the
temperature difference between the two 1D component models ($\Delta T_{\mathrm{1.5D}}$), and
the relative surface area covered. Synthetic observable quantities from the 1.5D stars are fitted
with quantities from NLTE and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) 1D models to assess the errors
in inferred $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ values from assuming horizontal homogeneity and LTE. Five different
quantities are fit to determine the $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ of the 1.5D stars: UBVRI photometric colors,
absolute surface flux SEDs, relative SEDs, continuum normalized spectra, and TiO band profiles.
In all cases except the TiO band profiles, the inferred $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ value increases with
increasing $\Delta T_{\mathrm{1.5D}}$. In all cases, the inferred $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ value
from fitting 1D LTE quantities is higher than from fitting 1D NLTE quantities and is approximately
constant as a function of $\Delta T_{\mathrm{1.5D}}$ within each case. The difference between
LTE and NLTE for the TiO bands is caused indirectly by the NLTE temperature structure of the upper
atmosphere, as the bands are computed in LTE. We conclude that the difference between $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$
values derived from NLTE and LTE modelling is relatively insensitive to the degree of the horizontal
inhomogeneity of the star being modeled, and largely depends on the observable quantity being fit.
