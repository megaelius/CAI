Hot Jupiters (HJs) are short-period giant planets that are observed around $\sim 1\%$ of solar-type
field stars. One possible formation scenario for HJs is high-eccentricity (high-$e$) migration,
in which the planet forms at much larger radii, is excited to high eccentricity by some mechanism,
and migrates to its current orbit due to tidal dissipation occurring near periapsis. We consider
high-$e$ migration in dense stellar systems such as the cores of globular clusters (GCs), in which
encounters with passing stars can excite planets to the high eccentricities needed to initiate
migration. We study this process via Monte-Carlo simulations of encounters with a star+planet
system including the effects of tidal dissipation, using an efficient regularized restricted
three-body code. HJs are produced in our simulations over a significant range of the stellar number
density $n_\star$. Assuming the planet is initially on a low-eccentricity orbit with semimajor
axis 1 AU, for $n_\star \lesssim 10^3\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$ the encounter rate is too low to induce
orbital migration, whereas for $n_\star \gtrsim 10^6\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$ HJ formation is suppressed
because the planet is more likely ejected from its host star, tidally disrupted, or transferred
to a perturbing star. The fraction of planets that are converted to HJs peaks at $\approx 2\%$ for
intermediate number densities of $\approx 4\times 10^4\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$. Warm Jupiters,
giant planets with periods between 10 and 100 days, are produced in our simulations with an efficiency
of up to $\approx 0.5\%$. Our results suggest that HJs can form through high-$e$ migration induced
by stellar encounters in the centers of of dense GCs, but not in their outskirts where the densities
are lower.
