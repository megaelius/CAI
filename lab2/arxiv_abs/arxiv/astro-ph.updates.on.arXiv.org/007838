Star-forming galaxies can in principle be transformed into passive systems by a multitude of processes
that quench star formation, such as the halting of gas accretion or the rapid removal of gas in AGN-driven
outflows. However, it remains unclear which processes are the most significant, primary drivers
of the SF-passive bimodality. We address this key issue in galaxy evolution by studying the chemical
properties of 80,000 local galaxies in SDSS DR7. In order to distinguish between different quenching
mechanisms, we analyse the systematic difference in mass-weighted stellar metallicity between
star-forming, green valley and passive galaxies. Our analysis reveals that the star-forming progenitors
of massive ($M_* \sim 10^{11}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) local passive galaxies quenched primarily
through starvation over a time-scale of 2 Gyr, before any future star formation was abruptly halted
by an ejective or heating mode. We find that outflows played a minor role in quenching the progenitors
of massive galaxies, but were of increasing importance in quenching the progenitors of low-mass
($M_* < 10^{10}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) passive galaxies over a typical time-scale of 5 Gyr. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that local green valley galaxies have typically been quenching through starvation
for 3.5 Gyr, indicating that galaxies in the local Universe quench more slowly than their counterparts
at higher redshift. Finally, we find that the quenching of central galaxies is independent of the
environment. In contrast, we find that environmental effects contributed to the starvation of
low-mass satellite galaxies in very dense environments.
