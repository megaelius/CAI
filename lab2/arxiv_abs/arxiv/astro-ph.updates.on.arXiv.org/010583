The James Webb Space Telescope will offer high-angular resolution observing capability in the
near-infrared with masking interferometry on NIRISS, and coronagraphic imaging on NIRCam & MIRI.
Full aperture kernel-phase based interferometry complements these observing modes, probing
for companions at small separations while preserving the telescope throughput. Our goal is to derive
both theoretical and operational contrast detection limits for the kernel-phase analysis of JWST
NIRISS full-pupil observations by using tools from hypothesis testing theory, applied to observations
of faint brown dwarfs with this instrument, but the tools and methods introduced here are applicable
in a wide variety of contexts. We construct a statistically independent set of observables from
aberration-robust kernel phases. Three detection tests based on these observable quantities
are designed and analysed, all guaranteeing a constant false alarm rate for small phase aberrations.
One of these tests, the Likelihood Ratio or Neyman-Pearson test, provides a theoretical performance
bound for any detection test. The operational detection method considered here is shown to exhibit
only marginal power loss with respect to the theoretical bound. In principle, for the test set to
a false alarm probability of 1%, companion at contrasts reaching 10^3 at separations of 200 mas around
objects of magnitude 14.1 are detectable. With JWST NIRISS, contrasts of up to 10^4 at separations
of 200 mas could be ultimately achieved, barring significant wavefront drift. The proposed detection
method is close to the ultimate bound and offers guarantees over the probability of making a false
detection for binaries, as well as over the error bars for the estimated parameters of the binaries
detectable by JWST NIRISS. This method is not only applicable to JWST NIRISS but to any imaging system
with adequate sampling.
