We present a uniform assessment of existing near-infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations
of planet-bearing stars. Using a simple four-parameter blackbody thermal model, we analyze stars
for which photometry in at least one of Spitzer's IRAC bands has been obtained over either the entirety
or a significant fraction of the planetary orbit. Systems in this category comprise ten well-studied
systems with Hot Jupiters on circular or near-circular orbits (HAT-P-7, HD 149026, HD 189733, HD
209458, WASP-12, WASP-14, WASP-18, WASP-19, WASP-33, and WASP-43), as well as three stars harboring
planets on significantly eccentric orbits (GJ 436, HAT-P-2, and HD 80606). We find that our simple
model, in almost all cases, accurately reproduces the minimum and maximum planetary emission,
as well as the phase offsets of these extrema with respect to transits/secondary eclipses. For one
notable exception, WASP-12 b, adding an additional parameter to account for its tidal distortion
is not sufficient to reproduce its photometric features. Full-orbit photometry is available in
multiple wavelengths for 10 planets. We find that the returned parameter values for independent
fits to each band are largely in agreement. However, disagreements in night-side temperature suggest
distinct atmospheric layers, each with their own characteristic minimum temperature. In addition,
a diversity in albedos suggests variation in opacity of the photospheres. While previous works
have pointed out trends in photometric features based on system properties, we cannot conclusively
identify analogous trends for physical model parameters. To make the connection between full-phase
data and physical models more robust, a higher signal-to-noise must come from both increased resolution
and a careful treatment of instrumental systematics.
