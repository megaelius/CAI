Eclipsing post-common envelope binaries are highly important for resolving the poorly understood,
very short-lived common envelope phase. Most hot subdwarfs (sdO/Bs) are the bare He-burning cores
of red giants which have lost almost all of their hydrogen envelopes. This mass loss is often triggered
by common envelope interactions with close stellar or even sub-stellar companions. In the recently
published catalog of eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge and in the ATLAS survey, we discovered
161 new eclipsing systems showing a reflection effect by visual inspection of the light curves and
using a machine-learning algorithm. The EREBOS (Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries from Optical
Surveys) project aims at analyzing all newly discovered eclipsing binaries with reflection effect
based on a spectroscopic and photometric follow up. To constrain the nature of the primary we derived
the absolute magnitude and the reduced proper motion of all our targets with the help of the parallaxes
and proper motions measured by the Gaia mission and compared those to the Gaia white dwarf catalogue.
For a sub-set of our targets with observed spectra the nature could be derived by measuring the atmospheric
parameter of the primary confirming that less than 10\% of our systems are not sdO/Bs with cool companions
but white dwarfs or central stars of planetary nebula. This large sample of eclipsing hot subdwarfs
with cool companions allowed us to derive a significant period distribution for hot subdwarfs with
cool companions for the first time showing that the period distribution is much broader than previously
thought and ideally suited to find the lowest mass companions to hot subdwarf stars. In the future
several new photometric surveys will be carried out, which will increase the sample of this project
even more giving the potential to test many aspects of common envelope theory and binary evolution.
