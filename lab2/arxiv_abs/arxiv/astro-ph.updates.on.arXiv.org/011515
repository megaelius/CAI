The mechanisms that drive disk winds are a window into the physical processes that underlie the disk.
Stellar-mass black holes are an ideal setting in which to explore these mechanisms, in part because
their outbursts span a broad range in mass accretion rate. We performed a spectral analysis of the
disk wind found in six Chandra/HETG observations of the black hole candidate 4U~1630$-$472, covering
a range of luminosities over two distinct spectral states. We modeled both wind absorption and extended
wind re-emission components using PION, a self-consistent photoionized absorption model. In
all but one case, two photoionization zones were required in order to obtain acceptable fits. Two
independent constraints on launching radii, obtained via the ionization parameter formalism
and the dynamical broadening of the re-emission, helped characterize the geometry of the wind.
The innermost wind components ($r \simeq {10}^{2-3}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) tend towards small volume
filling factors, high ionization, densities up to $n \simeq {10}^{15-16} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$,
and outflow velocities of $\sim 0.003c$. These small launching radii and large densities require
magnetic driving, as they are inconsistent with numerical and analytical treatments of thermally
driven winds. Outer wind components ($r \simeq {10}^{5}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) are significantly less
ionized and have filling factors near unity. Their larger launching radii, lower densities ($n
\simeq {10}^{12} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$), and outflow velocities ($\sim 0.0007c$) are nominally
consistent with thermally driven winds. The overall wind structure suggests that these components
may also be part of a broader MHD outflow and perhaps better described as magneto-thermal hybrid
winds.
