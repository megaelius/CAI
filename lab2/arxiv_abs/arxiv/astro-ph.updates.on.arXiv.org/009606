Studies on extraterrestrial civilisations in Russia date back to the end of the 19th century. The
modern period of SETI studies began in the USSR in the early 1960s. The first edition of the I.S. Shklovsky's
book {\it Universe, Life, Intelligence} published in 1962 was a founding stone of SETI research
in the USSR. A number of observational projects in radio and optical domains were conducted in the
1960s - 1990s. Theoretical studies focused on defining optimal spectral domains for search of artificial
electromagnetic signals, selection of celestial targets in search for ETI, optimal methods for
encoding and decoding of interstellar messages, estimating the magnitude of astro-engineering
activity of ETI, and developing philosophical background of the SETI problem. Later, in the 1990s
and in the first two decades of the 21st century, in spite of acute underfunding and other problems
facing the scientific community in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, SETI-oriented
research continued. In particular, SETI collaborations conducted a number of surveys of Sun-like
stars in the Milky Way, searched for Dyson spheres and artificial optical signals. Several space
broadcasting programs were conducted too, including a radio transmission toward selected stars.
Serious rethinking was given to incentives for passive and active participation of space civilisations
in SETI and CETI. This paper gives an overview of past SETI activities. It also gives a comprehensive
list of publications by authors from Russia, the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet space, as well
as some SETI publications by other authors. The rich heritage of SETI research presented in the paper
might offer a potentially useful background and starting point for developing strategy and specific
research programs of the near future.
