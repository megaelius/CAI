HD50138 is a Herbig B[e] star with a circumstellar disc detected at IR and mm wavelength. Its brightness
makes it a good candidate for NIR interferometry observations. We aim to resolve, spatially and
spectrally, the continuum and hydrogen emission lines in the 2.12-2.47 micron region, to shed light
on the immediate circumstellar environment of the star. VLTI/AMBER K-band observations provide
spectra, visibilities, differential phases, and closure phases along three long baselines for
the continuum, and HI emission in Br$\gamma$ and five high-n Pfund lines. By computing the pure-line
visibilities, we derive the angular size of the different line-emitting regions. A simple LTE model
was created to constrain the physical conditions of HI emitting region. The continuum region cannot
be reproduced by a geometrical 2D elongated Gaussian fitting model. We estimate the size of the region
to be 1 au. We find the Br$\gamma$ and Pfund lines come from a more compact region of size 0.4 au. The
Br$\gamma$ line exhibits an S-shaped differential phase, indicative of rotation. The continuum
and Br$\gamma$ line closure phase show offsets of $\sim$-25$\pm$5 $^o$ and 20$\pm$10$^o$, respectively.
This is evidence of an asymmetry in their origin, but with opposing directions. We find that we cannot
converge on constraints for the HI physical parameters without a more detailed model. Our analysis
reveals that HD50138 hosts a complex circumstellar environment. Its continuum emission cannot
be reproduced by a simple disc brightness distribution. Similarly, several components must be
evoked to reproduce the interferometric observables within the Br$\gamma$, line. Combining the
spectroscopic and interferometric data of the Br$\gamma$ and Pfund lines favours an origin in a
wind region with a large opening angle. Finally, our results point to an evolved source.
