Our objective is to investigate the physical properties of the ionised gas of the low-metallicity
dwarf galaxy, IC 10, at various spatial scales: from individual HII regions to the entire galaxy
scale and examine whether diagnostics for integrated measurements introduce bias in the results.
We modeled the ionised gas combining the mid- and far-infrared fine-structure cooling lines observed
with Spitzer/IRS and Herschel/PACS, with the photoionisation code Cloudy. The free parameters
of the models are the age of the stellar cluster, the density and the ionisation parameter of the ionised
gas as well as the depth of the cloud. The latter is used to investigate the leakage of the ionising
photons from the analysed regions of IC 10. We investigate HII regions in the main star-forming body,
on scales of ~25 pc, three in the main star-forming region in the center of the galaxy and two on the
first arc. We then consider larger sizes on the scale of ~200 pc. We find that most clumps have nearly
identical properties, density ~10$^{2.} $ - 10$^{2.6}$ cm$^{-3}$, ionisation parameter between
10$^{-2.2}$ and 10$^{-1.6}$ and age of the stellar cluster ~5.5 Myr. All of them are matter-bounded
regions, allowing ionising photons to leak. The relatively uniform physical properties of the
clumps suggest a common origin for their star formation activity, which could be related to the feedback
from stellar winds or supernovae of a previous generation of stars. The properties derived for ~200
pc size "zones" have similar properties as the HII regions they encompass, but with the larger regions
tending to be more radiation-bounded. Finally, we investigate the fraction of [CII] 157.7 {\mu}m,
[SiII] 34.8 {\mu}m, and [FeII] 25.9 {\mu}m, emission arising from the ionised gas phase and we find
that most of the emission originates from the neutral gas, not from the ionised gas.
