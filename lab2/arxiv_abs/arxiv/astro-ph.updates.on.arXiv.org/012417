This paper aims at providing a comprehensive framework to generate an astrophysical scene and to
simulate realistic hyperspectral and multispectral data acquired by two JWST instruments, namely
NIRCam Imager and NIRSpec IFU. We want to show that this simulation framework can be resorted to assess
the benefits of fusing these images to recover an image of high spatial and spectral resolutions.
To do so, we create a synthetic scene associated with a canonical infrared source, the Orion Bar.
This scene combines pre-existing modelled spectra provided by the JWST Early Release Science Program
1288 and real high resolution spatial maps from the Hubble space and ALMA telescopes. We develop
forward models including corresponding noises for the two JWST instruments based on their technical
designs and physical features. JWST observations are then simulated by applying the forward models
to the aforementioned synthetic scene. We test a dedicated fusion algorithm we developed on these
simulated observations. We show the fusion process reconstructs the high spatio-spectral resolution
scene with a good accuracy on most areas, and we identify some limitations of the method to be tackled
in future works. The synthetic scene and observations presented in the paper are made publicly available
and can be used for instance to evaluate instrument models (aboard the JWST or on the ground), pipelines,
or more sophisticated algorithms dedicated to JWST data analysis. Besides, fusion methods such
as the one presented in this paper are shown to be promising tools to fully exploit the unprecedented
capabilities of the JWST.
