Context. Classical novae are explosive phenomena that take place in stellar binary systems. They
are powered by mass transfer from a low-mass main sequence star onto a white dwarf (either CO or ONe).
The material accumulates for 10+4 - 10+5 yr until ignition under degenerate conditions, resulting
in a thermonuclear runaway. The nuclear energy released produces peak temperatures of about 0.1
- 0.4 GK. During these events, 10-7 - 10-3 Msun enriched in intermediate-mass elements (with respect
to solar abundances) are ejected into the interstellar medium. However, the origin of the large
metallicity enhancements and the inhomogeneous distribution of chemical species observed in
high-resolution spectra of ejected nova shells is not fully understood. Aims. Recent multidimensional
simulations have demonstrated that Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that operate at the core-envelope
interface can naturally produce self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with material from the
underlying white dwarf at levels that agree with observations. However, such multidimensional
simulations have been performed for a small number of cases, and much of the parameter space remains
unexplored. Methods. Here we investigate the dredge-up, driven by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities,
for white dwarf masses in the range 0.8-1.25 Msun and different core compositions (CO-rich and ONe-rich
substrates). We present a set of five numerical simulations performed in two dimensions aimed at
analyzing the possible impact of the white dwarf mass (and composition) on the metallicity enhancement
and on the explosion characteristics. Results. We observe greater mixing (about 30 per cent higher
when measured in the same conditions), at the time we stop the simulations, and more energetic outbursts
for ONe-rich substrates than for CO-rich substrates and for more massive white dwarfs.
