We combine state-of-the-art models for the production of stellar radiation and its transfer through
the interstellar medium (ISM) to investigate ultraviolet-line diagnostics of stars, the ionized
and the neutral ISM in star-forming galaxies. We start by assessing the reliability of our stellar
population synthesis modelling by fitting absorption-line indices in the ISM-free ultraviolet
spectra of 10 Large-Magellanic-Cloud clusters. In doing so, we find that neglecting stochastic
sampling of the stellar initial mass function in these young ($\sim10$-100 Myr), low-mass clusters
affects negligibly ultraviolet-based age and metallicity estimates but can lead to significant
overestimates of stellar mass. Then, we proceed and develop a simple approach, based on an idealized
description of the main features of the ISM, to compute in a physically consistent way the combined
influence of nebular emission and interstellar absorption on ultraviolet spectra of star-forming
galaxies. Our model accounts for the transfer of radiation through the ionized interiors and outer
neutral envelopes of short-lived stellar birth clouds, as well as for radiative transfer through
a diffuse intercloud medium. We use this approach to explore the entangled signatures of stars,
the ionized and the neutral ISM in ultraviolet spectra of star-forming galaxies. We find that, aside
from a few notable exceptions, most standard ultraviolet indices defined in the spectra of ISM-free
stellar populations are prone to significant contamination by the ISM, which increases with metallicity.
We also identify several nebular-emission and interstellar-absorption features, which stand
out as particularly clean tracers of the different phases of the ISM.
