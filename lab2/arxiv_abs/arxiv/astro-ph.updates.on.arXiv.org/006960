We present space-based ultraviolet/optical photometry and spectroscopy with the Swift Ultra-Violet/Optical
Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope, respectively, along with ground-based optical photometry
and spectroscopy and near-infrared spectroscopy of supernova SN2017erp. The optical light curves
and spectra are consistent with a normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia). Compared to previous photometric
samples in the near-ultraviolet (NUV), SN2017erp has colors similar to the NUV-red category after
correcting for Milky Way and host dust reddening. We find the difference between SN2017erp and the
NUV-blue SN2011fe is not consistent with dust reddening alone but is similar to the SALT color law,
derived from rest-frame UV photometry of higher redshift SNe Ia. This chromatic difference is dominated
by the intrinsic differences in the UV and only a small contribution from the expected dust reddening.
Differentiating the two can have important consequences for determining cosmological distances
with rest-frame UV photometry. This spectroscopic series is important for analyzing SNe Ia with
intrinsically redder NUV colors. We also show model comparisons suggesting that metallicity could
be the physical difference between NUV-blue and NUV-red SNe Ia, with emission peaks from reverse
fluorescence near 3000 Angstroms implying a factor of ten higher metallicity in the upper layers
of SN2017erp compared to SN~2011fe. Metallicity estimates are very model dependent however, and
there are multiple effects in the UV. Further models and UV spectra of SNe Ia are needed to explore
the diversity of SNe Ia which show seemingly independent differences in the near-UV peaks and mid-UV
flux levels.
