We present observational data of a molecular line survey toward the nearby galaxies NGC 1068, NGC
253, and IC 342 at the wavelengths of 3 mm ($\sim$85--116 GHz) obtained with the Nobeyama 45 m radio
telescope. In IC 342 the line survey with high spectral resolution at the 3 mm region was reported
for the first time. NGC 1068 is a nearby gas-rich galaxy with X-rays from an active galactic nucleus
(AGN), and NGC 253 and IC 342 are nearby gas-rich galaxies with prototypical starbursts. These galaxies
are useful to study the impacts of X-rays and ultraviolet radiation on molecular abundances. The
survey was carried out with the resulting rms noise level of a few mK ($T\rm{_A^*}$). As a result we
could obtain almost complete data of these galaxies at the 3 mm region: We detected 19--23 molecular
species depending on the galaxies including several new detections (e.g., cyclic-C$_3$H$_2$
in IC 342). We found that the intensities of HCN, CN, and HC$_3$N relative to $^{13}$CO are significantly
strong in NGC 1068 compared to those in NGC 253 and IC 342. On the other hand, CH$_3$CCH was not detected
in NGC 1068. We obtained these results with the narrow beam (15$''$.2--19$''$.1) of the 45 m telescope
among the single-dish telescopes, and in particular selectively observed the molecular gas close
to the circumnuclear disk (CND) in NGC 1068. Our line intensities in NGC 1068 were compared to those
obtained with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope already reported. As a result, the intensity ratio of
each line was found to have information on the spatial distribution. Our observations obtained
the line intensities and stringent constraints on the upper limit for the three galaxies with such
narrow beam, and consequently, the data will be a basis for further observations with high spatial
resolution.
