New photometric space missions to detect and characterise transiting exoplanets are focusing
on bright stars to obtain high cadence, high signal-to-noise light curves. Since these missions
will be sensitive to stellar oscillations and granulation even for dwarf stars, they will be limited
by stellar variability. We tested the performance of Gaussian process (GP) regression on the characterisation
of transiting planets, and in particular to determine how many components of variability are necessary
to describe high cadence, high signal-to-noise light curves expected from CHEOPS and PLATO. We
found that the best GP stellar variability model contains four to five variability components:
one stellar oscillation component, two to four granulation components, and/or one rotational
modulation component. This high number of components is in contrast with the one-component GP model
(1GP) commonly used in the literature for transit characterisation. Therefore, we compared the
performance of the best multi-component GP model with the 1GP model in the derivation of transit
parameters of simulated transits. We found that for Jupiter- and Neptune-size planets the best
multi-component GP model is slightly better than the 1GP model, and much better than the non-GP model
that gives biased results. For Earth-size planets, the 1GP model fails to retrieve the transit because
it is a poor description of stellar activity. The non-GP model gives some biased results and the best
multi-component GP is capable of retrieving the correct transit model parameters. We conclude
that when characterising transiting exoplanets with high signal-to-noise ratios and high cadence
light curves, we need models that couple the description of stellar variability with the transits
analysis, like GPs. Moreover, for Earth-like exoplanets a better description of stellar variability
improves the planetary characterisation.
