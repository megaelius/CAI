Gas plays a major role in the dynamical evolution of protoplanetary discs. Its coupling with the
dust is the key to our understanding planetary formation. Studying the gas content is therefore
a crucial step towards understanding protoplanetary discs evolution. Such a study can be made through
spectroscopic observations of emission lines in the far-infrared, where some of the most important
gas coolants emit, such as the [OI] 3P1-3 P2 transition at 63.18 microns. We aim at characterising
the gas content of protoplanetary discs in the intermediate-aged Chamaeleon II (Cha II) star forming
region. We also aim at characterising the gaseous detection fractions within this age range, which
is an essential step tracing gas evolution with age in different star forming regions. We obtained
Herschel-PACS line scan spectroscopic observations at 63 microns of 19 Cha II Class I and II stars.
The observations were used to trace [OI] and o-H2O at 63 microns. The analysis of the spatial distribution
of [OI], when extended, can be used to understand the origin of the emission. We have detected [OI]
emission toward seven out of the nineteen systems observed, and o-H2O emission at 63.32 microns
in just one of them, Sz 61. Cha II members show a correlation between [OI] line fluxes and the continuum
at 70 microns, similar to what is observed in Taurus. We analyse the extended [OI] emission towards
the star DK Cha and study its dynamical footprints in the PACS Integral Field Unit (IFU). We conclude
that there is a high velocity component from a jet combined with a low velocity component with an origin
that may be a combination of disc, envelope and wind emission. The stacking of spectra of objects
not detected individually in [OI] leads to a marginal 2.6sigma detection that may indicate the presence
of gas just below our detection limits for some, if not all, of them.
