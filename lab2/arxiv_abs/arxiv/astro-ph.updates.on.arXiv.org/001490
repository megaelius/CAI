We show that within tachyonic braneworld models,"super-exponential" warp factors of the form
$e^{-2f} \sim e^{-2c_1e^{c_2 |\sigma|}}$ are problematic when dealing with both the finiteness
of the effective four-dimensional (4d) Planck mass and the localization of 4d gravity, which can
be stated by the requirement that $\int e^{-2f(\sigma)}d\sigma < \infty$, because this condition
necessarily implies that c_1 and c_2 should be positive. As a consequence of this fact the tachyonic
field $T$ turns out to be complex in contradiction with the real nature of the starting action for
the tachyonic braneworld. Conversely if one requires to have a real tachyon field, 4d gravity will
not be localized and the effective gravitational coupling will be infinite. We present several
typical examples where this problem occurs: we have analysed this situation for thin as well as thick
tachyonic braneworlds with 4d Poincare symmetry, for the case when a bulk cosmological constant
is present, and even for a brane with an induced spatially flat 4d cosmological background, and shown
that in all cases the tachyon field T comes out to be inconsistently complex when imposing localization
of 4d gravity. On the other hand, when dealing with a further reduction of the hierarchy problem one
should carefully consider the sign of the constants c_1 and c_2 to avoid inconsistencies in the tachyonic
braneworld model. We also present a similar discusion involving a canonical scalar field in the
bulk where none of these problems arise and hence, the mass hierarchy and 4d gravity localization
problems can be successfully addressed at once. Finally, the stability analysis of this scalar
tensor braneworld model with a super-exponential warp factor is performed.
