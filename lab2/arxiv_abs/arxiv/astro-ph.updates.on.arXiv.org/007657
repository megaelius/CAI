We report on measurements of the polarization of extragalactic sources at 148 GHz made during the
first two seasons of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarization (ACTPol) survey. The survey
covered 680 deg$^{2}$ of the sky on the celestial equator. Polarization measurements of 169 intensity-selected
sources brighter than 30 mJy, that are predominantly Active Galactic Nuclei, are presented. Above
a total flux of 215 mJy where the noise bias removal in the polarization measurement is reliable,
we detect 26 sources, 14 of which have a detection of linear polarization at greater than 3$\sigma_{p}$
significance. The distribution of the fractional polarization as a function of total source intensity
is analyzed. Our result is consistent with the scenario that the fractional polarization of our
measured radio source population is independent of total intensity down to the limits of our measurements
and well described by a Gaussian distribution with a mean fractional polarization $p=0.028\pm$0.005
and standard deviation $\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}=0.054$, truncated at $p=0$. Extrapolating this
model for the distribution of source polarization below the ACTPol detection threshold, we predict
that one could get a clean measure of the E-mode polarization power spectrum of the microwave background
out to $\ell=6000$ with 1 $\mu$K-arcminute maps over 10$\%$ of the sky from a future survey. We also
study the spectral energy distribution of the total and polarized source flux densities by cross-matching
with low radio frequency catalogs. We do not find any correlation between the spectral indices for
total flux and polarized flux.
