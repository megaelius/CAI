We investigated the `spectro-temporal' behaviour of the source XTE J1859+226 in X-rays during
its outburst phase in 1999, by revisiting the RXTE PCA/HEXTE data in 3 - 150 keV spectral band. Detailed
analysis shows that the source evolves through different spectral states during its entire outburst
as indicated by the variation in the temporal and spectral features. Evolution of QPO frequencies
during rising phase, modeled with propagating oscillatory shock gives an estimate of the oscillating
region(corona). Although the evolution pattern of the outburst followed the typical q-shaped
profile, we observe an absence of `canonical' soft state and a weak presence of `secondary' emission
during the decay phase of the outburst. The broad band spectra, modeled with high energy cutoff,
show that fold-energy increases monotonically in the hard and hard-intermediate states followed
by a random variation in the soft-intermediate state. These findings make the source evolution
more complex. It is also observed that during multiple ejections (observed as radio flares) the
QPO frequencies are absent in the power spectra which is dominated by noise component and there is
an absence of lag in the soft to hard photons. The disk flux increases along with a decrease in the high
energy flux, implying the soft nature of the spectrum. These results are the `possible' indication
that the Comptonized corona, which could be responsible for the generation of QPO and for the non-thermal
Comptonized component of the spectrum, is disrupted and the matter gets evacuated in the form of
jet. We attempted to explain the complex behaviour of `spectro-temporal' properties of the source
during the entire outburst and the nature of the disk-jet connection before, during and after the
ejection events in the context of two different types of accreting flow material, in presence of
magnetic field.
