This paper examines, compares and plots optical, near- and mid-infrared (MIR) photometric data
for 605 planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). With the aid of multi-wavelength
surveys such as the Spitzer legacy programme Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution, the Two
Micron All Sky Survey and the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey, plots have been constructed
to expose the relative contributions from molecular hydrogen, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
forbidden emission lines, warm dust continuum and stellar emission at various bands. Besides identifying
trends, these plots have helped to reveal PN mimics including six previously known PNe in the outer
LMC which are re-classied as other object types. Together with continuing follow-up optical observations,
the data have enabled a substantial reduction in the number of PNe previously tagged as `likely'
and `possible'. The total number of LMC PNe is adjusted to 715 but with a greater degree of confidence
in regard to classification. In each colour-colour plot, the more highly evolved LMC PNe are highlighted
for comparison with younger, brighter PNe. The faintest and most evolved PNe typically cluster
in areas of colour-colour space occupied by ordinary stars. Possible reasons for the wide disparity
in infrared colour-colour ratios, such as evolution and dust composition, are presented for evaluation.
A correlation is found between the optical luminosity of PNe, emission-line ratios and the MIR dust
luminosity at various bands. Luminosity functions using the four Infrared Array Camera and Multiband
Imaging Photometer of Spitzer (MIPS) [24] bands are directly compared, revealing an increasing
accumulation of PNe within the brightest two magnitudes at longer wavelengths. A correlation is
also found between the MIPS [24] band and the [O III] 5007 and H-beta fluxes.
