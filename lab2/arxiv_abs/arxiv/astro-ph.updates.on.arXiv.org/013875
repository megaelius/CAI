Context. Taurus represents an ideal region to study the three-dimensional distribution of the
young stellar population and relate it to the associated molecular cloud. Aims. The second Gaia
data release (DR2) enables us to investigate the Taurus complex in three dimensions, starting from
a previously defined robust membership. The molecular cloud structured in filaments can be traced
in emission using the public far-infrared maps from Herschel. Methods. From a compiled catalog
of spectroscopically confirmed members, we analyze the 283 sources with reliable parallax and
proper motions in the Gaia DR2 archive. We fit the distribution of parallaxes and proper motions
with multiple populations described by multivariate Gaussians. We compute the cartesian Galactic
coordinates (X,Y,Z) and, for the populations associated with the main cloud, also the galactic
space velocity (U,V,W). We discuss the spatial distribution of the populations in relation to the
structure of the filamentary molecular cloud traced by Herschel. Results. We discover the presence
of six populations which are all well defined in parallax and proper motions, with the only exception
being Taurus D. The derived distances range between 130 and 160 pc. We do not find a unique relation
between stellar population and the associated molecular cloud: while the stellar population seems
to be on the cloud surface, both lying at similar distances, this is not the case when the molecular
cloud is structured in filaments. Taurus B is probably moving in the direction of Taurus A, while
Taurus E appears to be moving towards them. Conclusions. The Taurus region is the result of a complex
star formation history which most probably occurred in clumpy and filamentary structures that
are evolving independently.
