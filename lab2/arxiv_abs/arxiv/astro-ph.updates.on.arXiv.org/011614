Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the Universe. The Sun's magnetic field drives the solar wind and
causes solar flares and other energetic surface phenomena that profoundly affect space weather
here on Earth. The first magnetic field in a star other than the Sun was detected in 1947 in the peculiar
A-type star 78 Vir. It is now known that the magnetic fields of the Sun and other low-mass stars (<1.5
solar masses) are generated in-situ by a dynamo process in their turbulent, convective envelopes.
Unlike such stars, intermediate-mass and high-mass stars (>1.5 solar masses; referred to as "massive"
stars here) have relatively quiet, radiative envelopes where a solar-like dynamo cannot operate.
However, about 10% of them, including 78 Vir, have strong, large-scale surface magnetic fields
whose origin has remained a major mystery. The massive star $\tau$ Sco is a prominent member of this
group and appears to be surprisingly young compared to other presumably coeval members of the Upper
Scorpius association. Here, we present the first 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the
coalescence of two massive main-sequence stars and 1D stellar evolution computations of the subsequent
evolution of the merger product that can explain $\tau$ Sco's magnetic field, apparent youth and
other observed characteristics. We argue that field amplification in stellar mergers is a general
mechanism to form strongly-magnetised massive stars. These stars are promising progenitors of
those neutron stars that host the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe, so-called magnetars,
and that may give rise to some of the enigmatic fast radio bursts. Strong magnetic fields affect the
explosions of core-collapse supernovae and, moreover, those magnetic stars that have rapidly-rotating
cores at the end of their lives might provide the right conditions to power long-duration gamma-ray
bursts and super-luminous supernovae.
