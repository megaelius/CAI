[abridged abstract] No, within a broad class of scenarios. With the advent of gravitational-wave
(GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will eventually have to be quantified. Here
we present a wide survey of the corrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest
for GW astronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two compact objects.
We take into account various effects such as: electric charges, magnetic fields, cosmological
evolution, possible deviations from General Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter
such as accretion disks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances
dictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time behavior of merger/ringdown
waveforms. The mode structure can drastically differ from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to
external perturbations is unchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because
although the vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the system, they
still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results strongly suggest that both parametrized
and ringdown searches should use at least two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries
shows that environmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the exception
of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in particular that accretion and hydrodynamic
drag generically dominate over self-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they
can be safely neglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most relevant
for eLISA. Finally, we discuss how our ignorance of the matter surrounding compact objects implies
intrinsic limits on the ability to constrain strong-field deviations from General Relativity.
