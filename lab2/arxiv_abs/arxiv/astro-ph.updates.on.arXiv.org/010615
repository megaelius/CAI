We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the eruption of a hot coronal channel associated with
an X1.0 flare (SOL2013-10-28T02:03) from the active region NOAA 11875 by combining observations
from AIA/SDO, HMI/SDO, RHESSI, and HiRAS. EUV images at high coronal temperatures indicated the
presence of a hot channel at the core of the active region from the early pre-flare phase evidencing
the pre-existence of a quasi-stable magnetic flux rope. The hot channel underwent an activation
phase after a localized and prolonged pre-flare event occurring adjacent to one of its footpoints.
Subsequently, the flux rope continued to rise slowly for $\approx$16 min during which soft X-ray
flux gradually built-up characterizing a distinct precursor phase. The flux rope transitioned
from the state of slow rise to the eruptive motion with the onset of the impulsive phase of the X1.0
flare. The eruptive expansion of the hot channel is accompanied by a series of type III radio bursts
in association with impulsive rise of strong hard X-ray non-thermal emissions that included explicit
hard X-ray sources of energies up to $\approx$50 keV from the coronal loops and $\approx$100 keV
from their footpoint locations. Our study contains evidence that pre-flare activity occurring
within the spatial extent of a stable flux rope can destabilize it toward eruption. Moreover, sudden
transition of the flux rope from the state of slow rise to fast acceleration precisely bifurcated
the precursor and the impulsive phases of the flare which points toward a feedback relationship
between early CME dynamics and the strength of the large-scale magnetic reconnection.
