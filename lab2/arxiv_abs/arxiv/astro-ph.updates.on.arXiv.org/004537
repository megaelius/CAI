The NS merger GW170817 was followed over several days by optical ("blue") kilonova (KN) emission
likely powered by the radioactive decay of light r-process nuclei synthesized by ejecta with a low
neutron excess (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.25-0.35). While the composition and high velocities of
the blue KN ejecta are consistent with originating from shock-heated dynamical material, the large
quantity is incompatible with numerical simulations unless the NS radii is small < 11 km. However,
such small NS radii would not enable the formation of a massive accretion disk, whose outflows can
supply the near-infrared ("red") KN emission seen at later times. We propose an alternative source
of the blue KN ejecta: the neutrino-heated, magnetically-accelerated wind from the strongly-magnetized
hypermassive NS (HMNS) remnant. A rapidly-spinning HMNS with an ordered surface magnetic field
strength of B~1-3e14 G and lifetime t_rem ~ 0.1-1 s can simultaneously explain the velocity, total
mass, and electron fraction of the blue KN ejecta. The inferred HMNS lifetime is close to its Alfven
crossing time for the same magnetic field strength, suggesting global magnetic torques could be
responsible for bringing the HMNS into solid body rotation and instigating its gravitational collapse.
Different origins for the KN ejecta may be distinguished by their emission in the first hours after
the merger, when the luminosity is enhanced by heating from internal shocks, the latter are expected
for any long-lived ejecta source (e.g. magnetar wind or accretion disk outflow) and is not a unique
prediction of the emergence of a relativistic jet ("cocoon" emission). The same shocks could mix
and homogenize the composition to a low but non-zero lanthanide mass fraction, X_La ~ 1e-3, as advocated
by some authors, but only if the shock mixing occurs after neutrons are consumed in the r-process
on a timescale >~ 1 s.
