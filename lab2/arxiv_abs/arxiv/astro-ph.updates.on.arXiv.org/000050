We analyze the accretion properties of 21 low mass T Tauri stars using a dataset of contemporaneous
near ultraviolet (NUV) through optical observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the ground based Small and Medium Aperture Research Telescope
System (SMARTS), a unique dataset because of the nearly simultaneous broad wavelength coverage.
Our dataset includes accreting T Tauri stars (CTTS) in Taurus, Chamaeleon I, $\eta$ Chamaeleon
and the TW Hydra Association. For each source we calculate the accretion rate by fitting the NUV and
optical excesses above the photosphere, produced in the accretion shock, introducing multiple
accretion components characterized by a range in energy flux (or density) for the first time. This
treatment is motivated by models of the magnetospheric geometry and accretion footprints, which
predict that high density, low filling factor accretion spots co-exist with low density, high filling
factor spots. By fitting the UV and optical spectra with multiple accretion components, we can explain
excesses which have been observed in the near infrared. Comparing our estimates of the accretion
rate to previous estimates, we find some discrepancies; however, they may be accounted for when
considering assumptions for the amount of extinction and variability in optical spectra. Therefore,
we confirm many previous estimates of the accretion rate. Finally, we measure emission line luminosities
from the same spectra used for the accretion rate estimates, to produce correlations between accretion
indicators (H$\beta$, Ca II K, C II] and Mg II) and accretion properties obtained simultaneously.
