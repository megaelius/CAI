The lack of a strong correlation between AGN X-ray luminosity ($L_X$; a proxy for AGN power) and the
star formation rate (SFR) of their host galaxies has recently been attributed to stochastic AGN
variability. Studies using population synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad,
universal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability distribution for AGN
specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of $L_X$ to host stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington
ratio). However, recent studies have demonstrated that this universal Eddington ratio distribution
fails to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions beyond z$\sim$1.2. Furthermore, empirical
studies have recently shown that the Eddington ratio distribution may instead depend upon host
galaxy properties, such as SFR and/or stellar mass. To investigate this further we develop a population
synthesis model in which the Eddington ratio distribution is different for star-forming and quiescent
host galaxies. We show that, although this model is able to reproduce the observed X-ray luminosity
functions out to z$\sim$2, it fails to simultaneously reproduce the observed flat relationship
between SFR and X-ray luminosity. We can solve this, however, by incorporating a mass dependency
in the AGN Eddington ratio distribution for star-forming host galaxies. Overall, our models indicate
that a relative suppression of low Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\lesssim$0.1) in lower
mass galaxies (M<$10^{10-11}$Msun) is required to reproduce both the observed X-ray luminosity
functions and the observed flat SFR/X-ray relationship.
