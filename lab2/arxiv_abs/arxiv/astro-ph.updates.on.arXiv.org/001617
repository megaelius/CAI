Due to their higher planet-star mass-ratios, M dwarfs are the easiest targets for detection of low-mass
planets orbiting nearby stars using Doppler spectroscopy. Furthermore, because of their low masses
and luminosities, Doppler measurements enable the detection of low-mass planets in their habitable
zones that correspond to closer orbits than for Solar-type stars. We re-analyse literature UVES
radial velocities of 41 nearby M dwarfs in a combination with new velocities obtained from publicly
available spectra from the HARPS-ESO spectrograph of these stars in an attempt to constrain any
low-amplitude Keplerian signals. We apply Bayesian signal detection criteria, together with
posterior sampling techniques, in combination with noise models that take into account correlations
in the data and obtain estimates for the number of planet candidates in the sample. More generally,
we use the estimated detection probability function to calculate the occurrence rate of low-mass
planets around nearby M dwarfs. We report eight new planet candidates in the sample (orbiting GJ
27.1, GJ 160.2, GJ 180, GJ 229, GJ 422, and GJ 682), including two new multiplanet systems, and confirm
two previously known candidates in the GJ 433 system based on detections of Keplerian signals in
the combined UVES and HARPS radial velocity data that cannot be explained by periodic and/or quasiperiodic
phenomena related to stellar activities. Finally, we use the estimated detection probability
function to calculate the occurrence rate of low-mass planets around nearby M dwarfs. According
to our results, M dwarfs are hosts to an abundance of low-mass planets and the occurrence rate of planets
less massive than 10 M$_{\oplus}$ is of the order of one planet per star, possibly even greater. ...
