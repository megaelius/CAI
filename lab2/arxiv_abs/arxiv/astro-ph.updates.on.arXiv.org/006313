Hot Jupiters (HJs), gas giant planets orbiting their host stars with periods on the order of days,
commonly occur in the Galaxy, including relatively massive ($1.6-2.4~$M$_\odot$, i.e. A-type
main sequence stars) and evolved stars. The majority of A-type main sequence stars have stellar
binary companions, which can strongly affect the dynamical evolution of planets around either
star. In this work we investigate the effects of gravitational perturbations by a far away stellar
companion on the orbital evolution of gas giant planets orbiting A-type stars, the so-called Eccentric
Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism, including the effects of general relativity, post-main sequence
stellar evolution, and tides. We find that only $0.15~\%$ of all A-type stars will host HJs during
their main sequence lifetime. However, we also find a new class of planets, Temporary Hot Jupiters
(THJs), that form during the post-main sequence lifetime of a significant fraction (about $3.7~\%$)
of all former A-type main sequence stars. These THJs orbit on periods of tens to a hundred days and
only exist for a few 100,000 years before they are engulfed by their expanding host stars, but they
reach the same temperatures as `classical' HJs due to the increased stellar luminosities. THJs'
spin-orbit angles will mostly be misaligned. Tidal interactions between THJs and their expanding
host stars will significantly influence the stellar envelopes, while the planets' eventual engulfment
will lead to faster stellar spins and transient increased luminosity signals that should extend
the possible time-frame to observe THJs far beyond the initial few 100,000 years. Overall we find
that approximately $70~\%$ of all gas giant planets orbiting A-type stars will eventually be destroyed
or engulfed by their star, about $25~\%$ during the main sequence lifetime and about $45~\%$ during
post-main sequence evolution.
