(abridged) Context. Gravitational fields at the outskirts of early-type galaxies (ETGs) are difficult
to constrain observationally. It thus remains poorly explored how well the LCDM and MOND hypotheses
agree with ETGs. Aims. This led us to gather a large sample of ETGs and examine homogeneously which
dark matter halos they occupy, whether the halos follow the theoretically predicted stellar-to-halo
mass relation (SHMR) and the halo mass-concentration relation (HMCR), whether ETGs obey MOND and
the radial acceleration relation (RAR) observed for late-type galaxies (LTGs), and finally whether
LCDM or MOND perform better in ETGs. Methods. We employed Jeans analysis of radial velocities of
globular clusters (GCs). We analysed nearly all ETGs having more than about 100 archival GC radial
velocity measurements. The GC systems of our 17 ETGs extend mostly over ten effective radii. A LCDM
simulation of GC formation helped us to interpret the results. Results. Successful LCDM fits are
found for all galaxies, but compared to the theoretical HMCR and SHMR, the best-fit halos usually
have concentrations that are too low and stellar masses that are too high for their masses. This might
be because of tidal stripping of the halos or because ETGs and LTGs occupy different halos. Most galaxies
can be fitted by the MOND models successfully as well, but for some of the galaxies, especially those
in centers of galaxy clusters, the observed GC velocity dispersions are too high. This might be a
manifestation of the additional dark matter that MOND requires in galaxy clusters. Additionally,
we find many signs that the GC systems were perturbed by galaxy interactions. Formal statistical
criteria prefer the best-fit LCDM models over the MOND models, but this might be due to the higher
flexibility of the LCDM models. The MOND approach can predict the GC velocity dispersion profiles
better.
