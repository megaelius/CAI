We proposed that the spectral evolution of transient X-ray binaries (XrB) is due to an interplay
between two flows: a standard accretion disk (SAD) in the outer parts and a jet-emitting disk (JED)
in the inner parts. We showed in previous papers that the spectral evolution in X-ray and radio during
the 2010-2011 outburst of GX339-4 can be recovered. We now investigate the presence of low frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) during an X-ray outburst, and address the possible correlation
between the frequencies of these LFQPOs and the transition radius between the two flows, rJ. We select
X-ray and radio data form 3 outbursts of GX339-4. We use the method detailed in paper IV to obtain $r_J(t)$
and $\dot{m}_{in}(t)$ for each outburst to reproduce the correlated evolution of the X-ray spectra
and the radio emission for 3 different activity cycles of GX339-4. We also independently search
and report the detection of 7 new LFQPOs in addition to the literature. We show that the frequency
of Type C QPOs can be linked to the dynamical JED-SAD transition radius rJ, rather than the radius
of optically thin-thick transition. The scaling factor q such that $\nu_{QPO} \simeq \nu_K (r_J)
/ q$ is $q \simeq 70-140$, consistent during the 4 cycles and similar to previous studies. The JED-SAD
hybrid disk configuration not only provides a successful paradigm allowing us to describe XrB cycles,
but also matches the QPO frequencies evolution. QPOs provide an indirect way to probe the JED-SAD
transition radius, where an undetermined process produces secular variability. The demonstrated
relation between the transition radius links Type C QPOs to the transition between the two flows,
tying it to the inner magnetized structure of the jets. This direct connection between the jets'
structure and the process responsible for Type C QPOs could naturally explain their puzzling multi-wavelength
behavior.
