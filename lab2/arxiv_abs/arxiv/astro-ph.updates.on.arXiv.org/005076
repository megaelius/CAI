Sweet-Parker current sheets in high Lundquist number plasmas are unstable to tearing, suggesting
they will not form in physical systems. Understanding magnetic reconnection thus requires study
of the stability of a current sheet as it forms. Formation can occur due to sheared, sub-Alfv\'enic
incompressible flows which narrow the sheet. Standard tearing theory (Furth et al. 1963; Coppi
et al. 1976; Rutherford 1973) is not immediately applicable to such forming sheets for two reasons:
first, because the flow introduces terms not present in the standard calculation; second, because
the changing equilibrium introduces time dependence to terms which are constant in the standard
calculation, complicating the formulation of an eigenvalue problem. This paper adapts standard
tearing mode analysis to confront these challenges. In an initial phase when any perturbations
are primarily governed by ideal MHD, a coordinate transformation reveals that the flow compresses
and stretches perturbations. A multiple scale formulation describes how linear tearing mode theory
(Furth et al. 1963; Coppi et al. 1976) can be applied to an equilibrium changing under flow, showing
that the flow affects the separable exponential growth only implicitly, by making the standard
scalings time-dependent. In the nonlinear Rutherford stage, the coordinate transformation shows
that standard theory can be adapted by adding to the stationary rates time dependence and an additional
term due to the strengthening equilibrium magnetic field. Overall, this understanding supports
the use of flow-free scalings with slight modifications to study tearing in a forming sheet.
