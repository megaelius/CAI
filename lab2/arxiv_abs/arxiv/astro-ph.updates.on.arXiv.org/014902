M105 (NGC 3379) is an early-type galaxy in the Leo I group. This group is the nearest group that contains
all main galaxy types and can thus be used as a benchmark to study the properties of the intra-group
light (IGL) in low-mass groups. We use PNe as discrete stellar tracers of the diffuse light around
M105. PNe were identified on the basis of their bright [OIII]5007 AA emission and the absence of a
broad-band continuum. We compare the PN number density profile with the galaxy surface-brightness
profile decomposed into metallicity components using published HST photometry in two halo fields.
We identify 226 PNe candidates within a limiting magnitude of mlim = 28.1 from our Subaru-SuprimeCam
imaging, covering 67.6 kpc along the major axis of M105 and the halos of NGC 3384 and NGC 3398. We find
an excess of PNe at large radii compared to the stellar surface brightness profile from broad-band
surveys. This excess is related to a variation in the luminosity-specific PN number $\alpha$ with
radius. The $\alpha$-parameter value of the extended halo is more than 7 times higher than that of
the inner halo. We also measure an increase in the slope of the PN luminosity function at fainter magnitudes
with radius. We infer that the radial variation of the PN population properties is due to a diffuse
population of metal-poor stars ([M/H] < -1.0) following an exponential profile, in addition to
the M105 halo. The spatial coincidence between the number density profile of these metal-poor stars
and the increase in the $\alpha$-parameter value with radius establishes the missing link between
metallicity and the post-AGB phases of stellar evolution. We estimate that the total bolometric
luminosity associated with the exponential IGL population is 2.04x10^9 Lsun as a lower limit, corresponding
to an IGL fraction of 3.8%. This work sets the stage for kinematic studies of the IGL in low-mass groups.
