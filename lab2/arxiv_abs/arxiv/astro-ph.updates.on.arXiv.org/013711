We construct the first comprehensive dynamical model for the high-quality subset of stellar kinematics
of the Milky Way disc, with full 6D phase-space coordinates, provided by the Gaia Data Release 2.
We adopt an axisymmetric approximation and use an updated Jeans Anisotropic Modelling (JAM) method,
which allows for a generic shape and radial orientation of the velocity ellipsoid, as indicated
by the Gaia data, to fit the mean velocities and all three components of the intrinsic velocity dispersion
tensor. The Milky Way is the first galaxy for which all intrinsic phase space coordinates are available,
and the kinematics are superior to the best integral-field kinematics of external galaxies. This
situation removes the long-standing dynamical degeneracies and makes this the first dynamical
model highly over-constrained by the kinematics. For these reasons, our ability to fit the data
provides a fundamental test for both galaxy dynamics and the mass distribution in the Milky Way disc.
We tightly constrain the volume average total density logarithmic slope, in the radial range 3.6--12
kpc, to be $\alpha_{\rm tot}=-2.149\pm 0.055$ and find that the dark halo slope must be significantly
steeper than $\alpha_{\rm DM}=-1$ (NFW). The dark halo shape is close to spherical and its density
is $\rho_{\rm DM}(R_\odot)=0.0115\pm0.0020$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$ ($0.437\pm0.076$ GeV cm$^{-3}$),
in agreement with previous estimates. The circular velocity at the solar position $v_{\rm circ}(R_{\odot})
= 236.5\pm 3.1$ km s$^{-1}$ (including systematics) and its gently declining radial trends are
also consistent with recent determinations.
