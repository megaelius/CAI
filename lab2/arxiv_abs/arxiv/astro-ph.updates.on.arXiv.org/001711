The intense radiation flux of type I X-ray bursts is expected to interact with the accretion flow
around neutron stars. High frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs), whose frequencies
match orbital frequencies at tens of gravitational radii, offer a unique probe of the innermost
disk regions. In this paper, we follow the lower kHz QPOs, in response to type I X-ray bursts, in two
prototypical QPO sources, namely 4U 1636-536 and 4U 1608-522 as observed by the Proportional Counter
Array of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We have selected a sample of 15 bursts for which the kHz QPO
frequency can be tracked on timescales commensurable with the burst durations (tens of seconds).
In a subset (3), we find evidence that the QPOs are affected by the bursts, being undetected for over
~ 80 seconds (and up to more than ~ 200 seconds in one case), while the burst emission has already decayed
to a level that would enable the "pre-burst" QPO to be detected. On the other hand, for the majority
of our burst-kHz QPO sample, we show that the QPO is detected as soon as the statistics allow and in
the best cases, we are able to set an upper limit of ~ 20 seconds on the recovery time of the QPO. This
diversity of behavior cannot be related to differences in the burst properties (rise and decay times,
energetics), otherwise comparable. We discuss these results in the framework of recent findings
that accretion onto the neutron star is enhanced during type I X-ray bursts. The subsequent disk
depletion could explain the disappearance of the QPO for ~ 100 seconds as we observe in a subset of
events. However, alternative scenarios would have to be invoked for explaining the short recovery
timescales inferred from most bursts. Clearly the combination of fast timing and spectral information
of type I X-ray bursts holds great potential to study the dynamics of the inner accretion flow around
neutron stars.
