Infrared imaging of the colliding-wind binary Apep has revealed a spectacular dust plume with complicated
internal dynamics that challenges standard colliding-wind binary physics. Such challenges can
be potentially resolved if a rapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet star is located at the heart of the system,
implicating Apep as a Galactic progenitor system to long-duration gamma-ray bursts. One of the
difficulties in interpreting the dynamics of Apep is that the spectral composition of the stars
in the system was unclear. Here we present visual to near-infrared spectra that demonstrate that
the central component of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon- (WC8) and
nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes. We argue that such an assignment represents the strongest
case of a classical WR+WR binary system in the Milky Way. The terminal line-of-sight wind velocities
of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are measured to be $2100 \pm 200$ and $3500 \pm 100$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively.
If the mass-loss rate of the two stars are typical for their spectral class, the momentum ratio of
the colliding winds is expected to be $\approx$ 0.4. Since the expansion velocity of the dust plume
is significantly smaller than either of the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion
that one of the Wolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic. We can recover a shock-compressed wind velocity
consistent with the observed dust expansion velocity if the WC8 star produces a significantly slow
equatorial wind with a velocity of $\approx$530 km s$^{-1}$. Such slow wind speeds can be driven
by near-critical rotation of a Wolf-Rayet star.
