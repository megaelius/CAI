The globular cluster (GC) M15 (NGC 7078) is host to at least eight pulsars and two low mass X-ray binaries
(LMXBs) one of which is also visible in the radio regime. Here we present the results of a multi-epoch
global very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) campaign aiming at i) measuring the proper motion
of the known compact radio sources, ii) finding and classifying thus far undetected compact radio
sources in the GC, and iii) detecting a signature of the putative intermediate mass black hole (IMBH)
proposed to reside at the core of M15. We measure the sky motion in right ascension ($\mu_{\alpha}$)
and declination ($\mu_{\delta}$) of the pulsars M15A and M15C and of the LMXB AC211 to be $(\mu_{\alpha},\,\mu_{\delta})_{\text{M15A}}=(-0.54\pm0.14,\,-4.33\pm0.25)\,$mas$\,$yr$^{-1}$,
$(\mu_{\alpha},\,\mu_{\delta})_{\text{M15C}}=(-0.75\pm0.09,\,-3.52\pm0.13)\,$mas$\,$yr$^{-1}$,
and $(\mu_{\alpha},\,\mu_{\delta})_{\text{AC211}}=(-0.46\pm0.08,\,-4.31\pm0.20)\,$mas$\,$yr$^{-1}$,
respectively. Based on these measurements we estimate the global proper motion of M15 to be $(\mu_{\alpha},\,\mu_{\delta})=(-0.58\pm0.18,\,-4.05\pm0.34)\,$mas$\,$yr$^{-1}$.
We detect two previously known but unclassified compact sources within our field of view. Our observations
indicate that one them is of extragalactic origin while the other one is a foreground source, quite
likely an LMXB. The double neutron star system M15C became fainter during the observations, disappeared
for one year and is now observable again---an effect possibly caused by geodetic precession. The
LMXB AC211 shows a double lobed structure in one of the observations indicative of an outburst during
this campaign. With the inclusion of the last two of a total of seven observations we confirm the upper
mass limit for a putative IMBH to be M$_{\bullet}<500$ M$_{\odot}$.
