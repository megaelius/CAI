Observations towards L1630 in the Orion B molecular cloud, comprising the iconic Horsehead Nebula,
allow us to study the interplay between stellar radiation and a molecular cloud under relatively
benign conditions, that is, intermediate densities and an intermediate UV radiation field. Contrary
to the well-studied Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC1), which hosts much harsher conditions, L1630
has little star formation. We aim to relate the [CII] fine-structure line emission to the physical
conditions predominant in L1630 and compare it to studies of OMC1. The [CII] $158\,\mu\mathrm{m}$
emission from an area of $12' \times 17'$ in L1630 was observed using the upGREAT instrument onboard
SOFIA. Of the [CII] emission from the mapped area 95%, $13\,L_{\odot}$, originates from the molecular
cloud; the adjacent HII region contributes only 5%, that is, $1\,L_{\odot}$. From comparison with
other data (CO (1-0)-line emission, far-infrared (FIR) continuum studies, emission from polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), we infer a gas density of the molecular cloud of $n_{\mathrm{H}}\sim
3\cdot 10^3\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, with surface layers, including the Horsehead Nebula, having
a density of up to $n_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 4\cdot 10^4\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The temperature of the
surface gas is $T\sim 100\,\mathrm{K}$. The average [CII] cooling efficiency within the molecular
cloud is $1.3\cdot 10^{-2}$. The fraction of the mass of the molecular cloud within the studied area
that is traced by [CII] is only $8\%$. Our PDR models are able to reproduce the FIR-[CII] correlations
and also the CO (1-0)-[CII] correlations. Finally, we compare our results on the heating efficiency
of the gas with theoretical studies of photoelectric heating by PAHs, clusters of PAHs, and very
small grains, and find the heating efficiency to be lower than theoretically predicted, a continuation
of the trend set by other observations.
