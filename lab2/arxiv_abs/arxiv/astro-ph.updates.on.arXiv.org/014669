In this paper we present a deep X-ray observation of the nearby M dwarf GJ\,357 and use it to put constraints
on the atmospheric evolution of its planet, GJ\,357\,b. We also analyse the systematic errors in
the stellar parameters of GJ~357 in order to see how they affect the perceived planetary properties.
We estimate the age of GJ\,357\,b by comparing the observed X-ray luminosity of its host star, derived
from a recent {\em XMM-Newton} observation {($\log{L_{\rm x}}\,{\rm [erg/s]} = 25.73$), with
$L_{\rm x} -$ age relations for M dwarfs. We find that GJ\,357 presents one of the lowest X-ray activity
levels ever measured for an M dwarf, and we put a lower limit on its age of $5$\,Gyr.} Using this age
limit, we perform a backwards reconstruction of the original primordial atmospheric reservoir.
Furthermore, by considering the systematic errors in the stellar parameters, we find a range of
possible planetary masses, radii, and densities. From the backwards reconstruction of GJ\,357\,b's
irradiation history we find that the upper limit of its initial primordial atmospheric mass is $\sim
\rm 38M_{\oplus}$. An initial atmospheric reservoir significantly larger than this may have survived
through the X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation history, hence being inconsistent with current
observations that suggest a telluric composition. In spite of the unlikelihood of a currently existing
primordial envelope, volcanism and outgassing may have contributed to a secondary atmosphere.
Under this assumption, we present three different synthetic infrared spectra for GJ\,357\,b that
one might expect, consisting of $100\%~\rm CO_{2}$, $100\%~\rm SO_{2}$, and $75\%~ \rm N_{2}$,
$24\%~\rm CO_{2}$ and $1\%~\rm H_{2}O$.
