We derive photometric redshifts (\zp) for sources in the entire ($\sim0.4$ deg$^2$) Hawaii-Hubble
Deep Field-North (\hdfn) field with the EAzY code, based on point spread function-matched photometry
of 15 broad bands from the ultraviolet (\bandu~band) to mid-infrared (IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m). Our catalog
consists of a total of 131,678 sources. We evaluate the \zp~quality by comparing \zp~with spectroscopic
redshifts (\zs) when available, and find a value of normalized median absolute deviation \sigm$=$0.029
and an outlier fraction of 5.5\% (outliers are defined as sources having $\rm |\zp - \zs|/(1+\zs)
> 0.15$) for non-X-ray sources. More specifically, we obtain \sigm$=0.024$ with 2.7\% outliers
for sources brighter than $R=23$~mag, \sigm$=0.035$ with 7.4\% outliers for sources fainter than
$R=23$~mag, \sigm$=$0.026 with 3.9\% outliers for sources having $z<1$, and \sigm$=$0.034
with 9.0\% outliers for sources having $z>1$. Our \zp\ quality shows an overall improvement
over an earlier \zp\ work that focused only on the central \hdfn\ area. We also classify each object
as star or galaxy through template spectral energy distribution fitting and complementary morphological
parametrization, resulting in 4959 stars and 126,719 galaxies. Furthermore, we match our catalog
with the 2~Ms {\it Chandra} Deep Field-North main \xray~catalog. For the 462 matched non-stellar
\xray~sources (281 having \zs), we improve their \zp~quality by adding three additional AGN templates,
achieving \sigm$=0.035$ and an outlier fraction of 12.5\%. We make our catalog publicly available
presenting both photometry and \zp, and provide guidance on how to make use of our catalog.
