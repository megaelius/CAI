An accurate modelling of baryonic feedback effects is required to exploit the full potential of
future weak-lensing surveys such as Euclid or LSST. In this second paper in a series of two, we combine
Euclid-like mock data of the cosmic shear power spectrum with an eROSITA X-ray mock of the cluster
gas fraction to run a combined likelihood analysis including both cosmological and baryonic parameters.
Following the first paper of this series, the baryonic effects (based on the baryonic correction
model of Schneider et al. 2019) are included in both the tomographic power spectrum and the covariance
matrix. However, this time we assume the more realistic case of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with massive
neutrinos, and we consider several extensions of the currently favoured cosmological model. For
the standard $\Lambda$CDM case, we show that including X-ray data reduces the uncertainties on
the sum of the neutrino mass by $\sim30$ percent, while there is only a mild improvement on other parameters
such as $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. As extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, we consider the cases of a dynamical
dark energy model (wCDM), a $f(R)$ gravity model (fRCDM), and a mixed dark matter model ($\Lambda$MDM)
with both a cold and a warm/hot dark matter component. We find that combining weak lensing with X-ray
data only leads to a mild improvement of the constraints on the additional parameters of wCDM, while
the improvement is more substantial for both fRCDM and $\Lambda$MDM. Ignoring baryonic effects
in the analysis pipeline leads to significant false-detections of either phantom dark energy or
a light subdominant dark matter component. Overall we conclude that for all cosmologies considered,
a general parametrisation of baryonic effects is both necessary and sufficient to obtain tight
constraints on cosmological parameters.
