Taipan is a multi-object spectroscopic galaxy survey starting in 2017 that will cover 2pi steradians
over the southern sky, and obtain optical spectra for about two million galaxies out to z<0.4. Taipan
will use the newly-refurbished 1.2m UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the
new TAIPAN instrument, which includes an innovative 'Starbugs' positioning system capable of
rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres (and up to 300 with a proposed
upgrade) over the 6-deg diameter focal plane, and a purpose-built spectrograph operating from
370 to 870nm with resolving power R>2000. The main scientific goals of Taipan are: (i) to measure
the distance scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H_0) to 1% precision,
and the structure growth rate of structure to 5%; (ii) to make the most extensive map yet constructed
of the mass distribution and motions in the local Universe, using peculiar velocities based on improved
Fundamental Plane distances, which will enable sensitive tests of gravitational physics; and
(iii) to deliver a legacy sample of low-redshift galaxies as a unique laboratory for studying galaxy
evolution as a function of mass and environment. The final survey, which will be completed within
5 years, will consist of a complete magnitude-limited sample (i<17) of about 1.2x10^6 galaxies,
supplemented by an extension to higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes (i<18.1) of a luminous
red galaxy sample of about 0.8x10^6 galaxies. Observations and data processing will be carried
out remotely and in a fully-automated way, using a purpose-built automated 'virtual observer'
software and an automated data reduction pipeline. The Taipan survey is deliberately designed
to maximise its legacy value, by complementing and enhancing current and planned surveys of the
southern sky at wavelengths from the optical to the radio.
