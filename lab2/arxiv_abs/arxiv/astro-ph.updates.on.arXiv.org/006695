In-depth studies of exoplanetary atmospheres are starting to become reality. In order to unveil
their properties in detail, we need spectra with a higher S/N and also more sophisticated analysis
methods. With high-resolution spectrographs, we can not only detect the sodium feature in the atmosphere
of exoplanets, but also characterize it by studying its line profile. After finding a clearly w-shaped
sodium line profile in the transmission spectrum of HD189733b, we investigated possible sources
of contamination given by the star and tried to correct for these spurious deformations. By analyzing
the single transmission spectra of HD189733b in the wavelength space, we show that the main sodium
signal that causes the absorption in the transmission spectrum is centered on the stellar rest frame.
We concentrate on two main stellar effects that contaminate the transmission spectrum: center-to-limb
variations and stellar rotation. We show the effects on the line profile: while we correct for the
CLV using simulated theoretical stellar spectra, we provide a new method, based directly on observational
data, to correct for the RM contribution to the line profile of the retrieved transmission spectrum.
We apply the corrections to the spectra of HD189733b. Our analysis shows line profiles of the Na D
lines in the transmission spectrum that are narrower than reported previously. The correction
of the D2 line, which is deeper than the D1, is probably still incomplete since the planetary radius
is larger at this wavelength. A careful detrending from spurious stellar effects followed by an
inspection in the velocity space is mandatory when studying the line profile of atmospheric features
in the high-resolution transmission spectrum of exoplanets. Data with higher S/N coupled with
improved atmospheric models will allow us to adapt the magnitude of the corrections of stellar effects
in an iterative way.
