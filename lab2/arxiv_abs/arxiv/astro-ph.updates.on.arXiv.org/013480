Red quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) are a subset of the luminous end of the cosmic population of active
galactic nuclei (AGN), most of which are reddened by intervening dust along the line-of-sight towards
their central engines. In recent work from our team, we developed a systematic technique to select
red QSOs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and demonstrated that they have distinctive radio
properties using the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (FIRST) radio survey. Here
we expand our study using low-frequency radio data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS).
With the improvement in depth that LoTSS offers, we confirm key results: compared to a control sample
of normal "blue" QSOs matched in redshift and accretion power, red QSOs have a higher radio detection
rate and a higher incidence of compact radio morphologies. For the first time, we also demonstrate
that these differences arise primarily in sources of intermediate radio-loudness: radio-intermediate
red QSOs are $\times 3$ more common than typical QSOs, but the excess diminishes among the most radio-loud
and the most radio-quiet systems in our study. We develop Monte-Carlo simulations to explore whether
differences in star formation could explain these results, and conclude that, while star formation
is an important source of low-frequency emission among radio-quiet QSOs, a population of AGN-driven
compact radio sources is the most likely cause for the distinct low-frequency radio properties
of red QSOs. Our study substantiates the conclusion that fundamental differences must exist between
the red and normal blue QSO populations.
