We present the first strong-lensing (SL) analysis of the galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 (\emph{El
Gordo}), in recent \emph{HST}/ACS images, revealing a prominent strong lens at a redshift of $z=0.87$.
This finding adds to the already-established unique properties of \emph{El Gordo}: it is the most
massive, hot, X-ray luminous, and bright Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect cluster at $z\gtrsim0.6$,
and the only `bullet'-like merging cluster known at these redshifts. The lens consists of two merging
massive clumps, where for a source redshift of $z_{s}\sim2$ each clump exhibits only a small, separate
critical area, with a total area of $0.69\pm0.11\sq\arcmin$ over the two clumps. For a higher source
redshift, $z_{s}\sim4$, the critical curves of the two clumps merge together into one bigger and
very elongated lens (axis ratio $\simeq5.5$), enclosing an effective area of $1.44\pm0.22\sq\arcmin$.
The critical curves continue expanding with increasing redshift so that for high-redshift sources
($z_{s}\gtrsim9$) they enclose an area of $\sim1.91\pm0.30\sq\arcmin$ (effective $\theta_{e}\simeq46.8\pm3.7\arcsec$)
and a mass of $6.09\pm1.04\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$. According to our model, the area of high magnification
($\mu>10$) for such high redshift sources is $\simeq1.2\sq\arcmin$, and the area with $\mu>5$
is $\simeq2.3\sq\arcmin$, making \emph{El Gordo} a compelling target for studying the high-redshift
Universe. We obtain a strong lower limit on the total mass of \emph{El Gordo}, $\gtrsim1.7\times10^{15}M_{\odot}$
from the SL regime alone, suggesting a total mass of, roughly, $M_{200}\sim2.3\times10^{15}M_{\odot}$.
Our results should be revisited when additional spectroscopic and \emph{HST} imaging data are
available.
