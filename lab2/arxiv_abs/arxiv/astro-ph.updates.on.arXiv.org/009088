We analyze the interstellar medium properties of a sample of sixteen bright CO line emitting galaxies
identified in the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ASPECS) Large Program.
This CO$-$selected galaxy sample is complemented by a couple of additional CO line emitters in the
UDF that are identified based on their MUSE optical spectroscopic redshifts. The ASPECS CO$-$selected
galaxies cover a larger range of star-formation rates and stellar masses compared to literature
CO emitting galaxies at $z>1$ for which scaling relations have been established previously. Most
of ASPECS CO-selected galaxies follow these established relations in terms of gas depletion timescales
and gas fractions as a function of redshift, as well as the star-formation rate-stellar mass relation
(`galaxy main sequence'). However, we find that $\sim30\%$ of the galaxies (5 out of 16) are offset
from the galaxy main sequence at their respective redshift, with $\sim12\%$ (2 out of 16) falling
below this relationship. Some CO-rich galaxies exhibit low star-formation rates, and yet show
substantial molecular gas reservoirs, yielding long gas depletion timescales. Capitalizing
on the well-defined cosmic volume probed by our observations, we measure the contribution of galaxies
above, below, and on the galaxy main sequence to the total cosmic molecular gas density at different
lookback times. We conclude that main sequence galaxies are the largest contributor to the molecular
gas density at any redshift probed by our observations (z$\sim$1$-$3). The respective contribution
by starburst galaxies above the main sequence decreases from z$\sim$2.5 to z$\sim$1, whereas we
find tentative evidence for an increased contribution to the cosmic molecular gas density from
the passive galaxies below the main sequence.
