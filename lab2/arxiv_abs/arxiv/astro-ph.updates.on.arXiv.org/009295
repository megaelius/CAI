When studying the chemistry of PDRs, time dependence becomes important as visual extinction increases,
since certain chemical timescales are comparable to the cloud lifetime. Dust temperature is also
a key factor, since it significantly influences gas temperature and mobility on dust grains, determining
the chemistry occurring on grain surfaces. We present a study of the dust temperature impact and
time effects on the chemistry of different PDRs, using an updated version of the Meijerink PDR code
and combining it with the time-dependent code Nahoon. We find the largest temperature effects in
the inner regions of high $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs, where high dust temperatures favour the formation
of simple oxygen-bearing molecules (especially that of O$_2$), while the formation of complex
organic molecules is much more efficient at low dust temperatures. We also find that time-dependent
effects strongly depend on the PDR type, since long timescales promote the destruction of oxygen-bearing
molecules in the inner parts of low $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs, while favouring their formation and
that of carbon-bearing molecules in high $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs. From the chemical evolution,
we also conclude that, in dense PDRs, CO$_2$ is a late-forming ice compared to water ice, and confirm
a layered ice structure on dust grains, with H$_2$O in lower layers than CO$_2$. Regarding steady
state, the PDR edge reaches chemical equilibrium at early times ($\lesssim$10$^5$ yr). This time
is even shorter ($<$10$^4$ yr) for high $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs. By contrast, inner regions reach
equilibrium much later, especially low $G$$_{\mathrm{0}}$ PDRs, where steady state is reached
at $\sim$10$^6$-10$^7$ yr.
