G+0.693-0.03 is a quiescent molecular cloud located within the Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) star-forming
complex. Recent spectral surveys have shown that it represents one of the most prolific repositories
of complex organic species in the Galaxy. The origin of such chemical complexity, along with the
small-scale physical structure and properties of G+0.693-0.03, remains a mystery. In this paper,
we report the study of multiple molecules with interferometric observations in combination with
single-dish data in G+0.693-0.03. Despite the lack of detection of continuum source, we find small-scale
(0.2 pc) structures within this cloud. The analysis of the molecular emission of typical shock tracers
such as SiO, HNCO, and CH$_3$OH unveiled two molecular components, peaking at velocities of 57 and
75 km s$^{-1}$. They are found to be interconnected in both space and velocity. The position-velocity
diagrams show features that match with the observational signatures of a cloud-cloud collision.
Additionally, we detect three series of class \rom{1} methanol masers known to appear in shocked
gas, supporting the cloud-cloud collision scenario. From the maser emission we provide constraints
on the gas kinetic temperatures ($\sim$30-150 K) and H$_2$ densities (10$^4$-10$^5$ cm$^{-2}$).
These properties are similar to those found for the starburst galaxy NGC253 also using class \rom{1}
methanol masers, suggested to be associated with a cloud-cloud collision. We conclude that shocks
driven by the possible cloud-cloud collision is likely the most important mechanism responsible
for the high level of chemical complexity observed in G+0.693-0.03.
