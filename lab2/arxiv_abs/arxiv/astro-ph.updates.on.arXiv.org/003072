We update our recently published model for GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA), to include a self-consistent
treatment of the partition of cold gas in atomic and molecular hydrogen. Our model provides significant
improvements with respect to previous ones used for similar studies. In particular, GAEA (i) includes
a sophisticated chemical enrichment scheme accounting for non-instantaneous recycling of gas,
metals, and energy; (ii) reproduces the measured evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function;
(iii) reasonably reproduces the observed correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas metallicity
at different redshifts. These are important prerequisites for models considering a metallicity
dependent efficiency of molecular gas formation. We also update our model for disk sizes and show
that model predictions are in nice agreement with observational estimates for the gas, stellar
and star forming disks at different cosmic epochs. We analyse the influence of different star formation
laws including empirical relations based on the hydro-static pressure of the disk, analytic models,
and prescriptions derived from detailed hydro-dynamical simulations. We find that modifying
the star formation law does not affect significantly the global properties of model galaxies, neither
their distributions. The only quantity showing significant deviations in different models is
the cosmic molecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio, particularly at high redshift. Unfortunately,
however, this quantity also depends strongly on the modelling adopted for additional physical
processes. Useful constraints on the physical processes regulating star formation can be obtained
focusing on low mass galaxies and/or at higher redshift. In this case, self-regulation has not yet
washed out differences imprinted at early time.
