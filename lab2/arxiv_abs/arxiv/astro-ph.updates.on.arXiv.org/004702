The linearzition solution of averaged resonant equations for planar circular restricted three-body
problem with non-gravitational effect is derived. The averaged resonant equations are derived
from Lagrange's planetary equations with added terms in order to include of the non-gravitational
effects. The derived solution depends on that whether the non-gravitational effects act rotationally
symmetrically around the star. The solution has the standard form with time dependence in exponential,
quadratic, linear and constant terms. It is investigated how well the linearization solution describes
real solution obtained from an equation of motion by a comparison of frequency found analytically
and numerically. Since the differential equations describing the evolution in the mean motion
resonance are averaged, the applicability of the linearization solution depends on the averaging.
The assumption used in the derivation of the averaged resonant equations is that the orbit of dust
particle does not change during of the averaging. The assumption implies for the mean motion resonances
that the linearization solution describes the real evolution with best accordance close to the
solution of resonant condition ($da / dt$ $=$ 0). At the solution of resonant condition is the semimajor
axis maximal or minimal and the resonant angular variable has approximately linear time dependence
in the libration period. The variations of other orbital elements at the solution of resonant condition
shifts the best accordance from the maxima or mimima of the semimajor axis. If the initial condition
are chosen close to the resonant condition, then practically all simple oscillatory evolutions
can be suitable well approximated. Due to this property "frequencies" of stationary solutions
can be correctly determined from the linearization solution.
