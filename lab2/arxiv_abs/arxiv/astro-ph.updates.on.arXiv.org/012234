With the $Karl~G.~Jansky$ Very Large Array (VLA) in C-configuration, we observed a large portion
of the first Galactic quadrant ($l=14.0-67.4^\circ $ and $\lvert b \rvert \leq 1.25^\circ $) achieving
an angular resolution of $\leq 40^{\prime\prime}$. At $L$ Band, the WIDAR correlator at the VLA
was set to cover the 21~cm HI line, four OH transitions, a series of H$n\alpha$ radio recombination
lines (RRLs; $n=151$ to 186), and eight 128~MHz wide continuum spectral windows (SPWs) simultaneously.
The HI emission shows clear filamentary substructures at negative velocities with low velocity
crowding. The emission at positive velocities is more smeared-out likely due to higher spatial
and velocity crowding of structures at the positive velocities. Comparing to the spiral arm model
of the Milky Way, the atomic gas follows the Sagittarius and Perseus Arm well but with significant
material in the inter-arm regions. With the C-configuration-only HI+continuum data, we produced
a HI optical depth map of the THOR areal coverage from 228 absorption spectra with the nearest-neighbor
method. With this $\tau$ map, we corrected the HI emission for optical depth and the derived column
density is 38% higher than the column density with optically thin assumption. The total HI mass with
optical depth correction in the survey region is 4.7$\times10^8~M_\odot$, 31% more than the mass
derived assuming the emission is optically thin. If we apply this 31% correction to the whole Milky
Way, the total atomic gas mass would be 9.4-10.5$\times 10^9~M_\odot$. Comparing the HI with existing
CO data, we find a significant increase in the atomic-to-molecular gas ration from the spiral arms
to the inter-arm regions.
