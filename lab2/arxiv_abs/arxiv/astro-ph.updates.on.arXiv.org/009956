Context. Since the discovery of the first Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658
in 1998, the family of these sources kept growing on. Currently, it counts 22 members. All AMXPs are
transients with usually very long quiescence periods, implying that mass accretion rate in these
systems is quite low and not constant. Moreover, for at least three sources, a non-conservative
evolution was also proposed. Aims. Our purpose is to study the long term averaged mass-accretion
rates in all the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars discovered so far, to investigate a non-conservative
mass-transfer scenario. Methods. We calculated the expected mass-transfer rate under the hypothesis
of a conservative evolution based on their orbital periods and on the (minimum) mass of the secondary
(as derived from the mass function), driven by gravitational radiation and/or magnetic braking.
Using this theoretical mass-transfer, we determined the expected accretion luminosity of the
systems. Thus, we achieved the lower limit to the distance of the sources by comparing the computed
theoretical luminosity and the observed flux averaged over a time period of 20 years. Then, the lower
limit to the distance of the sources has been compared to the value of the distance reported in literature
to evaluate how reasonable is the hypothesis of a conservative mass-transfer. Results. Based on
a sample of 18 sources, we found strong evidences of a non-conservative mass-transfer for five sources,
for which the estimated distance lower limits are higher than their known distances. We also report
hints for mass outflows in other six sources. The discrepancy can be fixed under the hypothesis of
a non-conservative mass-transfer in which a fraction of the mass transferred onto the compact object
is swept away from the system, likely due to the (rotating magnetic dipole) radiation pressure of
the pulsar.
