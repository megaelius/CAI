The recent observational data in cosmology seem to indicate that the universe is currently expanding
in an accelerated way. An intriguing interpretation of these data is that they may just be signalling
that Einstein's General Relativity is not the correct description of gravity when we consider distances
of the order of the present horizon of the universe. In this thesis we consider two models which modify
General Relativity at very large distances, the Cascading DGP and the dRGT massive gravity, and
investigate their phenomenological viability. We start with a general introduction to standard
cosmology and we introduce the late time acceleration problem and the cosmological constant problem.
We then provide a pedagogical introduction to the DGP model, of which the Cascading DGP is an extension,
and to the dRGT massive gravity. Concerning the Cascading DGP, we show that the thin limit of the 4D
brane inside the (already thin) 5D brane is well defined, at least for the class of configurations
that we consider, and confirm that gravity is regularized in these set-ups. We give a geometrical
interpretation of the presence of the critical tension, and comment on the difference between the
results in the literature and our results, which we support with a numerical calculation. Regarding
the dRGT massive gravity, we focus on the branch of solutions in which the Vainshtein mechanism can
occur. We determine analytically the number and properties of local solutions which exist asymptotically
on large scales (but still below the gravitational Compton wavelength), and of local (inner) solutions
which exist on small scales. We characterize exactly the properties of global solutions in every
point of the phase space, and characterize precisely in which regions the Vainshtein mechanism
takes place. We also provide numerical solutions which confirm our analysis.
