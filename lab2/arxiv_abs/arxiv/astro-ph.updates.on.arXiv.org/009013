Red supergiant stars are surrounded by a gaseous and dusty circumstellar environment created by
their mass loss which spreads heavy elements into the interstellar medium. The structure and the
dynamics of this envelope are crucial to understand the processes driving the red supergiant mass
loss and the shaping of the pre-supernova ejecta. We have observed the emission from the CO $J = 2-1$
line from the red supergiant star $\mu$~Cep with the NOEMA interferometer. In the line the synthesized
beam was $0.92 \times 0.72$~arcsec ($590 \times 462$~au at 641~pc). The continuum map shows only
the unresolved contribution of the free-free emission of the star chromosphere. The continuum-subtracted
channel maps reveal a very inhomogeneous and clumpy circumstellar environment. In particular,
we detected a bright CO clump, as bright as the central source in the line, at 1.80~arcsec south-west
from the star, in the blue channel maps. After a deprojection of the radial velocity assuming two
different constant wind velocities, the observations were modelled using the 3D radiative transfer
code \textsc{lime} to derive the characteristics of the different structures. We determine that
the gaseous clumps observed around $\mu$~Cep are responsible for a mass loss rate of $(4.9 \pm 1.0)
\times 10^{-7}~{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, in addition to a spatially unresolved wind component
with an estimated mass-loss rate of $2.0 \times 10^{-6}~{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Therefore,
the clumps have a significant role in $\mu$~Cep's mass loss ($\ge 25 \%$). We cannot exclude that
the unresolved central outflow may be made of smaller unresolved clumps.
