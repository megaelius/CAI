Chemical enrichment signatures strongly constrain galaxy formation and evolution, and a detailed
understanding of abundance patterns provides clues regarding the nucleosynthetic production
pathways of elements. Using the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey, we study radial gradients of chemical
element abundances in detail. We use stacked spectra out to 1 Re of 366 early-type galaxies with masses
9.9 - 10.8 log $M/M_{\odot}$ to probe the abundances of the elements C, N, Na, Mg, Ca, and Ti, relative
to the abundance of Fe, by fitting stellar population models to a combination of Lick absorption
indices. We find that C, Mg, and Ti trace each other both as a function of galaxy radius and galaxy mass.
These similar C and Mg abundances within and across galaxies set a lower limit for star-formation
timescales. Conversely, N and Ca are generally offset to lower abundances. The under-abundance
of Ca compared to Mg implies delayed enrichment of Ca through Type Ia supernovae, whereas the correlated
behaviour of Ti and the lighter $\alpha$ elements, C and Mg, suggest contributions to Ti from Type
II supernovae. We obtain shallow radial gradients in [Mg/Fe], [C/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], meaning that
these inferences are independent of radius. However, we measure strong negative radial gradients
for [N/Fe] and [Na/Fe], of up to $-0.25\pm0.05$ and $-0.29\pm0.02$ dex/Re respectively. These
gradients become shallower with decreasing galaxy mass. We find that N and Na abundances increase
more steeply with velocity dispersion within galaxies than globally, while the other elements
show the same relation locally and globally. This implies that the high Na and N abundances found
in massive early type galaxies are generated by internal processes within galaxies. These are strongly
correlated with the total metallicity, suggesting metallicity-dependent Na enrichment, and
secondary N production in massive early-type galaxies.
