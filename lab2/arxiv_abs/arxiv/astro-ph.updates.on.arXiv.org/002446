It is not yet clear whether magnetic fields play an essential role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe),
or whether stellar rotation alone and/or a close binary companion can account for the variety of
the observed nebular morphologies. In a quest for empirical evidence verifying or disproving the
role of magnetic fields in shaping PNe, we follow up on previous attempts to measure the magnetic
field in a representative sample of PN central stars. We obtained low-resolution polarimetric
spectra with FORS 2 at VLT for a sample of twelve bright central stars of PNe with different morphology,
including two round nebulae, seven elliptical nebulae, and three bipolar nebulae. Two targets
are Wolf-Rayet type central stars. For the majority of the observed central stars, we do not find
any significant evidence for the existence of surface magnetic fields. However, our measurements
may indicate the presence of weak mean longitudinal magnetic fields of the order of 100 Gauss in the
central star of the young elliptical planetary nebula IC 418, as well as in the Wolf-Rayet type central
star of the bipolar nebula Hen2-113 and the weak emission line central star of the elliptical nebula
Hen2-131. A clear detection of a 250 G mean longitudinal field is achieved for the A-type companion
of the central star of NGC 1514. Some of the central stars show a moderate night-to-night spectrum
variability, which may be the signature of a variable stellar wind and/or rotational modulation
due to magnetic features. We conclude that strong magnetic fields of the order of kG are not widespread
among PNe central stars. Nevertheless, simple estimates based on a theoretical model of magnetized
wind bubbles suggest that even weak magnetic fields below the current detection limit of the order
of 100 G may well be sufficient to contribute to the shaping of PNe throughout their evolution.
