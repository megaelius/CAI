Theories of modified gravity where light scalars with non-trivial self-interactions and non-minimal
couplings to matter-chameleon and symmetron theories-dynamically suppress deviations from
general relativity in the solar system. On other scales, the environmental nature of the screening
means that such scalars may be relevant. The highly-nonlinear nature of screening mechanisms means
that they evade classical fifth-force searches, and there has been an intense effort towards designing
new and novel tests to probe them, both in the laboratory and using astrophysical objects, and by
reinterpreting existing datasets. The results of these searches are often presented using different
parametrizations, which can make it difficult to compare constraints coming from different probes.
The purpose of this review is to summarize the present state-of-the-art searches for screened scalars
coupled to matter, and to translate the current bounds into a single parametrization to survey the
state of the models. Presently, commonly studied chameleon models are well-constrained but less
commonly studied models have large regions of parameter space that are still viable. Symmetron
models are constrained well by astrophysical and laboratory tests, but there is a desert separating
the two scales where the model is unconstrained. The coupling of chameleons to photons is tightly
constrained but the symmetron coupling has yet to be explored. We also summarize the current bounds
on $f(R)$ models that exhibit the chameleon mechanism (Hu \& Sawicki models). The simplest of these
are well constrained by astrophysical probes, but there are currently few reported bounds for theories
with higher powers of $R$. The review ends by discussing the future prospects for constraining screened
modified gravity models further using upcoming and planned experiments.
