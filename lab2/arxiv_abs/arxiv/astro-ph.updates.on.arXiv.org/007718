The Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project explores feedback in cosmological galaxy
formation simulations. Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (FIRE-1) for consistency.
Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational
softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields),
we introduce FIRE-2, an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We
run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively
change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details
of the star-formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects, provided that
we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present
new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties
are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling
ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles
are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties
of winds and circum-galactic media (CGM). Central (~kpc) mass concentrations in massive (L*) galaxies
are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot halos). Multiple feedback mechanisms
play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation;
radiative feedback suppresses accretion onto dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in disks.
We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.
