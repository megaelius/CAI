The two main advantages of exoplanet imaging are the discovery of objects in the outer part of stellar
systems -- constraining models of planet formation --, and its ability to spectrally characterize
the planets -- information on their atmosphere. It is however challenging because exoplanets are
up to 1e10 times fainter than their star and separated by a fraction of arcsecond. Current instruments
like SPHERE/VLT or GPI/Gemini detect young and massive planets because they are limited by non-common
path aberrations (NCPA) that are not corrected by the adaptive optics system. To probe fainter exoplanets,
new instruments capable of minimizing the NCPA is needed. One solution is the self-coherent camera
(SCC) focal plane wavefront sensor, whose performance was demonstrated in laboratory attenuating
the starlight by factors up to several 1e8 in space-like conditions at angular separations down
to 2L/D. In this paper, we demonstrate the SCC on the sky for the first time. We installed an SCC on the
stellar double coronagraph (SDC) instrument at the Hale telescope. We used an internal source to
minimize the NCPA that limited the vortex coronagraph performance. We then compared to the standard
procedure used at Palomar. On internal source, we demonstrated that the SCC improves the coronagraphic
detection limit by a factor between 4 and 20 between 1.5 and 5L/D. Using this SCC calibration, the
on-sky contrast is improved by a factor of 5 between 2 and 4L/D. These results prove the ability of
the SCC to be implemented in an existing instrument. This paper highlights two interests of the self-coherent
camera. First, the SCC can minimize the speckle intensity in the field of view especially the ones
that are very close to the star where many exoplanets are to be discovered. Then, the SCC has a 100%
efficiency with science time as each image can be used for both science and NCPA minimization.
