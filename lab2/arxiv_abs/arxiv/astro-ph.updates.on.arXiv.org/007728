We explore the isothermal total matter radial density profiles in early-type galaxies (ETGs) selected
from the IllustrisTNG simulation. For a sample of 514 ETGs in the stellar mass range of $10^{10.7}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}
\leqslant M_{\ast} \leqslant 10^{11.9}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at $z = 0$, the total power-law slope
has a mean of $\langle\gamma^{\prime}\rangle = 2.003 \pm 0.008$ and a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\gamma^{\prime}}
= 0.175$ over the radial range from 0.4 to 4 times the stellar half mass radius. Several correlations
between $\gamma^{\prime}$ and galactic properties including stellar mass, effective radius,
stellar surface density, central velocity dispersion, central dark matter fraction and in-situ-formed
stellar mass ratio are compared to observations and other simulations, revealing that IllustrisTNG
reproduce correlation trends qualitatively, and $\gamma^{\prime}$ is almost constant with redshift
below $z = 2$. The power-law density profile of the ETG dark matter halos is steeper in the full physics
(FP) run than their counterparts in the dark matter only (DMO) run. The dark matter inner slopes of
the best-fit generalized NFW profile are much steeper than the standard NFW profile and they are
anti-correlated (constant) with the halo mass in the FP (DMO) run. The dark matter inner slope is
also anti-correlated with the halo concentration parameter $c_{200}$ in both runs. Comparison
of the mass-weighted slope/central dark matter fraction correlation, $\gamma_{\mathrm{mw}}^{\prime}-f_{\mathrm{DM}}$,
with models and observations indicates contraction of the IllustrisTNG dark matter halos, especially
in lower-mass systems.
