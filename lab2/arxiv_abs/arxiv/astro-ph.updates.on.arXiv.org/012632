We consider an Early Dark Energy (EDE) cosmological model, and perform an analysis which takes into
account both background and perturbation effects via the parameters $c^{2}_{\rm eff}$ and $c^{2}_{\rm
vis}$, representing effective sound speed and viscosity, respectively. By using the latest available
data we derive constraints on the amount of dark energy at early times and the present value of the
equation of state. Our focus is on the effect that early dark energy has on the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) data, including polarization and lensing, in a generalized parameter space including a varying
total neutrino mass, and tensor to scalar ratio, besides the 6 standard parameters of the minimal
cosmological model. We find that the inclusion of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data and
CMB lensing significantly improves the constraints on the EDE parameters, while other high redshift
data like the Quasar Hubble diagram and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest BAO have instead a negligible
impact. We find $\Omega_{\rm eDE} < 0.00391 $ and $w_{0} < -0.9500 $ at the $95 \%$ C.L. for EDE accounting
for its clustering through the inclusion of perturbation dynamics. This limit becomes weaker $\Omega_{\rm
eDE} < 0.00337$ if perturbations are neglected. The constraints on the EDE parameters are remarkably
stable even when $\Sigma m_{\nu}$, and $r$ parameters are varied, with weak degeneracies between
$\Omega_{\rm eDE}$ and $r$ or $\Sigma m_{\nu}$. Perturbation parameters are not constrained with
current data sets, and tensions between the CMB derived $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ values and those measured
with local probes are not eased. This work demonstrates the capability of CMB probes to constrain
the total amount of EDE well below the percent level.
