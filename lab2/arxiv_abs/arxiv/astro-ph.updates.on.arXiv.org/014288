We present an overview of the sample of northern hemisphere white dwarfs within 40 pc of the Sun detected
from $Gaia$ Data Release 2 (DR2). We find that 521 sources are spectroscopically confirmed degenerate
stars, 111 of which were first identified as white dwarf candidates from $Gaia$ DR2 and followed-up
recently with the William Herschel Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias. Three additional white
dwarf candidates remain spectroscopically unobserved and six unresolved binaries are known to
include a white dwarf but were not in our initial selection of white dwarfs in the $Gaia$ DR2 Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram (HRD). Atmospheric parameters are calculated from $Gaia$ and Pan-STARRS photometry for
all objects in the sample, confirming most of the trends previously observed in the much smaller
20 pc sample. Local white dwarfs are overwhelmingly consistent with Galactic disc kinematics,
with only four halo candidates. We find that DAZ white dwarfs are significantly less massive than
the overall DA population ($\overline{M}_\mathrm{DAZ} = 0.59\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $\overline{M}_\mathrm{DA}
= 0.66\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$). It may suggest that planet formation is less efficient at higher mass
stars, producing more massive white dwarfs. We detect a sequence of crystallised white dwarfs in
the mass range from $0.6\ \lesssim M/\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim\ 1.0\,$ and find that the vast majority
of objects on the sequence have standard kinematic properties that correspond to the average of
the sample, suggesting that their nature can be explained by crystallisation alone. We also detect
56 wide binaries including a white dwarf and 26 double degenerates.
