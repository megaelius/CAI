Hinge clumps are luminous knots of star formation near the base of tidal features in some interacting
galaxies. We use archival Hubble Space Telescope UV/optical/IR images and Chandra X-ray maps along
with GALEX UV, Spitzer IR, and ground-based optical/near-IR images to investigate the star forming
properties in a sample of 12 hinge clumps in five interacting galaxies. The most extreme of these
hinge clumps have star formation rates of 1 - 9 M(sun)/yr, comparable to or larger than the `overlap'
region of intense star formation between the two disks of the colliding galaxy system the Antennae.
In the HST images, we have found remarkably large (~70 pc) and luminous (M(I) ~ 12.2 to -16.5) sources
at the centers of these hinge clumps, sometimes embedded in a linear ridge of fainter star clusters.
We have found strong X-ray emission from several of these hinge clumps. In most cases, this emission
is well-resolved with Chandra and has a thermal X-ray spectrum, thus it is likely due to hot gas associated
with the star formation. The ratio of the extinction-corrected diffuse X-ray luminosity to the
mechanical energy rate (the X-ray production efficiency) for the hinge clumps is similar to that
in the Antennae galaxies, but higher than those for regions in the normal spiral galaxy NGC 2403.
Two of the hinge clumps have point-like X-ray emission much brighter than expected for hot gas; these
sources are likely `ultra-luminous X-ray sources' (ULXs) due to accretion disks around black holes.
The most extreme of these sources, in Arp 240, has a hard X-ray spectrum and an absorbed X-ray luminosity
of ~2 X 10^41 erg/s; more than expected by single high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), thus it may be either
a collection of HMXBs or an intermediate-mass black hole (>=80 M(sun)). [ abridged ]
