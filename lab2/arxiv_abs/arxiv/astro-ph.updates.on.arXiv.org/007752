In a comprehensive convergence study, we investigate the computational conditions necessary
to resolve disk formation and jet-launching processes, and analyze possible caveats. We explore
the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) processes of the collapse of massive prestellar cores in detail,
including an analysis of the forces involved and their temporal evolution for up to two free-fall
times. We conduct MHD simulations, combining nonideal MHD, self-gravity, and very high resolutions
as they have never been achieved before. Our setup includes a 100 Msol cloud core that collapses under
its own self-gravity to self-consistently form a dense disk structure and launch tightly collimated
magneto-centrifugal jets and wide-angle winds. Our high-resolution simulations can resolve
a magneto-centrifugal jet and a magnetic pressure-driven outflow, separately. The nature of the
outflows depends critically on spatial resolution. Only high-resolution simulations are able
to differentiate a magneto-centrifugally launched, highly collimated jet from a slow wide-angle
magnetic-pressure-driven tower flow. Of these two outflow components, the tower flow dominates
angular-momentum transport. The mass outflow rate is dominated by the entrained material from
the interaction of the jet with the stellar environment and only part of the ejected medium is directly
launched from the accretion disk. A tower flow can only develop to its full extent when much of the
original envelope has already dispersed. Taking into account both the mass launched from the surface
of the disk and the entrained material from the envelope, we find an ejection-to-accretion efficiency
of 10%. Nonideal MHD is required to form centrifugally supported accretion disks and the disk size
is strongly dependent on spatial resolution.
