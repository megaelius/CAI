Magnetohydrodynamic waves are important for diagnosing the physical parameters of coronal plasmas.
Field-aligned flows appear frequently in coronal loops.We examine the effects of transverse density
and plasma flow structuring on standing sausage modes trapped in coronal loops, and examine their
observational implications. We model coronal loops as straight cold cylinders with plasma flow
embedded in a static corona. An eigen-value problem governing propagating sausage waves is formulated,
its solutions used to construct standing modes. Two transverse profiles are distinguished, one
being the generalized Epstein distribution (profile E) and the other (N) proposed recently in Nakariakov
et al.(2012). A parameter study is performed on the dependence of the maximum period $P_\mathrm{max}$
and cutoff length-to-radius ratio $(L/a)_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$ in the trapped regime on the density
parameters ($\rho_0/\rho_\infty$ and profile steepness $p$) and flow parameters (magnitude
$U_0$ and profile steepness $u$). For either profile, introducing a flow reduces $P_\mathrm{max}$
relative to the static case. $P_\mathrm{max}$ depends sensitively on $p$ for profile N but is insensitive
to $p$ for profile E. By far the most important effect a flow introduces is to reduce the capability
for loops to trap standing sausage modes: $(L/a)_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$ may be substantially reduced
in the case with flow relative to the static one. If the density distribution can be described by profile
N, then measuring the sausage mode period can help deduce the density profile steepness. However,
this practice is not feasible if profile E better describes the density distribution. Furthermore,
even field-aligned flows with magnitudes substantially smaller than the ambient Alfv\'en speed
can make coronal loops considerably less likely to support trapped standing sausage modes.
