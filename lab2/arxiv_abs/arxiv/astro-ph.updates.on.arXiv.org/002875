We study the X-ray spectra of tenuous, two-temperature accretion flows using a model involving
an exact, Monte Carlo computation of the global Comptonization effect as well as general relativistic
description of both the flow structure and radiative processes. In our previous work we found that
in flows surrounding supermassive black holes, thermal synchrotron radiation is not capable of
providing a sufficient seed photons flux to explain the X-ray spectral indices as well as the cut-off
energies measured in several best-studied AGNs. In this work we complete the model by including
seed photons provided by nonthermal synchrotron radiation and we find that it allows to reconcile
the hot flow model with the AGN data. We take into account two possible sources of nonthermal electrons.
First, we consider e+- produced by charged-pions decay, which should be always present in the innermost
part of a two-temperature flow due to proton-proton interactions. We find that for a weak heating
of thermal electrons (small delta) the synchrotron emission of pion-decay e+- is much stronger
than the thermal synchrotron emission in the considered range of bolometric luminosities, L Ledd.
The small-delta model including hadronic effects in general agrees with the AGN data, except for
the case of a slowly rotating black hole and a thermal distribution of protons. For large-delta,
the pion-decay e+- have a negligible effect and then in this model we consider nonthermal electrons
produced by direct acceleration. We find an approximate agreement with the AGN data for the fraction
of the heating power of electrons which is used for the nonthermal acceleration eta~0.1.
