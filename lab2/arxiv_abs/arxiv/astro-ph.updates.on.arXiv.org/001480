A middle-aged radio-quiet pulsar J0357+3205 was discovered in gamma-rays with $Fermi$ and later
in X-rays with $Chandra$ and $XMM$-$Newton$ observatories. It produces an unusual thermally-emitting
pulsar wind nebula observed in X-rays. Deep optical observations were obtained to search for the
pulsar optical counterpart and its nebula using the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). The direct
imaging mode in the Sloan $g'$ band was used. Archival X-ray data were reanalysed and compared with
the optical data. No pulsar optical counterpart was detected down to $g'\geq~28_{\cdotp}^{\text{m}}1$.
No pulsar nebula was either identified in the optical. We confirm early results that the X-ray spectrum
of the pulsar consists of a nonthermal power-law component of the pulsar magnetospheric origin
dominating at high energies and a soft thermal component from the neutron star surface. Using magnetised
partially ionised hydrogen atmosphere models in X-ray spectral fits we found that the thermal component
can come from entire surface of the cooling neutron star with a temperature of 36$^{+9}_{-6}$ eV,
making it one of the coldest among cooling neutron stars known. The surface temperature agrees with
the standard neutron star cooling scenario. The optical upper limit does not put any additional
constraints on the thermal component, however it implies a strong spectral break for the nonthermal
component between the optical and X-rays as is observed in other middle-aged pulsars. The thermal
emission from the entire surface of the neutron star likely dominates over the nonthermal emission
in the UV range. Observations of the PSR J0357+3205 in this range are promising to put more stringent
constraints on its thermal properties.
