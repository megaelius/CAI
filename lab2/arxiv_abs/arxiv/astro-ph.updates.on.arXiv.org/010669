After several gravitational wave transients were discovered since 2015, studying neutrino signals
coincident with the gravitational wave events now becomes an important mission for the existing
neutrino experiments. Unfortunately, no candidate neutrinos have been found yet. This article
introduces a method to find the neutrino excess to search for the potential neutrinos from gravitational
wave sources at the future reactor neutrino experiment (such as JUNO and RENO-50). According to
our calculations and simulations, the non-detection of $\bar\nu_e$ associated with gravitational
waves at the nominal JUNO experiment gives rise to the $\bar\nu_e$ signal sensitivity at 90$\%$
confidence level (C.L.), $\mu_{90}$ = 2.44. This corresponds to the range of neutrino fluence on
the Earth around 6 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ to 4 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ with neutrino
energy range from 1.8 MeV to 120 MeV at monochromatic energy spectrum assumption. Based on certain
popular models which describe the gravitational wave sources, we calculate the corresponding
fluence ($F_{UL}^{90}$), which is around 1 - 3 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ for both monochromatic
energy spectrum assumption and Fermi-Dirac energy spectrum assumption. Then we convert $F_{UL}^{90}$
into the detectable distance ($D_\text{UL}^{90}$), about 1 - 3 Mpc for two assumptions, with the
predicted luminosities in these known models. To further improve the sensitivity, we discuss the
potential benefits from an extra detector, with different target masses and baselines. Particularly,
there will be around 38\% sensitivity improvement and around 28$\%$ detectable distance increasing
if the extra detector is designed to be identical to the JUNO detector. On the other hand, instead
of building an extra detector, if we combine the JUNO experiment with the RENO-50 experiment, the
sensitivity will also be significantly improved.
