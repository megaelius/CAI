Motivated by the GW170817/GRB170817A constraint on the deviation of the speed of gravitational
waves from that of photons, we study disformal transformations of the metric in the context of the
generalized Proca theory. The constraint restricts the form of the gravity Lagrangian, the way
the electromagnetism couples to the gravity sector on cosmological backgrounds, or in general
a combination of both. Since different ways of coupling matter to gravity are typically related
to each other by disformal transformations, it is important to understand how the structure of the
generalized Proca Lagrangian changes under disformal transformations. For disformal transformations
with constant coefficients we provide the complete transformation rule of the Lagrangian. We find
that additional terms, which were considered as beyond generalized Proca in the literature, are
generated by the transformations. Once these additional terms are included, on the other hand,
the structure of the gravity Lagrangian is preserved under the transformations. We then derive
the transformation rules for the sound speeds of the scalar, vector and tensor perturbations on
a homogeneous and isotropic background. We explicitly show that they transform following the natural
expectation of metric transformations, that is, according to the transformation of the background
lightcone structure. We end by arguing that inhomogeneities due to structures in the universe,
e.g. dark matter halos, generically changes the speed of gravitational waves from its cosmological
value. We give a rough estimate of the effect of inhomogeneities and find that the fine-tuning should
not depend on the background or that the fine-tuned theory has to be further fine-tuned to pass the
tight constraint.
