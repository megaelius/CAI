The hydrogen isotopic (D/H) ratio reflects the global cycling and evolution of water on Earth as
it fractionates through planetary processes. We model the water cycle taking seafloor hydrothermal
alteration, chemical alteration of continental crust, slab subduction, hydrogen escape from
the early Earth, and degassing at mid-ocean ridges, hot spots, and arcs into account. The differences
in D/H ratios between present-day oceans, oceanic and continental crust, and mantle are thought
to reflect isotopic fractionation through seafloor alteration, chemical alteration, and slab
dehydration. However, if the speed of plate tectonics has been nearly constant through out Earth's
history, the degassing and regassing rates are too small to reach the present-day D/H ratios. We
show that (a) hydrogen escape from reduced early atmosphere, (b) secular net regassing, or (c) faster
plate tectonics on early Earth is needed to reproduce the present-day D/H ratios of the water reservoirs.
The low D/H ratio of Archean seawater at 3.8 Ga has previously been interpreted as a signature of (a)
hydrogen escape, but we find it can also be explained either by (b) secular net regassing or by (c)
faster plate tectonics on early Earth. The rates of hydrogen escape from early Earth and secular
regassing on present-day Earth are constrained to be lower than 2.1 x 10^11 kg/yr and 3.9 x 10^11 kg/yr.
Consequently, the volume of water in the present-day mantle could result entirely from the regassing
through Earth's history. In that case, the volume of initial oceans could be 2 to 3 times larger than
that of current Earth. We suggest that, in addition to the D/H ratio of Archean seawater, identifying
the D/H ratios of both seawater and mantle throughout Earth's history would allow to distinguish
these evolutionary scenarios.
