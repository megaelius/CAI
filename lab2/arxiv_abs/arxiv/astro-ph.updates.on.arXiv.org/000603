In this paper we explore the maximum precision attainable in the location of a point source imaged
by a pixel array detector in the presence of a background, as a function of the detector properties.
For this we use a well-known result from parametric estimation theory, the so-called Cramer-Rao
lower bound. We develop the expressions in the 1-dimensional case of a linear array detector in which
the only unknown parameter is the source position. If the object is oversampled by the detector,
analytical expressions can be obtained for the Cramer-Rao limit that can be readily used to estimate
the limiting precision of an imaging system, and which are very useful for experimental (detector)
design, observational planning, or performance estimation of data analysis software: In particular,
we demonstrate that for background-dominated sources, the maximum astrometric precision goes
as $B/F^2$, where $B$ is the background in one pixel, and $F$ is the total flux of the source, while
when the background is negligible, this precision goes as $F^{-1}$. We also explore the dependency
of the astrometric precision on: (1) the size of the source (as imaged by the detector), (2) the pixel
detector size, and (3) the effect of source de-centering. Putting these results into context, the
theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound is compared to both ground- as well as spaced-based astrometric
results, indicating that current techniques approach this limit very closely. Our results indicate
that we have found in the Cramer-Rao lower variance bound a very powerful astrometric "benchmark"
estimator concerning the maximum expected positional precision for a point source, given a prescription
for the source, the background, the detector characteristics, and the detection process.
