The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has routinely observed the flaring Mg II NUV spectrum,
offering excellent diagnostic potential and a window into the location of energy deposition. A
number of studies have forward modelled both the general properties of these lines and specific
flare observations. Generally these have forward modelled radiation via post-processing of snapshots
from hydrodynamic flare simulations through radiation transfer codes. There has, however, not
been a study of how the physics included in these radiation transport codes affects the solution.
A baseline setup for forward modelling MgII in flares is presented and contrasted with approaches
that add or remove complexity. It is shown for Mg II: (1) PRD is still required during flare simulations
despite the increased densities, (2) using full angle-dependent PRD affects the solution but takes
significantly longer to process a snapshot, (3) including Mg I in NLTE results in negligible differences
to the Mg II lines but does affect the NUV quasi-continuum, (4) only hydrogen and Mg II need to be included
in NLTE, (5) ideally the non-equilibrium hydrogen populations, with non-thermal collisional
rates, should be used rather than the statistical equilibrium populations, (6) an atom consisting
of only the ground state, h & k upper levels, and continuum level is insufficient to model the resonance
lines, and (7) irradiation from a hot, dense flaring transition region can affect the formation
of Mg II. We discuss modifications to the RH code allowing straightforward inclusion of transition
region and coronal irradiation in flares.
