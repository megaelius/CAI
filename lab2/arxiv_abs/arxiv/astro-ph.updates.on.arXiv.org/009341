Fine structures of radio bursts play an important role in diagnostics of the solar flare plasma.
Among them the zebras, which are prevalently assumed to be generated by the double plasma resonance
instability, belong to the most important. In this paper we compute the growth rate of this instability
for two types of the electron distribution: a) for the power-law distribution and b) for the kappa
distribution, in the both cases with the loss-cone type anisotropy. We found that the growth rate
of the upper-hybrid waves for the power-law momentum distribution strongly depends on the pitch-angle
boundary. The maximum growth rate was found for the pitch-angle $\theta_\mathrm{c} \approx$ 50$^\circ$.
For small angles the growth rate profile is very flat and for high pitch-angles the wave absorption
occurs. Furthermore, analyzing the growth rate of the upper hybrid waves for the kappa momentum
distribution we found that a decrease of the characteristic momentum $p_\kappa$ shifts the maximum
of the growth rate to lower values of the ratio of the electron-plasma and electron-cyclotron frequencies,
and the frequency widths of the growth rate peaks are very broad. But, if we consider the kappa distribution
which is isotropic up to some large momentum $p_m$ and anisotropic with loss-cone above this momentum
then distinct peaks of the growth rate appear and thus distinct zebra stripes can be generated. It
means that the restriction for small momenta for the anisotropic part of distributions is of principal
importance for the zebra stripes generation. Finally, for the 1 August 2010 zebra stripes, the growth
rates in dependence on radio frequency were computed. It was shown that in this case the growth rate
peaks are more distinct than in usually presented dependencies of growth rates on the ratio of the
plasma and cyclotron frequencies.
