Flares and CMEs can have deleterious effects on their surroundings: they can erode atmospheres
of orbiting planets over time and also have high importance in stellar evolution. Most of the CME
detections in the literature are single events found serendipitously sparse for statistical investigation.
We aimed to gather a large amount of spectral data of M-dwarfs to drastically increase the number
of known events to make statistical analysis possible in order to study the properties of potential
stellar CMEs. Using archive data we investigated asymmetric features of Balmer-lines, that could
indicate the Doppler-signature of ejected material. Of more than 5500 spectra we found 478 with
line asymmetries--including nine larger events--on 25 objects, with 1.2-19.6 events/day on objects
with line asymmetries. Most events are connected with enhanced Balmer-line peaks, suggesting
these are connected to flares similar to solar events. Detected speeds mostly do not reach surface
escape velocity: the typical observed maximum velocities are in the order of 100-300km/s , while
the typical masses of the ejecta were in the order of $10^{15}-10^{18}$g. Statistical analysis
suggests that events are more frequent on cooler stars with stronger chromospheric activity. Detected
maximum velocities are lower than those observed on the Sun, while event rates were somewhat lower
than we could expect from the solar case. These findings may support the idea that most of the CMEs
could be suppressed by strong magnetic field. Alternatively, it is possible that we can observe
only an early low-coronal phase before CMEs are accelerated at higher altitudes. Our findings could
indicate that later-type, active dwarfs could be a safer environment for exoplanetary systems
CME-wise than previously thought, and atmosphere loss due to radiation effects would play a stronger
role in exoplanetary atmosphere evolution than CMEs.
