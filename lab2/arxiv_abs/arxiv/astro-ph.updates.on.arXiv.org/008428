Ellerman bombs are transient brightenings in the wings of H-alpha 6563 {\AA} that pinpoint photospheric
sites of magnetic reconnection in solar active regions. Their partial visibility in the 1600 {\AA}
and 1700 {\AA} continua registered routinely by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) offers a unique opportunity to inventory such magnetic-field
disruptions throughout the AIA database if a reliable recipe for their detection can be formulated.
This is done here. We improve and apply an H-alpha Ellerman bomb detection code to ten data sets spanning
viewing angles from solar disc centre to the limb. They combine high-quality H-alpha imaging spectroscopy
from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope with simultaneous AIA imaging around 1600 {\AA} and 1700 {\AA}.
A trial grid of brightness, lifetime and area constraints is imposed on the AIA images to define optimal
recovery of the 1735 Ellerman bombs detected in H-alpha. The best results when optimising simultaneously
for recovery fraction and reliability are obtained from 1700 {\AA} images by requiring 5-sigma
brightening above the average 1700 {\AA} nearby quiet-Sun intensity, lifetime above one minute,
area of 1-18 AIA pixels. With this recipe 27% of the AIA detections are H-alpha-detected Ellerman
bombs while it recovers 19% of these (of which many are smaller than the AIA resolution). Better yet,
among the top 10% AIA 1700 {\AA} detections selected with combined brightness, lifetime and area
thresholds as many as 80% are H-alpha Ellerman bombs. Automated selection of the best 1700 {\AA}
candidates therefore opens the entire AIA database for detecting most of the more significant photospheric
reconnection events. This proxy is applicable as flux-dynamics tell-tale in studying any Earth-side
solar active region since early 2010 up to the present.
