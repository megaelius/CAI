Recent observational programmes are providing a global view of the Milky Way bulge that serves as
template for detailed comparison with models and extragalactic bulges. A number of surveys (i.e.
VVV, GIBS, GES, ARGOS, BRAVA, APOGEE) are producing comprehensive and detailed extinction, metallicity,
kinematics and stellar density maps of the Galactic bulge with unprecedented accuracy. However,
the still missing key ingredient is the distribution of stellar ages across the bulge. To overcome
this limitation, we aim to age-date the stellar population in several bulge fields with the ultimate
goal of deriving an age map of the Bulge. This paper presents the methodology and the first results
obtained for a field along the Bulge minor axis, at $b=-6^\circ$. We use a new PSF-fitting photometry
of the VISTA Variables in the V\'{i}a L\'{a}ctea (VVV) survey data to construct deep color-magnitude
diagrams of the bulge stellar population down to $\sim$ 2 mag below the Main Sequence turnoff. We
find the bulk of the bulge stellar population in the observed field along the minor axis to be at least
older than $\sim$ 7.5 Gyr. In particular, when the metallicity distribution function spectroscopically
derived by GIBS is used, the best fit to the data is obtained with a combination of synthetic populations
with ages in between $\sim$ 7.5 Gyr and 11 Gyr. However, the fraction of stars younger than $\sim$
10 Gyr strongly depends upon the number of Blue Straggler Stars present in the bulge. Simulations
show that the observed color-magnitude diagram of the bulge in the field along the minor axis is incompatible
with the presence of a conspicuous population of intermediate-age/young (i.e. $\lesssim 5$ Gyr)
stars.
