Abridged. Here we report on the X-ray activity of the primary star, HD189733 A, using a new XMM-Newton
observation and a comparison with the previous X-ray observations. The spectrum in the quiescent
intervals is described by two temperatures at 0.2 keV and 0.7 keV, while during the flares a third
component at 0.9 keV is detected. We obtain estimates of the electron density in the range $n_e = 1.6
- 13 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and thus the corona of HD189733 A appears denser than the solar one.
{For the third time, we observe a large flare that occurred just after the eclipse of the planet. Together
with the flares observed in 2009 and 2011, the events are restricted to a small planetary phase range
of $\phi = 0.55-0.65$. Although we do not find conclusive evidence of a significant excess of flares
after the secondary transits, we suggest that the planet might trigger such flares when it passes
close to locally high magnetic field of the underlying star at particular combinations of stellar
rotational phases and orbital planetary phases. For the most recent flares, a wavelet analysis
of the light curve suggests a loop of length of four stellar radii at the location of the bright flare,
and a local magnetic field of order of 40-100 G, in agreement with the global field measured in other
studies. The loop size suggests an interaction of magnetic nature between planet and star, separated
by only $\sim8 R_*$. We also detect the stellar companion (HD 189733 B, $\sim12"$ from the primary
star) in this XMM observation. Its very low X-ray luminosity ($L_X = 3.4\times 10^{26}$ erg s$^{-1}$)
confirms the old age of this star and of the binary system. The high activity of the primary star is
best explained by a transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the star.
