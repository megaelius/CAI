We present an analysis of high-resolution ALMA interferometry of CO(4-3) line emission and dust
continuum in the "Ruby" (PLCK_G244.8+54.9), a bright, gravitationally lensed galaxy at z = 3.0
discovered with the Planck all-sky survey. The Ruby is the brightest of Planck's Dusty GEMS, a sample
of 11 of the brightest gravitationally lensed high-redshift galaxies on the extragalactic sub-mm
sky. We resolve the high-surface-brightness continuum and CO line emission of the Ruby in several
extended clumps along a partial, nearly circular Einstein ring with 1.4" diameter around a massive
galaxy at z = 1.5. Local star-formation intensities are up to 2000 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$,
amongst the highest observed at high redshift, and clearly in the range of maximal starbursts. Gas-mass
surface densities are a few $\times$ 10$^4$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. The Ruby lies at, and in part
even above, the starburst sequence in the Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram, and at the limit expected
for star formation that is self-regulated through the kinetic energy injection from radiation
pressure, stellar winds, and supernovae. We show that these processes can also inject sufficient
kinetic energy and momentum into the gas to explain the turbulent line widths, which are consistent
with marginally gravitationally bound molecular clouds embedded in a critically Toomre-stable
disk. The star-formation efficiency is in the range 1-10% per free-fall time, consistent with the
notion that the pressure balance that sets the local star-formation law in the Milky Way may well
be universal out to the highest star-formation intensities. AGN feedback is not necessary to regulate
the star formation in the Ruby, in agreement with the absence of a bright AGN component in the infrared
and radio regimes.
