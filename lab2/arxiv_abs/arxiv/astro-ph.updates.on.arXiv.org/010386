Astrophysics lies at the crossroads of big datasets (such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
and Gaia), open source software to visualize and interpret high dimensional datasets (such as Glue,
WorldWide Telescope, and OpenSpace), and uniquely skilled software engineers who bridge data
science and research fields. At the same time, more than 4,000 planetariums across the globe immerse
millions of visitors in scientific data. We have identified the potential for critical synergy
across data, software, hardware, locations, and content that -- if prioritized over the next decade
-- will drive discovery in astronomical research. Planetariums can and should be used for the advancement
of scientific research. Current facilities such as the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, Adler
Planetarium in Chicago, Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco, the Iziko Planetarium and Digital
Dome Research Consortium in Cape Town, and Visualization Center C in Norrkoping are already developing
software which ingests catalogs of astronomical and multi-disciplinary data critical for exploration
research primarily for the purpose of creating scientific storylines for the general public. We
propose a transformative model whereby scientists become the audience and explorers in planetariums,
utilizing software for their own investigative purposes. In this manner, research benefits from
the authentic and unique experience of data immersion contained in an environment bathed in context
and equipped for collaboration. Consequently, in this white paper we argue that over the next decade
the research astronomy community should partner with planetariums to create visualization-based
research opportunities for the field. Realizing this vision will require new investments in software
and human capital.
