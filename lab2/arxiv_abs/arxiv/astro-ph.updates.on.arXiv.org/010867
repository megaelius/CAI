ATLAS (Astrophysics Telescope for Large Area Spectroscopy) is a concept for a NASA probe-class
space mission. It is the spectroscopic follow-up mission to WFIRST, boosting its scientific return
by obtaining deep NIR & MIR slit spectroscopy for most of the galaxies imaged by the WFIRST High Latitude
Survey at z>0.5. ATLAS will measure accurate and precise redshifts for ~200M galaxies out to z=7
and beyond, and deliver spectra that enable a wide range of diagnostic studies of the physical properties
of galaxies over most of cosmic history. ATLAS and WFIRST together will produce a definitive 3D map
of the Universe over 2000 sq deg. ATLAS Science Goals are: (1) Discover how galaxies have evolved
in the cosmic web of dark matter from cosmic dawn through the peak era of galaxy assembly. (2) Discover
the nature of cosmic acceleration. (3) Probe the Milky Way's dust-enshrouded regions, reaching
the far side of our Galaxy. (4) Discover the bulk compositional building blocks of planetesimals
formed in the outer Solar System. These flow down to the ATLAS Scientific Objectives: (1A) Trace
the relation between galaxies and dark matter with less than 10% shot noise on relevant scales at
1<z<7. (1B) Probe the physics of galaxy evolution at 1<z<7. (2) Obtain definitive measurements
of dark energy and tests of General Relativity. (3) Measure the 3D structure and stellar content
of the inner Milky Way to a distance of 25 kpc. (4) Detect and quantify the composition of 3,000 planetesimals
in the outer Solar System. ATLAS is a 1.5m telescope with a FoV of 0.4 sq deg, and uses Digital Micro-mirror
Devices (DMDs) as slit selectors. It has a spectroscopic resolution of R = 1000, and a wavelength
range of 1-4 microns. ATLAS has an unprecedented spectroscopic capability based on DMDs, with a
spectroscopic multiplex factor ~6,000. ATLAS is designed to fit within the NASA probe-class space
mission cost envelope.
