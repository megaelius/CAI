Multi-epoch observations have revealed the variability of pre-main sequence stars and/or their
environment. Moreover, structures in orbital motion around the central star, resulting from planet-disk
interaction, are predicted to cause temporal variations in the brightness distributions of protoplanetary
disks. Through repeated observations with the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) over
nearly two decades, the ESO Archive has become a treasure chest containing high-resolution multi-epoch
near- and mid-infrared observations of the potential planet-forming regions in protoplanetary
disks. We aim to investigate whether the existing multi-epoch observations provide evidence for
the variability of the brightness distributions of the innermost few astronomical units of protoplanetary
disks and to quantify any variations detected. We present different approaches to search for evidence
of temporal variations based on multi-epoch observations obtained with the VLTI instruments PIONIER,
AMBER, and MIDI for 68 pre-main sequence stars. For nine objects in our sample, multi-epoch data
obtained using equal baselines are available that allow us to directly detect variations in the
visibilities due to temporally variable brightness distributions. Significant variations of
the near-infrared visibilities obtained in different epochs with PIONIER and/or AMBER for HD 50138,
DX Cha, HD 142527, V856 Sco, HD 163296, and R CrA were found. By estimating the impact of a small variation
of the baseline on the measured squared visibilities, we are able to compare the data of another 12
pre-main sequence stars. Thereby, we find evidence for temporal variations of the brightness distribution
of one additional object, AK Sco. Besides the two binaries DX Cha and AK Sco, HD 50138 and V856 Sco also
show signs of variability caused by variations of asymmetric structures in the brightness distribution.
