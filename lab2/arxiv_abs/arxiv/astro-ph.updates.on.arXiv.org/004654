The search of life in the Universe is a fundamental problem of astrobiology and a major priority for
NASA. A key area of major progress since the NASA Astrobiology Strategy 2015 (NAS15) has been a shift
from the exoplanet discovery phase to a phase of characterization and modeling of the physics and
chemistry of exoplanetary atmospheres, and the development of observational strategies for the
search for life in the Universe by combining expertise from four NASA science disciplines including
heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary science and Earth science. The NASA Nexus for Exoplanetary
System Science (NExSS) has provided an efficient environment for such interdisciplinary studies.
Solar flares, coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles produce disturbances in interplanetary
space collectively referred to as space weather, which interacts with the Earth upper atmosphere
and causes dramatic impact on space and ground-based technological systems. Exoplanets within
close in habitable zones around M dwarfs and other active stars are exposed to extreme ionizing radiation
fluxes, thus making exoplanetary space weather (ESW) effects a crucial factor of habitability.
In this paper, we describe the recent developments and provide recommendations in this interdisciplinary
effort with the focus on the impacts of ESW on habitability, and the prospects for future progress
in searching for signs of life in the Universe as the outcome of the NExSS workshop held in Nov 29 - Dec
2, 2016, New Orleans, LA. This is one of five Life Beyond the Solar System white papers submitted by
NExSS to the National Academy of Sciences in support of the Astrobiology Science Strategy for the
Search for Life in the Universe.
