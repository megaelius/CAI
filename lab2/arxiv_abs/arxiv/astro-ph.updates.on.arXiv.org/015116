Late accretion is a process that strongly modulated surface geomorphic and geochemical features
of Mercury. Yet, the fate of the impactors and their effects on Mercury's surface through the bombardment
epoch are not clear. Using Monte-Carlo and analytical approaches of cratering impacts, we investigate
the physical and thermodynamical outcomes of late accretion on Mercury. Considering the uncertainties
in late accretion, we develop scaling laws for the following parameters as a function of impact velocity
and total mass of late accretion: (1) depth of crustal erosion, (2) the degree of resurfacing, and
(3) mass accreted from impactor material. Existing dynamical models indicate that Mercury experienced
an intense impact bombardment (a total mass of $\sim 8 \times 10^{18} - 8 \times 10^{20}$ kg with a
typical impact velocity of $30-40$ km s$^{-1}$) after $4.5$ Ga. With this, we find that late accretion
could remove 50 m to 10 km of the early crust of Mercury, but the change to its core-to-mantle ratio
is negligible. Alternatively, the mantles of putative differentiated planetesimals in the early
solar system could be more easily removed and their respective core fraction increased, if Mercury
ultimately accreted from such objects. Although the cratering is notable for erasing the older
geological surface records on Mercury, we show that $\sim 40-50$ wt% of the impactor's exogenic
materials, including the volatile-bearing materials, can be heterogeneously implanted on Mercury's
surface as a late veneer ($>3\times 10^{18}-1.6 \times 10^{19}$ kg in total). About half of the accreted
impactor's materials are vaporized, and the rest is completely melted upon the impact. We expect
that the further interplay between our theoretical results and forthcoming surface observations
of Mercury, including the BepiColombo mission, will lead us to a better understanding of Mercury's
origin and evolution.
