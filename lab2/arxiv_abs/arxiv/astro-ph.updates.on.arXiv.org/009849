T Tauri stars are low-mass young stars whose disks provide the setting for planet formation. Despite
this, their structure is poorly understood. We present new infrared interferometric observations
of the SU Aurigae circumstellar environment that offer 3 x higher resolution and better baseline
position angle coverage over previous observations. We investigate the characteristics of circumstellar
material around SU Aur, constrain the disk geometry, composition and inner dust rim structure.
The CHARA array offers opportunities for long baseline observations, with baselines up to 331 m.
Using the CLIMB 3-telescope combiner in the K-band allows us to measure visibilities as well as closure
phase. We undertook image reconstruction for model-independent analysis, and geometric modeling.
Additionally, the fitting of radiative transfer models constrains the physical parameters of
the disk. For the first time, a dusty disk wind is introduced to the radiative transfer code TORUS
to model protoplanetary disks. Our implementation is motivated by theoretical dusty disk winds,
where magnetic field lines drive dust above the disk plane close to the sublimation zone. Image reconstruction
reveals an inclined disk with slight asymmetry along its minor-axis, likely due to inclination
effects obscuring the inner disk rim through absorption of incident star light on the near-side
and thermal re-emission/scattering of the far-side. Geometric modelling of a skewed ring finds
the inner rim at 0.17+/-0.02 au with an inclination of 50.9+/-1.0 degrees and minor axis position
angle 60.8+/-1.2 degrees. Radiative transfer modelling shows a flared disk with an inner radius
at 0.18 au which implies a grain size of 0.4 um and a scale height of 15.0 au at 100 au. Among the tested
radiative transfer models, only the dusty disk wind successfully accounts for the K-band excess
by introducing dust above the mid-plane.
