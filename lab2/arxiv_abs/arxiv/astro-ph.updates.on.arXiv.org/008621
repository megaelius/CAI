We present a detailed study of a transient in the center of SDSS1115+0544 based on the extensive UV,
optical, mid-IR light curves (LC) and spectra over 1200 days. The host galaxy is a quiescent early
type galaxy at $z$ = 0.0899 with a blackhole mass of $2\times10^7M_\odot$. The transient underwent
a 2.5 magnitude brightening over $\sim120$ days, reaching a peak $V$-band luminosity (extinction
corrected) of $-20.9$ magnitude, then fading 0.5 magnitude over 200 days, settling into a plateau
of $>600$ days. Following the optical brightening are the significant mid-IR flares at $3.4$ and
$4.5\mu$m, with a peak time delay of $\sim180$ days. The mid-IR LCs are explained as the echo of UV
photons by a dust medium with a radius of $5\times10^{17}$ cm, consistent with $\rm E(B-V)$ of 0.58
inferred from the spectra. This event is very energetic with an extinction corrected $L_{bol} \sim
4\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Optical spectra over 400 days in the plateau phase revealed newly
formed broad H$\alpha, \beta$ emission with a FWHM of $\sim3750$ km s$^{-1}$ and narrow coronal
lines such as [Fe VII], [Ne V]. This flare also has a steeply rising UV continuum, detected by multi-epoch
$Swift$ data at $+700$ to $+900$ days post optical peak. The broad Balmer lines and the UV continuum
do not show significant temporal variations. The slow evolving LCs over 1200 days, the constant
Balmer lines and UV continuum at late-times rule out TDE and SN IIn as the physical model for this event.
We propose that this event is a `turn-on' AGN, transitioning from a quiescent state to a type 1 AGN
with a sub-Eddington accretion rate of $0.017M_\odot$/yr. This change occurred on a very short
time scale of $\sim 120- 200$ days. The discovery of such a rapid `turn-on' AGN poses challenges to
accretion disk theories and may indicate such event is not extremely rare.
