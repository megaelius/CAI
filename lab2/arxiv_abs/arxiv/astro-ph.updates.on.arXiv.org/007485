There is strong observational evidence that many active galactic nuclei (AGNs) harbour supermassive
black holes (SMBHs), demonstrating multi-accretion episodes during their lifetime. In such AGNs,
corotating and counterrotating tori, or strongly misaligned disks, as related to the central SMBH
spin, can report traces of the AGNs evolution. Here we concentrate on aggregates of accretion disks
structures, ringed accretion disks (RADs) orbiting a central Kerr SMBH, assuming that each torus
of the RADs is centered in the equatorial plane of the BH, tori are coplanar and axisymmetric. Many
RAD aspects are governed mostly by the Kerr geometry spin. We classify Kerr BHs due to their dimensionless
spin, according to possible combinations of corotating and counterrotating equilibrium or accreting
tori composing the RADs. The number of accreting tori in RADs cannot exceed n=2. We present list of
14 characteristic values of the BH spin a governing the classification in the BH range 0<a<M, constrained
by the RAD properties. The spins are remarkably close providing an accurate characterization of
the Kerr BHs based on the RAD properties. RAD dynamics is richer in the spacetimes of high spins. One
of the critical predictions states that a RAD tori couple formed by an outer accreting corotating
and an inner accreting counterrotating torus is expected to be observed only around slowly spinning
(a<0.46M) BHs. The analysis strongly binds the fluid and BH characteristics providing indications
on the situations where to search for RADs observational evidences. Obscuring and screening tori,
possibly evident as traces in Xray spectrum emission, are strongly constrained, eventually ruling
out many assumptions used in the current investigations of the screening effects. We expect relevance
of our classification of Kerr BHs in relation to AGNs phenomena that could be observed by the Xray
satellite ATHENA.
