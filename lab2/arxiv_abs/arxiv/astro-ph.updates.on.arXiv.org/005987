We discuss the detection in the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) of two objects in Neptune's
distant 9:1 mean motion resonance at semimajor axis $a\approx~130$~au. Both objects are securely
resonant on 10~Myr timescales, with one securely in the 9:1 resonance's leading asymmetric libration
island and the other in either the symmetric or trailing asymmetric island. These objects are the
largest semimajor axis objects with secure resonant classifications, and their detection in a
carefully characterized survey allows for the first robust resonance population estimate beyond
100~au. The detection of these objects implies a 9:1 resonance population of $1.1\times10^4$ objects
with $H_r<8.66$ ($D~\gtrsim~100$~km) on similar orbits (95\% confidence range of $\sim0.4-3\times10^4$).
Integrations over 4~Gyr of an ensemble of clones spanning these objects' orbit fit uncertainties
reveal that they both have median resonance occupation timescales of $\sim1$~Gyr. These timescales
are consistent with the hypothesis that these objects originate in the scattering population but
became transiently stuck to Neptune's 9:1 resonance within the last $\sim1$~Gyr of solar system
evolution. Based on simulations of a model of the current scattering population, we estimate the
expected resonance sticking population in the 9:1 resonance to be 1000-4500 objects with $H_r<8.66$;
this is marginally consistent with the OSSOS 9:1 population estimate. We conclude that resonance
sticking is a plausible explanation for the observed 9:1 population, but we also discuss the possibility
of a primordial 9:1 population, which would have interesting implications for the Kuiper belt's
dynamical history.
