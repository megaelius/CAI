The spectrum of the Fe I atom is critical to many areas of astrophysics and beyond. Measurements of
the energies of its high-lying levels remain woefully incomplete, however, despite extensive
analysis of ultraviolet laboratory iron absorption spectra, optical laboratory iron emission
spectra, and the solar infrared spectrum. In this work we use as sources the high-resolution archival
absorption-line ultraviolet and optical spectra of stars, whose warm temperatures favor moderate
Fe I excitation. We derive the energy for a particular upper level in Kurucz's semiempirical calculations
by adopting a trial value that yields the same wavelength for a given line predicted to be about as
strong as that of a strong unidentified spectral line observed in the stellar spectra, then checking
the new wavelengths of other strong predicted transitions that share the same upper level for coincidence
with other strong observed unidentified lines. To date this analysis has provided the upper energies
of 66 Fe I levels. Many new level energies are higher than those accessible to laboratory experiments;
several exceed the Fe I ionization energy. These levels provide new identifications for over two
thousand potentially detectable lines. Almost all of the new levels of odd parity include UV lines
that were detected but unclassified in laboratory Fe I absorption spectra, providing an external
check on the energy values. We motivate and present the procedure, provide the resulting new level
energies and their uncertainties, list all the potentially detectable UV and optical new Fe I line
identifications and their gf-values, point out new lines of astrophysical interest, and discuss
the prospects for additional Fe I energy-level determinations in the near future.
