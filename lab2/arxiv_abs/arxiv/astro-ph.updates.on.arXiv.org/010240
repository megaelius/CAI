We present the results of mapping observations toward an outflow-shocked region, OMC-2 FIR 4 using
the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. We observed the area in $^{13}$CO ($J=1-0$), C$^{18}$O ($J=1-0$),
N$_2$H$^+$ ($J=1-0$), CCS ($J_N=8_7-7_6$), HCO$^+$ ($J=1-0$), H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J=1-0$), HN$^{13}$C
($J=1-0$), H$^{13}$CN ($J=1-0$), DNC ($J=1-0$), N$_2$D$^+$ ($J=1-0$), and DC$_3$N ($J=9-8$).
We detected a dense molecular clump that contains FIR 4/5. We also detected in $^{13}$CO blueshifted
and redshifted components driven presumably by protostellar outflows in this region. The axes
of the FIR 3 and VLA 13 outflows, projected on the plane of the sky, appear to point toward the FIR 4 clump,
suggesting that the clump may be compressed by protostellar outflows from Class I sources, FIR 3
and VLA 13. Applying the hyperfine fit of N$_2$H$^+$ lines, we estimated the excitation temperature
to be $\sim$ 20 K. The high excitation temperature is consistent with the fact that the clump contains
protostars. The CCS emission was detected in this region for the first time. Its abundance is estimated
to be a few $\times 10^{-12}$, indicating that the region is chemically evolved at $\sim 10^5$ years,
which is comparable to the typical lifetime of the Class I protostars. This timescale is consistent
with the scenario that star formation in FIR 4 is triggered by dynamical compression of the protostellar
outflows. The [HNC]/[HCN] ratio is evaluated to be $\sim 0.5$ in the dense clump and the outflow lobes,
whereas it is somewhat larger in the envelope of the dense clump. The small [HNC]/[HCN] ratio indicates
that the HNC formation was prevented due to high temperatures. Such high temperatures seem to be
consistent with the scenario that either protostellar radiation or outflow compression, or both,
affected the thermal properties of this region.
