The relevance of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) compared to neutrino-driven
convection in three-dimensional (3D) supernova-core environments is still highly controversial.
Studying a 27 Msun progenitor, we demonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity can
develop in 3D simulations with detailed neutrino transport despite the presence of convection.
This result was obtained with the Prometheus-Vertex code with the same sophisticated neutrino
treatment so far used only in 1D and 2D models. While buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial
mass motions in the postshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with growing amplitude sets in during
a phase of shock retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose growth is only quenched when
the infall of the Si/SiO interface leads to strong shock expansion in response to a dramatic decrease
of the mass accretion rate. In the phase of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the
postshock layer exhibits nonradial deformation dominated by the lowest-order spherical harmonics
(l=1, m=0,-1,+1) in distinct contrast to the higher multipole structures associated with neutrino-driven
convection. We find that the SASI amplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic energy in
3D can exceed those of the corresponding 2D case during extended periods of the evolution. We also
perform parametrized 3D simulations of a 25 Msun progenitor, using a simplified, gray neutrino
transport scheme, an axis-free Yin-Yang grid, and different amplitudes of random seed perturbations.
They confirm the importance of the SASI for another progenitor, its independence of the choice of
spherical grid, and its preferred growth for fast accretion flows connected to small shock radii
and compact proto-neutron stars as previously found in 2D setups.
