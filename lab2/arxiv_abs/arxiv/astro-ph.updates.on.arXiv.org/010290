Previous generation of instruments have the opportunity to discover thousands of extra-solar
planets and more will come with the current and future planet-search missions. In order to go one
step further in the characterization of exoplanets, in this paper we describe a way to compare the
photometric observation of Hot Jupiters done with space telescopes such as HST, CHEOPS, TESS, PLATO,
and JWST and give the first-hand characterization on their atmospheres. We analyze a set of planetary
systems hosting a Hot Jupiter for which an atmospheric template is available in the literature.
For each system, we simulate the transit light curves observed by different instruments, convolving
the incoming spectrum with the corresponding instrumental throughput. For each instrument, we
thus measure the expected transit depth and estimate the associated uncertainty. Finally, we compare
the transit depths as seen by the selected instruments and we quantify the effect of the planetary
atmosphere on multi-band transit photometry. We also analyze a set of simulated scenarios with
different stellar magnitudes, activity levels, transit durations and atmospheric templates
to find the best cases for this kind of observational approach. We find in general that current and
especially future space telescopes provide enough photometric precision to detect significant
differences between the transit depths at different wavelengths. In particular, we find that the
chromatic effect due to the atmosphere of the Hot Jupiters is maximized at later spectral types and
that the effect of stellar activity is smaller than the measurement uncertainties.
