The integrated HI emission from hierarchical structures such as groups and clusters of galaxies
can be detected by FAST at intermediate redshifts. Here we propose to use FAST to study the evolution
of the global HI content of clusters and groups over cosmic time by measuring their integrated HI
emissions. We use the Virgo cluster as an example to estimate the detection limit of FAST, and have
estimated the integration time to detect a Virgo type cluster at different redshifts (from z=0.1
to z=1.5). We have also employed a semi-analytic model (SAM) to simulate the evolution of HI contents
in galaxy clusters. Our simulations suggest that the HI mass of a Virgo-like cluster could be 2-3
times higher and the physical size could be more than 50\% smaller when redshift increases from z=0.3
to z=1. Thus the integration time could be reduced significantly and gas rich clusters at intermediate
redshifts can be detected by FAST in less than 2 hour of integration time. For the local universe,
we have also used SAM simulations to create mock catalogs of clusters to predict the outcomes from
FAST all sky surveys. Comparing with the optically selected catalogs derived by cross matching
the galaxy catalogs from the SDSS survey and the ALFALFA survey, we find that the HI mass distribution
of the mock catalog with 20 second of integration time agrees well with that of observations. However,
the mock catalog with 120 second integration time predicts much more groups and clusters that contains
a population of low mass HI galaxies not detected by the ALFALFA survey. Future deep HI blind sky survey
with FAST would be able to test such prediction and set constraints to the numerical simulation models.
Observational strategy and sample selections for the future FAST observations of galaxy clusters
at high redshifts are also discussed.
