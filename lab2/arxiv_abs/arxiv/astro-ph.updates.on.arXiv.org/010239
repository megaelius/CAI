The Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the $Fermi$ spacecraft routinely observes high-energy emission
from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here we present the second catalog of LAT-detected GRBs, covering
the first 10 years of operations, from 2008 August 4 to 2018 August 4. A total of 186 GRBs are found;
of these, 91 show emission in the range $30-100\,$MeV (17 of which are seen only in this band) and 169
are detected above 100 MeV. Most of these sources were discovered by other instruments ($Fermi$/GBM,
$Swift$/BAT, AGILE, INTEGRAL) or reported by the Interplanetary Network (IPN); the LAT has independently
triggered on 4 GRBs. This catalog presents the results for all 186 GRBs. We study onset, duration
and temporal properties of each GRB, as well as spectral characteristics in the $100\,$MeV$-100\,$GeV
energy range. Particular attention is given to the photons with highest energy. Compared with the
first LAT GRB catalog, our rate of detection is significantly improved. The results generally confirm
the main findings of the first catalog: the LAT primarily detects the brightest GBM bursts, and the
high-energy emission shows delayed onset as well as longer duration. However, in this work we find
delays exceeding 1 ks, and several GRBs with durations over 10 ks. Furthermore, the larger number
of LAT detections shows that these GRBs cover not only the high-fluence range of GBM-detected GRBs,
but also samples lower fluences. In addition, the greater number of detected GRBs with redshift
estimates allows us to study their properties in both the observer and rest frames. Comparison of
the observational results with theoretical predictions reveals that no model is currently able
to explain all results, highlighting the role of LAT observations in driving theoretical models.
