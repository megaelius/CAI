We present an analysis of the VIMS solar occultations dataset, which allows us to extract vertically
resolved information on the characteristics of Titan's atmosphere between 100-700 km with a characteristic
vertical resolution of 10 km. After a series of data treatment procedures, 4 occultations out of
10 are retained. This sample covers different seasons and latitudes of Titan. The transmittances
show clearly the evolution of the haze and detect the detached layer at 310 km in Sept. 2011 at mid-northern
latitudes. Through the inversion of the transmission spectra with a line-by-line radiative transfer
code we retrieve the vertical distribution of CH$_4$ and CO mixing ratio. The two methane bands at
1.4 and 1.7 {\mu}m are always in good agreement and yield an average stratospheric abundance of $1.28\pm0.08$%.
This is significantly less than the value of 1.48% obtained by the GCMS/Huygens instrument. The
analysis of the residual spectra after the inversion shows that there are additional absorptions
which affect a great part of the VIMS wavelength range. We attribute many of these additional bands
to gaseous ethane, whose near-infrared spectrum is not well modeled yet. Ethane contributes significantly
to the strong absorption between 3.2-3.5 {\mu}m that was previously attributed only to C-H stretching
bands from aerosols. Ethane bands may affect the surface windows too, especially at 2.7 {\mu}m.
Other residual bands are generated by stretching modes of C-H, C-C and C-N bonds. In addition to the
C-H stretch from aliphatic hydrocarbons at 3.4 {\mu}m, we detect a strong and narrow absorption
at 3.28 {\mu}m which we tentatively attribute to the presence of PAHs in the stratosphere. C-C and
C-N stretching bands are possibly present between 4.3-4.5 {\mu}m. Finally, we obtain the CO mixing
ratio between 70-170 km. The average result of $46\pm16$ ppm is in good agreement with previous studies.
