We performed a complete investigation on the magnetar-like radio pulsar PSR J1119-6127 with the
archival high-energy observations obtained after its magnetar-like outbursts in the end July
of 2016. The X-ray pulsations can be described by the contribution from two hotspots, and the surface
emission from the larger hotspot can be replaced by the magnetized atmospheric radiation. After
the bursts, specific regions on the neutron star can be heated up to > 1 keV, and a hard non-thermal
component related to the magnetospheric emission can be seen from the spectra in the hard X-ray band.
Instead of the cooling down, we find that the thermal emitting region gradually shrunk following
the decrease of the source flux after the burst. Marginal hard X-ray pulsations can be detected soon
after the outburst, but the signal totally disappeared in a few days. We found that the gamma-ray
emission was suppressed during the outburst. This is likely caused by the reconfiguration of the
magnetic field of PSR J1119-6127 accompanying with the mode changing in radio pulsation after the
burst. Due to the possible global change in the magnetosphere, the timing solution of the pulsar
evolved dramatically and the gamma-ray pulsation soon after the these X-ray bursts cannot be resolved
without seriously counting the effect of timing noise. Unlike the exponential recovery trend of
the spin-down rate that was observed in the 2004 and 2007 glitch events and the glitch events of other
pulsars, we did not obtain a similar timing behavior after the glitch of 2016 caused by the bursts.
We argue that temporal/spectral behaviors of the observed emission from radio to gamma-ray bands
after the burst were caused by a complex combinations of a change of the magnetospheric structure,
pair plasma injection and the shrinking emission sites on the neutron star.
