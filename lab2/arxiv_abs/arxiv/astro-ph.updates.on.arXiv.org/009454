The claim of an exomoon candidate in the Kepler-1625b system has generated substantial discussion
regarding possible alternative explanations for the purported signal. In this work we examine
in detail these possibilities. First, the effect of more flexible trend models is explored and we
show that sufficiently flexible models are capable of attenuating the signal, although this is
an expected byproduct of invoking such models. We also explore trend models using X and Y centroid
positions and show that there is no data-driven impetus to adopt such models over temporal ones.
We quantify the probability that the 500 ppm moon-like dip could be caused by a Neptune-sized transiting
planet to be < 0.75%. We show that neither autocorrelation, Gaussian processes nor a Lomb-Scargle
periodogram are able to recover a stellar rotation period, demonstrating that K1625 is a quiet star
with periodic behavior < 200 ppm. Through injection and recovery tests, we find that the star does
not exhibit a tendency to introduce false-positive dip-like features above that of pure Gaussian
noise. Finally, we address a recent re-analysis by Kreidberg et al (2019) and show that the difference
in conclusions is not from differing systematics models but rather the reduction itself. We show
that their reduction exhibits i) slightly higher intra-orbit and post-fit residual scatter, ii)
$\simeq$ 900 ppm larger flux offset at the visit change, iii) $\simeq$ 2 times larger Y-centroid
variations, and iv) $\simeq$ 3.5 times stronger flux-centroid correlation coefficient than the
original analysis. These points could be explained by larger systematics in their reduction, potentially
impacting their conclusions.
