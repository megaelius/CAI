Radial-velocity follow-up of stars harbouring transiting planets detected by TESS is expected
to require very large amounts of expensive telescope time in the next few years. Therefore, scheduling
strategies should be implemented to maximize the amount of information gathered about the target
planetary systems. We present one random scheduler and two types of uniform-in-phase schedulers:
one myopic, which selects targets one-at-a-time, and one non-myopic that efficiently explores
all the possible combinations between stars to be observed and available time slots. We compare
these strategies with respect to the bias, accuracy and precision achieved in recovering the mass
and orbital parameters of transiting and non-transiting planets from the mock radial-velocity
follow-up of a sample of 50 TESS target stars, with simulated planetary systems containing at least
one transiting planet with a radius below $4R_{\oplus}$. For each system and strategy, 10 radial-velocity
datasets were generated and analysed using a fully Bayesian methodology. We find the myopic strategies
lead to a biased estimation of the order of 5\% of the mass of the transiting exoplanets while the non-myopic
scheduler is able to provide an unbiased (<1\%) measurement of the masses while keeping the relative
accuracy and precision around 16\% and 23\% respectively. The number of non-transiting planets
detected is similar for all the strategies considered, although the random scheduler leads to less
biased and more accurate estimates for their mass and orbital parameters, possibly due to a higher
mean number of scheduled radial-velocities for the datasets associated with non-transiting planets
detections.
