Contex: Solar magnetic activity exhibits variations with periods between 1.5--4 years, the so-called
quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs), in addition to the well-known 11-year Schwabe cycles. Solar
dynamo is thought to be the responsible mechanism for generation of the QBOs. Aims: In this work,
we analyse sunspot areas to investigate the spatial and temporal behaviour of the QBO signal and
study the responsible physical mechanisms using simulations from fully nonlinear mean-field
flux-transport dynamos. Methods: We investigated the behaviour of the QBOs in the sunspot area
data in full disk, and northern and southern hemispheres, using wavelet and Fourier analyses. We
also ran solar dynamos with two different approaches to generating a poloidal field from an existing
toroidal field, Babcock-Leighton and turbulent $\alpha$ mechanisms. We then studied the simulated
magnetic field strengths as well as meridional circulation and differential rotation rates using
the same methods. Results: The results from the sunspot areas show that the QBOs are present in the
full disk and hemispheric sunspot areas and they show slightly different spatial and temporal behaviours,
indicating a slightly decoupled solar hemispheres. The QBO signal is generally intermittent and
in-phase with the sunspot area data, surfacing when the solar activity is in maximum. The results
from the BL-dynamos showed that they are neither capable of generating the slightly decoupled behaviour
of solar hemispheres nor can they generate QBO-like signals. The turbulent $\alpha$-dynamos,
on the other hand, generated decoupled hemispheres and some QBO-like shorter cycles. Conclusions:
In conclusion, our simulations show that the turbulent $\alpha$-dynamos with the Lorentz force
seems more efficient in generating the observed temporal and spatial behaviour of the QBO signal
compared with those from the BL-dynamos.
