The averaged resonant equations of motion for the planar circular restricted three-body problem
are solved on the linearization basis taking into account also non-gravitational effects. The
averaged resonant equations are derived from Lagrange's planetary equations with additional
Gauss's terms caused by the non-gravitational effects. The time depending solution has the standard
form with exponential, quadratic, linear and constant terms. The existence of a rotational symmetry
in the action of the non-gravitational effects around the star determines the order of a characteristic
equation of the linearized system. In the symmetrical case (order 3) the considered non-gravitational
effects are the stellar electromagnetic radiation and the radial stellar wind (stellar radiation).
In the asymmetrical case (order 4) the stellar radiation and interstellar gas flow are considered.
It is investigated how well the linearization solution describes real solution obtained from an
equation of motion by a comparison of the resonant libration frequency found analytically and numerically.
It is found that from initial values of the evolving orbital parameters (semimajor axis, eccentricity,
longitude of pericenter, and resonant angular variable) in the averaged phase space the linearization
frequency depends most sensitively on the initial value of the resonant angular variable. For small
libration amplitudes of the resonant angular variable the best match of the real libration frequency
and the linearization frequency is located approximately at the solution of the resonant condition
($da / dt$ $=$ 0). If the initial averaged conditions are chosen close to the solution of resonant
condition, then the linearization frequency for practically all simple oscillatory evolutions
matches the real libration frequency and the linearization solution very well approximates the
real evolution.
