We study the formation and evolution of a sample of Lyman Break Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization
by using high-resolution ($\sim 10 \,{\rm pc}$), cosmological zoom-in simulations part of the
SERRA suite. In SERRA, we follow the interstellar medium (ISM) thermo-chemical non-equilibrium
evolution, and perform on-the-fly radiative transfer of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF).
The simulation outputs are post-processed to compute the emission of far infrared lines ([CII],
[NII], and [OIII]). At $z=8$, the most massive galaxy, `Freesia', has an age $t_\star \simeq 409\,{\rm
Myr}$, stellar mass $M_{\star} \simeq 4.2\times 10^9 {\rm M}_{\odot}$, and a star formation rate
${\rm SFR} \simeq 11.5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\rm yr}^{-1}$, due to a recent burst. Freesia has two stellar
components (A and B) separated by $\simeq 2.5\, {\rm kpc}$; other 11 galaxies are found within $56.9
\pm 21.6 \, {\rm kpc}$. The mean ISRF in the Habing band is $G = 7.9\, G_0$ and is spatially uniform;
in contrast, the ionisation parameter is $U = 2^{+20}_{-2} \times 10^{-3}$, and has a patchy distribution
peaked at the location of star-forming sites. The resulting ionising escape fraction from Freesia
is $f_{\rm esc}\simeq 2\%$. While [CII] emission is extended (radius 1.54 kpc), [OIII] is concentrated
in Freesia-A (0.85 kpc), where the ratio $\Sigma_{\rm [OIII]}/\Sigma_{\rm [CII]} \simeq 10$.
As many high-$z$ galaxies, Freesia lies below the local [CII]-SFR relation. We show that this is
the general consequence of a starburst phase (pushing the galaxy above the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation)
which disrupts/photodissociates the emitting molecular clouds around star-forming sites. Metallicity
has a sub-dominant impact on the amplitude of [CII]-SFR deviations.
