Most planets currently amenable to transit spectroscopy are close enough to their host star to exhibit
a relatively strong day to night temperature gradient. For hot planets, this leads to cause a chemical
composition dichotomy between the two hemispheres. In the extreme case of ultra hot jupiters, some
species, such as molecular hydrogen and water, are strongly dissociated on the day-side while others,
such as carbon monoxide, are not. However, most current retrieval algorithm rely on 1D forward models
that are unable to model this effect. We thus investigate how the 3D structure of the atmosphere biases
the abundances retrieved using commonly used algorithms. We study the case of Wasp-121b as a prototypical
ultra hot Jupiter. We use the simulations of this planet performed with the SPARC/MIT global climate
model (GCM) and generate transmission spectra that fully account for the 3D structure of the atmosphere
with Pytmopsh3R. These spectra are then analyzed using the \taurex retrieval code. We find that
such ultra hot jupiter's transmission spectra exhibit muted H$_2$O features that originate in
the night-side where the temperature, hence the scale-height, is smaller than on the day-side.
However, the spectral features of molecules present on the day-side are boosted by both its high
temperature and low mean molecular weight. As a result, the retrieved parameters are strongly biased
compared to the ground truth. In particular the [CO]/[H$_2$O] is overestimated by one to three orders
of magnitude. This must be kept in mind when using such retrieval analysis to infer the C/O ratio of
a planet's atmosphere. We also discuss whether indicators can allow us to infer the 3D structure
of an observed atmosphere. Finally we show that HST/WFC3 transmission data of Wasp-121b are compatible
with the day-night thermal and compositional dichotomy predicted by models.
