This paper presents the detailed abundances and r-process classifications of 126 newly identified
metal-poor stars as part of an ongoing collaboration, the R-Process Alliance. The stars were identified
as metal-poor candidates from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and were followed-up at high
spectral resolution (R~31,500) with the 3.5~m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. The atmospheric
parameters were determined spectroscopically from Fe I lines, taking into account <3D> non-LTE
corrections and using differential abundances with respect to a set of standards. Of the 126 new
stars, 124 have [Fe/H]<-1.5, 105 have [Fe/H]<-2.0, and 4 have [Fe/H]<-3.0. Nine new carbon-enhanced
metal-poor stars have been discovered, 3 of which are enhanced in r-process elements. Abundances
of neutron-capture elements reveal 60 new r-I stars (with +0.3<=[Eu/Fe]<=+1.0 and [Ba/Eu]<0)
and 4 new r-II stars (with [Eu/Fe]>+1.0). Nineteen stars are found to exhibit a `limited-r' signature
([Sr/Ba]>+0.5, [Ba/Eu]<0). For the r-II stars, the second- and third-peak main r-process patterns
are consistent with the r-process signature in other metal-poor stars and the Sun. The abundances
of the light, alpha, and Fe-peak elements match those of typical Milky Way halo stars, except for
one r-I star which has high Na and low Mg, characteristic of globular cluster stars. Parallaxes and
proper motions from the second Gaia data release yield UVW space velocities for these stars which
are consistent with membership in the Milky Way halo. Intriguingly, all r-II and the majority of
r-I stars have retrograde orbits, which may indicate an accretion origin.
