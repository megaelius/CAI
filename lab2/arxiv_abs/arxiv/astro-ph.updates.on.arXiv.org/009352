Ultraviolet (UV) photodissociation of CO controls the abundances and distribution of CO and its
photodissociation products. This significantly influences the gas-phase chemistry in the circumstellar
envelope (CSE) around evolved stars. A better understanding of CO photodissociation in outflows
also provides a more precise estimate of mass-loss rates. We aim to update the CO photodissociation
rate in an expanding spherical envelope assuming that the interstellar radiation field (ISRF)
photons penetrate through the envelope. This will allow us to precisely estimate the CO abundance
distributions in CSEs around evolved stars. We used the most recent CO spectroscopic data to precisely
calculate the depth dependency of the photodissociation rate of each CO dissociating line. We calculated
the CO self- and mutual-shielding functions in an expanding envelope. We investigated the dependence
of the CO profile on the five fundamental parameters mass-loss rate, the expansion velocity, the
CO initial abundance, the CO excitation temperature, and the strength of the ISRF. Our derived CO
envelope size is smaller than the commonly used radius derived by Mamon et al. 1988. The difference
between results varies from 1% to 39% and depends on the H2 and CO densities of the envelope. We list
two fitting parameters for a large grid of models to estimate the CO abundance distribution. We demonstrate
that the CO envelope size can differ between outflows with the same effective content of CO, but different
CO abundance, mass-loss rate, and the expansion velocity as a consequence of differing amounts
of shielding by H2 and CO. We find that the abundance of CO close to the star and the outflow density
both can have a significant effect on the size of the molecular envelope. We also demonstrate that
modest variations in the ISRF can cause measurable differences in the envelope extent.
