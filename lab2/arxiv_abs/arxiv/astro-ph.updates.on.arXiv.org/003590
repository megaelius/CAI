We investigate the dust depletion properties of optically thick gas in and around galaxies and its
origin we study in detail the dust depletion patterns of Ti, Mn, and Ca in the multi-component damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA) absorber at $z_\mathrm{abs}=0.313$ toward the quasar PKS 1127$-$145.}
We performed a detailed spectral analysis of the absorption profiles of CaII, MnII, TiII, and NaI
associated with the DLA toward PKS 1127$-$145, based on optical high-resolution data obtained
with the UVES instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We obtained column densities and Doppler-parameters
for the ions listed above and determine their gas-phase abundances, from which we conclude on their
dust depletion properties. We compared the Ca and Ti depletion properties of this DLA with that of
other DLAs. One of the six analyzed absorption components shows a striking underabundance of Ti
and Mn in the gas-phase, indicating the effect of dust depletion for these elements and a locally
enhanced dust-to-gas ratio. In this DLA and in other similar absorbers, the MnII abundance follows
that of TiII very closely, implying that both ions are equally sensitive to the dust depletion effects.
Our analysis indicates that the DLA toward PKS 1127$-$145 has multiple origins. With its narrow
line width and its strong dust depletion, component 3 points toward the presence of a neutral gas
disk from a faint LSB galaxy in front of PKS 1127$-$145, while the other, more diffuse and dust-poor,
absorption components possibly are related to tidal gas features from the interaction between
the various, optically confirmed galaxy-group members. In general, the Mn/CaII ratio in sub-DLAs
and DLAs possibly serves as an important indicator to discriminate between dust-rich and dust-poor
in neutral gas in and around galaxies.
