Understanding infrared (IR) luminosity is fundamental to understanding the cosmic star formation
history and AGN evolution. Japanese infrared satellite, AKARI, provided unique data sets to probe
this both at low and high redshift; the AKARI all sky survey in 6 bands (9-160 $\mu$m), and the AKARI
NEP survey in 9 bands (2-24$\mu$m). The AKARI performed all sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90,
140, and 160 $\mu$m) with 3-10 times better sensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths
across the peak of the dust emission. Combined with a better spatial resolution, we measure the total
infrared luminosity ($L_{TIR}$) of individual galaxies, and thus, the total infrared luminosity
density of the local Universe much more precisely than previous work. In the AKARI NEP wide field,
AKARI has obtained deep images in the mid-infrared (IR), covering 5.4 deg$^2$. However, our previous
work was limited to the central area of 0.25 deg$^2$ due to the lack of deep optical coverage. To rectify
the situation, we used the newly advent Subaru telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam to obtain deep optical
images over the entire 5.4 deg$^2$ of the AKARI NEP wide field. With this deep and wide optical data,
we, for the first time, can use the entire AKARI NEP wide data to construct restframe 8$\mu$m, 12$\mu$m,
and total infrared (TIR) luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.15$<z<$2.2. A continuous 9-band filter
coverage in the mid-IR wavelength (2.4, 3.2, 4.1, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 24$\mu$m) by the AKARI satellite
allowed us to estimate restframe 8$\mu$m and 12$\mu$m luminosities without using a large extrapolation
based on a SED fit, which was the largest uncertainty in previous work. By combining these two results,
we reveal dust-hidden cosmic star formation history and AGN evolution from z=0 to z=2.2, all probed
by the AKARI satellite.
