We investigate the star formation history and the dust attenuation in the galaxy merger Mrk848.
Thanks to the multiwavelength photometry from the ultraviolet (UV) to the infrared (IR), and MaNGA's
integral field spectroscopy, we are able to study this merger in a detailed way. We divide the whole
merger into the core and tail regions, and fit both the optical spectrum and the multi-band spectral
energy distribution (SED) to models to obtain the star formation properties for each region respectively.
We find that the color excess of stars in the galaxy $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$ measured with the multi-band
SED fitting is consistent with that estimated both from the infrared excess (the ratio of IR to UV
flux) and from the slope of the UV continuum. Furthermore, the reliability of the $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$
is examined with a set of mock SEDs, showing that the dust attenuation of the stars can be well constrained
by the UV-to-IR broadband SED fitting. The dust attenuation obtained from optical continuum $E(B-V)_s^{spec}$
is only about half of $E(B-V)_s^{SED}$. The ratio of the $E(B-V)_s^{spec}$ to the $E(B-V)_g$ obtained
from the Balmer decrement is consistent with the local value (around 0.5). The difference between
the results from the UV-to-IR data and the optical data is consistent with the picture that younger
stellar populations are attenuated by an extra dust component from the birth clouds compared to
older stellar populations which are only attenuated by the diffuse dust. Both with the UV-to-IR
SED fitting and the spectral fitting, we find that there is a starburst younger than 100~Myr in one
of the two core regions, consistent with the scenario that the interaction-induced gas inflow can
enhance the star formation in the center of galaxies.
