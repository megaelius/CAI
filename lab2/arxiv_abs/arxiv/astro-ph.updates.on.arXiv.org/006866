Since 2013, the highest energy IceCube cascade showers overcame the common muon neutrino tracks.
This fast flavor changes, above few tens TeV, has been indebt to the injection of the long searched
astrophysical neutrino. However for what concern the recent published ICECUBE 54 neutrino, High
Energy Starting Events, (HESE) in 2016, as well as the most recent ones of 82 and 103 IceCube events
(2017-2018) and the several dozens of thorough-going muon tracks formed around the IceCube, none
of them are pointing or clustering toward any expected x, gamma or radio sources: no one in connection
to GRB, no toward active BL Lac, neither to AGN source in Fermi catalog. No clear correlation with
nearby mass distribution (Local Group), nor with galactic plane. Withal, there have not been any
record of the expected double bang due to the tau neutrino birth and decay among several events above
200 TeV energy (we are disregarding for a moment the most celebrated recent first correlated, but
unique, muon track and the recent two tau possible identification); no any self-clustering events
at tens TeV energy raised in most recent searches. Furthermore, there is a tension between the internal
HESE event spectra power index and the external thorough-going muon tracks one. As we will show at
the conclusions a more mundane (but a bit more abundant) prompt charmed atmospheric neutrino component
may pollute and rule the data, explaining most of the present enlisted IceCube puzzles. We review
the last HESE event data shown in early and in most recent papers (and talks in Neutrino 2018) making
the case for the simplest conclusions. We believe that most astrophysical neutrino signals are
still hidden below the ashes of these new, anyway discovered, prompt atmospheric noise.
