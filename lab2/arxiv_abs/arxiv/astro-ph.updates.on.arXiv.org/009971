We examine the potential multi-messenger role of BL Lac objects emitting at high energy (so-called
HBL) focusing on the limits on the energy density of soft radiation in the jet frame, a critical parameter
which regulates the proton cooling and the fragmentation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR)
nuclei possibly accelerated in the jet. We show that (under the assumption that the high-energy
emission bump is dominated by inverse Compton emission) the energy density of any external soft
radiation field (e.g. produced by a layer surrounding the jet or in the accretion flow) cannot be
larger than few times that associated to the observed synchrotron radiation produced in the emission
region. Quite interestingly, the constraint that we derive is generally stronger than the limit
obtained from the condition that the source is transparent to very-high energy $\gamma$-rays.
Using this constraint we can derive a robust upper limit for the efficiency of the photopion reaction
leading to the emission of PeV neutrinos, $f_{\pi}\lesssim 10^{-5}$, which makes HBL quite inefficient
neutrino sources. For the photodisintegration of nuclei the results are more dependent on the spectral
properties of the radiation field. The photodisintegration efficiency is safely below 1 (and nuclei
can escape intact) for a `canonical' spectrum of the soft radiation field $\propto \nu^{-0.5}$.
For radiation fields characterized by a softer spectrum and extended over a large portion of the
jet, the efficiency increases and for an appreciable fraction of the sources nuclei with energies
above $10^{19}$ eV might suffer significant photodisintegration.
