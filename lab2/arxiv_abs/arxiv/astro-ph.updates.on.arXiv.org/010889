We investigate the explosion of stars with zero-age main-sequence masses between 20 and 35 solar
masses and varying degrees of rotation and magnetic fields including ones commonly considered
progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The simulations, combining special relativistic magnetohydrodynamics,
a general relativistic approximate gravitational potential, and two-moment neutrino transport,
demonstrate the viability of different scenarios for the post-bounce evolution. Having formed
a highly massive proto-neutron star (PNS), several models launch successful explosions, either
by the standard supernova mechanism based on neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities
or by magnetorotational processes. It is, however, quite common for the PNS to collapse to a black
hole (BH) within a few seconds. Others might produce proto-magnetar-driven explosions. We explore
several ways to describe the different explosion mechanisms. The competition between the timescales
for advection of gas through the gain layer and heating by neutrinos provides an approximate explanation
for models with insignificant magnetic fields. The fidelity of this explosion criterion in the
case of rapid rotation can be improved by accounting for the strong deviations from spherical symmetry
and mixing between pole and equator. We furthermore study an alternative description including
the ram pressure of the gas falling through the shock. Magnetically driven explosions tend to arise
from a strongly magnetised region around the polar axis. In these cases, the onset of the explosion
corresponds to the equality between the advection timescale and the timescale for the propagation
of Alfv\'en waves through the gain layer.
