We have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ine Seyfert 1 galaxies (RLNLS1s),
selected by searching among all the known sources of this type and omitting those with steep radio
spectra. We analyse data from radio frequencies to X-rays, and supplement these with information
available from online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the full electromagnetic spectrum.
This is the largest known multiwavelength survey for this type of source. We detected 90% of the sources
in X-rays and found 17% at gamma rays. Extreme variability at high energies was also found, down to
timescales as short as hours. In some sources, dramatic spectral and flux changes suggest interplay
between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk. The estimated masses of the central black holes
are in the range $\sim 10^{6-8}M_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretion luminosities
span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the Eddington limit, similar to those of quasars.
The distribution of the calculated jet power spans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$
erg s$^{-1}$, generally lower than quasars and BL Lac objects, but partially overlapping with the
latter. Once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet power of the three types of
active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other, indicating the scalability of the jet. Despite
the observational differences, the central engine of RLNLS1s is apparently quite similar to that
of blazars. The historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies
might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.
