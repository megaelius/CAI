V1247 Orionis harbours a pre-transitional disc with a partially cleared gap. Earlier interferometric
and polarimetric observations revealed strong asymmetries both in the gap region and in the outer
disc. The presence of a companion was inferred to explain these asymmetric structures and the ongoing
disc clearing. Using an extensive set of multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations we aimed
to identify the origin of the previously detected asymmetries. We have observed V1247 Ori at three
epochs spanning $\sim678$ days using sparse aperture masking interferometry with Keck/NIRC2
and VLT/NACO. In addition, we search for signs of accretion through VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL spectral
differential imaging in H$\alpha$ and R-band continuum. Our SMA sub-millimetre interferometry
in 880 $\mu$m continuum and in the CO(3-2) line allows us to constrain the orientation and direction
of rotation of the outer disc. We find the L'-band emission to be dominated by static features which
trace forward-scattered dust emission from the inner edge of the outer disc located to the north-east.
In H- and K-band, we see evidence for a companion candidate that moved systematically by 45$^{\circ}$
within the first $\sim$345 days. The separation of the companion candidate is not well constrained,
but the observed position angle change is consistent with Keplerian motion of a body located on a
6 au orbit. From the SMA CO moment map, the location of the disc rim, and the detected orbital motion,
we deduced the three-dimensional orientation of the disc. We see no indication of accretion in H$\alpha$
and set upper limits for an accreting companion. The measured contrast of the companion candidate
in H and K is consistent with an actively accreting protoplanet. Hence, we identify V1247 Ori as a
unique laboratory for studying companion-disc interactions and disc clearing.
