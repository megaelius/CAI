Over the past decade, our knowledge of the \gamma-ray sky has been revolutionized by ground- and
space-based observatories by detecting photons up to several hundreds of tera-electron volt (TeV)
energies. A major population of the $\gamma$-ray bright objects are active galactic nuclei (AGN)
with their relativistic jets pointed along our line-of-sight. Gamma-ray emission is also detected
from nearby mis-aligned AGN such as radio galaxies. While the TeV-detected radio galaxies (TeVRad)
only form a small fraction of the \gamma-ray detected AGN, their multi-wavelength study offers
a unique opportunity to probe and pinpoint the high-energy emission processes and sites. Even in
the absence of substantial Doppler beaming TeVRad are extremely bright objects in the TeV sky (luminosities
detected up to 10^{45} erg/s), and exhibit flux variations on timescales shorter than the event-horizon
scales (flux doubling timescale less than 5 minutes). Thanks to the recent advancement in the imaging
capabilities of high-resolution radio interferometry (millimeter very long baseline interferometry,
mm-VLBI), one can probe the scales down to less than 10 gravitational radii in TeVRad, making it possible
not only to test jet launching models but also to pinpoint the high-energy emission sites and to unravel
the emission mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the high-energy observations of TeVRad
with a focus on the emitting sites and radiation processes. Some recent approaches in simulations
are also sketched. Observations by the near-future facilities like Cherenkov Telescope Array,
short millimeter-VLBI, and high-energy polarimetry instruments will be crucial for discriminating
the competing high-energy emission models.
