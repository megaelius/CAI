Little is known about the origin of the high-energy and sustained emission from solar Long-Duration
Gamma-Ray Flares (LDGRFs), identified with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), the Solar
Maximum Mission (SMM), and now Fermi. Though Fermi/Large Area Space Telescope (LAT) has identified
dozens of flares with LDGRF signature, the nature of this phenomenon has been a challenge to explain
both due to the extreme energies and long durations. The highest-energy emission has generally
been attributed to pion production from the interaction of >300 MeV protons with the ambient matter.
The extended duration suggests that particle acceleration occurs over large volumes extending
high in the corona, either from stochastic acceleration within large coronal loops or from back
precipitation from coronal mass ejection driven shocks. It is possible to test these models by making
direct comparison between the properties of the accelerated ion population producing the gamma-ray
emission derived from the Fermi/LAT observations, and the characteristics of solar energetic
particles (SEPs) measured by the Payload for Matter-Antimatter Exploration and Light Nuclei Astrophysics
(PAMELA) spacecraft in the energy range corresponding to the pion-related emission detected with
Fermi. For fourteen of these events we compare the two populations -- SEPs in space and the interacting
particles at the Sun -- and discuss the implications in terms of potential sources. Our analysis
shows that the two proton numbers are poorly correlated, with their ratio spanning more than five
orders of magnitude, suggesting that the back precipitation of shock-acceleration particles
is unlikely the source of the LDGRF emission.
