We present cosmological parameter constraints from a joint analysis of three cosmological probes:
the tomographic cosmic shear signal in $\sim$450 deg$^2$ of data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS),
the galaxy-matter cross-correlation signal of galaxies from the Galaxies And Mass Assembly (GAMA)
survey determined with KiDS weak lensing, and the angular correlation function of the same GAMA
galaxies. We use fast power spectrum estimators that are based on simple integrals over the real-space
correlation functions, and show that they are practically unbiased over relevant angular frequency
ranges. We test our full pipeline on numerical simulations that are tailored to KiDS and retrieve
the input cosmology. By fitting different combinations of power spectra, we demonstrate that the
three probes are internally consistent. For all probes combined, we obtain $S_8\equiv \sigma_8
\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}=0.800_{-0.027}^{+0.029}$, consistent with Planck and the fiducial
KiDS-450 cosmic shear correlation function results. Marginalising over wide priors on the mean
of the tomographic redshift distributions yields consistent results for $S_8$ with an increase
of $28\%$ in the error. The combination of probes results in a $26\%$ reduction in uncertainties
of $S_8$ over using the cosmic shear power spectra alone. The main gain from these additional probes
comes through their constraining power on nuisance parameters, such as the galaxy intrinsic alignment
amplitude or potential shifts in the redshift distributions, which are up to a factor of two better
constrained compared to using cosmic shear alone, demonstrating the value of large-scale structure
probe combination.
