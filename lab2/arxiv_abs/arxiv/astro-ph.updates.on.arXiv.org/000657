Observed oscillations of coronal loops in EUV lines have been successfully used to estimate plasma
parameters in the inner corona (< 0.2 R_0, where R_0 is the solar radius). However, coronal seismology
in EUV lines fails for higher altitudes because of rapid decrease in line intensity. We aim to use
radio observations to estimate the plasma parameters of the outer solar corona (> 0.2 R_0). We
use the large Ukrainian radio telescope URAN-2 to observe type IV radio burst at the frequency range
of 8-32 MHz during the time interval of 09:50-12:30 UT in April 14, 2011. The burst was connected to
C2.3 flare, which occurred in AR 11190 during 09:38-09:49 UT. The dynamic spectrum of radio emission
shows clear quasi-periodic variations in the emission intensity at almost all frequencies. Wavelet
analysis at four different frequencies (29 MHz, 25 MHz, 22 MHz and 14 MHz) shows the quasi-periodic
variation of emission intensity with periods of 34 min and 23 min. The periodic variations can be
explained by the first and second harmonics of vertical kink oscillation of transequatorial coronal
loops, which were excited by the same flare. The apex of transequatorial loops may reach up to 1.2
R_0 altitude. We derive and solve the dispersion relation of trapped MHD oscillations in a longitudinally
inhomogeneous magnetic slab. The analysis shows that a thin (with width to length ratio of 0.1),
dense (with the ratio of internal and external densities of > 20) magnetic slab with weak longitudinal
inhomogeneity may trap the observed oscillations. Seismologically estimated Alfv\'en speed
inside the loop at the height of 1 R_0 is 1000 km/s. Then the magnetic field strength at this height
is estimated as 0.9 G. Extrapolation of magnetic field strength to the inner corona gives 10 G at the
height of 0.1 R_0.
