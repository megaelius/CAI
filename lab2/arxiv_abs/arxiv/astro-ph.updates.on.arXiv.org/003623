We study PTF11mnb, a He-poor supernova (SN) whose pre-peak light curves (LCs) resemble those of
SN 2005bf, a peculiar double-peaked stripped-envelope (SE) SN. LCs, colors and spectral properties
are compared to those of SN 2005bf and normal SE SNe. A bolometric LC is built and modeled with the SNEC
hydrodynamical code explosion of a MESA progenitor star, as well as with semi-analytic models.
The LC of PTF11mnb turns out to be similar to that of SN 2005bf until $\sim$50 d, when the main (secondary)
peaks occur at $-18.5$ mag. The early peak occurs at $\sim$20 d, and is about 1.0 mag fainter. After
the main peak, the decline rate of PTF11mnb is remarkably slower than that of SN 2005bf, and it traces
the $^{56}$Co decay rate. The spectra of PTF11mnb reveal no traces of He unlike in the case of SN Ib
2005bf. The bolometric LC is well reproduced by the explosion of a massive ($M_{ej} =$ 7.8 $M_{\odot}$),
He-poor star with a double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution, a total $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.59 $M_{\odot}$
and an explosion energy of 2.2$\times$10$^{51}$ erg. Alternatively, a normal SN Ib/c explosion
[M($^{56}$Ni)$=$0.11 $M_{\odot}$, $E_{K}$ = 0.2$\times$10$^{51}$ erg, $M_{ej} =$ 1 $M_{\odot}$]
can power the first peak while a magnetar ($B$=5.0$\times$10$^{14}$ G, $P=18.1$ ms) provides energy
for the main peak. The early $g$-band LC implies a radius of at least 30 $R_{\odot}$. If PTF11mnb arose
from a massive He-poor star characterized by a double-peaked $^{56}$Ni distribution, the ejecta
mass and the absence of He imply a large ZAMS mass ($\sim85 M_{\odot}$) for the progenitor, which
most likely was a Wolf-Rayet star, surrounded by an extended envelope formed either by a pre-SN eruption
or due to a binary configuration. Alternatively, PTF11mnb could be powered by a normal SE SN during
the first peak and by a magnetar afterwards.
