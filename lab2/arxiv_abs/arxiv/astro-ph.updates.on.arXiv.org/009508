We performed a theoretical investigation on the mixing-length parameter recovery from an eclipsing
double-lined binary system. We focused on a syntetic system composed by a primary of mass M = 0.95
Msun and a secondary of M = 0.85 Msun. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted at three metallicities,
and three evolutionary stages of the primary. For each configuration artificial data were sampled
assuming an increasing difference between the mixing-length of the two stars. The mixing length
values were reconstructed using three alternative set-ups. A first method, which assumes full
independence between the two stars, showed a great difficulty to constrain the mixing-length values:
the recovered values were nearly unconstrained with a standard deviation of 0.40. The second technique
imposes the constraint of common age and initial chemical composition for the two stars in the fit.
We found that $\alpha_{ml,1}$ values match the ones recovered under the previous configuration,
but $\alpha_{ml,2}$ values are peaked around unbiased estimates. This occurs because the primary
star provides a much more tight age constraint in the joint fit than the secondary. Within this second
scenario we also explored, for systems sharing a common $\alpha_{ml}$, the difference in the mixing-length
values of the two stars only due to random fluctuations owing to the observational errors. The posterior
distribution of these differences was peaked around zero, with a large standard deviation of 0.3
(15\% of the solar-scaled value). The third technique also imposes the constraint of a common mixing-length
value for the two stars, and served as a test for identification of wrong fitting assumptions. In
this case the common mixing-length is mainly dictated by the value of $\alpha_{ml,2}$. [...] For
$\Delta \alpha_{ml} > 0.4$ less than half of the systems can be recovered and only 20% at $\Delta \alpha_{ml}
= 1.0$.
