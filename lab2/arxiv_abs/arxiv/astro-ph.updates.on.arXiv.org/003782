We propose the study of constant-roll inflation in $F(R)$ gravity. We use two different approaches,
one that relates an $F(R)$ gravity to well known scalar models of constant-roll and a second that
examines directly the constant-roll condition in $F(R)$ gravity. With regards to the first approach,
by using well known techniques, we find the $F(R)$ gravity which realizes a given constant-roll
evolution in the scalar-tensor theory. We also perform a conformal transformation in the resulting
$F(R)$ gravity and we find the Einstein frame counterpart theory. As we demonstrate, the resulting
scalar potential is different in comparison to the original scalar constant-roll case, and the
same applies for the corresponding observational indices. Moreover, we discuss how cosmological
evolutions that can realize constant-roll to constant-roll eras transitions in the scalar-tensor
description, can be realized by vacuum $F(R)$ gravity. With regards to the second approach, we examine
directly the effects of the constant-roll condition on the inflationary dynamics of vacuum $F(R)$
gravity. We present in detail the formalism of constant-roll $F(R)$ gravity inflationary dynamics
and we discuss how the inflationary indices become in this case. We use two well known $F(R)$ gravities
in order to illustrate our findings, the $R^2$ model and a power-law $F(R)$ gravity in vacuum. As
we demonstrate, in both cases the parameter space is enlarged in comparison to the slow-roll counterparts
of the models, and in effect, the models can also be compatible with the observational data. Finally,
we briefly address the graceful exit issue.
