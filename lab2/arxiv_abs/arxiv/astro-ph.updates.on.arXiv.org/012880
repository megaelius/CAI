We present the results from the 1.2 mm continuum image obtained as part of the ALMA Spectroscopic
Survey in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ASPECS). The 1.2 mm continuum image has a size of 2.9 (4.2) arcmin$^2$
within a primary beam response of 50% (10%) and a rms value of $9.3\thinspace{\rm\mu Jy\thinspace
beam^{-1}}$. We detect 35 sources at high significance (Fidelity $\geq0.5$), 32 of these have well
characterized near-infrared HST counterparts. We estimate the 1.2 mm number counts to flux levels
of $<30\thinspace{\rm\mu Jy}$ in two different ways: we first use the detected sources to constrain
the number counts and find a significant flattening of the counts below $S_\nu \sim 0.1$ mJy. In a
second approach, we constrain the number counts by using a probability of deflection statistics
(P(D)) analysis. For this latter approach, we describe new methods to accurately measure the noise
in interferometric imaging (employing jack-knifing in the cube and in the visibility plane). This
independent measurement confirms the flattening of the number counts. Our analysis of the differential
number counts shows that we are detecting $\sim$93% ($\sim$100% if we include the lower fidelity
detections) of the total continuum dust emission associated to galaxies in the HUDF. The ancillary
data allows us to study the dependence of the 1.2 mm number counts on redshift ($z=0-4$), galaxy dust
mass (${\rm M}_{\rm dust}=10^{7}-10^{9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$), stellar mass (${\rm M}_{*}=10^{9}-10^{12}{\rm
M}_{\odot}$), and star-formation rate (${\rm SFR}=1-1000\thinspace{\rm M}_{\odot}\thinspace{\rm
yr^{-1}}$). In an accompanying paper we show that the number counts are crucial to constrain galaxy
evolution models and the understanding of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.
