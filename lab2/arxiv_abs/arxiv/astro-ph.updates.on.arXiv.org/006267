Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) accrete matter from the inner edge of their surrounding circumstellar
disks. The impact of the accretion material on the stellar atmosphere results in a strong shock,
which causes emission from the X-ray to the near-infrared (NIR) domain. Shock velocities of several
100 km s$^{-1}$ imply that the immediate post shock plasma emits mainly in X-rays. Indeed, two X-ray
diagnostics, the so-called soft excess and the high densities observed in He-like triplets, differentiate
CTTSs from their non-accreting siblings. However, accretion shock properties derived from X-ray
diagnostics often contradict established ultraviolet (UV)-NIR accretion tracers and a physical
model simultaneously explaining both, X-ray and UV-NIR accretion tracers, is not yet available.
We present new XMM-Newton and Chandra grating observations of the CTTS T Tauri combined with UV and
optical data. During all epochs, the soft excess is large and the densities derived from the O VII
and Ne IX He-like triplets are compatible with coronal densities. This confirms that the soft X-ray
emission cannot originate in accretion funnels that carry the bulk of the accretion rate despite
T Tauri's large soft excess. Instead, we propose a model of radially density stratified accretion
columns to explain the density diagnostics and the soft excess. In addition, accretion rate and
X-ray luminosity are inversely correlated in T Tauri over several epochs. Such an anti-correlation
has been observed in samples of stars. Hence the process causing it must be intrinsic to the accretion
process, and we speculate that the stellar magnetic field configuration on the visibile hemisphere
affects both the accretion rate and the coronal emission, eventually causing the observed anti-correlation.
