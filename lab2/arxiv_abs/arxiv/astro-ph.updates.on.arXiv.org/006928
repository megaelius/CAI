The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system represents an exceptional opportunity for the atmospheric characterization
of temperate terrestrial exoplanets with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Assessing
the potential impact of stellar contamination on the planets' transit transmission spectra is
an essential precursor step to this characterization. Planetary transits themselves can be used
to scan the stellar photosphere and to constrain its heterogeneity through transit depth variations
in time and wavelength. In this context, we present our analysis of 169 transits observed in the optical
from space with K2 and from the ground with the SPECULOOS and Liverpool telescopes. Combining our
measured transit depths with literature results gathered in the mid/near-IR with Spitzer/IRAC
and HST/WFC3, we construct the broadband transmission spectra of the TRAPPIST-1 planets over the
0.8-4.5 $\mu$m spectral range. While planets b, d, and f spectra show some structures at the 200-300ppm
level, the four others are globally flat. Even if we cannot discard their instrumental origins,
two scenarios seem to be favored by the data: a stellar photosphere dominated by a few high-latitude
giant (cold) spots, or, alternatively, by a few small and hot (3500-4000K) faculae. In both cases,
the stellar contamination of the transit transmission spectra is expected to be less dramatic than
predicted in recent papers. Nevertheless, based on our results, stellar contamination can still
be of comparable or greater order than planetary atmospheric signals at certain wavelengths. Understanding
and correcting the effects of stellar heterogeneity therefore appears essential to prepare the
exploration of TRAPPIST-1's with JWST.
