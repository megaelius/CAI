Context. Multi-wavelength observations are indispensable in studying disk geometry and dust
evolution processes in protoplanetary disks. Aims. We aimed to construct a 3-dimensional model
of HD 163296 capable of reproducing simultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered
light with the SPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk midplane
with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is intermediary between the otherwise well-separated
group I and group II Herbig stars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the ALMA observations,
while the polarized scattered light observations were used to constrain the inclination of the
inner disk component and turbulence and grain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings
are observed in the disk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only
the innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a lack of small dust
grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two models capable of explaining this difference.
The first model uses increased settling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains
on the surface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the first ring. The second
model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the outer disk as a mechanism for decreasing the
optical depth at optical and NIR wavelengths. In the region outside the fragmentation-dominated
regime, such depletion is expected from state-of-the-art dust evolution models. We studied the
effect of creating an artificial inner cavity in our models, and conclude that HD 163296 might be
a precursor to typical group I sources.
