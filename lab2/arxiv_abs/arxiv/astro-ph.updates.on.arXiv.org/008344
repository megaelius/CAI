The HArps-n red Dwarf Exoplanet Survey is providing a major contribution to the widening of the current
statistics of low-mass planets, through the in-depth analysis of precise radial velocity measurements
in a narrow range of spectral sub-types. As part of that programme, we obtained radial velocity measurements
of Gl 686, an M1 dwarf at d = 8.2 pc. The analysis of data obtained within an intensive observing campaign
demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to a coherent signal, with a period of 15.53 d. Almost
simultaneous photometric observations were carried out within the APACHE and EXORAP programmes
to characterize the stellar activity and to distinguish periodic variations related to activity
from signals due to the presence of planetary companions, complemented also with ASAS photometric
data. We took advantage of the available radial velocity measurements for this target from other
observing campaigns. The analysis of the radial velocity composite time series from the HIRES,
HARPS and HARPS-N spectrographs, consisting of 198 measurements taken over 20 years, enabled us
to address the nature of periodic signals and also to characterize stellar physical parameters
(mass, temperature, and rotation). We report the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting at a distance
of 0.092 AU from the host star Gl 686. Gl 686 b has a minimum mass of 7.1 +/- 0.9 MEarth and an orbital period
of 15.532 +/- 0.002 d. The analysis of the activity indexes, correlated noise through a Gaussian
process framework and photometry, provides an estimate of the stellar rotation period at 37 d, and
highlights the variability of the spot configuration during the long timespan covering 20 yrs.
The observed periodicities around 2000 d likely point to the existence of an activity cycle.
