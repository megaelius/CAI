We present the design and characterization of a ground-based absolute polarization angle calibrator
accurate to better than 0.1 degrees for use with polarization sensitive cosmic microwave background
(CMB) experiments. The calibrator's accuracy requirement is driven by the need to reduce upper
limits on cosmic polarization rotation, which is expected to be zero in a large class of cosmological
models. Cosmic polarization effects such as cosmic birefringence and primordial magnetic fields
can generate spurious B-modes that result in non-zero CMB TB and EB correlations that are degenerate
with a misalignment of detector orientation. Common polarized astrophysical sources used for
absolute polarization angle calibration have not been characterized to better than 0.5 degrees.
Higher accuracy can be achieved through self-calibration methods, however these are subject to
astrophysical foreground contamination and inherently assume the absence of effects like cosmic
polarization rotation. The deficiencies in these two calibration methods highlight the need for
a well characterized polarized source. The calibrator we present utilizes a 76 GHz Gunn oscillator
coupled to a frequency doubler, pyramidal horn antenna, and co-rotating wire-grid polarizer.
We use an accurate bubble level in combination with four precision-grade aluminum planes located
within the enclosure to calibrate the source's linear polarization plane with respect to the local
gravity vector to better than the 0.1 degree goal. In 2017 the calibrator was deployed for an engineering
test run on the POLARBEAR CMB experiment located in Chile's Atacama Desert and is being upgraded
for calibration of the POLARBEAR-2b receiver in 2018. In the following work we present a detailed
overview of the calibrator design, systematic control, characterization, deployment, and plans
for future CMB experiment absolute polarization calibration.
