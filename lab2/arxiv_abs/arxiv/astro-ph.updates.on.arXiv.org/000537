According to earlier Doppler images of the magnetically active primary giant component of the RS
CVn binary II Peg, the surface of the star was dominated by one single active longitude that was clearly
drifting in the rotational frame of the binary system during 1994-2002; later imaging for 2004-2010,
however, showed decreased and chaotic spot activity, with no signs of the drift pattern. Here we
set out to investigate from a more extensive photometric dataset whether such a drift is a persistent
phenomenon, in which case it could be due to either an azimuthal dynamo wave or an indication of the
binary system orbital synchronization still being incomplete. We analyse the datasets using the
Carrier Fit method (hereafter CF), especially suitable for analyzing time series in which a fast
clocking frequency (such as the rotation of the star) is modulated with a slower process (such as
the stellar activity cycle). We combine all collected photometric data into one single data set,
and analyze it with the CF method. As a result, we confirm the earlier results of the spot activity
having been dominated by one primary spotted region almost through the entire data set, and the existence
of a persistent, nearly linear drift. Disruptions of the linear trend and complicated phase behavior
are also seen, but the period analysis reveals a rather stable periodicity with P(spot)=6.71054d
plus/minus 0.00005d. After the linear trend is removed from the data, we identify several abrupt
phase jumps, three of which are analyzed in more detail with the CF method. These phase jumps closely
resemble what is called flip-flop event, but the new spot configurations do not, in most cases, persist
for longer than a few months.
