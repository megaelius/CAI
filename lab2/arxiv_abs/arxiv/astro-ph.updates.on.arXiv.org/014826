The class of Double-Double Radio Galaxies (DDRGs) relates to episodic jet outbursts. How various
regions and components add to the total intensity in radio images is less well known. In this paper
we synthesize synchrotron images for DDRGs based on special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations,
making advanced approximations for the magnetic fields. We study the synchrotron images for: Three
different radial jet profiles; Ordered, entangled or mixed magnetic fields; Spectral ageing from
synchrotron cooling; The contribution from different jet components; The viewing angle and Doppler
(de-)boosting; The various epochs of the evolution of the DDRG. To link our results to observational
data, we adopt to J1835+6204 as a reference source. In all cases the synthesized synchrotron images
show two clear pairs of hotspots, in the inner and outer lobes. The best resemblance is obtained for
the piecewise isochoric jet model, for a viewing angle of approximately $\vartheta \sim -71^{\circ}$,
i.e. inclined with the lower jet towards the observer, with predominantly entangled ($\gtrsim
70$ per cent of the magnetic pressure) in turbulent, rather than ordered fields. The effects of spectral
ageing become significant when the ratio of observation frequencies and cut-off frequency $\nu_{\rm
obs}/\nu_{\infty,0} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$, corresponding to $\sim 3 \cdot 10^2$ MHz. For viewing angles
$\vartheta \lesssim -30^{\circ}$, a DDRG morphology can no longer be recognized. The second jets
must be injected within $\lesssim$ 4 per cent of the lifetime of the first jets for a DDRG structure
to emerge, which is relevant for Active Galactic Nuclei feedback constraints.
