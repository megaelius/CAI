Unlike previously explored relationships between the properties of hot Jovian atmospheres, the
geometric albedo and the incident stellar flux do not exhibit a clear correlation, as revealed by
our re-analysis of Q0 to Q14 Kepler data. If the albedo is primarily associated with the presence
of clouds in these irradiated atmospheres, a holistic modeling approach needs to relate the following
properties: the strength of stellar irradiation (and hence the strength and depth of atmospheric
circulation), the geometric albedo (which controls both the fraction of starlight absorbed and
the pressure level at which it is predominantly absorbed) and the properties of the embedded cloud
particles (which determine the albedo). The anticipated diversity in cloud properties renders
any correlation between the geometric albedo and the stellar flux to be weak and characterized by
considerable scatter. In the limit of vertically uniform populations of scatterers and absorbers,
we use an analytical model and scaling relations to relate the temperature-pressure profile of
an irradiated atmosphere and the photon deposition layer and to estimate if a cloud particle will
be lofted by atmospheric circulation. We derive an analytical formula for computing the albedo
spectrum in terms of the cloud properties, which we compare to the measured albedo spectrum of HD
189733b by Evans et al. (2013). Furthermore, we show that whether an optical phase curve is flat or
sinusoidal depends on whether the particles are small or large as defined by the Knudsen number.
This may be an explanation for why Kepler-7b exhibits evidence for the longitudinal variation in
abundance of condensates, while Kepler-12b shows no evidence for the presence of condensates,
despite the incident stellar flux being similar for both exoplanets.
