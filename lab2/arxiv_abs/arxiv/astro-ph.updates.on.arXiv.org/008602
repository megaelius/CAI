Evolutionary properties of infrared (IR) luminous galaxies are important keys to understand dust-obscured
star formation history and galaxy evolution. Based on the near- to mid-IR imaging with 9 continuous
filters of AKARI space telescope, we present the characteristics of dusty star-forming (SF) galalxies
showing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features observed by the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP)
wide field survey of AKARI and Herschel. All the sample galaxies from the AKARI/NEP-Wide data are
selected based both on the Herschel/SPIRE 250 {\mu}m detection and optical spectroscopic redshift
data. The physical modelling of spectral energy distribution (SED) using all available data points
from u to sub-mm 500 {\mu}m band, including WISE and PACS data where available, takes unique advantages
of the continuous near to mid-IR coverage, reliable constraint on far-IR peak, spectroscopically
determined accurate redshifts, as well as energy balance principle by MAGPHYS. This enables us
to derive physically meaningful and accurate total infrared luminosity and 8 {\mu}m (or PAH) luminosity
consistently. Our sample galaxies are in the redshift range z <1, and majority of them appear to be
normal SF/spiral populations showing PAH features near the 8 {\mu}m. These SF galaxies showing
PAHs in the mid-IR include various types from quiescent to starbursts. Some of our sample show shortage
of 8 {\mu}m luminosity compared to the total IR luminosity and this PAH deficit gets severe in more
luminous IR galaxies, suggesting PAH molecules in these galaxies destroyed by strong radiation
field from SF region or a large amount of cold dust in ISM. The specific SFR of our sample shows mass
dependent time evolution which is consistent with downsizing evolutionary pattern.
