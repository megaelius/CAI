NGC6357 is an active star forming region with very young massive open clusters (OC). These clusters
contain some of the most massive stars in the Galaxy and strongly interact with nearby giant molecular
clouds (GMC). We study the young stellar populations of the region and of the OC Pismis24, focusing
on their relationship with the nearby GMCs. We seek evidence of triggered star formation propagating
from the clusters. We used new deep JHKs photometry, along with unpublished deep IRAC/Spitzer MIR
photometry, complemented with optical HST/WFPC2 high spatial resolution photometry and X-ray
Chandra observations, to constrain age, initial mass function, and star formation modes in progress.
We carefully examine and discuss all sources of bias (saturation, confusion, different sensitivities,
extinction). NGC6357 hosts three large young stellar clusters, of which Pismis24 is the most prominent.
We found that Pismis24 is a very young (~1-3 Myr) OC with a Salpeter-like IMF and a few thousand members.
A comparison between optical and IR photometry indicates that the fraction of members with a NIR
excess (i. e., with a circumstellar disk) is in the range 0.3-0.6, consistent with its photometrically
derived age. We also find that Pismis24 is likely subdivided into a few different sub-clusters,
one of which contains almost all the massive members. There are indications of current star formation
triggered by these massive stars, but clear age trends could not be derived (although the fraction
of stars with a NIR excess does increase towards the HII region associated with the cluster). The
gas out of which Pismis24 formed must have been distributed in dense clumps within a cloud of less
dense gas ~1 pc in radius. Our findings provide some new insight into how young stellar populations
and massive stars emerge, and evolve in the first few Myr after birth, from a giant molecular cloud
complex.
