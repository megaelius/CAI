Direct imaging and spectral characterization of exoplanets using extreme adaptive optics (ExAO)
is a key science goal of future extremely large telescopes and space observatories. However, quasi-static
wavefront errors will limit the sensitivity of this endeavor. Additional limitations for ground-based
telescopes arise from residual AO-corrected atmospheric wavefront errors, generating millisecond-lifetime
speckles that average into a halo over a long exposure. A solution to both of these problems is to use
the science camera of an ExAO system as a wavefront sensor to perform a fast measurement and correction
method to minimize these aberrations as soon as they are detected. We develop the framework for one
such method based on the self-coherent camera (SCC) to be applied to ground-based telescopes, called
Fast Atmospheric SCC Technique (FAST). We show that with the use of a specially designed coronagraph
and coherent differential imaging algorithm, recording images every few milliseconds allows
for a subtraction of atmospheric and static speckles while maintaining a close to unity algorithmic
exoplanet throughput. Detailed simulations reach a contrast close to the photon noise limit after
30 seconds for a 1 % bandpass in H band on both 0$^\text{th}$ and 5$^\text{th}$ magnitude stars. For
the 5th magnitude case, this is about 110 times better in raw contrast than what is currently achieved
from ExAO instruments if we extrapolate for an hour of observing time, illustrating that sensitivity
improvement from this method could play an essential role in the future detection and characterization
of lower mass exoplanets.
