It is known that the observed distribution of frequencies in CoRoT and Kepler {\delta} Scuti stars
has no parallelism with any theoretical model. Pre-whitening is a widespread technique in the analysis
of time series with gaps from pulsating stars located in the classical instability strip such as
{\delta} Scuti stars. However, some studies have pointed out that this technique might introduce
biases in the results of the frequency analysis. This work aims at studying the biases that can result
from pre-whitening in asteroseismology. The results will depend on the intrinsic range and distribution
of frequencies of the stars. The periodic nature of the gaps in CoRoT observations, just in the range
of the pulsational frequency content of the {\delta} Scuti stars, is shown to be crucial to determine
their oscillation frequencies, the first step to perform asteroseismolgy of these objects. Hence,
here we focus on the impact of pre-whitening on the asteroseismic characterization of {\delta}
Scuti stars. We select a sample of 15 {\delta} Scuti stars observed by the CoRoT satellite, for which
ultra-high quality photometric data have been obtained by its seismic channel. In order to study
the impact on the asteroseismic characterization of {\delta} Scuti stars we perform the pre-whitening
procedure on three datasets: gapped data, linearly interpolated data, and ARMA interpolated data.
The different results obtained show that at least in some cases pre-whitening is not an efficient
procedure for the deconvolution of the spectral window. therefore, in order to reduce the effect
of the spectral window to the minimum it is necessary to interpolate with an algorithm that is aimed
to preserve the original frequency content, and not only to perform a pre-whitening of the data.
