We have conducted B, g, V, and R-band imaging in a 45x40 arcmin^2 field containing part of the high
Galactic latitude translucent cloud MBM32, and correlated the intensity of diffuse optical light
S_\nu(\lambda) with that of 100 micron emission S_\nu(100um). A chi^2 minimum analysis is applied
to fit a linear function to the measured correlation and derive the slope parameter b(\lambda)=
\Delta S_\nu(\lambda) / \Delta S_\nu(100um) of the best-fit linear function. Compiling a sample
by combining our b(\lambda) and published ones, we show that the b(\lambda) strength varies from
cloud to cloud by a factor of 4. Finding that b(\lambda) decreases as S_\nu(100um) increases in the
sample, we suggest that a non-linear correlation including a quadratic term of S_\nu(100um)^2
should be fitted to the measured correlation. The variation of optical depth, which is A_V = 0.16
- 2.0 in the sample, can change b(\lambda) by a factor of 2 - 3. There would be some contribution to the
large b(\lambda) variation from the forward-scattering characteristic of dust grains which is
coupled to the non-isotropic interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Models of the scattering of
diffuse Galactic light (DGL) underestimate the b(\lambda) values by a factor of 2. This could be
reconciled by deficiency in UV photons in the ISRF or by a moderate increase in dust albedo. Our b(\lambda)
spectrum favors a contribution from extended red emission (ERE) to the diffuse optical light; b(\lambda)
rises from B to V faster than the models, seems to peak around 6000 \AA, and decreases towards long
wavelengths. Such a characteristic is expected from the models in which the DGL is combined with
ERE.
