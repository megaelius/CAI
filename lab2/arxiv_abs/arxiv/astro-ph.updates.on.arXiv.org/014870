In this paper, we study the inertial and gravity wave transmissions near the radiative-convective
boundaries in the {\it f}-plane. Two configurations have been considered: waves propagate from
the convective layer to the radiative stratified stable layer, or the other way around. It has been
found that waves prefer to survive at low latitudes in a slowly rotating fluid (the stable layer is
strongly stratified). When the rotation is rapid (the stable layer is weakly stratified), however,
waves can survive in the full sphere if the meridional wavenumber is large. Then we have discussed
the transmission ratios for two different stratified structures: the constant stratification,
and the continuously varying stratification. For the constant stratification, we have found that
the transmission is efficient when the rotation is rapid, or when the wave is near the critical colatitude.
For the continuously varying stratification, we have discussed the transmission ratio when the
square of buoyancy frequency is a polynomial function $N^2\propto z^{\nu}$. For the linear stratification
($\nu=1$), we have found that the transmission is efficient when the rotation is rapid, or when the
wave is near the critical colatitude, or when the width of the linear stratification layer is far
greater than the horizontal wave length. For a convex stratification ($\nu>1$), the incident wave
is always transmitted. For a concave stratification ($0<\nu<1$), the incident wave is always reflected.
The transmission ratios does not depend on the configurations, but only on the characteristics
of the wave (frequency and wavenumber) and the fluid (degree of stratification).
