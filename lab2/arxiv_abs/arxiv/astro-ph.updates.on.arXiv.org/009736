We present results from the LymAn Continuum Escape Survey (LACES), a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
program designed to characterize the ionizing radiation emerging from a sample of Lyman alpha emitting
galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 3.1$. As many show intense [O III] emission characteristic of $z>6.5$
star-forming galaxies, they may represent valuable low redshift analogs of galaxies in the reionization
era. Using HST Wide Field Camera 3 / UVIS $F336W$ to image Lyman continuum emission, we investigate
the escape fraction of ionizing photons in this sample. For 61 sources, of which 77% are spectroscopically
confirmed and 53 have measures of [O III] emission, we detect Lyman continuum leakage in 20%, a rate
significantly higher than is seen in individual continuum-selected Lyman break galaxies. We estimate
there is a 98% probability that $\leq 2$ of our detections could be affected by foreground contamination.
Fitting multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to take account of the varying stellar
populations, dust extinctions and metallicities, we derive individual Lyman continuum escape
fractions corrected for foreground intergalactic absorption. We find escape fractions of 15 to
60% for individual objects, and infer an average 20% escape fraction by fitting composite SEDs for
our detected samples. Surprisingly however, even a deep stack of those sources with no individual
$F336W$ detections provides a stringent upper limit on the average escape fraction of less than
0.5%. We examine various correlations with source properties and discuss the implications in the
context of the popular picture that cosmic reionization is driven by such compact, low metallicity
star-forming galaxies.
