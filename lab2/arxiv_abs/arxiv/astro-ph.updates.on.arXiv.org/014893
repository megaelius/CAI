WR 112 is a dust-forming carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) binary with a dusty circumstellar nebula that
exhibits a complex asymmetric morphology, which traces the orbital motion and dust formation in
the colliding winds of the central binary. Unraveling the complicated circumstellar dust emission
around WR 112 therefore provides an opportunity to understand the dust formation process in colliding-wind
WC binaries. In this work, we present a multi-epoch analysis of the circumstellar dust around WR
112 using seven high spatial resolution (FWHM $\sim0.3-0.4''$) N-band ($\lambda \sim12$ $\mu$m)
imaging observations spanning almost 20 years and includes newly obtained images from Subaru/COMICS
in Oct 2019. In contrast to previous interpretations of a face-on spiral morphology, we observe
clear evidence of proper motion of the circumstellar dust around WR 112 consistent with a nearly
edge-on spiral with a $\theta_s=55^\circ$ half-opening angle and a $\sim20$-yr period. The revised
near edge-on geometry of WR 112 reconciles previous observations of highly variable non-thermal
radio emission that was inconsistent with a face-on geometry. We estimate a revised distance to
WR 112 of $d = 3.39^{+0.89}_{-0.84}$ kpc based on the observed dust expansion rate and a spectroscopically
derived WC terminal wind velocity of $v_\infty= 1230\pm260$ km s$^{-1}$. With the newly derived
WR 112 parameters we fit optically-thin dust spectral energy distribution models and determine
a dust production rate of $\dot{M}_d=2.7^{+1.0}_{-1.3}\times10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,
which demonstrates that WR 112 is one of the most prolific dust-making WC systems known.
