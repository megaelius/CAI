In this paper we demonstrate that the information encoded in \emph{one} single (sufficiently large)
$N$-body simulation can be used to reproduce arbitrary numbers of halo catalogues, using approximated
realisations of dark matter density fields with different initial conditions. To this end we use
as a reference one realisation (from an ensemble of $300$) of the Minerva $N$-body simulations and
the recently published Bias Assignment Method to extract the local and non-local bias linking the
halo to the dark matter distribution. We use an approximate (and fast) gravity solver to generate
$300$ dark matter density fields from the down-sampled initial conditions of the reference simulation
and sample each of these fields using the halo-bias and a kernel, both calibrated from the arbitrarily
chosen realisation of the reference simulation. We show that the power spectrum, its variance and
the three-point statistics are reproduced within $\sim 2\%$ (up to $k\sim1.0\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$),
$\sim 5-10\%$ and $\sim 10\%$, respectively. Using a model for the real space power spectrum (with
three free bias parameters), we show that the covariance matrices obtained from our procedure lead
to parameter uncertainties that are compatible within $\sim 10\%$ with respect to those derived
from the reference covariance matrix, and motivate approaches that can help to reduce these differences
to $\sim 1\%$. Our method has the potential to learn from one simulation with moderate volumes and
high-mass resolution and extrapolate the information of the bias and the kernel to larger volumes,
making it ideal for the construction of mock catalogues for present and forthcoming observational
campaigns such as Euclid or DESI.
