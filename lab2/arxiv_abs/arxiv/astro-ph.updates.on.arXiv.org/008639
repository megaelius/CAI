It is well established that the properties of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are
correlated through scaling relations. While hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have begun
to account for the co-evolution of BHs and galaxies, they typically have neglected the BH spin, even
though it may play an important role in modulating the growth and feedback of BHs. Here we introduce
a new sub-grid model for the BH spin evolution in the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} in order to improve
the physical faithfulness of the BH modelling in galaxy formation simulations. We account for several
different channels of spin evolution, in particular gas accretion through a Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-disc,
chaotic accretion, and BH mergers. For BH feedback, we extend the IllustrisTNG model, which considers
two different BH feedback modes, a thermal quasar mode for high accretion states and a kinetic mode
for low Eddington ratios, with a self-consistent accounting of spin-dependent radiative efficiencies
and thus feedback strength. We find that BHs with mass $M_{\rm{bh}}\lesssim 10^{8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$
reach high spin values as they typically evolve in the coherent gas accretion regime. On the other
hand, BHs with mass $M_{\rm{bh}}\gtrsim 10^{8}\, {\rm M}_\odot$ have lower spins as BH mergers
become more frequent, and their accretion discs fragment due to self-gravity, inducing chaotic
accretion. We also explore the hypothesis that the transition between the quasar and kinetic feedback
modes is mediated by the accretion mode of the BH disc itself, i.e.~the kinetic feedback mode is activated
when the disc enters the self-gravity regime. We find excellent agreement between the galaxy and
BH populations for this approach and the fiducial TNG model with no spin evolution. Furthermore,
our new approach alleviates a tension in the galaxy morphology -- colour relation of the original
TNG model.
