Planck data have been used to provide stringent new constraints on cosmic strings and other defects.
We describe forecasts of the CMB power spectrum induced by cosmic strings, calculating these from
network models and simulations using line-of-sight Boltzmann solvers. We have studied Nambu-Goto
cosmic strings, as well as field theory strings for which radiative effects are important, thus
spanning the range of theoretical uncertainty in strings models. We have added the angular power
spectrum from strings to that for a simple adiabatic model, with the extra fraction defined as $f_{10}$
at multipole $\ell=10$. This parameter has been added to the standard six parameter fit using COSMOMC
with flat priors. For the Nambu-Goto string model, we have obtained a constraint on the string tension
of $G\mu/c^2 < 1.5 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.015$ at 95% confidence that can be improved to
$G\mu/c^2 < 1.3 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.010$ on inclusion of high-$\ell$ CMB data. For the
abelian-Higgs field theory model we find, $G\mu_{AH}/c^2 < 3.2 x 10^{-7}$ and $f_{10} < 0.028$.
The marginalized likelihoods for $f_{10}$ and in the $f_{10}$--$\Omega_b h^2$ plane are also presented.
We have also obtained constraints on $f_{10}$ for models with semi-local strings and global textures
for which $G\mu/c^2 < 1.1 x 10^{-6}$. We have made complementarity searches for the specific
non-Gaussian signatures of cosmic strings, calibrating with all-sky Planck resolution CMB maps
generated from networks of post-recombination strings. We have obtained upper limits on the string
tension at 95% confidence of $G\mu/c^2 < 8.8 x 10^{-7}$ using modal bispectrum estimation and
$G\mu/c^2 < 7.8 x 10^{-7}$ for real space searches with Minkowski functionals. These are conservative
upper bounds because only post-recombination string contributions have been included in the non-Gaussian
analysis.
