The study of machine learning (ML) techniques for the autonomous classification of astrophysical
sources is of great interest, and we explore its applications in the context of a multifrequency
data-frame. We test the use of supervised ML to classify blazars according to its synchrotron peak
energy, either lower or higher than 10$^{15}$Hz. We select a blazar sample with 4178 objects labelled
as 1279 high synchrotron peak sources (HSP: $ \nu$-peak > 10$^{15}$Hz) and 2899 low synchrotron
peak sources (LSP: $ \nu$-peak < 10$^{15}$Hz). A set of multifrequency input features were defined
to represent each source, that includes spectral slopes ($\alpha_{\nu_1, \nu_2}$) between the
radio, infra-red, optical, and X-ray bands, also considering IR colours. We describe the optimisation
of five ML algorithms: Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours
(KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and the Ludwig auto-ML framework, and report on accurate models
for blazar classification into LSP and HSP. In our particular case, the SVM algorithm had the best
performance, reaching 93% of balanced-accuracy. A joint-feature permutation test revealed that
the spectral slopes alpha-radio-IR and alpha-radio-optical are the most relevant for the ML modelling,
followed by the IR colours. This work shows that ML algorithms can distinguish multifrequency spectral
characteristics and handle the classification task of blazars into LSPs and HSPs, and is a hint for
the potential use of ML algorithms for the autonomous determination of broadband spectral parameters
(as the synchrotron $\nu$-peak), or even to search for new blazars in all-sky databases.
