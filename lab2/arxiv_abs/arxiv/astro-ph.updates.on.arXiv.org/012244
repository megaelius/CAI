Context. Elemental abundances are of prime importance to help us reconstruct the origin and evolution
of stars and galaxies in our Universe. Sulfur abundances have not been as heavily studied as other
elements, so some details regarding its behaviour are still unclear. Aims. We aim to investigate
[S/Fe] ratios in stars of the solar neighbourhood in order to analyse the chemical evolution of sulfur
and probe for possible differences in abundances of planet host and non-planet host stars. Methods.
We use the code MOOG to perform spectral synthesis and derive v*sin(i) values and [S/Fe] ratios for
719 FGK stars with high-resolution (R~115000) and high-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program.
We find the best fit and corresponding parameter values by performing chi-square minimisation
of the deviation between synthetic profiles and observational spectra. Results. Our results reveal
that sulfur behaves as a typical alpha-element, with low abundances in young thin disk stars and
high abundances in old thick disk stars, following what was expected from our understanding of the
Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). Nevertheless, further studies into the abundances of sulfur
in very metal-poor stars are required as our sample only derived sulfur abundances to stars with
metallicity as low as [Fe/H]=-1.13 dex. High-alpha metal rich stars are more enhanced in sulfur
compared to their thin disk counterparts at the same metallicity. We compare our results to GCE models
from other authors in the [S/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane. The [S/Fe]-age relationship is a good proxy for
time, just like it is the case with other alpha-elements. We report no differences in the abundances
of sulfur between stars with and without planetary companions in the metallicity range [Fe/H] >=
-0.3 dex.
