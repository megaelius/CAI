After the development of a BoGEMMS (Bologna Geant4 Multi-Mission Simulator) template for the back-
ground study of X-ray telescopes, a new extension is built for the simulation of a Gamma-ray space
mission (e.g. AGILE, Fermi), conceived to work as a common, multi-purpose framework for the present
and future electron tracking gamma-ray space telescopes. The Gamma-ray extension involves the
Geant4 mass model, the physics list and, more important, the production and treatment of the simulation
output. From the user point of view, the simulation set-up follows a tree structure, with the main
level being the selection of the simulation framework (the general, X-ray or gamma-ray application)
and the secondary levels being the detailed configuration of the geometry and the output format.
The BoGEMMS application to Gamma-ray missions has been used to evaluate the instrument performances
of a new generation of Gamma-ray tele- scopes (e.g. Gamma-Light), and a full simulation of the AGILE
mission is currently under construction, to scientifically validate and calibrate the simulator
with real in-space data sets. A complete description of the BoGEMMS Gamma-ray framework is presented
here, with an overview of the achieved results for the potential application to present and future
experiments (e.g., GAMMA-400 and Gamma-Light). The evaluation of the photon conversion efficiency
to beta particle pairs and the comparison to tabulated data allows the preliminary physical validation
of the overall architecture. The Gamma-ray module application for the study of the Gamma-Light
instrument performances is reported as reference test case.
