We present improved estimates of several global properties of the Milky Way, including its current
star formation rate (SFR), the stellar mass contained in its disk and bulge+bar components, as well
as its total stellar mass. We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using
a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that
any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide
variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates.
Ultimately, our analysis yields a SFR for the Galaxy of $\dot{\rm M}_\star=1.65\pm0.19$ ${\rm
M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the
latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, $R_0$, the exponential scale-length
of the disk, $L_d$, and the local surface density of stellar mass, $\Sigma_\star(R_0)$, we show
that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is ${\rm M}^{\rm B}_\star=0.91\pm0.07\times10^{10}$
${\rm M}_\odot$, the disk mass is ${\rm M}^{\rm D}_\star=5.17\pm1.11\times10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_\odot$,
and their combination yields a total stellar mass of ${\rm M}_\star=6.08\pm1.14\times10^{10}$
${\rm M}_\odot$. This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates,
normalized to common assumptions about the stellar initial mass function and Galactic disk properties,
presented herein. We additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratio for the Milky Way of $B/T=0.150^{+0.028}_{-0.019}$
and a specific star formation rate of $\dot{\rm M}_\star/{\rm M}_\star=2.71\pm0.59\times10^{-11}$
yr$^{-1}$. The HB meta-analysis method allows us to robustly combine measurements that may be prone
to varying systematic errors.
