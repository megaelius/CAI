Deuterium fractionation processes in the interstellar medium (ISM) have been shown to be highly
efficient in the family of nitrogen hydrides. To date, observations were limited to ammonia (NH$_2$D,
NHD$_2$, ND$_3$) and imidogen radical (ND) isotopologues. We want to explore the high frequency
windows offered by the \emph{Herschel Space Observatory} to search for deuterated forms of amidogen
radical NH$_2$ and to compare the observations against the predictions of our comprehensive gas-grain
chemical model. Making use of the new molecular spectroscopy data recently obtained at high frequencies
for NHD and ND$_2$, both isotopologues have been searched for in the spectral survey towards the
class 0 IRAS 16293-2422, a source in which NH$_3$, NH and their deuterated variants have been previously
detected. We used the observations carried out with HIFI (Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared)
in the framework of the key program "Chemical Herschel surveys of star forming regions" (CHESS).
We report the first detection of interstellar NHD and ND$_2$. Both species are observed in absorption
against the continuum of the protostar. From the analysis of their hyperfine structure, accurate
excitation temperature and column density values have been determined. The latter were combined
with the column density of the parent species NH$_2$ to derive the deuterium fractionation in amidogen.
The amidogen D/H ratio measured in the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422 is comparable to the one
derived for the related species imidogen and much higher than that observed for ammonia. Additional
observations of these species will give more insights into the mechanism of ammonia formation and
deuteration in the ISM. We finally indicate the current possibilities to further explore these
species at submillimeter wavelengths.
