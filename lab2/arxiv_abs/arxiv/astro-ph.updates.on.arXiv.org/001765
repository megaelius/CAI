We present nanoscale explosives as a novel type of dark matter detector and study the ignition properties.
When a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle WIMP from the Galactic Halo elastically scatters off
of a nucleus in the detector, the small amount of energy deposited can trigger an explosion. For specificity,
this paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as a nanothermite, consisting of a
metal and an oxide in close proximity. When the two components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic
reaction --- an explosion. As a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nm radius
embedded in an oxide. One cell contains more than a few million nanoparticles, and a large number
of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector mass. A WIMP interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles,
depositing enough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers. When one
nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout the cell. A number of possible thermite
materials are studied. Excellent background rejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale
granularity of the detector: whereas a WIMP will cause a single cell to explode, backgrounds will
instead set off multiple cells. If the detector operates at room temperature, we find that WIMPs
with masses above 100 GeV (or for some materials above 1 TeV) could be detected; they deposit enough
energy ($>$10 keV) to cause an explosion. When operating cryogenically at liquid nitrogen or
liquid helium temperatures, the nano explosive WIMP detector can detect energy deposits as low
as 0.5 keV, making the nano explosive detector more sensitive to very light $<$10 GeV WIMPs, better
than other dark matter detectors.
