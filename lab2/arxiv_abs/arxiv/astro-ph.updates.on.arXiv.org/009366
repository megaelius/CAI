The strong observed clustering of $z>3.5$ quasars indicates they are hosted by massive ($M_{\rm{halo}}\gtrsim10^{12}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$)
dark matter halos. Assuming quasars and galaxies trace the same large-scale structures, this should
also manifest as strong clustering of galaxies around quasars. Previous work on high-redshift
quasar environments, mostly focused at $z>5$, have failed to find convincing evidence for these
overdensities. Here we conduct a survey for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the environs of 17 quasars
at $z\sim4$ probing scales of $R\lesssim7\,h^{-1}\,{\rm{Mpc}}$. We measure an average LAE overdensity
around quasars of 1.4 for our full sample, which we quantify by fitting the quasar-LAE cross-correlation
function. We find consistency with a power-law shape with correlation length of $r^{QG}_{0}=2.78^{+1.16}_{-1.05}\,h^{-1}\,{\rm{cMpc}}$
for a fixed slope of $\gamma=1.8$. We also measure the LAE auto-correlation length and find $r^{GG}_{0}=9.12^{+1.32}_{-1.31}\,h^{-1}$\,cMpc
($\gamma=1.8$), which is $3.3$ times higher than the value measured in blank fields. Taken together
our results clearly indicate that LAEs are significantly clustered around $z\sim4$ quasars. We
compare the observed clustering with the expectation from a deterministic bias model, whereby
LAEs and quasars probe the same underlying dark matter overdensities, and find that our measurements
fall short of the predicted overdensities by a factor of 2.1. We discuss possible explanations for
this discrepancy including large-scale quenching or the presence of excess dust in galaxies near
quasars. Finally, the large cosmic variance from field-to-field observed in our sample (10/17
fields are actually underdense) cautions one from over-interpreting studies of $z\sim6$ quasar
environments based on a single or handful of quasar fields.
