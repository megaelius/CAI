In the asymptotic parameterisation of mode frequencies, the phase function $\epsilon(\nu)$ completely
specifies the detailed structure of the frequency eigenvalues. In practice, however, this function
of frequency is reduced to a single scalar $\epsilon$, defined, particularly by observers, as the
intercept of a least-squares fit to the frequencies against radial order, or via the central value
of this function. The procedure by which this is done is not unique. We derive a few simple expressions
relating various observational estimators of $\epsilon$ for radial modes to each other, and to
the underlying theoretical object. In particular we demonstrate that a ``reduced' functional
parameterisation is both insensitive to mis-estimations of $\Delta\nu$, and easy to evaluate
locally in terms of both observational and theoretical quantities. It has been shown previously
that such a local definition of $\epsilon$ can distinguish between stars on the ascending part of
the red giant branch and those in the red clump. We find that this sensitivity to evolutionary stage
arises from differences in the local frequency derivative of the underlying phase function, a consequence
of differences in internal structure. By constructing an HR-like diagram out of purely seismic
observables, we provide a unified view of the \textit{Kepler} asteroseismic sample, as well as
the initial results from \textit{TESS}. We investigate how various astrophysical quantities
and modelling parameters affect the morphology of isochrones on this seismic diagram. We also show
that $\epsilon$ can be used as an independent input when deriving stellar parameters from global
asteroseismic quantities.
