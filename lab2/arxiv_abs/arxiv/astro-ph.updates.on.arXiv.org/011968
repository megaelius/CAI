Neutrinos from a supernova (SN) might undergo fast flavor conversions near the collapsed stellar
core. We perform a detailed study of this intriguing possibility, analyzing time-dependent state-of-the-art
3D SN models of 9 and 20 Msun. Both models were computed with multi-D three-flavor neutrino transport
based on a two-moment solver, and both exhibit the presence of the lepton-number emission self-sustained
asymmetry (LESA). The transport solution does not provide the angular distributions of the neutrino
fluxes, which are crucial to track the fast flavor instability. To overcome this limitation, we
use a recently proposed approach based on the angular moments of the energy-integrated electron
lepton-number distribution. With this method we find the possibility of fast neutrino flavor instability
at radii <~20 km, which is well interior to the neutrinosphere. Our results confirm recent observations
in a 2D SN model and in 2D/3D models with fixed matter background, which were computed with Boltzmann
neutrino transport. However, the flavor unstable locations are not isolated points as discussed
previously, but thin skins surrounding volumes where electron antineutrinos are more abundant
than electron neutrinos. These volumes grow with time and appear first in the convective layer of
the proto-neutron star (PNS), where a decreasing electron fraction (Ye) and high temperatures
favor the occurrence of regions with negative neutrino chemical potential. Since Ye remains higher
in the LESA dipole direction, where convective lepton-number transport out from the nonconvective
PNS core slows down the deleptonization, flavor unstable conditions become more widespread in
the opposite hemisphere. This interesting phenomenon deserves further investigation, since
its impact on SN modeling and possible consequences for SN dynamics and neutrino observations are
presently unclear. (abridged)
