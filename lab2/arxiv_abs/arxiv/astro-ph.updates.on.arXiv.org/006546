Long gamma ray bursts give us the chance to study both their extreme physics and the star-forming
galaxies in which they form. GRB 100418A, at a z = 0.6239, had a bright optical and radio afterglow,
and a luminous star-forming host galaxy. This allowed us to study the radiation of the explosion
as well as the interstellar medium of the host both in absorption and emission. We collected photometric
data from radio to X-ray wavelengths to study the evolution of the afterglow and the contribution
of a possible supernova and three X-shooter spectra obtained during the first 60 hr. The light curve
shows a very fast optical rebrightening, with an amplitude of 3 magnitudes, starting 2.4 hr after
the GRB onset. This cannot be explained by a standard external shock model and requires other contributions,
such as late central-engine activity. Two weeks after the burst we detect an excess in the light curve
consistent with a SN with peak absolute magnitude M_V = -18.5 mag, among the faintest GRB-SNe detected
to date. The host galaxy shows two components in emission, with velocities differing by 130 km s^-1,
but otherwise having similar properties. While some absorption and emission components coincide,
the absorbing gas spans much higher velocities, indicating the presence of gas beyond the star-forming
regions. The host has a star-formation rate of 12.2 M_sol yr^-1, a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.55
and a mass of 1.6x10^9 M_sol. GRB 100418A is a member of a class of afterglow light curves which show
a steep rebrightening in the optical during the first day, which cannot be explained by traditional
models. Its very faint associated SN shows that GRB-SNe can have a larger dispersion in luminosities
than previously seen. Furthermore, we have obtained a complete view of the host of GRB 100418A owing
to its spectrum, which contains a remarkable number of both emission and absorption lines.
