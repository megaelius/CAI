We present an algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to subtract galaxies from imaging
data, and also two algorithms to find strong, galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in the resulting
residual image. The combined method is optimized to find full or partial Einstein rings. Starting
from a pre-selection of potential massive galaxies, we first perform a PCA to build a set of basis
vectors. The galaxy images are reconstructed using the PCA basis and subtracted from the data. We
then filter the residual image with two different methods. The first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets)
filter of the residual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. The resulting image is transformed
in polar coordinates, centered on the lens galaxy center. In these coordinates, a ring is turned
into a line, allowing us to detect very faint rings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise
in the ring (a line in polar coordinates). The second way of analysing the PCA-subtracted images
identifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they are lensed images according
to their orientation, multiplicity and elongation. We apply the two methods to a sample of simulated
Einstein rings, as they would be observed with the ESA Euclid satellite in the VIS band. The polar
coordinates transform allows us to reach a completeness of 90% and a purity of 86%, as soon as the signal-to-noise
integrated in the ring is higher than 30, and almost independent of the size of the Einstein ring.
Finally, we show with real data that our PCA-based galaxy subtraction scheme performs better than
traditional subtraction based on model fitting to the data. Our algorithm can be developed and improved
further using machine learning and dictionary learning methods, which would extend the capabilities
of the method to more complex and diverse galaxy shapes.
