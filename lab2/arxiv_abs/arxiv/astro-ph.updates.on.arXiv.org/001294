Aims. We present a study of the very high energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission of the blazar
PKS 1424+240 observed with the MAGIC telescopes. The primary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength
spectral characterization and modeling of this blazar, made particularly interesting by the recent
discovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z>0.6, which makes it a promising candidate to be
the most distant VHE source. Methods. The source has been observed with the MAGIC telescopes in VHE
gamma rays for a total observation time of 33.6 h from 2009 to 2011. Results. The source was marginally
detected in VHE gamma rays during 2009 and 2010 and later the detection was confirmed during an optical
outburst in 2011. The combined significance of the stacked sample is 7.2 sigma. The differential
spectra measured during the different campaigns can be described by steep power laws, with the indices
ranging from 3.5+/-1.2 to 5.0+/-1.7. The MAGIC spectra corrected for the absorption due to the extragalactic
background light connect rather smoothly, within systematic errors, with the mean spectrum in
2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the Fermi-LAT. A recent study including the combined VERITAS
and Fermi-LAT contemporaneous observations from 2009 provided different results. In addition
the absorption-corrected MAGIC spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to 400 GeV. The multiwavelength
light curve shows increasing flux in radio and optical bands that could point to a common origin from
the same region of the jet. Also the large separation between the two peaks of the constructed non-simultaneous
spectral energy distribution requires an extremely high Doppler factor if a one zone synchrotron
self-Compton model is applied. We find that a two-component synchrotron self-Compton model describes
the spectral energy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.
