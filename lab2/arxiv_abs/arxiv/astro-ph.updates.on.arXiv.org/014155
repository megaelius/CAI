Dust grains moving at hypersonic velocities of $v_{d}\gtrsim 100\rm km~s^{-1}$ through an ambient
gas are known to be destroyed by nonthermal sputtering. Yet, previous studies of nonthermal sputtering
disregarded the fact that dust grains can be spun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic mechanical
torques from gas-grain collisions. In this paper, we show that such grain suprathermal rotation
can disrupt a small grain into small fragments because induced centrifugal stress exceeds the maximum
tensile strength of grain material, $S_{\rm max}$. We term this mechanism {\it MEchanical Torque
Disruption} (METD). We find that METD is more efficient than nonthermal sputtering in destroying
smallest grains ($a<10$ nm) of nonideal structures moving with velocities of $v_{d}<500 \rm km~s^{-1}$.
The ratio of rotational disruption to sputtering time is $\tau_{\rm disr}/\tau_{\rm sp}\sim 0.7(S_{\rm
max}/10^{9}\rm erg~cm^{-3})(\bar{A}_{\rm sp}/12)(Y_{\rm sp}/0.1)(a/0.01\mu m)^{3}(300\rm
km~s^{-1}/v_{d})^{2}$ where $a$ is the radius of spherical grains, and $Y_{\rm sp}$ is sputtering
yield. We also consider the high-energy regime and find that the rate of METD is reduced and becomes
less efficient than sputtering for $v_{d}>500\rm km~s^{-1}$ because impinging particles only
transfer part of their momentum to the grain. We finally discuss implications of the METD mechanism
for the destruction of hypersonic grains accelerated by radiation pressure as well as grains in
fast shocks. Our results suggest that the destruction of small grains by METD in fast shocks of supernova
remnants may be more efficient than previously predicted by nonthermal sputtering, depending
on grain internal structures.
