Here we focus on the dynamical aspect and given that most of the stars in the Milky Way have been born
in stellar associations or clusters that have lived a few Myr up to several Gyr, we focus on the evolution
of star clusters. We have carried out our simulations in two steps: 1) we have created a Galactic disc
dynamically as close to observations as possible and 2) we have evolved three sets of stellar clusters
with masses of 400, 1000 and 15000 Msun to dissolution. The birth location of these sets was 4, 6, 8
and 10 kpc for the 400 and 1000 Msun clusters and 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 kpc for the 15000 Msun. We have focussed
our efforts on studying the state of these escapers after 4.5 Gyr of evolution in the Solar annulus,
i.e. 7.5 < Rgc < 8.5 kpc. We have also analysed the possibility of a given star escaping from
our clusters with a mass close to the mass of the Sun to end in the Solar orbit. We found by using dynamical
arguments that for our 400 Msun clusters there is a 49 per cent higher chance of the Sun being born from
a cluster at 8 kpc than at 6 kpc while only a 38 per cent higher chance to come from a cluster born at 10
kpc. For our 1000 Msun clusters it becomes a 50 per cent higher chance of the Sun being born from a cluster
at 8 kpc than at 6 kpc while only a 25 per cent higher chance to come from a cluster born at 10 kpc. Finally
for our 15000 Msun clusters there is a 70 per cent higher chance of the Sun coming from a cluster born
at 8 kpc than at either 6 or 10 kpc while this reduces to 59 per cent relative to clusters born at 12 kpc.
We have concluded our analysis by calculating magnitudes and colours of our single stars in order
to make predictions about the samples that the Gaia, Gaia-ESO and GALAH-AAO surveys will obtain.
