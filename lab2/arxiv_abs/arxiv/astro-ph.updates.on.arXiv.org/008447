The abundance and demographics of dark matter substructure is important for many areas in astrophysics
and cosmological $N$-body simulations have been the primary tool used to investigate them. However,
it has recently become clear that the simulations are subject to numerical artefacts, which hampers
a proper treatment of the tidal evolution of subhaloes. Unfortunately, no analytical models that
accurately describe subhalo evolution exist either. We therefore present a library of idealized,
high resolution $N$-body simulations of the tidal evolution of individual subhaloes that can be
used to calibrate semi-analytical models and to complement cosmological simulations. The simulations
focus on minor mergers, i.e., the mass of the subhalo is much smaller than that of the host halo, such
that the impact of dynamical friction is negligible. This setup allows the adoption of a fixed analytical
potential for modelling the host halo. The dynamical evolution of subhaloes is followed with $N$-body
computations. In the library, four parameters, two of which characterize the subhalo orbit with
respect to the host halo, and the two concentrations of the host- and subhalo, are varied over the
ranges encountered in cosmological simulations. We show several representative examples from
the library that illustrate the evolution of the subhalo mass and velocity dispersion profiles.
Additionally, we make publicly available a pre-trained non-parametric model of the subhalo mass
evolution based on random forest regression. This model is able to interpolate the simulation data
at the 0.1\,dex level and provides efficient access to the data for further use in modelling.
