J-PLUS is an ongoing 12-band photometric optical survey, observing thousands of square degrees
of the Northern hemisphere from the dedicated JAST/T80 telescope at the Observatorio Astrof\'isico
de Javalambre. T80Cam is a 2 sq.deg field-of-view camera mounted on this 83cm-diameter telescope,
and is equipped with a unique system of filters spanning the entire optical range. This filter system
is a combination of broad, medium and narrow-band filters, optimally designed to extract the rest-frame
spectral features (the 3700-4000\AA\ Balmer break region, H$\delta$, Ca H+K, the G-band, the Mgb
and Ca triplets) that are key to both characterize stellar types and to deliver a low-resolution
photo-spectrum for each pixel of the sky observed. With a typical depth of AB $\sim 21.25$ mag per
band, this filter set thus allows for an indiscriminate and accurate characterization of the stellar
population in our Galaxy, it provides an unprecedented 2D photo-spectral information for all resolved
galaxies in the local universe, as well as accurate photo-z estimates ($\Delta\,z\sim 0.01-0.03$)
for moderately bright (up to $r\sim 20$ mag) extragalactic sources. While some narrow band filters
are designed for the study of particular emission features ([OII]/$\lambda$3727, H$\alpha$/$\lambda$6563)
up to $z < 0.015$, they also provide well-defined windows for the analysis of other emission lines
at higher redshifts. As a result, J-PLUS has the potential to contribute to a wide range of fields
in Astrophysics, both in the nearby universe (Milky Way, 2D IFU-like studies, stellar populations
of nearby and moderate redshift galaxies, clusters of galaxies) and at high redshifts (ELGs at $z\approx
0.77, 2.2$ and $4.4$, QSOs, etc). With this paper, we release $\sim 36$ sq.deg of J-PLUS data, containing
about $1.5\times 10^5$ stars and $10^5$ galaxies at $r<21$ mag.
