RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are tracers of the Milky Way's fossil record, holding valuable information
on its formation and early evolution. Owing to the high interstellar extinction endemic to the Galactic
plane, distant RRLs lying at low Galactic latitudes have been elusive. We attained a census of 1892
high-confidence RRLs by exploiting the near-infrared photometric database of the VVV survey's
disk footprint spanning $\sim$70$^\circ$ of Galactic longitude, using a machine-learned classifier.
Novel data-driven methods were employed to accurately characterize their spatial distribution
using sparsely sampled multi-band photometry. The RRL metallicity distribution function (MDF)
was derived from their $K_s$-band light curve parameters using machine-learning methods. The
MDF shows remarkable structural similarities to both the spectroscopic MDF of red clump giants
and the MDF of bulge RRLs. We model the MDF with a multi-component density distribution and find that
the number density of stars associated with the different model components systematically changes
with both the Galactocentric radius and vertical distance from the Galactic plane, equivalent
to weak metallicity gradients. Based on the consistency with results from the ARGOS survey, three
MDF modes are attributed to the old disk populations, while the most metal-poor RRLs are probably
halo interlopers. We propose that the dominant [Fe/H] component with a mean of $-1$ dex might correspond
to the outskirts of an ancient Galactic spheroid or classical bulge component residing in the central
Milky Way. The physical origins of the RRLs in this study need to be verified by kinematical information.
