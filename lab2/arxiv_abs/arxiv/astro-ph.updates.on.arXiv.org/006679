Radio loud Active Galactic Nuclei are episodic in nature, cycling through periods of activity and
quiescence. In this work we investigate the duty cycle of the radio galaxy B2~0258+35, which was
previously suggested to be a restarted radio galaxy based on its morphology. The radio source consists
of a pair of kpc-scale jets embedded in two large-scale lobes (~240 kpc) with relaxed shape and very
low surface brightness, which resemble remnants of a past AGN activity. We have combined new LOFAR
data at 145 MHz and new SRT data at 6600 MHz with available WSRT data at 1400 MHz to investigate the spectral
properties of the outer lobes and derive their age. Interestingly, the spectrum of both the outer
Northern and Southern lobes is not ultra-steep as expected for an old ageing plasma with spectral
index values equal to $\rm \alpha_{1400}^{145}=0.48\pm0.11$ and $\rm \alpha_{6600}^{1400}=0.69\pm0.20$
in the outer Northern lobe, and $\rm \alpha_{1400}^{145}=0.73\pm0.07$ in the outer Southern lobe.
Moreover, despite the wide frequency coverage available for the outer Northern lobe (145-6600~MHz),
we do not identify a significant spectral curvature (SPC$\simeq$0.2$\pm0.2$). While mechanisms
such as in-situ particle reacceleration, mixing or compression can temporarily play a role in preventing
the spectrum from steepening, in no case seem the outer lobes to be compatible with being very old
remnants of past activity as previously suggested (with age $\gtrsim$ 80 Myr). We conclude that
either the large-scale lobes are still fuelled by the nuclear engine or the jets have switched off
no more than a few tens of Myr ago. Our study shows the importance of combining morphological and spectral
properties to reliably classify the evolutionary stage of low surface brightness, diffuse emission
that low frequency observations are revealing around a growing number of radio sources.
