Global fits of primary and secondary cosmic-ray (CR) fluxes measured by AMS-02 have great potential
to study CR propagation models and search for exotic sources of antimatter such as annihilating
dark matter (DM). Previous studies of AMS-02 antiprotons revealed a possible hint for a DM signal
which, however, could be affected by systematic uncertainties. To test the robustness of such a
DM signal, in this work we systematically study two important sources of uncertainties: the antiproton
production cross sections needed to calculate the source spectra of secondary antiprotons and
the potential correlations in the experimental data, so far not provided by the AMS-02 Collaboration.
To investigate the impact of cross-section uncertainties we perform global fits of CR spectra including
a covariance matrix determined from nuclear cross-section measurements. As an alternative approach,
we perform a joint fit to both the CR and cross-section data. The two methods agree and show that cross-section
uncertainties have a small effect on the CR fits and on the significance of a potential DM signal,
which we find to be at the level of $3\sigma$. Correlations in the data can have a much larger impact.
To illustrate this effect, we determine possible benchmark models for the correlations in a data-driven
method. The inclusion of correlations strongly improves the constraints on the propagation model
and, furthermore, enhances the significance of the DM signal up to above $5\sigma$. Our analysis
demonstrates the importance of providing the covariance of the experimental data, which is needed
to fully exploit their potential.
