We study the imprints of an effective dark energy fluid in the large scale structure of the universe
through the observed angular power spectrum of galaxies in the relativistic regime. We adopt the
phenomenological approach that introduces two parameters $\{Q,\eta\}$ at the level of linear
perturbations and allow to take into account the modified clustering (or effective gravitational
constant) and anisotropic stress appearing in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We characterize the
effective dark energy fluid by an equation of state parameter $w=-0.95$ and various sound speed
cases in the range $10^{-6}\leq c^2_s\leq 1$, thus covering K-essence and quintessence cosmologies.
We calculate the angular power spectra of standard and relativistic effects for these scenarios
under the $\{Q,\eta\}$ parametrization, and we compare these relative to a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We find that, overall, deviations relative to $\Lambda$CDM are stronger at low redshift
since the behavior of the dark energy fluid can mimic the cosmological constant during matter domination
era but departs during dark energy domination. In particular, at $z=0.1$ the matter density fluctuations
are suppressed by up to $\sim3\%$ for the quintessence-like case, while redshift-space distortions
and Doppler effect can be enhanced by $\sim15\%$ at large scales for the lowest sound speed scenario.
On the other hand, at $z=2$ we find deviations of up to $\sim5\%$ in gravitational lensing, whereas
the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect can deviate up to $\sim17\%$. Furthermore, when considering
an imperfect dark energy fluid scenario, we find that all effects are insensitive to the presence
of anisotropic stress at low redshift, and only the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect can detect this
feature at $z=2$ and very large scales.
