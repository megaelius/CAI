We study the effect of weak lensing by cosmic (super-)strings on the higher-order statistics of
the cosmic microwave background (CMB). A cosmic string segment is expected to cause weak lensing
as well as an integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, the so-called Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins (GKS) effect,
to the CMB temperature fluctuation, which are thus naturally cross-correlated. We point out that,
in the presence of such a correlation, yet another kind of the post-recombination CMB temperature
bispectra, the ISW-lensing bispectra, will arise in the form of products of the auto- and cross-power
spectra. We first present an analytic method to calculate the autocorrelation of the temperature
fluctuations induced by the strings, and the cross-correlation between the temperature fluctuation
and the lensing potential both due to the string network. In our formulation, the evolution of the
string network is assumed to be characterized by the simple analytic model, the velocity-dependent
one scale model, and the intercommutation probability is properly incorporated in orderto characterize
the possible superstringy nature. Furthermore, the obtained power spectra are dominated by the
Poisson-distributed string segments, whose correlations are assumed to satisfy the simple relations.
We then estimate the signal-to-noise ratios of the string-induced ISW-lensing bispectra and discuss
the detectability of such CMB signals from the cosmic string network. It is found that in the case
of the smaller string tension, $G\mu\ll 10^{-7}$\,, the ISW-lensing bispectrum induced by a cosmic
string network can constrain the string-model parameters even more tightly than the purely GKS-induced
bispectrum in the ongoing and future CMB observations on small scales.
