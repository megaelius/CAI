CONTEXT: It has been recently advanced the proposal that the ejected matter from white dwarf (WD)
binary mergers might produce transient optical and infrared emission similar to the "kilonovae"
of neutron star (NS) binary mergers. AIMS: To calculate the electromagnetic emission from the WD-WD
mergers and compare with kilonova observations. METHODS: We simulate WD-WD mergers leading to
a massive, fast rotating, highly magnetized WD with an adapted version of the smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics
(SPH) code Phantom. We thus obtain initial conditions for the ejecta such as escape velocity, mass
and initial position and distribution. The subsequent thermal and dynamical evolution of the ejecta
is obtained by integrating the energy-conservation equation accounting for expansion cooling
and a heating source given by the fallback accretion onto the newly-formed WD and its magneto-dipole
radiation. RESULTS: We apply our model to the most detailed observed kilonova, AT 2017gfo, and its
associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) 170817A. We show that magnetospheric processes in the merger
can lead to a prompt, short gamma-ray emission of up to 10^{46}erg in a timescale of 0.1-1s. The ejecta
bulk starts the expansion with a non-relativistic velocity 0.01c and then accelerates to 0.1c owing
to the fallback accretion energy injection which dominates over the spindown energy. The ejecta
expands to become transparent in the optical wavelengths at ~7 days post-merger with a luminosity
10^{41}-10^{42}erg/s. The transparency to the X-rays from the ongoing fallback accretion occurs
at ~150-200 day post-merger with a luminosity of 10^{39}erg/s. CONCLUSIONS: We show that WD-WD
mergers can lead to electromagnetic emission as the one observed in GRB 170817A-AT 2017gfo. We also
predict the post-merger time at which the central WD should appear as a pulsar depending on the value
of the magnetic field and rotation period.
