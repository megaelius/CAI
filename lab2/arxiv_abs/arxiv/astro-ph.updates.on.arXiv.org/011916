The composition of comets in the Solar System come in multiple groups thought to encode information
about their formation in different regions of the outer protosolar disk. The recent discovery of
the second interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, allows for spectroscopic investigations into its
gas content and a preliminary classification of it within the Solar System comet taxonomies to test
the applicability of planetesimal formation models to other stellar systems. We present spectroscopic
and imaging observations from 2019 September 20th to October 26th at the Bok, MMT, and LBT telescopes.
We identify CN in the comet's spectrum and set precise upper limits on the abundance of C2 on all dates.
We use a Haser model to convert our integrated fluxes to production rates and find Q(CN) = 5.0 +/- 2.0
* 10^24 mol/s on September 20th and Q(CN) = 1.1 - 1.9 * 10^24 mol/s on later dates, both consistent with
contemporaneous observations. We set our lowest upper limit on a C2 production rate, Q(C2) < 1.6
* 10^23 mol/s, on October 10th. The measured ratio upper limit for that date, Q(C2)/Q(CN) < 0.095
indicates that 2I/Borisov is strongly in the (carbon chain) 'depleted' taxonomic group. The only
comparable Solar System comets have detected ratios near this limit, making 2I/Borisov statistically
likely to be more depleted than any known comet. Most 'depleted' comets are Jupiter Family Comets,
perhaps indicating a similiarity in formation conditions between the most depleted of the JFCs
and 2I/Borisov. More work is needed to understand the applicability of our knowledge of Solar System
comet taxonomies onto interstellar objects, and we discuss future work that could help clarify
the usefulness of the approach.
