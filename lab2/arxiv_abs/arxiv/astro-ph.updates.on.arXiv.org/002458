The intrinsic alignment of galaxies with the large-scale density field is an important astrophysical
contaminant in upcoming weak lensing surveys whilst offering insights into galaxy formation and
evolution. We present detailed measurements of the galaxy intrinsic alignments and associated
ellipticity-direction (ED) and projected shape ($w_{g+}$) correlation functions for galaxies
in the cosmological hydrodynamic MassiveBlack-II (MB-II) simulation. We carefully assess the
effects on galaxy shapes, misalignments and two-point statistics of iterative weighted (by mass,
luminosity, and color) definitions of the (reduced and unreduced) inertia tensor. We find that
iterative procedures must be adopted for a reliable measurement of reduced tensor but that luminosity
versus mass weighting has only negligible effects. Blue galaxies exhibit stronger misalignments
and suppressed $w_{g+}$ amplitude. Both ED and $w_{g+}$ correlations increase in amplitude with
subhalo mass (in the range of $10^{10} - 6.0\times 10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$), with a weak redshift
dependence (from $z=1$ to $z=0.06$) at fixed mass. At $z \sim 0.3$, we predict a $w_{g+}$ that is in
reasonable agreement with SDSS LRG measurements and that decreases in amplitude by a factor of $\sim
5$--18 for galaxies in the LSST survey. We predict the ratio of $w_{g+}$ (using subhalos as tracers
of density) and $w_{\delta+}$ (using dark matter density) to exhibit a scale dependent bias on scales
where the 1-halo term dominates. We also compared the intrinsic alignments of centrals and satellites,
with clear detection of satellite radial alignments within their host halos. Finally, we show that
$w_{g+}$ and $w_{\delta+}$ predictions from the simulations agree with that of non-linear alignment
models (NLA) at scales where the 2-halo term dominates in the correlations (and tabulate associated
NLA fitting parameters).
