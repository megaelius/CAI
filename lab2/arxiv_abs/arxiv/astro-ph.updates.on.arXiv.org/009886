Imaging of the dust continuum emitted from disks around nearby protostars reveals diverse substructure.
In recent years, theoretical efforts have been intensified to investigate how far the intrinsic
dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) can lead to such features. Turbulence in the realm of non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is one candidate for explaining the generation of zonal flows which
can lead to local dust enhancements. Adopting a radially varying cylindrical disk model, and considering
combinations of vertical and azimuthal initial net flux, we perform 3D non-ideal MHD simulations
aimed at studying self-organization induced by the Hall effect in turbulent PPDs. To this end, new
modules have been incorporated into the NIRVANA-III and FARGO3D MHD codes. We moreover include
dust grains, treated in the fluid approximation, in order to study their evolution subject to the
emerging zonal flows. In the regime of a dominant Hall effect, we robustly obtain large-scale organized
concentrations in the vertical magnetic field that remain stable for hundreds of orbits. For disks
with vertical initial net flux alone, we confirm the presence of zonal flows and vortices that introduce
regions of super-Keplerian gas flow. Including a moderately strong net-azimuthal magnetic flux
can significantly alter the dynamics, partially preventing the self-organization of zonal flows.
For plasma beta-parameters smaller than 50, large-scale, near-axisymmetric structures develop
in the vertical magnetic flux. In all cases, we demonstrate that the emerging features are capable
of accumulating dust grains for a range of Stokes numbers.
