The established cosmological theory which describes the history of the Universe since shortly
after the "Big Bang" until today is remarkably successful. Thanks to the increasing precision of
available observational data, we are now able to considerably constrain the geometry and composition
of the Universe --- and to glimpse how these will evolve in the near future. However, this success
comes at a price: one must assume the Universe "started" in a highly fine-tuned initial condition.
Understanding what came before this is therefore one of the main goals of modern cosmology. This
thesis attempts to further our understanding of the epoch before this initial condition in three
different ways. Firstly, the concept of negative absolute temperatures (NAT) is introduced and
its potential relevance for cosmology is investigated. In particular, it is shown that a Universe
at a NAT should undergo a period of inflation --- although it is unclear whether this would be consistent
with current observations. Secondly, work is done on the topic of the evolution of networks of cosmic
strings --- topological defects which are expected to form in a broad class of phase transitions
the Universe may have gone through. A model which takes into account the presence of small-scale
structure in strings is used to address questions concerning the existence and stability of scaling
regimes for these networks. Finally, it is investigated how future experiments might try to falsify
a simple class of canonical single-field slow-roll inflation models by measuring the running and
the running of the running of the spectral index of scalar perturbations.
