We perform time-dependent, 2DHD numerical simulations to study the dynamics of a slowly rotating
accretion flow from sub-pc to pc scales under the irradiation from the central AGN. Compared to previous
work, we improve the calculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition
to radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central AGN, in the momentum
equation we also include the force due to the scattered and reprocessed photons. We find that the
accretion flow properties change significantly due to this "re-radiation" effect. The inflow
rate at the inner boundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhanced by
about one order of magnitude. This effect is more significant when the density at the outer boundary
is higher. The properties of outflows such as velocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio
of outflow rate and the accretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring
the radiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far below the value
of $\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological simulations. The effect of the temperature
of the gas at the outer boundary ($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity
of the accretion flow oscillates. This is because in this case the gas around the Bondi radius can
be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature due to its high internal energy. Another
question we hope to address is the so-called "sub-Eddington" puzzle. Observationally, the luminosity
of almost all AGNs are sub-Eddington, while theoretically the luminosity of an accretion flow can
easily be super-Eddington. We find that even when the re-radiation effect is included and outflow
does become much stronger, the luminosity, while reduced, can still be super-Eddington.
