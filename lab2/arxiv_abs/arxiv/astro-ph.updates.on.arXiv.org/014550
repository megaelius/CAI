We estimate the mass of the intermediate-mass black hole at the heart of the dwarf elliptical galaxy
NGC 404 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the molecular
interstellar medium at an unprecedented linear resolution of ~0.5 pc, in combination with existing
stellar kinematic information. These ALMA observations reveal a central disc/torus of molecular
gas clearly rotating around the black hole. This disc is surrounded by a morphologically and kinematically
complex flocculent distribution of molecular clouds, that we resolve in detail. Continuum emission
is detected from the central parts of NGC 404, likely arising from the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of emission
from dust around the nucleus, and potentially from dusty massive star-forming clumps at discrete
locations in the disc. Several dynamical measurements of the black hole mass in this system have
been made in the past, but they do not agree. We show here that both the observed molecular gas and stellar
kinematics independently require a ~5x10$^5$ Msun black hole once we include the contribution
of the molecular gas to the potential. Our best estimate comes from the high-resolution molecular
gas kinematics, suggesting the black hole mass of this system is 5.5$^{+4.1}_{-3.8}\times$10$^5$
Msun (at the 99% confidence level), in good agreement with our revised stellar kinematic measurement
and broadly consistent with extrapolations from the black hole mass - velocity dispersion and black
hole mass - bulge mass relations. This highlights the need to accurately determine the mass and distribution
of each dynamically important component around intermediate-mass black holes when attempting
to estimate their masses.
