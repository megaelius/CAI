As wide-field surveys yield ever more precise measurements, cosmology has entered a phase of high
precision requiring highly accurate and fast theoretical predictions. At the heart of most cosmological
model predictions is a numerical solution of the Einstein-Boltzmann equations governing the evolution
of linear perturbations in the Universe. We present PyCosmo, a new Python-based framework to solve
this set of equations using a special pur- pose solver based on symbolic manipulations, automatic
generation of C++ code and sparsity optimisation. The code uses a consistency relation of the field
equations to adapt the time step and does not rely on physical approximations for speed-up. After
reviewing the system of first-order linear homogeneous differential equations to be solved, we
describe the numerical scheme implemented in PyCosmo. We then compare the predictions and performance
of the code for the computation of the transfer functions of cosmological perturbations and compare
it to existing cosmological Boltzmann codes. We find that we achieve comparable execution times
for comparable accuracies. While PyCosmo does not yet have all the features of other codes, our approach
is complementary to existing cosmological Boltzmann solvers and can be used as an independent test
of their numerical solutions. The symbolic representation of the Einstein-Boltzmann equation
system in PyCosmo provides a convenient interface for implementing extended cosmological models.
We also discuss how the PyCosmo framework can also be used as a general framework to compute cosmological
quantities as well as observables for both interactive and high-performance batch jobs applications.
