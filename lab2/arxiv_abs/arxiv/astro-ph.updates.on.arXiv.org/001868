The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) was a multi-cycle
treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that surveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with
~900 HST orbits spread across 5 fields over 3 years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae
(SN) of all types, out to z~2.5. We classify ~24 of these as Type Ia SN (SN Ia) based on host-galaxy redshifts
and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of 6 SN). Here we present a measurement of
the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 and putting
new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SN that
exploded when the universe was only ~3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history.
This gives the CANDELS high-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SN Ia
that explode promptly after formation (<500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available
SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we find that this prompt SN Ia fraction is fP=0.53 +0.09
-0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys), consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple
t^{-1} power law for all times t>40 Myr. However, a mild tension is apparent between ground-based
low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH,
we find a low rate of SN Ia at z>1. This could be a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively
rare, accounting for only ~20% of all SN Ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples
will be needed to examine that suggestion.
