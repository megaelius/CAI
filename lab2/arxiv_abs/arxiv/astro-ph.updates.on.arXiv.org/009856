At Pic du Midi observatory we carry out a solar survey with images of the photosphere, prominences
and corona. This survey, named CLIMSO (CLIch\'es Multiples du SOleil), is in the following spectral
lines: Fe XIII corona (1.075 micron), H-alpha (656.3 nm) and He I (1.083 micron) prominences, H-alpha
and Ca II (393.4 nm) photosphere. All frames cover 1.3 times the diameter of the Sun with an angular
resolution approaching one arc second. The frame rate is one per minute per channel (weather permitting)
for the prominences and chromosphere, and one per hour for the Fe XIII corona. This survey started
in 2007 for the disk and prominences, and in 2015 for the corona. We have almost completed one solar
cycle, and hope to cover several more, keeping the same wavelengths or adding others. Aims: Make
the CLIMSO images easier to use and more profitable for the scientific community. Methods: Providing
'science-ready' data. We have improved the contrast capabilities of our coronagraphs, which now
provide images of the Fe XIII corona, in addition to the previous spectral channels. We have also
implemented an autoguiding system based on a diffractive Fresnel array for precise positioning
of the Sun behind the coronagraphic masks. Results: The data (images and films) are publicly available
and downloadable through virtual observatories and dedicated sites: e.g. this http URL For the
H-alpha and and Ca II channels we calibrate the data into physical units, independent of atmospheric
or instrumental conditions: we provide solar maps of spectral radiances inW m^-2 sr^-1 nm^-1. The
instrumental improvements and the calibration process are presented in this paper.
