The current consensus on the formation and evolution of the brightest cluster galaxies is that their
stellar mass forms early ($z \gtrsim 4$) in separate galaxies that then eventually assemble the
main structure at late times ($z \lesssim 1$). However, advances in observational techniques have
led to the discovery of protoclusters out to $z \sim 7$, suggesting that the late-assembly picture
may not be fully complete. If these protoclusters assemble rapidly in the early universe, they should
form the brightest cluster galaxies much earlier than suspected by the late-assembly picture.
Using a combination of observationally constrained hydrodynamical and dark-matter-only simulations,
we show that the stellar assembly time of a sub-set of the brightest cluster galaxies occurs at high
redshifts ($z > 3$) rather than at low redshifts ($z < 1$), as is commonly thought. We find, using isolated
non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, that highly overdense protoclusters assemble
their stellar mass into brightest cluster galaxies within $\sim 1$ $\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution
-- producing massive blue elliptical galaxies at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 1.5$). We argue that
there is a downsizing effect on the cluster scale wherein some of the brightest cluster galaxies
in the cores of the most-massive clusters assemble earlier than those in lower-mass clusters. In
those clusters with $z = 0$ virial mass $\geqslant 5\times10^{14}$ M$_\mathrm{\odot}$, we find
that $9.8$% have their cores assembly early, and a higher fraction of $16.4$% in those clusters above
$10^{15}$ M$_\mathrm{\odot}$. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to detect and confirm
our prediction in the near future, and we discuss the implications to constraining the value of $\sigma_\mathrm{8}$.
