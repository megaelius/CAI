Characterise the large-scale structure in the Universe from present times to the high redshift
epoch of reionisation is essential to constraining the cosmology, the history of star formation
and reionisation, measuring the gas content of the Universe and obtaining a better understanding
of the physical process that drive galaxy formation and evolution. Using the integrated emission
from unresolved galaxies or gas clouds, line intensity mapping (LIM) provides a new observational
window to measure the larger properties of structure. This very promising technique motivates
the community to plan for LIM experiments. We describe the development of a large field-of-view
instrument, named CONCERTO, operating in the range 130-310 GHz from the APEX 12-meters telescope.
CONCERTO is a low-resolution spectrometer based on the Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors
technology. Spectra are obtained using a fast Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS), coupled to
a dilution cryostat with base temperature of 0.1K. Two 2 kilo-pixels arrays of LEKID are mounted
inside the cryostat that also contains the cold optics and the front-end electronics. We present
in detail the technological choices leading to the instrumental concept, together with the design
and fabrication of the instrument and preliminary laboratory tests on the detectors. We also give
our best estimates of CONCERTO sensitivity and give predictions for two of the main scientific goals
of CONCERTO, i.e. a [CII]-intensity mapping survey and observations of galaxy clusters. We provide
a detail description of the instrument design. Based on realistic comparisons with existing instruments
developed by our group (NIKA, NIKA2, and KISS), and on laboratory detectors characterisation,
we provide an estimate of CONCERTO sensitivity on sky. Finally, we describe in detail two out of the
main science goals offered by CONCERTO at APEX.
