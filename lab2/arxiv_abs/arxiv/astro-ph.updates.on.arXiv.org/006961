Endogenous or exogenous, dry or wet, various scenarios have been so far depicted for the origin of
water on our Solar Systems rocky bodies. Hydrated silicates found in meteorites and in interplanetary
dust particles together with observations of abundant water reservoirs in the habitable zone of
protoplanetary disks are evidences that support aqueous alteration of silicate dust grains by
water vapor condensation in a nebular setting. We investigate the thermodynamics (temperature
and pressure dependencies) and kinetics (adsorption rates and energies, surface diffusion and
cluster formation) of water adsorption on surfaces of forsterite grains. (abbreviated) The protoplanetary
disk model (ProDiMo) code is tuned to simulate the thermochemical disk structure of the early solar
nebula at three evolutionary stages. Pressure, temperature and water vapor abundance within 1
au from the protosun were extracted and used as input for a Monte Carlo code to model water associative
adsorption using adsorption energies that resemble the forsterite [100] crystal lattice. Hydration
of forsterite surfaces by water vapor adsorption could have occurred within the nebula lifetime
already at a density of 1e8 cm-3, with increasing surface coverage for higher water vapor densities.
Full surface coverage is attained for temperatures lower than 500 K, while for hotter grain surfaces
water cluster formation plays a crucial role. (abbreviated) This work shows that water cluster
formation enhances the water surface coverage and enables a stable water layer to form at high temperature
and low water vapor density conditions. Finally, surface diffusion of physisorbed water molecules
shortens the timescale for reaching steady state, enabling phyllosilicate formation within the
solar nebula timescale.
