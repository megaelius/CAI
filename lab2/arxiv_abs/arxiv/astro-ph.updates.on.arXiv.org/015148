The South Pole Telescope (SPT) has systematically identified 81 high-redshift, strongly gravitationally
lensed, dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in a 2500 square degree cosmological mm-wave survey.
We present the final spectroscopic redshift survey of this flux-limited ($S_{870\, \mathrm{\mu
m}} > 25\, \mathrm{mJy}$) sample, initially selected at $1.4$ mm. The redshift survey was conducted
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array across the $3$ mm spectral window, targeting
carbon monoxide line emission. By combining these measurements with ancillary data, the SPT sample
is now spectroscopically complete, with redshifts spanning $1.9$$<$$z$$<$$6.9$ and a median
of $z=3.9 \pm 0.2$. We present the mm through far-infrared photometry and spectral energy density
fits for all sources, along with their inferred intrinsic properties. Comparing the properties
of the SPT sources to the unlensed DSFG population, we demonstrate that the SPT-selected DSFGs represent
the most extreme infrared-luminous galaxies, even after accounting for strong gravitational
lensing. The SPT sources have a median star formation rate of $2.3(2)\times 10^3\, \mathrm{M_\odot
yr^{-1}}$ and a median dust mass of $1.4(1)\times10^9\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, the inferred
gas depletion timescales of the SPT sources are comparable to those of unlensed DSFGs, once redshift
is taken into account. This SPT sample contains roughly half of the known spectroscopically confirmed
DSFGs at $z$$>$$5$, making this the largest sample of high-redshift DSFGs to-date, and enabling
the "high-redshift tail" of extremely luminous DSFGs to be measured. Though galaxy formation models
struggle to account for the SPT redshift distribution, the larger sample statistics from this complete
and well-defined survey will help inform future theoretical efforts.
