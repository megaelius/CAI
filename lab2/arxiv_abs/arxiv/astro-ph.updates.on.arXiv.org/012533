We report on the first NuSTAR observation of the transitional millisecond pulsar binary XSS J12270-4859
during its current rotation-powered state, complemented with a 2.5yr-long radio monitoring at
Parkes telescope and archival XMM-Newton and Swift X-ray and optical data. The radio pulsar is mainly
detected at 1.4GHz displaying eclipses over about 40% of the 6.91h orbital cycle. We derive a new
updated radio ephemeris to study the 3-79keV light curve that displays a significant orbital modulation
with fractional amplitude of 28+/-3%, a structured maximum centred at the inferior conjunction
of the pulsar and no cycle-to-cycle or low-high-flaring mode variabilities. The average X-ray
spectrum, extending up to about 70keV without a spectral break, is well described by a simple power-law
with photon index Gamma = 1.17+/-0.08 giving a 3-79keV luminosity of 7.6(-0.8;+3.8)x10**32 erg/s,
for a distance of 1.37(-0.15;+0.69)kpc. Energy resolved orbital light curves reveal that the modulation
is not energy dependent from 3keV to 25keV and is undetected with an upper limit of about 10% above
25keV. Comparison with previous X-ray XMM-Newton observations in common energy ranges confirms
that the modulation amplitudes vary on timescales of a few months, indicative of a non-stationary
contribution of the intrabinary shock formed by the colliding winds of the pulsar and the companion.
A more detailed inspection of energy resolved modulations than previously reported gives hints
of a mild softening at superior conjunction of the pulsar below 3keV, likely due to the contribution
of the thermal emission from the neutron star. The intrabinary shock emission, if extending into
the MeV range, would be energetically capable alone to irradiate the donor star.
