We aim at unveiling the stellar content properties of quiescent galaxies, as well as how these galaxies
evolved and assembled their stellar populations since $z\sim1$ up to the present days. Using the
multi-filter photometric data from ALHAMBRA and the SED-fitting code MUFFIT, we built a complete
catalogue of quiescent galaxies through the dust-corrected stellar mass-colour diagram. This
catalogue includes stellar population properties, such as ages, metallicities, extinctions,
stellar masses and photo $z$, which were retrieved using two sets of SSP models to construct composite
models of stellar populations. We develop a novel methodology to provide, for the first time, the
analytic probability distribution functions of mass-weighted ages, metallicities, and extinctions
of quiescent galaxies as a function of redshift and stellar mass. In the analysis, we explore different
assumptions for the SFH to discard potential systematics of the population synthesis models. There
is an increasing number of quiescent galaxies since $z\sim1$ that is more prominent for decreasing
stellar masses. Quiescent galaxies present extinction values of $A_V<0.6$ with median values
in the range $A_V = 0.15$--$0.3$. At increasing stellar mass, quiescent galaxies are older and more
metal rich since $z\sim1$. A detailed analysis of the PDFs reveals that the evolution of quiescent
galaxies is not compatible with a passive evolution and there is striking evidence for a slight decrease
in the median metallicity of $0.1$--$0.2$~dex. The intrinsic dispersions of the age and metallicity
PDFs show a dependence with stellar mass and redshift. These results are qualitatively consistent
with both set of SSP models and the alternative SFH assumptions explored. To reconcile the observed
trends, the quiescent population must undergo an evolutive pathway including mergers, remnants
of star formation and the "progenitor" bias.
