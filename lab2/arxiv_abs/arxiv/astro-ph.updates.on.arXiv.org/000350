Color distributions of globular clusters (GCs) in most massive galaxies are bimodal. Assuming
linear color-to-metallicity conversions, bimodality is viewed as the presence of merely two GC
subsystems with distinct metallicities, which serves as a critical backbone of various galaxy
formation theories. Recent studies, however, revealed that the color-metallicity relations
(CMRs) often used to derive GC metallicities (e.g., CMRs of g-z, V-I and C-T1) are in fact inflected.
Such inflection can create bimodal color distributions if the underlying GC metallicity spread
is simply broad as expected from the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation. In order
to test the nonlinear-CMR scenario for GC color bimodality, the u-band photometry is proposed because
the u-related CMRs (e.g., CMRs of u-g and u-z) are theoretically predicted to be least inflected
and most distinctive among commonly used optical CMRs. Here, we present Hubble Space Telescope
(HST)/WFC3 F336W (u-band) photometry of the GC system in M84, a giant elliptical in the Virgo galaxy
cluster. Combining the u data with the existing HST ACS/WFC g and z data, we find that the u-z and u-g
color distributions are different from the g-z distribution in a very systematic manner and remarkably
consistent with our model predictions based on the nonlinear-CMR hypothesis. The results lend
further confidence to validity of the nonlinear-CMR scenario as an explanation for GC color bimodality.
There are some GC systems showing bimodal spectroscopic metallicity, and in such systems the inflected
CMRs often create stronger bimodality in the color domain.
