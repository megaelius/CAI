We investigate the time evolution of dense cores identified in molecular cloud simulations using
dendrograms, which are a common tool to identify hierarchical structure in simulations and observations
of star formation. We develop an algorithm to link dendrogram structures through time using the
three-dimensional density field from magnetohydrodynamical simulations, thus creating histories
for all dense cores in the domain. We find that the population-wide distributions of core properties
are relatively invariant in time, and quantities like the core mass function match with observations.
Despite this consistency, an individual core may undergo large (>40%), stochastic variations
due to the redefinition of the dendrogram structure between timesteps. This variation occurs independent
of environment and stellar content. We identify a population of short-lived (<200 kyr) overdensities
masquerading as dense cores that may comprise ~20% of any time snapshot. Finally, we note the importance
of considering the full history of cores when interpreting the origin of the initial mass function;
we find that, especially for systems containing multiple stars, the core mass defined by a dendrogram
leaf in a snapshot is typically less than the final system stellar mass. This work reinforces that
there is no time-stable density contour that defines a star-forming core. The dendrogram itself
can induce significant structure variation between timesteps due to small changes in the density
field. Thus, one must use caution when comparing dendrograms of regions with different ages or environment
properties because differences in dendrogram structure may not come solely from the physical evolution
of dense cores.
