The (supermassive black hole mass, $M_\text{BH}$)-(bulge stellar mass, $M_{\rm*,sph}$) relation
is, obviously, derived using two quantities. We endeavor to provide accurate values for the latter
via detailed multicomponent galaxy decompositions for the current full sample of 43 spiral galaxies
having directly measured $M_\text{BH}$ values; 35 of these galaxies have been alleged to contain
pseudobulges, 21 have water maser measurements, and three appear bulgeless. This more than doubles
the previous sample size of spiral galaxies with a finessed image analysis. We have analyzed near-infrared
images, accounting for not only the bulge, disk (exponential, truncated, or inclined), and bar
but also for spiral arms and rings and additional central components (active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
etc.). A symmetric Bayesian analysis finds $\log\left(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}\right)=\left(2.44_{-0.31}^{+0.35}\right)\log\left\{M_{\rm*,sph}/[\upsilon(1.15\times10^{10}\,M_{\odot})]\right\}+(7.24\pm0.12)$,
with $\upsilon$ a stellar mass-to-light ratio term. The level of scatter equals that about the $M_{\rm
BH}$-$\sigma_*$ relation. The nonlinear slope rules out the idea that many mergers, coupled with
the central limit theorem, produced this scaling relation, and it corroborates previous observational
studies and simulations, which have reported a near-quadratic slope at the low-mass end of the $M_\text{BH}$-$M_{\rm*,sph}$
diagram. Furthermore, bulges with AGNs follow this relation; they are not offset by an order of magnitude,
and models that have invoked AGN feedback to establish a linear $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm*,sph}$ relation
need revisiting. We additionally present an updated $M_\text{BH}$-(S\'ersic index, $n_\text{sph}$)
relation for spiral galaxy bulges with a comparable level of scatter and a new $M_{\rm*,sph}$-(spiral-arm
pitch angle, $\phi$) relation.
