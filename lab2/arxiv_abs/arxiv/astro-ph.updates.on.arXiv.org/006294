In the core accretion scenario, gas giant planets are formed form solid cores with several Earth
masses via gas accretion. We investigate the formation of such cores via collisional growth from
kilometer-sized planetesimals in turbulent disks. The stirring by forming cores induces collisional
fragmentation and surrounding planetesimals are ground down until radial drift. The core growth
is therefore stalled by the depletion of surrounding planetesiamls due to collisional fragmentation
and radial drift. The collisional strength of planetesimals determines the planetesimal-depletion
timescale, which is prolonged for large planetesiamls. The size of planetesiamls around growing
cores is determined by the planetesimal size distribution at the onset of runaway growth. Strong
turbulence delays the onset of runaway growth, resulting in large planetesimals. Therefore, the
core mass evolution depends on turbulent parameter $\alpha$; the formation of cores massive enough
without significant depletion of surrounding planetesimals needs strong turbulence of $\alpha
\gtrsim 10^{-3}$. However, the strong turbulence with $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ leads to a significant
delay of the onset of runaway growth and prevents the formation of massive cores within the disk lifetime.
The formation of cores massive enough within several millions years therefore requires the several
times enhancement of the solid surface densities, which is achieved in the inner disk $\lesssim
10$AU due to pile-up of drifting dust aggregates. In addition, the collisional strength $Q_{\rm
D}^*$ even for kilometer-sized or smaller bodies affects the growth of cores; $Q_{\rm D}^* \gtrsim
10^7 \,{\rm erg/g}$ for bodies $\lesssim 1$ km is likely for this gas giant formation.
