Strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters can provide magnification of the flux and even multiple
images of the galaxies that lie behind them. This phenomenon facilitates observations of high-redshift
supernovae (SNe), that would otherwise remain undetected. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) detections
are of particular interest because of their standard brightness, since they can be used to improve
either cluster lensing models or cosmological parameter measurements. We present a ground-based,
near-infrared search for lensed SNe behind the galaxy cluster Abell 370. Our survey was based on
15 epochs of J-band observations with the HAWK-I instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We
use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry to infer the global properties of the multiply-imaged
galaxies. Using a recently published lensing model of Abell 370, we also present the predicted magnifications
and time delays between the images. In our survey, we did not discover any live SNe from the 13 lensed
galaxies with 47 multiple images behind Abell 370. This is consistent with the expectation of $0.09\pm0.02$
SNe calculated based on the measured star formation rate. We compare the expectations of discovering
strongly lensed SNe in our survey and that performed with HST during the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF)
programme. We also show the expectations of search campaigns that can be conducted with future facilities,
such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).
We show that the NIRCam instrument aboard the JWST will be sensitive to most SN multiple images in
the strongly lensed galaxies and thus will be able to measure their time delays if observations are
scheduled accordingly.
