The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) has investigated
multiple stellar populations by means of the "chromosome map" (ChM) diagnostic tool that maximises
the separation between stars with different chemical composition. One of the most challenging
features revealed by ChMs analysis is the apparent inhomogeneity among stars belonging to the first
population, a phenomenon largely attributed to He variations. However, this explanation is not
supported by the uniformity in p-capture elements of these stars. The HST survey has revealed that
the GC NGC 3201 shows an exceptionally wide coverage in the Delta(F275W,F814W) parameter of the
ChM. We present a chemical abundance analysis of 24 elements in 18 giants belonging to the first population
of this GC, and having a wide range in Delta(F275W,F814W). As far as the p-capture elements are concerned,
the chemical abundances are typical of 1G stars, as expected from the location of our targets in the
ChM. Based on radial velocities and chemical abundances arguments, we find that the three stars
with the lowest Delta(F275W,F814W) values are binary candidates. This suggests that, at least
those stars could be explained with binarity. These results are consistent with evidence inferred
from multi-band photometry that evolved blue stragglers populate the bluest part of the 1G sequence
in the ChM. The remaining 15 spectroscopic targets show a small range in the overall metallicity
by ~0.10 dex, with stars at higher Delta(F275W,F814W) values having higher absolute abundances.
We suggest that a small variation in metals and binarity govern the color spread of the 1G in the ChM,
and that evolved blue stragglers contribute to the bluest tail of the 1G sequence.
