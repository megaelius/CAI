Context. Solar spectral irradiance (SSI) variability is one of the key inputs to models of the Earth's
climate. Understanding solar irradiance fluctuations also helps to place the Sun among other stars
in terms of their brightness variability patterns and to set detectability limits for terrestrial
exo-planets. Aims. One of the most successful and widely used models of solar irradiance variability
is SATIRE-S. It uses spectra of the magnetic features and surrounding quiet Sun computed with the
ATLAS9 spectral synthesis code under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).
SATIRE-S has been at the forefront of solar variability modelling, but due to the limitations of
the LTE approximation its output SSI has to be empirically corrected below 300 nm, which reduces
the physical consistency of its results. This shortcoming is addressed in the present paper. Methods.
We replace the ATLAS9 spectra of all atmospheric components in SATIRE-S with the spectra calculated
using the non-LTE Spectral Synthesis Code (NESSY). We also use Fontenla et al. (1999) temperature
and density stratification models of the solar atmosphere to compute the spectrum of the quiet Sun
and faculae. Results. We compute non-LTE contrasts of spots and faculae and combine them with the
SDO/HMI filling factors of the active regions to calculate the total and spectral solar irradiance
variability during solar cycle 24. Conclusions. The non-LTE contrasts result in total and spectral
solar irradiance in good agreement with the empirically corrected output of the LTE version. This
suggests that empirical correction introduced into SATIRE-S output is well judged and that the
corrected total and spectral solar irradiance obtained from the SATIRE-S model in LTE is fully consistent
with the results of non-LTE computations.
