We test the isotropy of the local Universe using low redshift Supernova data from various catalogs
and the non-parametric method of smoothed residuals. Using a recently developed catalog which
combines Supernova data from various surveys, we show that the isotropic hypothesis of a Universe
with zero velocity perturbation can be rejected with moderate significance, with $p$-value $\sim
0.07$ out to redshift $z < 0.045$. We estimate the direction of maximal anisotropy on the sky for
various pre-existing catalogs and show that it remains relatively unaffected by the light curve
fitting procedure. However the recovered direction is biased by the underlying distribution of
data points on the sky. We estimate both the uncertainty and bias in the direction by creating mock
data containing a randomly oriented bulk flow and using our method to reconstruct its direction.
We conclude that the inhomogeneous nature of the data introduces a directional bias in galactic
latitude of approximately $|\Delta b_{\rm max}| \sim 18^{\circ}$ for the Supernova catalog considered
in this work, and after correcting for this effect we infer the direction of maximum anisotropy as
$(b,\ell) = (20^{\circ}, 276^{\circ}) \pm (12^{\circ},29^{\circ})$ in galactic coordinates.
Finally we compare the anisotropic signal in the data to mock realisations in which large scale velocity
perturbations are consistently accounted for at the level of linear perturbation theory. We show
that including the effect of the velocity perturbation in our mock catalogs degrades the significance
of the anisotropy considerably, with $p$-value increasing to $\sim 0.29$. One can conclude from
our analysis that there is a moderate deviation from isotropy in the Supernova data, but the signal
is consistent with a large scale bulk velocity expected within $\Lambda$CDM.
