In this paper, we systematically study spherically symmetric static spacetimes in the framework
of Einstein-aether theory, and pay particular attention to the existence of black holes (BHs).
In the theory, one scalar and one vector two gravitational modes additionally appear. To avoid the
vacuum gravi-\v{C}erenkov radiation, they must all propagate with speeds greater than or at least
equal to the speed of light. In the spherical case, only the scalar mode is relevant, so BH horizons
are defined by this mode. In the present studies we first clarify several subtle issues. In particular,
we find that, out of the five non-trivial field equations, only three are independent, so the problem
is well-posed, as now there are only three unknown functions, two, $F(r)$ and $B(r)$, describe the
spacetime and one, $A(r)$, describes the aether field. In addition, the two second-order differential
equations for $A$ and $F$ are independent of $B$, and once they are found, $B$ is given simply by an
algebraic expression of $F,\; A$ and their derivatives. To simplify the problem further, we explore
the symmetry of field redefinitions, and work first with the redefined metric and aether field,
and then obtain the physical ones by the inverse transformations. These clarifications significantly
simplify the computational labor, which is important, as the problem is highly involved mathematically.
In fact, it is exactly because of these, we find various numerical BH solutions with an accuracy that
is at least two orders higher than previous ones. More important, these BH solutions are the only
ones that satisfy the self-consistent conditions and meantime are consistent with all the observational
constraints obtained so far. The locations of universal horizons are also identified, together
with several other observationally interesting quantities.
