A large fraction of accreting black hole and neutron stars systems present clear evidence of the
reprocessing of X-rays in the atmosphere of an optically-thick accretion disk. The main hallmarks
of X-ray reflection include fluorescent K-shell emission lines from iron ($\sim 6.4-6.9$ keV),
the absorption iron K-edge ($\sim 7-9$ keV), and a broad featureless component known as the Compton
hump ($\sim 20-40$ keV). This Compton hump is produced as the result of the scattering of high-energy
photons ($E \gtrsim 10$ keV) of the relatively colder electrons ($T_e \sim 10^5-10^7$ K) in the accretion
disk, in combination with photoelectric absorption from iron. The treatment of this process in
most current models of ionized X-ray reflection has been done using an approximated Gaussian redistribution
kernel. This approach works sufficiently well up to $\sim100$ keV, but it becomes largely inaccurate
at higher energies and at relativistic temperatures ($T_e\sim10^9$ K). We present new calculations
of X-ray reflection using a modified version of our code XILLVER, including an accurate solution
for Compton scattering of the reflected unpolarized photons in the disk atmosphere. This solution
takes into account quantum electrodynamic and relativistic effects allowing the correct treatment
of high photon energies and electron temperatures. We show new reflection spectra computed with
this model, and discuss the improvements achieved in the reproducing the correct shape of the Compton
hump, the discrepancies with previous calculations, and the expected impact of these new models
in the interpretation of observational data.
