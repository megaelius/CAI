We investigate thermal and non-thermal radio continuum associated with the early formation and
evolution of Young Stellar Clusters (YSCs) selected by their MIR emission in M33. For the first time
in an external galaxy it has been possible to identify radio counterparts to more than 300 star forming
regions. We proof the nature of candidate YSCs fully embedded in molecular clouds, by recovering
their associated faint radio continuum luminosities. Using the Halpha line to identify free-free
radio emission at 5 GHz in the more evolved, partially exposed YSCs, we retrieve information on the
relevance of magnetic fields and cosmic rays across the M33 disk at 25 pc spatial scales. A cross-correlation
of MIR and radio continuum luminosities is established from bright to very faint YSCs, with MIR-to-radio
emission ratio showing a gradual decline towards the outer disk, while the magnetic field is pervasive
at all radii. We establish and discuss the tight relation between radio continuum and other star
formation indicators, such as Halpha. This relation holds for individual YSCs over four orders
of magnitude as well as for molecular clouds hosting YSCs. On average about half of radio emission
at 5 GHz in YSCs is non-thermal. For exposed but compact YSCs the non-thermal radio fraction increases
with source brightness, while for large HII regions the fraction is lower and shows no clear trend.
This has been found for YSCs with and without identified SNRs and underlines the possible role of
massive stars in triggering particle acceleration through winds and shocks: these particles diffuse
throughout the native molecular cloud prior to cloud dispersal.
