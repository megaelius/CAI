The $\epsilon$ mechanism is a self-excitation mechanism of stellar pulsations which acts in regions
inside the star where nuclear burning takes place. It has been shown that the $\epsilon$ mechanism
can excite pulsations in models of hot pre-horizontal branch stars, and that the shortest periods
of LS IV-14$^{\circ}$116 could be explained that way. We aim to study the $\epsilon$ mechanism in
stellar models appropriate for hot pre-horizontal branch stars to predict their pulsational properties
and the instability domain in the $\log g-\log T_{\rm eff}$ plane. We perform detailed computations
of non-adiabatic non-radial pulsations on stellar models during the helium subflashes just before
the helium-core burning phase. We find an instability domain of long-period gravity modes due to
the $\epsilon$ mechanism in the $\log g-\log T_{\rm eff}$ plane at roughly $22000\,{\rm K} \lesssim
T_{\rm eff}\lesssim 50000\,$K and $4.67 \lesssim \log g \lesssim 6.15$. Consequently, we find
instabilities due to the $\epsilon$ mechanism on pre-extreme horizontal branch stellar models
($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim 22000\,$K), but not on pre-blue horizontal branch stellar models ($T_{\rm
eff}\lesssim 21000\,$K). The periods of excited modes range between $\sim 200$ and $\sim2000\,$s.
Comparison with the three known pulsating He-rich subdwarfs shows that $\epsilon$ mechanism can
excite gravity modes in stars with similar surface properties, but in our models it is only able to
excite modes in the range of the shortest observed periods. We predict a new instability strip for
hot-subdwarf stars of which LS IV-14$^{\circ}$116 could be the first inhabitant. Based on simple
estimates we expect 1 to 10 stars in the current samples of hot-subdwarf stars to be pulsating by the
$\epsilon$ mechanism. Our results could constitute a theoretical basis for future searches of
pulsators in the Galactic field.
