We observe plasma flows in cool loops using the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) onboard the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS). Huang et al. (2015) observed unusually broadened Si IV 1403 angstrom
line profiles at the footpoints of such loops that were attributed to signatures of explosive events
(EEs). We have chosen one such uni-directional flowing cool loop system observed by IRIS where one
of the footpoints is associated with significantly broadened Si IV line profiles. The line profile
broadening indirectly indicates the occurrence of numerous EEs below the transition region (TR),
while it directly infers a large velocity enhancement /perturbation further causing the plasma
flows in the observed loop system. The observed features are implemented in a model atmosphere in
which a low-lying bi-polar magnetic field system is perturbed in the chromosphere by a velocity
pulse with a maximum amplitude of 200 km/s. The data-driven 2-D numerical simulation shows that
the plasma motions evolve in a similar manner as observed by IRIS in the form of flowing plasma filling
the skeleton of a cool loop system. We compare the spatio-temporal evolution of the cool loop system
in the framework of our model with the observations, and conclude that their formation is mostly
associated with the velocity response of the transient energy release above their footpoints in
the chromosphere/TR. Our observations and modeling results suggest that the velocity responses
most likely associated to the EEs could be one of the main candidates for the dynamics and energetics
of the flowing cool loop systems in the lower solar atmosphere.
