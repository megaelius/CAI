Given the unprecedented effective area, the new ATHENA Silicon Pore Optics (SPO) focusing technology,
the dynamic and variable L2 environment, where no X-ray mission has flown up to date, a dedicated
Geant4 simulation campaign is needed to evaluate the impact of low energy protons scattering on
the ATHENA mirror surface and the induced residual background level on its X-ray detectors. The
Geant4 mass model is built as part of the ESA AREMBES project activities using the BoGEMMS framework.
An SPO mirror module row is the atomic unit of the mass model, allowing the simulation of the full structure
by means of 20 independent runs, one for each row. Thanks to the BoGEMMS configuration files, both
single pores, mirror modules or the entire SPO row can be built with the same Geant4 geometry. Both
Remizovich, in its elastic approximation, and Coulomb single scattering Geant4 models are used
in the interaction of mono-energetic proton beams with a single SPO pore. The scattering efficiency
for the first model is almost twice the efficiency obtained with the latter but for both cases we obtain
similar polar and azimuthal angular distributions, with about 70-75% of scatterings generated
by single or double reflections. The soft proton flux modelled for the plasma sheet region is used
as input for the simulation of soft proton funnelling by the full SPO mass model. A much weaker soft
proton vignetting than the one observed by XMM-Newton EPIC detectors is generated by ATHENA mirrors.
The residual soft proton flux reaching the focal plane, defined as a 15 cm radius, is 10^4 times lower
than the input L2 soft proton population entering the mirror, at the same energy, with rates comparable
or higher than the ones observed in XMM EPIC-pn most intense soft proton flares.
