The role of the magnetic field in the formation of the filamentary structures observed in the interstellar
medium (ISM) is a debated topic. The Planck all-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust
at 353GHz provide the required combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation between
the structures of the Galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, both in the diffuse ISM
and in molecular clouds. The data reveal structures, or ridges, in the intensity map with counterparts
in the Stokes Q and/or U maps. We focus on structures at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes
with column density from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We measure the magnetic field orientation
on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present an algorithm to estimate the orientation
of the ridges from the dust intensity map. We use analytical models to account for projection effects.
Comparing polarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratio between the
strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magnetic field to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with
a preferred value of 0.8. We find that the ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field
measured on the structures. This trend becomes more striking for increasing polarization fraction
and decreasing column density. We interpret the increase of alignment with polarization fraction
as a consequence of projections effects. The decrease of alignment for high column density is not
due to a loss of correlation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. In molecular
complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field, which cannot be accounted
for by projection effects. We discuss our results in the context of models and MHD simulations, which
describe the formation of structures in the magnetized ISM.
