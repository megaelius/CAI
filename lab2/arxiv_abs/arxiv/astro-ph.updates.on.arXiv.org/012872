We present the discovery of Kepler-88 d ($P_d = 1403\pm14$ days, $M\mathrm{sin}i_d = 970\pm50\,M_\oplus
= 3.05\pm0.16\,M_J$, $e_d = 0.42\pm0.04$) based on six years of radial velocity (RV) follow-up
from the W. M. Keck Observatory HIRES spectrograph. Kepler-88 has two previously identified planets.
Kepler-88 b (KOI-142.01) transits in the NASA \Kepler\ photometry and has very large transit timing
variations. Nesvorny et al. (2013) perfomed a dynamical analysis of the TTVs to uniquely identify
the orbital period and mass of the perturbing planet (Kepler-88 c), which was later was confirmed
with RVs from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP, Barros et al. 2014). To fully explore the
architecture of this system, we performed photodynamical modeling on the Kepler photometry combined
with the RVs from Keck and OHP and stellar parameters from spectroscopy and Gaia. Planet d is not detectable
in the photometry, and long-baseline RVs are needed to ascertain its presence. A photodynamical
model simultaneously optimized to fit the RVs and Kepler photometry yields the most precise planet
masses and orbital properties yet for b and c: $P_b = 10.91647\pm0.00014\,\mathrm{days}$, $M_b=9.5\pm1.2\,M_\oplus$,
$P_c=22.2649\pm0.0007\,\mathrm{days}$, and $M_c=214.1\pm5.3\,M_\oplus$. The photodynamical
solution also finds that planets b and c have low eccentricites and low mutual inclination, are apsidally
anti-aligned, and have conjunctions on the same hemisphere of the star. Continued RV follow-up
of systems with small planets will improve our understanding of the link between inner planetary
system architectures and giant planets.
