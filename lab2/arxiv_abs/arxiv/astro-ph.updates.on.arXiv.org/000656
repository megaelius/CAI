One of the most important features in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is the variability of their emission.
Variability has been discovered at X-ray, UV, and radio frequencies on time scales from hours to
years. Among the AGN family and according to theoretical studies, Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission
Line Region (LINER) nuclei would be variable objects on long time scales. Our purpose is to investigate
spectral X-ray variability in LINERs and to understand the nature of these kinds of objects, as well
as their accretion mechanism. Chandra and XMM-Newton public archives were used to compile X-ray
spectra of seven LINER nuclei at different epochs with time scales of years. To search for variability
we fit all the spectra from the same object with a set of models, in order to identify the parameters
responsible for the variability pattern. We also analyzed the light curves in order to search for
short time scale (from hours to days) variability. Whenever possible, UV variability was also studied.
We found spectral variability in four objects, with variations mostly related to hard energies
(2-10 keV). These variations are due to changes in the soft excess, and/or changes in the absorber,
and/or intrinsic variations of the source. Another two galaxies seem not to vary. Short time scale
variations during individual observations were not found. Our analysis confirms the previously
reported anticorrelation between the X-ray spectral index and the Eddington ratio, and also the
correlation between the X-ray to UV flux ratio and the Eddington ratio. These results support an
Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) as the accretion mechanism in LINERs.
