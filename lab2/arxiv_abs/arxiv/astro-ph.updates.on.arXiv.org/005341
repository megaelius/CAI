We need to establish a correspondence between the magnetic structures generated by models and usual
stellar activity indexes to simulate radial velocity time series for stars less active than the
Sun. This is necessary to compare the outputs of such models with observed radial velocity jitters
and is critical to better understand the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet detectability.
We propose a coherent picture to describe the relationship between magnetic activity, including
the quiet Sun regions, and the chromospheric emission using the Sun as a test-bench and a reference.
We analyzed a time series of MDI magnetograms jointly with chromospheric emission time series obtained
at Sacramento Peak and Kitt Peak observatories. This has allowed us to study the variability in the
quiet Sun over the solar cycle, and then, based on available relations between magnetic fields in
active structures and chromospheric emission, to propose an empirical reconstruction of the solar
chromospheric emission based on all contributions. We show that the magnetic flux covering the
solar surface, including in the quieted regions, varies in phase with the solar cycle, suggesting
a long-term relationship between the global dynamo and the contribution of all components of solar
activity. We have been able to propose a reconstruction of the solar S-index, including a relationship
between the weak field component and its chomospheric emission, which is in good agreement with
the literature. This allows us to explain that stars with a low average chromospheric emission level
exhibit a low variability. We conclude that weak flux regions significantly contribute to the chromospheric
emission; these regions should be critical in explaining the lower variability associated with
the lower average activity level in other stars as compared to the Sun and estimated from their chromospheric
emission.
