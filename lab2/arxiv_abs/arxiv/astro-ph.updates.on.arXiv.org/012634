The rotation rates and magnetic activity of Sun-like and low-mass (< 1.4 Msun) main-sequence stars
are known to decline with time, and there now exist several models for the evolution of rotation and
activity. However, the role that chemical composition plays during stellar spin-down has not yet
been explored. In this work, we use a structural evolution code to compute the rotational evolution
of stars with three different masses (0.7, 1.0, and 1.3Msun and six different metallicities, ranging
from [Fe/H]=-1.0 to [Fe/H]=+0.5. We also implement three different wind-braking formulations
from the literature (two modern and one classical) and compare their predictions for rotational
evolution. The effect that metallicity has on stellar structural properties, and in particular
the convective turnover timescale, leads the two modern wind-braking formulations to predict
a strong dependence of the torque on metallicity. Consequently, they predict that metal rich stars
spin-down more effectively at late ages (> 1 Gyr) than metal poor stars, and the effect is large enough
to be detectable with current observing facilities. For example, the formulations predict that
a Sun-like (solar-mass and solar-aged) star with [Fe/H]=-0.3 will have a rotation period of less
than 20 days. Even though old, metal poor stars are predicted to rotate more rapidly at a given age,
they have larger Rossby numbers and are thus expected to have lower magnetic activity levels. Finally,
the different wind-braking formulations predict quantitative differences in the metallicity-dependence
of stellar rotation, which may be used to test them.
