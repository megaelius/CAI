The MIRO instrument's remote sensing capability is integral in constraining water density, temperature
and velocity fields in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gersimenko. Our aim is to quantify the contribution
to the water density from all facets inside and outside the field-of-view (FOV) of MIRO, in both,
nadir and limb geometries. This information is crucial for understanding the MIRO derived coma
production rates and their relation to the nucleus characteristics, and inherent spatial resolution
of the data. This study relies on a detailed 3D nucleus shape model, illumination conditions and
the pointing information of the viewing geometry. With these parameters, we can evaluate the relative
contribution of water density originating from facets directly inside the MIRO beam as well outside
of the beam as a function of distance along the MIRO line-of-sight. We also calculate the ratio of
in-beam versus out-of-beam number density. We demonstrate that despite the rather small MIRO field-of-view
there is only a small fraction of molecules that originate from facets within the MIRO beam. This
is true for nadir, but also translated into the limb observing geometry. The MIRO instrument cannot
discriminate active from non-active regions directly from observations. This study also suggests
that the beam averaged solar incidence angle, local time and mean normal vectors are not necessary
related to molecules within the MIRO beam. These results also illustrate why the 1D spherical Haser
model can be applied with relative success for analyzing the MIRO data (and generally any Rosetta
measurements). The future possibilities of constraining gas activity distribution on the surface
should use 3D codes extracting information from the MIRO spectral line shapes which contain additional
information. The presented results are in fact applicable to all relevant instruments onboard
Rosetta.
