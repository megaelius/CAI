Two basic routes for planetesimal formation have been proposed over the last few decades. One is
a classical "slow-growth" scenario. Another one is particle concentration models, in which small
pebbles are concentrated locally and then collapse gravitationally to form planetesimals. Both
types of models make certain predictions for the size spectrum and internal structure of newly-born
planetesimals. We use these predictions as input to simulate collisional evolution of debris discs
left after the gas dispersal. The debris disc emission as a function of a system's age computed in
these simulations is compared with several Spitzer and Herschel debris disc surveys around A-type
stars. We confirm that the observed brightness evolution for the majority of discs can be reproduced
by classical models. Further, we find that it is equally consistent with the size distribution of
planetesimals predicted by particle concentration models - provided the objects are loosely bound
"pebble piles" as these models also predict. Regardless of the assumed planetesimal formation
mechanism, explaining the brightest debris discs in the samples uncovers a "disc mass problem."
To reproduce such discs by collisional simulations, a total mass of planetesimals of up to ~1000
Earth masses is required, which exceeds the total mass of solids available in the protoplanetary
progenitors of debris discs. This may indicate that stirring was delayed in some of the bright discs,
that giant impacts occurred recently in some of them, that some systems may be younger than previously
thought, or that non-collisional processes contribute significantly to the dust production.
