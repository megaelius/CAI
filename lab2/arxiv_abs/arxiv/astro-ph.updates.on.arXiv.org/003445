Rotating radio transients (RRATs), loosely defined as objects that are discovered through only
their single pulses, are sporadic pulsars that have a wide range of emission properties. For many
of them, we must measure their periods and determine timing solutions relying on the timing of their
individual pulses, while some of the less sporadic RRATs can be timed by using folding techniques
as we do for other pulsars. Here, based on Parkes and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations, we
introduce our results on eight RRATs including their timing-derived rotation parameters, positions,
and dispersion measures (DMs), along with a comparison of the spin-down properties of RRATs and
normal pulsars. Using data for 24 RRATs, we find that their period derivatives are generally larger
than those of normal pulsars, independent of any intrinsic correlation with period, indicating
that RRATs' highly sporadic emission may be associated with intrinsically larger magnetic fields.
We carry out Lomb$-$Scargle tests to search for periodicities in RRATs' pulse detection times with
long timescales. Periodicities are detected for all targets, with significant candidates of roughly
3.4 hr for PSR J1623$-$0841 and 0.7 hr for PSR J1839$-$0141. We also analyze their single-pulse amplitude
distributions, finding that log-normal distributions provide the best fits, as is the case for
most pulsars. However, several RRATs exhibit power-law tails, as seen for pulsars emitting giant
pulses. This, along with consideration of the selection effects against the detection of weak pulses,
imply that RRAT pulses generally represent the tail of a normal intensity distribution.
