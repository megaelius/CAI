This white paper submitted for 2020 Decadal Assessment of Plasma Science concerns the importance
of multi-spacecraft missions to address fundamental questions concerning plasma turbulence.
Plasma turbulence is ubiquitous in the universe, and it is responsible for the transport of mass,
momentum, and energy in such diverse systems as the solar corona and wind, accretion discs, planet
formation, and laboratory fusion devices. Turbulence is an inherently multi-scale and multi-process
phenomenon, coupling the largest scales of a system to sub-electron scales via a cascade of energy,
while simultaneously generating reconnecting current layers, shocks, and a myriad of instabilities
and waves. The solar wind is humankind's best resource for studying the naturally occurring turbulent
plasmas that permeate the universe. Since launching our first major scientific spacecraft mission,
Explorer 1, in 1958, we have made significant progress characterizing solar wind turbulence. Yet,
due to the severe limitations imposed by single point measurements, we are unable to characterize
sufficiently the spatial and temporal properties of the solar wind, leaving many fundamental questions
about plasma turbulence unanswered. Therefore, the time has now come wherein making significant
additional progress to determine the dynamical nature of solar wind turbulence requires multi-spacecraft
missions spanning a wide range of scales simultaneously. A dedicated multi-spacecraft mission
concurrently covering a wide range of scales in the solar wind would not only allow us to directly
determine the spatial and temporal structure of plasma turbulence, but it would also mitigate the
limitations that current multi-spacecraft missions face, such as non-ideal orbits for observing
solar wind turbulence. Some of the fundamentally important questions that can only be addressed
by in situ multipoint measurements are discussed.
