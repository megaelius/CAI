Context: OB stars are important in the chemistry and evolution of the Universe, but the sample of
targets well understood from an asteroseismological point of view is still too limited to provide
feedback on the current evolutionary models. Our study extends this sample with two spectroscopic
binary systems. AIMS. Our goal is to provide orbital solutions, fundamental parameters and abundances
from disentangled high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra, as well as to analyse and interpret
the variations in the Kepler light curve of these carefully selected targets. This way we continue
our efforts to map the instability strips of beta Cep and SPB stars using the combination of high-resolution
ground-based spectroscopy and uninterrupted space-based photometry. Methods: We fit Keplerian
orbits to radial velocities measured from selected absorption lines of high-resolution spectroscopy
using synthetic composite spectra to obtain orbital solutions. We use revised masks to obtain optimal
light curves from the original pixel-data from the Kepler satellite, which provided better long
term stability compared to the pipeline processed light curves. We use various time-series analysis
tools to explore and describe the nature of variations present in the light curve. Results: We find
two eccentric double-lined spectroscopic binary systems containing a total of three main sequence
B-type stars (and one F-type component) of which at least one in each system exhibits light variations.
The light curve analysis (combined with spectroscopy) of the system of two B stars points towards
the presence of tidally excited g modes in the primary component. We interpret the variations seen
in the second system as classical g mode pulsations driven by the kappa mechanism in the B type primary,
and explain the unexpected power in the p mode region as a result of nonlinear resonant mode excitation.
