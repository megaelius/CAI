The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are hydrogen-deficient, variable stars that are most likely
the result of He-CO WD mergers. They display extremely low oxygen isotopic ratios, 16O/18O ~ 1 - 10,
12C/13C>=100, and enhancements up to 2.6dex in F and in s-process elements from Zn to La, compared
to solar. These abundances provide stringent constraints on the physical processes during and
after the double-degenerate merger. As shown before O-isotopic ratios observed in RCB stars cannot
result from the dynamic double-degenerate merger phase, and we investigate now the role of the long-term
1D spherical post-merger evolution and nucleosynthesis based on realistic hydrodynamic merger
progenitor models. We adopt a model for extra envelope mixing to represent processes driven by rotation
originating in the dynamical merger. Comprehensive nucleosynthesis post-processing simulations
for these stellar evolution models reproduce, for the first time, the full range of the observed
abundances for almost all the elements measured in RCB stars: 16O/18O ratios between 9 and 15, C-isotopic
ratios above 100, and ~1.4 - 2.35dex F enhancements, along with enrichments in s-process elements.
The nucleosynthesis processes in our models constrain the length and temperature in the dynamic
merger shell-of-fire feature as well as the envelope mixing in the post-merger phase. s-process
elements originate either in the shell-of-fire merger feature or during the post-merger evolution,
but the contribution from the AGB progenitors is negligible. The post-merger envelope mixing must
eventually cease ~ 10^6yr after the dynamic merger phase, before the star enters the RCB phase.
