The on-going phase mixing in the vertical direction of the Galactic disk has been discovered with
the revolutionary Gaia DR2 data. It manifests itself as the snail shell in the $Z-V_{Z}$ phase space.
To better understand the origin and properties of the phase mixing process, we study the phase-mixing
signatures in moving groups (also known as the kinematic streams) with the Gaia DR2 data in the Galactic
disk near the Solar circle. Interestingly, the phase space snail shell exists only in the main kinematic
streams with $|V_{R}| \lesssim 50$ km/s and $|V_{\phi} - V_{\rm LSR}| \lesssim 30$ km/s, i.e., stars
on dynamically ``colder'' orbits. No snail shell is discernible for stars on hotter orbits. Thus
one should pay closer attention to the colder orbits in future phase mixing studies. We also confirm
that the Hercules stream has two branches (at fast and slow $V_{\phi}$), which may not be explained
by a single mechanism, since the phase space snail shell is only seen in the fast branch, but not in
the slow one. Compared to the colder orbits, the hotter orbits may have phase-wrapped away already
due to the much larger dynamical range in radial variation to facilitate faster phase mixing. These
results help put tighter constraints on the vertical perturbation history of the Milky Way disk.
To explain the lack of a well-defined snail shell in the hotter orbits, the disk should be perturbed
at least $\sim 400-500$ Myr ago. Our results offer more support to the external perturbation scenario
than the internal bar buckling perturbation scenario as the origin of the phase space mixing. The
more prominent snail shell in the $V_{\phi}$ color-coded phase space is due partly to the fact that
only the colder orbits exhibit the phase space spiral, with the featureless distribution of the
hotter orbits providing a contrasting background.
