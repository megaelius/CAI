It has recently been proposed that global or local turbulence models can be used to simulate core-collapse
supernova explosions in spherical symmetry (1D) more consistently than with traditional approaches
for parameterised 1D models. However, a closer analysis of the proposed schemes reveals important
consistency problems. Most notably, they systematically violate energy conservation as they
do not balance buoyant energy generation with terms that reduce potential energy, thus failing
to account for the physical source of energy that buoyant convection feeds on. We also point out other
non-trivial consistency requirements for viable turbulence models. The model of Kuhfuss (1986)
proves more consistent than the newly proposed approaches for supernovae, but still cannot account
naturally for all the relevant physics for predicting explosion properties. We perform numerical
simulations for a $20 M_\odot$ progenitor to further illustrate problems of 1D turbulence models.
If the buoyant driving term is formulated in a conservative manner, the explosion energy of $\mathord{\sim}2\times
10^{51}\, \mathrm{erg}$ for the corresponding non-conservative turbulence model is reduced
to $<10^{48}\,\mathrm{erg}$ even though the shock expands continuously. This demonstrates that
the conservation problem cannot be ignored. Although plausible energies can be reached using an
energy-conserving model when turbulent viscosity is included, it is doubtful whether the energy
budget of the explosion is regulated by the same mechanism as in multi-dimensional models. We conclude
that 1D turbulence models based on a spherical Reynolds decomposition cannot provide a more consistent
approach to supernova explosion and remnant properties than other phenomenological approaches
before some fundamental problems are addressed.
