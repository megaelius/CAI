Changing-look quasars are a recently identified class of active galaxies in which the strong UV
continuum and/or broad optical hydrogen emission lines associated with unobscured quasars either
appear or disappear on timescales of months to years. The physical processes responsible for this
behaviour are still debated, but changes in the black hole accretion rate or accretion disk structure
appear more likely than changes in obscuration. Here we report on four epochs of spectroscopy of
SDSS J110057.70-005304.5, a quasar at a redshift of $z=0.378$ whose UV continuum and broad hydrogen
emission lines have faded, and then returned over the past $\approx$20 years. The change in this
quasar was initially identified in the infrared, and an archival spectrum from 2010 shows an intermediate
phase of the transition during which the flux below rest-frame $\approx$3400\AA\ has decreased
by close to an order of magnitude. This combination is unique compared to previously published examples
of changing-look quasars, and is best explained by dramatic changes in the innermost regions of
the accretion disk. The optical continuum has been rising since mid-2016, leading to a prediction
of a rise in hydrogen emission line flux in the next year. Increases in the infrared flux are beginning
to follow, delayed by a $\sim$3 year observed timescale. If our model is confirmed, the physics of
changing-look quasars are governed by processes at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
around the black hole, and the structure of the innermost disk. The easily identifiable and monitored
changing-look quasars would then provide a new probe and laboratory of the nuclear central engine.
