Magnetic flux emergence has been shown to be a key mechanism for unleashing a wide variety of solar
phenomena. However, there are still open questions concerning the rise of the magnetized plasma
through the atmosphere, mainly in the chromosphere, where the plasma departs from local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) and is partially ionized. We aim to investigate the impact of the nonequilibrium
(NEQ) ionization and recombination and molecule formation of hydrogen, as well as ambipolar diffusion,
on the dynamics and thermodynamics of the flux emergence process. Using the Bifrost code, we performed
2.5D numerical experiments of magnetic flux emergence from the convection zone up to the corona.
The experiments include the NEQ ionization and recombination of atomic hydrogen, the NEQ formation
and dissociation of H2 molecules, and the ambipolar diffusion term of the Generalized Ohm's Law.
Our experiments show that the LTE assumption substantially underestimates the ionization fraction
in most of the emerged region, leading to an artificial increase in the ambipolar diffusion and,
therefore, in the heating and temperatures as compared to those found when taking the NEQ effects
on the hydrogen ion population into account. We see that LTE also overestimates the number density
of H2 molecules within the emerged region, thus mistakenly magnifying the exothermic contribution
of the H2 molecule formation to the thermal energy during the flux emergence process. We find that
the ambipolar diffusion does not significantly affect the amount of total unsigned emerged magnetic
flux, but it is important in the shocks that cross the emerged region, heating the plasma on characteristic
times ranging from 0.1 to 100 s. We also briefly discuss the importance of including elements heavier
than hydrogen in the equation of state so as not to overestimate the role of ambipolar diffusion in
the atmosphere.
