We investigate the intra-cluster light (ICL) in the 6 Hubble Frontier Field clusters at $0.3<z<0.6$.
We employ a new method, which is free from any functional form of the ICL profile, and exploit the unprecedented
depth of this Hubble Space Telescope imaging to map the ICL's diffuse light out to clustrocentric
radii $R\sim300$kpc ($\mu_{\rm ICL}\sim27$mag arcsec$^{-2}$). From these maps, we construct
radial color and stellar mass profiles via SED fitting and find clear negative color gradients in
all systems with increasing distance from the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). While this implies
older/more metal rich stellar components in the inner part of the ICL, we find the ICL mostly consists
of a $<2$Gyr population, and plausibly originated with $\log M_*/M_\odot<10$ cluster galaxies.
Further, we find 10-15% of the ICL's mass at large radii ($>150$kpc) lies in a younger/bluer stellar
population ($\sim1$Gyr), a phenomenon not seen in local samples. We attribute this light to the
higher fraction of starforming/(post-)starburst galaxies in clusters at $z\sim0.5$. Ultimately,
we find the ICL's total mass to be $\log M_{\rm *}^{\rm ICL}/M_\odot\sim11$-12, constituting 5%-20%
of the clusters' total stellar mass, or about a half of the value at $z\sim0$. The above implies distinct
formation histories for the ICL and BCGs/other massive cluster galaxies; i.e. the ICL at this epoch
is still being constructed rapidly ($\sim40M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$), while the BCGs have mostly completed
their evolution. To be consistent with the ICL measurements of local massive clusters, such as the
Virgo, our data suggest mass acquisition mainly from quiescent cluster galaxies is the principal
source of ICL material in the subsequent $\sim$5 Gyr of cosmic time.
