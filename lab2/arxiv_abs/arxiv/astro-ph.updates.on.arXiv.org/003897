Aims: To reveal the morphology, chemical composition, kinematics and to establish the main processes
prevalent in the gas at the foot points of the giant molecular loops (GMLs) in the Galactic center
region Methods: Using the 22-m Mopra telescope, we mapped the M$-3.8+0.9$ molecular cloud, placed
at the foot points of a giant molecular loop, in 3-mm range molecular lines. To derive the molecular
hydrogen column density, we also observed the $^{13}$CO $(2-1)$ line at 1 mm using the 12-m APEX telescope.
From the 3 mm observations 12 molecular species were detected, namely HCO$^+$, HCN, H$^{13}$CN,
HNC, SiO, CS, CH$_3$OH, N$_2$H$^+$, SO, HNCO, OCS, and HC$_3$N. Results: Maps revealing the morphology
and kinematics of the M$-3.8+0.9$ molecular cloud in different molecules are presented. We identified
six main molecular complexes. We derive fractional abundances in 11 selected positions of the different
molecules assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium. Conclusions: Most of the fractional abundances
derived for the M$-3.8+0.9$ molecular cloud are very similar over the whole cloud. However, the
fractional abundances of some molecules show significant difference with respect to those measured
in the central molecular zone (CMZ). The abundances of the shock tracer SiO are very similar between
the GMLs and the CMZ. The methanol emission is the most abundant specie in the GMLs. This indicates
that the gas is likely affected by moderate $\sim $ 30 km s$^{-1}$ or even high velocity (50 km s$^{-1}$)
shocks, consistent with the line profile observed toward one of the studied position. The origin
of the shocks is likely related to the flow of the gas throughout the GMLs towards the foot points.
