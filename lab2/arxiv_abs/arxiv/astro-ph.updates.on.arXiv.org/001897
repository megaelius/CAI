We present the first results from our NASA Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorbers toward
Quasars (KODIAQ) survey which aims to characterize the properties of the highly ionized gas of high
redshift galaxies and their circumgalactic medium (CGM) at 2<z<4. We select absorbers optically
thick at the Lyman limit ({\tau}LL > 1, log N(HI) > 17.3) as probes of these galaxies and their
CGM where both transitions of the O VI doublet have little contamination from the Ly {\alpha}, {\beta}
forests. We found 20 absorbers that satisfy these rules: 7 Lyman limit systems (LLSs), 8 super-LLSs
(SLLSs) and 5 damped Ly{\alpha} (DLAs). The O VI detection rate is 100% for the DLAs, 71% for the LLSs,
and 63% for the SLLSs. When O VI is detected, log N(OVI)=14.9+/-0.3, an average O VI column density
substantially larger and with a smaller dispersion than found in blind O VI surveys at similar redshifts.
Strong O VI absorption is therefore nearly ubiquitous in the CGM of z~2-3 galaxies. The total velocity
widths of the O VI profiles are also large (200<Dv(OVI)<400 km/s). These properties are quite
similar to those seen for O VI in low z star-forming galaxies, and therefore we hypothesize that these
strong CGM O VI absorbers (with {\tau}LL > 1) at 2<z<3.5 also probe outflows of star-forming
galaxies. The LLSs and SLLSs with no O VI absorption have properties consistent with those seen in
cosmological simulations tracing cold streams feeding galaxies. When the highly ionized (Si IV
and O VI) gas is taken into account, we determine that the {\tau}LL > 1 absorbers could contain
as much as 3-14% of the cosmic baryon budget at z~2-3, only second to the Ly{\alpha} forest. We conservatively
show that 5-20% of the metals ever produced at z~2-3 are in form of highly ionized metals ejected in
the CGM of galaxies.
