The characterization of rocky, Earth-like planets is an important goal for future large ground-
and space-based telescopes. In support of developing an efficient observational strategy, we
have applied Bayesian statistical inference to interpret the albedo spectrum of cloudy true-Earth
analogs that include a diverse spread in their atmospheric water vapor mixing ratios. We focus on
detecting water-bearing worlds by characterizing their atmospheric water vapor content via the
strong 0.94$\,\mu$m H$_2$O absorption feature, with several observational configurations.
Water vapor is an essential signpost when assessing planetary habitability, and determining its
presence is important in vetting whether planets are suitable for hosting life. We find that R=140
spectroscopy of the absorption feature combined with a same-phase green optical photometric point
at $0.525-0.575\,\mu$m is capable of distinguishing worlds with less than $0.1\times$ Earth-like
water vapor levels from worlds with $1\times$ Earth-like levels or greater at a signal-to-noise
ratio of 5 or better with $2\sigma$ confidence. This configuration can differentiate between $0.01\times$
and $0.1\times$ Earth-like levels when the signal-to-noise ratio is 10 or better at the same confidence.
However, strong constraints on the water vapor mixing ratio remained elusive with this configuration
even at signal-to-noise of 15. We find that adding the same-phase optical photometric point does
not significantly help characterize the H$_2$O mixing ratio, but does enable an upper limit on atmospheric
ozone levels. Finally, we find that a 0.94$\,\mu$m photometric point, instead of spectroscopy,
combined with the green-optical point, fails to produce meaningful information about atmospheric
water content.
