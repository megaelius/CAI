The coronagraphic instrument (CGI) on the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will
demonstrate technologies and methods for high-contrast direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanet
systems in reflected light, including polarimetry of circumstellar disks. The WFIRST management
and CGI engineering and science investigation teams have developed requirements for the instrument,
motivated by the objectives and technology development needs of potential future flagship exoplanet
characterization missions such as the NASA Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx) and the
Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR). The requirements have been refined to support recommendations
from the WFIRST Independent External Technical/Management/Cost Review (WIETR) that the WFIRST
CGI be classified as a technology demonstration instrument instead of a science instrument. This
paper provides a description of how the CGI requirements flow from the top of the overall WFIRST mission
structure through the Level 2 requirements, where the focus here is on capturing the detailed context
and rationales for the CGI Level 2 requirements. The WFIRST requirements flow starts with the top
Program Level Requirements Appendix (PLRA), which contains both high-level mission objectives
as well as the CGI-specific baseline technical and data requirements (BTR and BDR, respectively)...
We also present the process and collaborative tools used in the L2 requirements development and
management, including the collection and organization of science inputs, an open-source approach
to managing the requirements database, and automating documentation. The tools created for the
CGI L2 requirements have the potential to improve the design and planning of other projects, streamlining
requirement management and maintenance. [Abstract Abbreviated]
