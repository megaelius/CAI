We report our SMA observations of the Class \RN{1}-\RN{2} protostar HL Tau in the $^{13}$CO (2--1),
C$^{18}$O (2--1), SO(5$_6$--4$_5$), and the 1.3 mm dust-continuum emission and our analyses of
the ALMA long baseline data of the HCO$^{+}$ (1--0) emission. The 1.3 mm continuum emission observed
with the SMA shows compact ($\sim$0$\farcs$8 $\times$ 0$\farcs$5) and extended ($\sim$6$\farcs$5
$\times$ 4$\farcs$3) components, tracing the protoplanetary disk and the protostellar envelope,
respectively. The $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and HCO$^+$ show a compact ($\sim$ 200 AU) component at
velocities higher than 3 km s$^{-1}$ from the systemic velocity and an extended ($\sim$ 1000 AU)
component at the lower velocities. The high-velocity component traces the Keplerian rotating
disk, and the low-velocity component traces the infalling envelope. The HCO$^+$ high-velocity
component is fitted with a Keplerian disk model with a central stellar mass of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The
radial intensity profiles of the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O along the disk major axis are fitted with
a disk+envelope model, and the gas masses of the disk and envelope are estimated to be $2\mbox{--}40\times10^{-4}$
$M_{\odot}$ and $2.9\times10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The disk dust mass has been estimated
to be $1\mbox{--}3 \times 10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$ in the literature. Thus, our estimated disk gas
mass suggests that the gas-to-dust mass ratio in the disk is $<$10, a factor of ten lower than the estimated
ratio in the envelope. We discuss the possible gas depletion or CO depletion in the planet-forming
candidate HL Tau in the context of disk and envelope evolution.
