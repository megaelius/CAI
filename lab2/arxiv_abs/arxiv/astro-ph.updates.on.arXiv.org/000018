We investigate guide-field magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in relativistic
pair plasmas with three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of a kinetic-scale current
sheet in a periodic geometry at low magnetizations. The tearing instability is the dominant mode
in the current sheet for all guide field strengths, while the linear kink mode is less important even
without guide field. Oblique modes seem to be suppressed entirely. In its nonlinear evolution,
the reconnection layer develops a network of interconnected and interacting magnetic flux ropes.
As smaller flux ropes merge into larger ones, the reconnection layer evolves toward a three-dimensional,
disordered state in which the resulting flux rope segments contain magnetic substructure on plasma
skin depth scales. Embedded in the flux ropes, we detect spatially and temporally intermittent
sites of dissipation reflected in peaks in the parallel electric field. Magnetic dissipation and
particle acceleration persist until the end of the simulations, with simulations with higher magnetization
and lower guide field strength exhibiting greater and faster energy conversion and particle energization.
At the end of our largest simulation, the particle energy spectrum attains a tail extending to high
Lorentz factors that is best modeled with a combination of two additional thermal components. We
confirm that the primary energization mechanism is acceleration by the electric field in the X-line
region. We discuss the implications of our results for macroscopic reconnection sites, and which
of our results may be expected to hold in systems with higher magnetizations.
