We carried out new $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0, 3-2) observations of a N63A supernova remnant (SNR) from
the LMC using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Atacama Submillimeter
Telescope Experiment. We find three giant molecular clouds toward the northeast, east, and near
the center of the SNR. Using the ALMA data, we spatially resolved clumpy molecular clouds embedded
within the optical nebulae in both the shock-ionized and photoionized lobes discovered by previous
H$\alpha$ and [S II] observations. The total mass of the molecular clouds is $\sim$700 $M_{\odot}$
for the shock-ionized region and $\sim$1500 $M_{\odot}$ for the photoionized region. Spatially
resolved X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the absorbing column densities toward the molecular
clouds are $\sim$1.5-$5.3 \times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, which are $\sim$2-20 times less than the
averaged interstellar proton column densities for each region. This means that the X-rays are produced
not only behind the molecular clouds, but also in front of the clouds. We conclude that the dense molecular
clouds have been completely engulfed by the shock waves, but have still survived erosion owing to
their high-density and short interacting time. The X-ray spectrum toward the gas clumps is well
explained by an absorbed power-law or high-temperature plasma models in addition to the thermal
plasma components, implying that the shock-cloud interaction is efficiently working for both
the cases. If the hadronic gamma-ray is dominant in the GeV band, the total energy of cosmic-ray protons
is calculated to be $\sim$0.3-$1.4 \times 10^{49}$ erg with the estimated ISM proton density of
$\sim$$190 \pm 90$ cm$^{-3}$, containing both the shock-ionized gas and neutral atomic hydrogen.
