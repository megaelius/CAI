The Lense-Thirring effect from spinning neutron stars in double neutron star binaries contribute
to the periastron advance of the orbit. This extra term involves the moment of inertia of the neutron
stars. Moment of inertia, on the other hand, depends on the mass and spin of the neutron star as well
as the equation of state of the matter. If at least one member of the double neutron star binary (better
the faster one) is a radio pulsar, then accurate timing analysis might lead to the estimation of the
contribution of the Lense-Thirring effect to the periastron advance, which will lead to the measurement
of the moment of inertia of the pulsar. Combination of the knowledge on the values of the moment of
inertia, the mass, and the spin of the pulsar, will give a new constraint on the equation of state.
Pulsars in double neutron star binaries are the best for this purpose as short orbits and moderately
high eccentricities make the Lense-Thirring effect substantial, whereas tidal effects are negligible
(unlike pulsars with main sequence or white-dwarf binaries). The most promising pulsars are PSR
J0737-3039A and PSR J1757-1854. The spin-precession of pulsars due to the misalignment between
the spin and the orbital angular momentum vectors affect the contribution of the Lense-Thirring
effect to the periastron advance. This effect has been explored for both PSR J0737-3039A and PSR
J1757-1854, and as the misalignment angles for both of these pulsars are small, the variation in
the Lense-Thirring term is not much. However, to extract the Lense-Thirring effect from the observed
rate of the periastron advance, more accurate timing solutions including precise proper motion
and distance measurements are essential.
