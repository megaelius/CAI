(Abridged) Noise considerations for experiments that aim to statistically estimate the 21 cm signal
from high redshift neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) using interferometric
data are typically computed assuming a tracked observation, where the telescope pointing centre
and instrument phase centre are the same over the observation. Current low frequency interferometers
use aperture arrays of fixed dipoles, which are steered electronically on the sky, and have different
properties to mechanically-steered single apertures, such as reduced sensitivity away from zenith,
and discrete pointing positions on the sky. Use of two additional observing modes is encouraged:
(1) zenith drift, where the pointing centre remains fixed at the zenith, and the phase centre tracks
the sky, and (2) drift+shift, where the telescope uses discrete pointing centres, and the sky drifts
during each pointing. The coherence of measurements in these modes dictates the optimal reduction
in thermal noise by combination of coherent modes, and the reduction in cosmic variance by combination
of incoherent modes (views of different patches of the sky). The balance between these noise components
provides one measure for the utility of these three modes for measuring a statistical EoR signature.
We provide a general framework for estimating the uncertainty in the power spectrum for a given observing
mode, telescope beam shape, and antenna distribution. We apply this framework to the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) using an analysis of the 2D and 1D power spectra for 900 hours of observing.
We demonstrate that zenith drift scans can yield marginally lower uncertainty in the signal power
compared with tracked scans for the MWA EoR experiment.
