Standard cosmology predicts that prior to matter-radiation equality about 41% of the energy density
was in free-streaming neutrinos. In many beyond Standard Model scenarios, however, the amount
and free-streaming nature of this component is modified. For example, this occurs in models with
new neutrino self-interactions or an additional dark sector with interacting light particles.
We consider several extensions of the standard cosmology that include a non-free-streaming radiation
component as motivated by such particle physics models and use the final Planck data release to constrain
them. This release contains significant improvements in the polarization likelihood which plays
an important role in distinguishing free-streaming from interacting radiation species. Fixing
the total amount of energy in radiation to match the expectation from standard neutrino decoupling
we find that the fraction of free-streaming radiation must be $f_\mathrm{fs} > 0.8$ at 95% CL (combining
temperature, polarization and baryon acoustic oscillation data). Allowing for arbitrary contributions
of free-streaming and interacting radiation, the effective number of new non-free-streaming
degrees of freedom is constrained to be $N_\mathrm{fld} < 0.6$ at 95% CL. Cosmologies with additional
radiation are also known to ease the discrepancy between the local measurement and CMB inference
of the current expansion rate $H_0$. We show that including a non-free-streaming radiation component
allows for a larger amount of total energy density in radiation, leading to a mild improvement of
the fit to cosmological data compared to previously discussed models with only a free-streaming
component.
