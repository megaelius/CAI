The thermally pulsing phase on the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) is the last nuclear burning
phase experienced by most of low and intermediate mass stars. During this phase, the outer chemical
stratification above the C/O core of the emerging white dwarf is built up. The chemical structure
resulting from progenitor evolution strongly impacts the whole pulsation spectrum exhibited
by ZZ Ceti stars, which are pulsating C/O core white dwarfs located on an narrow instability strip
at T eff \sim 12000 K. Several physical processes occurring during progenitor evolution strongly
affect the chemical structure of these stars, being those found during the TP-AGB phase ones of the
most relevant for the pulsational properties of ZZ Ceti stars. We present a study of the impact of
the chemical structure built up during the TP-AGB evolution on the stellar parameters inferred
from asteroseismological fits of ZZ Ceti stars. Our analysis is based on a set of carbon-oxygen core
white dwarf models with masses from 0.534 to 0.6463M_{\odot} derived from full evolutionary computations
from the ZAMS to the ZZ Ceti domain. We compute evolutionary sequences that experience different
number of thermal pulses. We find that the occurrence or not of thermal pulses during AGB evolution
implies an average deviation in the astero- seimological effective temperature of ZZ Ceti stars
of at most 8% and of the order of < 5% in the stellar mass. For the mass of the hydrogen envelope, however,
we find deviations up to 2 orders of magnitude in the case of cool ZZ Ceti stars. For hot and intermediate
temperature ZZ Ceti stars shows no differences in the hydrogen envelope mass in most cases. Our results
show that, in general, the impact of the occurrence or not of thermal pulses in the progenitor stars
is not negligible and must be taken into account in asteroseismological studies of ZZ Ceti stars.
