Using a Wigner-Seitz approximation with spherical cells, we re-analyze a widely used single nucleus
model of accreting neutron star crust. We calculate beta disequilibrium within the crust, which
is sizable, and implies that neutron and baryon chemical potentials, $\mu_n$ and $\mu_{\rm b}$,
are not equal. We include also non-equilibrium reactions, driven by matter compression, and proceeding
in the reaction layers. The constancy of $e^{\Phi}\mu_n$, where the spacetime metric component
$g_{00}=e^{2\Phi}$, in the shells between the reaction layers is not applicable, because single
electron captures are blocked, so that the neutron fraction is fixed, and therefore neutrons are
not an independent component of the crust matter. The absence of neutron diffusion in the shells
between the reaction layers, stems from the constancy of the neutron fraction (concentration)
in these shells. In the reaction layers, the outward force resulting from neutron fraction gradient
is balanced by the inward gravitational force acting on unbound neutrons. Neglecting the thickness
of the reaction layers compared to the shell thickness, we obtain condition $e^{\Phi(r)}f_Q(r)g(r)=$constant,
where $g$ is Gibbs energy per nucleon, undergoing discontinuous drops on the reaction surfaces,
and $f_Q(r)g(r)={\widetilde{g}}(r)$ is a continuous function, due to the factor $f_Q(r)$ canceling
the discontinuities (drops) in $g(r)$. The function $f_Q(r)$ is calculated using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov
equations from $f_Q(P)$ and $g(P)$ obtained from the equation of state (EOS) with discontinuites.
The constancy of of $e^{\Phi(r)}{\widetilde{g}}(r)$ is an extension of the standard relation
$e^{\Phi(r)}{{\mu}}_{\rm b}(r)=$constant, valid in hydrostatic equilibrium for catalyzed
crust.
