The sky distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been intensively studied by various groups
for more than two decades. Most of these studies test the isotropy of GRBs based on their sky number
density distribution. In this work we propose an approach to test the isotropy of the Universe through
inspecting the isotropy of the properties of GRBs such as their duration, fluences and peak fluxes
at various energy bands and different time scales. We apply this method on the {\em Fermi} / Gamma-ray
Burst Monitor (GBM) data sample containing 1591 GRBs. The most noticeable feature we found is near
the Galactic coordinates $l\approx 30^\circ$, $b\approx 15^\circ$ and radius $r\approx 20^\circ-40^\circ$.
The inferred probability for the occurrence of such an anisotropic signal (in a random isotropic
sample) is derived to be less than a percent in some of the tests while the other tests give results
consistent with isotropy. These are based on the comparison of the results from the real data with
the randomly shuffled data samples. Considering large number of statistics we used in this work
(which some of them are correlated to each other) we can anticipate that the detected feature could
be result of statistical fluctuations. Moreover, we noticed a considerably low number of GRBs in
this particular patch which might be due to some instrumentation or observational effects that
can consequently affect our statistics through some systematics. Further investigation is highly
desirable in order clarify about this result, e.g. utilizing a larger future {\em Fermi} / GBM data
sample as well as data samples of other GRB missions and also looking for possible systematics.
