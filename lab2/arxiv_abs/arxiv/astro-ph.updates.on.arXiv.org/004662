In recent years, a number of numerical studies have been focusing on the significance of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI) in the dynamics of oscillating coronal loops. This process enhances the transfer
of energy into smaller scales, and has been connected with heating of coronal loops, when dissipation
mechanisms, such as resistivity, are considered. However, the turbulent layer is expected near
the outer regions of the loops. Therefore, the effects of wave heating are expected to be confined
to the loop's external layers, leaving their denser inner parts without a heating mechanism. In
the current work we aim to study the spatial evolution of wave heating effects from a footpoint driven
standing kink wave in a coronal loop. Using the MPI-AMRVAC code, we performed ideal, three dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of footpoint driven transverse oscillations of a cold, straight
coronal flux tube, embedded in a hotter environment. We have also constructed forward models for
our simulation using the FoMo code. The developed Transverse Wave Induced Kelvin-Helmholtz (TWIKH)
rolls expand throughout the tube cross-section, and cover it entirely. This turbulence significantly
alters the initial density profile, leading to a fully deformed cross section. As a consequence,
the resistive and viscous heating rate both increase over the entire loop cross section. The resistive
heating rate takes its maximum values near the footpoints, while the viscous heating rate at the
apex. We conclude that even a monoperiodic driver can spread wave heating over the whole loop cross
section, potentially providing a heating source in the inner loop region. Despite the loop's fully
deformed structure, forward modelling still shows the structure appearing as a loop.
