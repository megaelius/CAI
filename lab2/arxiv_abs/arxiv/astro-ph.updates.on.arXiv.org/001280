Convergent migration allows pairs of planet to become trapped into mean motion resonances. Once
in resonance, the planets' eccentricities grow to an equilibrium value that depends on the ratio
of migration time scale to the eccentricity damping timescale, $K=\tau_a/\tau_e$, with higher
values of equilibrium eccentricity for lower values of $K$. For low equilibrium eccentricities,
$e_{eq}\propto K^{-1/2}$. The stability of a planet pair depends on eccentricity so the system
can become unstable before it reaches its equilibrium eccentricity. Using a resonant overlap criterion
that takes into account the role of first and second order resonances and depends on eccentricity,
we find a function $K_{min}(\mu_p, j)$ that defines the lowest value for $K$, as a function of the
ratio of total planet mass to stellar mass ($\mu_p$) and the period ratio of the resonance defined
as $P_1/P_2=j/(j+k)$, that allows two convergently migrating planets to remain stable in resonance
at their equilibrium eccentricities. We scaled the functions $K_{min}$ for each resonance of the
same order into a single function $K_c$. The function $K_{c}$ for planet pairs in first order resonances
is linear with increasing planet mass and quadratic for pairs in second order resonances with a coefficient
depending on the relative migration rate and strongly on the planet to planet mass ratio. The linear
relation continues until the mass approaches a critical mass defined by the 2/7 resonance overlap
instability law and $K_c \to \infty$. We compared our analytic boundary with an observed sample
of resonant two planet systems. All but one of the first order resonant planet pair systems found
by radial velocity measurements are well inside the stability region estimated by this model. We
calculated $K_c$ for Kepler systems without well-constrained eccentricities and found only weak
constraints on $K$.
