We suggest that fast-rising blue optical transients (FBOTs) and the brightest event of the class
AT2018cow result from an electron-capture collapse to a \NS\ following a merger of a massive ONeMg
white dwarf (WD) with another WD. Two distinct evolutionary channels lead to the disruption of the
less massive WD during the merger and the formation of a shell burning non-degenerate star incorporating
the ONeMg core. During the shell burning stage a large fraction of the envelope is lost to the wind,
while mass and angular momentum are added to the core. As a result, the electron-capture collapse
occurs with a small envelope mass, after $\sim 10^2-10^4$ years. During the formation of a neutron
star as little as $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot $ of the material is ejected at the bounce-off with mildly
relativistic velocities and total energy $\sim$ few $ 10^{50}$ ergs. This ejecta becomes optically
thin on a time scale of days - this is the FBOT. During the collapse, the neutron star is spun up and magnetic
field is amplified. The ensuing fast magnetically-dominated relativistic wind from the newly
formed neutron star shocks against the ejecta, and later against the wind. The radiation-dominated
forward shock produces the long-lasting optical afterglow, while the termination shock of the
relativistic wind produces the high energy emission in a manner similar to Pulsar Wind Nebulae.
If the secondary WD was of the DA type, the wind will likely have $\sim 10^{-4} M_\odot$ of hydrogen;
this explains the appearance of hydrogen late in the afterglow spectrum. The model explains many
of the puzzling properties of FBOTs/AT2018cow: host galaxies, a fast and light anisotropic ejecta
producing a bright optical peak, afterglow high energy emission of similar luminosity to the optical,
and late infra-red features.
