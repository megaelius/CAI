New space missions (e.g., NASA-TESS and ESA-PLATO) will perform an analysis of bright stars in large
fields of the celestial sphere searching for extraterrestrial planets. Asteroseismic observations
will search for exoplanet-hosting stars with solar-like oscillations. In order to achieve all
the goals, a full characterization of the stellar objects is important. However, accurate atmospheric
parameters are available for less than 30% of bright dwarf stars of the solar neighborhood. In this
study we observed high-resolution (R = 60,000) spectra for all bright (V < 8 mag) and cooler than F5
spectral class dwarf stars in the northern-most field of the celestial sphere with radius of 20{\deg}
from the {\alpha}(2000) = 161$^\circ$03 and {\delta}(2000) = 86$^\circ$60 that is a center of one
of the preliminary ESO-PLATO fields. Spectroscopic atmospheric parameters were determined for
140 slowly rotating stars, for 73% of them for the first time. The majority (83%) of the investigated
stars are in the TESS object lists and all of them are in the preliminary PLATO field. Our results have
no systematic differences when compared with other recent studies. Comparing our results for 39
stars with previous high-resolution spectral determinations, we find only a 7 $\pm$ 73 K difference
in effective temperatures, 0.02 $\pm$ 0.09 in log g, and -0.02 $\pm$ 0.09 dex in metallicities. We
also determined basic kinematic and orbital parameters for this sample of stars. From the kinematical
point of view, almost all our stars belong to the thin disk substructure of the Milky Way. The derived
galactocentric metallicity gradient is -0.066 $\pm$ 0.024 dex/kpc (2.5{\sigma} significance)
and the vertical metallicity gradient is -0.102 $\pm$ 0.099 dex/kpc (1{\sigma} significance)
that comply with the latest inside-out thin disk formation models, including those with stellar
migration taken into account.
