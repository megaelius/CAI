Rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of massive stars, affecting their evolution, chemical
yields, ionizing photon budget, and final fate. We determined the projected rotational velocity,
$v_e\sin i$, of $\sim$330 O-type objects, i.e. $\sim$210 spectroscopic single stars and $\sim$110
primaries in binary systems, in the Tarantula nebula or 30 Doradus (30\,Dor) region. The observations
were taken using VLT/FLAMES and constitute the largest homogeneous dataset of multi-epoch spectroscopy
of O-type stars currently available. The most distinctive feature of the $v_e\sin i$ distributions
of the presumed-single stars and primaries in 30 Dor is a low-velocity peak at around 100\,$\rm{km
s^{-1}}$. Stellar winds are not expected to have spun-down the bulk of the stars significantly since
their arrival on the main sequence and therefore the peak in the single star sample is likely to represent
the outcome of the formation process. Whereas the spin distribution of presumed-single stars shows
a well developed tail of stars rotating more rapidly than 300\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$, the sample of primaries
does not feature such a high-velocity tail. The tail of the presumed-single star distribution is
attributed for the most part -- and could potentially be completely due -- to spun-up binary products
that appear as single stars or that have merged. This would be consistent with the lack of such post-interaction
products in the binary sample, that is expected to be dominated by pre-interaction systems. The
peak in this distribution is broader and is shifted toward somewhat higher spin rates compared to
the distribution of presumed-single stars. Systems displaying large radial velocity variations,
typical for short period systems, appear mostly responsible for these differences.
