We present a comprehensive dataset of optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of
type~Ia supernova (SN) 2016hnk, combined with integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of its host galaxy,
MCG -01-06-070, and nearby environment. Properties of the SN local environment are characterized
by means of single stellar population synthesis applied to IFS observations taken two years after
the SN exploded. SN~2016hnk spectra are compared to other 1991bg-like SNe Ia, 2002es-like SNe Ia,
and Ca-rich transients. In addition, abundance stratification modelling is used to identify the
various spectral features in the early phase spectral sequence and the dataset is also compared
to a modified non-LTE model previously produced for the sublumnious SN~1999by. SN 2016hnk is consistent
with being a sub-luminous (M$_{\rm B}=-16.7$ mag, s$_{\rm BV}$=0.43$\pm$0.03), highly reddened
object. IFS of its host galaxy reveals both a significant amount of dust at the SN location, as well
as residual star formation and a high proportion of old stellar populations in the local environment
compared to other locations in the galaxy, which favours an old progenitor for SN 2016hnk. Inspection
of a nebular spectrum obtained one year after maximum contains two narrow emission lines attributed
to the forbidden [Ca II] $\lambda\lambda$7291,7324 doublet with a Doppler shift of 700 km s$^{-1}$.
Based on various observational diagnostics, we argue that the progenitor of SN 2016hnk was likely
a near Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$) carbon-oxygen white dwarf that produced 0.108 $M_\odot$
of $^{56}$Ni. Our modeling suggests that the narrow [Ca II] features observed in the nebular spectrum
are associated with $^{48}$Ca from electron capture during the explosion, which is expected to
occur only in white dwarfs that explode near or at the $M_{\rm Ch}$ limit.
