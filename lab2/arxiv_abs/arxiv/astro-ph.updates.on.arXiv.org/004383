We argue that if ultrahigh-energy (E > 10^10 GeV) cosmic rays are heavy nuclei (as indicated by existing
data), then the pointing of cosmic rays to their nearest extragalactic sources is expected for 10^10.6
< E/GeV < 10^11. This is because for a nucleus of charge Ze and baryon number A, the bending of the cosmic
ray decreases as Z/E with rising energy, so that pointing to nearby sources becomes possible at highest
energies. In addition, the maximum energy of acceleration capability of the sources grows linearly
in Z, while the energy loss per distance traveled decreases with increasing A. Each of these two points
tend to favor heavy nuclei at the highest energies. The traditional bi-dimensional analyses, which
simultaneously reproduce Auger data on the spectrum and nuclear composition, may not be capable
of incorporating the relative importance of these phenomena. In this paper we propose a multi-dimensional
reconstruction of the individual emission spectra (in E, direction, and cross-correlation with
nearby putative sources) to study the hypothesis that primaries are heavy nuclei subject to GZK
photo-disintegration, and to determine the nature of the extragalactic sources. More specifically,
we propose to combine information on nuclear composition and arrival direction to associate a potential
clustering of events with a 3-dimensional position in the sky. Actually, both the source distance
and maximum emission energy can be obtained through a multi-parameter likelihood analysis to accommodate
the observed nuclear composition of each individual event in the cluster. We show that nucleus-emitting-sources
exhibit a cepa stratis structure on Earth which could be pealed off by future space-missions, such
as POEMMA. We also show that metal-rich starburst galaxies are highly-plausible candidate sources,
and we use them as an explicit example of our proposed multi-dimensional analysis.
