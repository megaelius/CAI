Large scale flows in the Sun play an important role in the dynamo process linked to the solar cycle.
The important large scale flows are the differential rotation and the meridional circulation with
an amplitude of km/s and few m/s , respectively. These flows also have a cycle related components,
namely the torsional oscillations. Our attempt is to determine large-scale plasma flows on the
solar surface by deriving horizontal flow velocities using the techniques of solar granule tracking,
dopplergrams, and time distance helioseismology. Coherent structure tracking (CST) and time
distance helioseismology were used to investigate the solar differential rotation and meridional
circulation at the solar surface on a 30 day HMI SDO sequence. The influence of a large sunspot on these
large scale flows with a specific 7 day HMI SDO sequence has been also studied. The large scale flows
measured by the CST on the solar surface and the same flow determined from the same data with the helioseismology
in the first 1 Mm below the surface are in good agreement in amplitude and direction. The torsional
waves are also located at the same latitudes with amplitude of the same order. We are able to measure
the meridional circulation correctly using the CST method with only three days of data and after
averaging between + and -15 degrees in longitude. We conclude that the combination of CST and Doppler
velocities allows us to detect properly the differential solar rotation and also smaller amplitude
flows such as the meridional circulation and torsional waves. The results of our methods are in good
agreement with helioseismic measurements.
