In high-energy astronomy, spectro-imaging instruments such as X-ray detectors allow investigation
of the spatial and spectral properties of extended sources including galaxy clusters, galaxies,
diffuse interstellar medium, supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae. In these sources, each
physical component possesses a different spatial and spectral signature, but the components are
entangled. Extracting the intrinsic spatial and spectral information of the individual components
from this data is a challenging task. Current analysis methods do not fully exploit the 2D-1D (x,y,E)
nature of the data, as the spatial and spectral information are considered separately. Here we investigate
the application of a Blind Source Separation algorithm that jointly exploits the spectral and spatial
signatures of each component in order to disentangle them. We explore the capabilities of a new BSS
method (General Morphological Component Analysis; GMCA), initially developed to extract an image
of the Cosmic Microwave Background from Planck data, in an X-ray context. The performance of GMCA
on X-ray data is tested using Monte-Carlo simulations of supernova remnant toy models, designed
to represent typical science cases. We find that GMCA is able to separate highly entangled components
in X-ray data even in high contrast scenarios, and can extract with high accuracy the spectrum and
map of each physical component. A modification is proposed to improve the spectral fidelity in the
case of strongly overlapping spatial components, and we investigate a resampling method to derive
realistic uncertainties associated to the results of the algorithm. Applying the modified algorithm
to the deep Chandra observations of Cassiopeia A, we are able to produce detailed maps of the synchrotron
emission at low energies (0.6-2.2 keV), and of the red/blue shifted distributions of a number of
elements including Si and Fe K.
