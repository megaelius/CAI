We analyze the formation and evolution of terrestrial-like planets around solar-type stars in
the absence of gaseous giants. In particular, we focus on the physical and dynamical properties
of those that survive in the system's Habitable Zone (HZ). This study is based on a comparative study
between N-body simulations that include fragmentation and others that consider all collisions
as perfect mergers. We use an N-body code, presented in a previous paper, that allows planetary fragmentation.
We carry out three sets of 24 simulations for 400 Myr. Two sets are developed adopting a model that
includes hit-and-run collisions and planetary fragmentation, each one with different values
of the individual minimum mass allowed for the fragments. For the third set, we considered that all
collisions lead to perfect mergers. The systems produced in N-body simulations with and without
fragmentation are broadly similar, with some differences. In runs with fragmentation, the formed
planets have lower masses since part it is distributed amongst collisional fragments. Additionally,
those planets presented lower eccentricities, presumably due to dynamical friction with the generated
fragments. Perfect mergers and hit-and-run collisions are the most common outcome. Regardless
of the collisional treatment adopted, most of the planets that survive in the HZ start the simulation
beyond the snow line, having very high final water contents. The fragments' contribution to their
mass and water content is negligible. Finally, the individual minimum mass for fragments may play
an important role in the planets' collisional history. Collisional models that incorporate fragmentation
and hit-and-run collisions lead to a more detailed description of the physical properties of the
terrestrial-like planets formed. We conclude that planetary fragmentation is not a barrier to
the formation of water worlds in the HZ.
