In order to study the internal dynamics of actual galaxy pairs, we need to derive the probability
distribution function (PDF) of true 3D (orbital) intervelocities and interdistances between
pair members from their observed (projected) values, and of the pair masses from Kepler's third
law. Our Isolated Galaxy Pair Catalog (IGPC) of 13114 pairs \cite{Nottale2018a} is used here for
this research. The algorithms of statistical deprojection elaborated in \cite{Nottale2018b}
are applied to these observational data. We derive the orbital velocity PDFs for the whole catalog
and for several selected subsamples. The interdistance PDF is deprojected and compared to analytical
profiles which are expected from semi-theoretical arguments. The PDF of deprojected pair orbital
velocities is characterized by the existence of a main probability peak around $\approx 150$ km.s$^{-1}$
for all subsamples of the IGPC as well as for the UGC pair catalog \cite{Chamaraux2016}. The interdistance
PDFs of both the projected and deprojected data are described at large distances by the same power
law with exponent $\approx -2$. The whole distributions, including their cores, are fairly fitted
by King profiles. The mass deprojection yields a mass/luminosity ratio for the pairs of $M/L=(30
\pm 5)$ in Solar units. The orbital velocity probability peak is observed at the same value, $\approx
150$ km/s, as the main exoplanet velocity peak, which points toward a possible universality of Keplerian
structures, whatever the scale. The pair $M/L$ ratio is just 5 times the standard ratio for luminous
matter, which does not require the existence of non-baryonic dark matter in these systems.
