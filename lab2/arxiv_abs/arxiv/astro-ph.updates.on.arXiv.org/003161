Modern high-resolution images obtained with space observatories display extremely strong intensity
variations across images on all spatial scales. Source extraction in such images with methods based
on global thresholding may bring unacceptably large numbers of spurious sources in bright areas
while failing to detect sources in low-background or low-noise areas. It would be highly beneficial
to subtract background and equalize the levels of small-scale fluctuations in the images before
extracting sources or filaments. This paper describes $getimages$, a new method of background
derivation and image flattening. It is based on median filtering with sliding windows that correspond
to a range of spatial scales from the observational beam size up to a maximum structure width $X_{\lambda}$.
The latter is a single free parameter of $getimages$ that can be evaluated manually from the observed
image $\mathcal{I}_{\lambda}$. The median filtering algorithm provides a background image $\tilde{\mathcal{B}}_{\lambda}$
for structures of all widths below $X_{\lambda}$. The same median filtering procedure applied
to an image of standard deviations $\mathcal{D}_{\lambda}$ derived from a background-subtracted
image $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}_{\lambda}$ results in a flattening image $\tilde{\mathcal{F}}_{\lambda}$.
Finally, a flattened detection image $\mathcal{I}_{{\lambda}\mathrm{D}}{\,=\,}\tilde{\mathcal{S}}_{\lambda}{/}\tilde{\mathcal{F}}_{\lambda}$
is computed, whose standard deviations are uniform outside sources and filaments. Detecting sources
in such greatly simplified images results in much cleaner extractions that are more complete and
reliable. As a bonus, $getimages$ reduces various observational and map-making artifacts and
equalizes noise levels between independent tiles of mosaicked images.
