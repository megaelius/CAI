We present a method to self-consistently propagate M$_{*}$ and SFR ($\Psi$) uncertainties onto
intercept, slope and intrinsic scatter estimates for a simple model of the main sequence of star
forming galaxies where $\Psi = \alpha + \beta$M$_{*} + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$. From simple idealised
models set up with broad-band photometry from NIRCam filters at $z\sim5$, we test the method and
compare to methods in the literature. Simplifying the $\Psi$ estimate by basing it on dust-corrected
MUV can help to reduce the impact of template set degeneracies on slope and intercept estimates,
but act to bias the intrinsic scatter estimate. Our test scenarios employ standard star-formation
histories used in SED-fitting in the literature. We find that priors in age for constant SFHs, and
age and $\tau_{SFR}$ for delayed histories, act to corral constraints in the M$_{*}-\Psi$ plane.
This means that one might infer better $\Psi$ constraints than are actually possible because of
the underlying priors. These priors are also incompatible with searching for possible mass-dependence
of intrinsic scatter in the main sequence, even for the M$_{*}$ estimates being used with independent
$\Psi$ estimates. $\Psi$ estimates obtained from H$\alpha$ with dust attenuation correction
using H$\beta$ are subject to uncertain stellar H$\beta$ absorption if SFHs are stochastic. Strong
constraints on rest-frame UV slope are therefore required in addition to H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
fluxes when investigating an increase in scatter to low stellar masses. These can be obtained with
NIRSpec R100 spectra. We show that, for simple exposure time calculations assuming point sources
without dust, we should be able to probe to log(m$_{*}$/M$_{\odot})\sim8.5$ with JWST at $z\sim5$.
