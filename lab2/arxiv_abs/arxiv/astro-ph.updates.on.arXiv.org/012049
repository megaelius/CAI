We have derived absolute proper motions of the entire Galactic bulge region from VIRAC and Gaia.
We present these as both integrated on-sky maps and, after isolating standard candle red clump (RC)
stars, as a function of distance using RC magnitude as a proxy. These data provide a new global, 3-dimensional
view of the Milky Way barred bulge kinematics. We find a gradient in the mean longitudinal proper
motion, $<\mu_l^\star>$, between the different sides of the bar, which is sensitive to the bar pattern
speed. The split RC has distinct proper motions and is colder than other stars at similar distance.
The proper motion correlation map has a quadrupole pattern in all magnitude slices showing no evidence
for a separate, more axisymmetric inner bulge component. The line-of-sight integrated kinematic
maps show a high central velocity dispersion surrounded by a more asymmetric dispersion profile.
$\sigma_{\mu_l} / \sigma_{\mu_b}$ is smallest, $\sim1.1$, near the minor axis and reaches $\sim1.4$
near the disc plane. The integrated $<\mu_b>$ pattern signals a superposition of bar rotation and
internal streaming motion, with the near part shrinking in latitude and the far part expanding.
To understand and interpret these remarkable data, we compare to a made-to-measure barred dynamical
model, folding in the VIRAC selection function to construct mock maps. We find that our model of the
barred bulge, with a pattern speed of 37.5 $\mathrm{km \, s^{-1} \, kpc^{-1}}$, is able to reproduce
all observed features impressively well. Dynamical models like this will be key to unlocking the
full potential of these data.
