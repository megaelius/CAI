Silicon and Mg in differentiated rocky bodies exhibit heavy isotope enrichments that have been
attributed to evaporation of partially or entirely molten planetesimals. We evaluate the mechanisms
of planetesimal evaporation in the early solar system and the conditions that controlled attendant
isotope fractionations. Energy balance at the surface of a body accreted within ~1 Myr of CAI formation
and heated from within by 26Al decay results in internal temperatures exceeding the silicate solidus,
producing a transient magma ocean with a thin surface boundary layer of order < 1 meter that would
be subject to foundering. Bodies that are massive enough to form magma oceans by radioisotope decay
(ge 0.1%) can retain hot rock vapor even in the absence of ambient nebular gas. We find that a steady-state
rock vapor forms within minutes to hours and results from a balance between rates of magma evaporation
and atmospheric escape. Vapor pressure buildup adjacent to the surfaces of the evaporating magmas
would have inevitably led to an approach to equilibrium isotope partitioning between the vapor
phase and the silicate melt. Numerical simulations of this near-equilibrium evaporation process
for a body with a radius of ~ 700 km yield a steady-state far-field vapor pressure corresponding to
95% saturation. Approaches to equilibrium isotope fractionation between vapor and melt should
have been the norm during planet formation due to the formation of steady-state rock vapor atmospheres
and/or the presence of protostellar gas. We model the Si and Mg isotopic composition of bulk Earth
and show that the best fit is for a carbonaceous chondrite-like source material with about 12% loss
of Mg and 15% loss of Si resulting from near-equilibrium evaporation into the solar protostellar
disk of hydrogen gas on timescales of 10,000 to 100,000 years.
