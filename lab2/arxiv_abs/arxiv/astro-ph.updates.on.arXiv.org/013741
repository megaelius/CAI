Interstellar dust is a significant component of matter in the galaxies. The dust owns its origin
and reprocessing in a wide range of astrophysical environments. In order to understand the origin
and evolution of the distinct types of interstellar dust grains, we have attempted a comprehensive
correlated study of the thermodynamics condensation of dust grains in distinct stellar environments
with the Galactic chemical evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Galaxy is evolved in terms of elemental
evolution resulting from stellar nucleosynthetic contributions of several generations of stars.
Based on the elemental composition of the evolving Galaxy, the relative abundances of the major
constituents of interstellar dust are assessed. The major aim is to redistribute the various condensable
elements at any epoch during the evolution of the Galaxy into various grain constituents and understand
their abundance evolution based on a mass-balance formalism. We also performed thermodynamical
equilibrium condensation calculations to understand the stellar origin of various grain constituents
that could carry the isotopic signatures of the various stellar nucleosynthetic sources. This
is perhaps a novel attempt to estimate the bulk dust mass budget in the evolving Galaxy. The normalized
mass of the Galactic dust is predicted to decrease with the increase in distance from the Galactic
centre. It increases over time. The supernovae SN Ia are predicted as the most prominent sources
of Fe-dust mass, the supernovae SN II+Ib/c produces oxides and silicate dust mass, and the AGB stars
contributes to carbonaceous dust mass.
