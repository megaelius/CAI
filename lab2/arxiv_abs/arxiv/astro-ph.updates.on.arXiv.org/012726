Context. Several new multi-object spectrographs are currently planned or under construction
that are capable of observing thousands of Galactic and extragalactic objects simultaneously.
Aims. In this paper we present a probabilistic fibre-to-target assignment algorithm that takes
spectrograph targeting constraints into account and is capable of dealing with multiple concurrent
surveys. We present this algorithm using the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST)
as an example. Methods. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to assign probabilities to fibre-target
pairs. The assignment of probabilities takes the fibre positioner's capabilities and constraints
into account. Additionally, these probabilities include requirements from surveys and take the
required exposure time, number density variation, and angular clustering of targets across each
survey into account. The main advantage of a probabilistic approach is that it allows for accurate
and easy computation of the target selection function for the different surveys, which involves
determining the probability of observing a target, given an input catalogue. Results. The probabilistic
fibre-to-target assignment allows us to achieve maximally uniform completeness within a single
field of view. The proposed algorithm maximises the fraction of successfully observed targets
whilst minimising the selection bias as a function of exposure time. In the case of several concurrent
surveys, the algorithm maximally satisfies the scientific requirements of each survey and no specific
survey is penalised or prioritised. Conclusions. The algorithm presented is a proposed solution
for the 4MOST project that allows for an unbiased targeting of many simultaneous surveys. With some
modifications, the algorithm may also be applied to other multi-object spectroscopic surveys.
