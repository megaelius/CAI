We carry out a detailed strong lensing analysis of a sub-sample of eight galaxy clusters of the CLASH
survey, in the redshift range of $ z_{\rm cluster} = [0.23-0.59]$, using extensive spectroscopic
information, primarily MUSE archival data complemented with CLASH-VLT redshift measurements.
Different models are tested in each cluster depending on the complexity of its mass distribution
and on the number of detected multiple images. Four clusters show more than five spectroscopically
confirmed multiple image families. In this sample, we do not make use of families that are only photometrically
identified, in order to reduce model degeneracies and systematics due to the potential misidentifications
of some multiple images. We present spectroscopic confirmation of 27 multiply lensed sources,
with no previous spectroscopic measurements, spanning over the redshift range of $z_{\rm src}=[0.7-6.1]$.
Moreover, we confirm an average of $48$ galaxy members in the core of each cluster, thanks to the high
efficiency and large field of view of MUSE. Despite having different properties (i.e., number of
mass components, total mass, redshift, etc), the projected total mass and mass density profiles
of all clusters have very similar shapes, when rescaled by independent measurements of $M_{200c}$
and $R_{200c}$. Specifically, we measure the mean value of the projected total mass of our cluster
sample within 10 (20)% of $R_{200c}$ to be 0.13 (0.32) of $M_{200c}$, with a remarkably small scatter
of 5 (6)%. Furthermore, the large number of high-z sources and the precise magnification maps derived
in this work for four clusters add up to the sample of high-quality gravitational telescopes to be
used to study the faint and distant Universe. The strong lensing models and the full redshift catalogues
from MUSE will be made publicly available upon the acceptance for publication of this manuscript.
