Observational surveys are now able to detect an increasing number of transients, such as core-collapse
supernovae (SN) and powerful non-terminal outbursts (SN impostors). Dedicated spectroscopic
facilities can follow up these events shortly after detection. Here we investigate the properties
of these explosions at early times. We use the radiative transfer code CMFGEN to build an extensive
library of spectra simulating the interaction of supernovae and their progenitor's winds/circumstellar
medium (CSM). We consider a range of progenitor mass-loss rates (Mdot = 5e-4 to 1e-2 Msun/yr), abundances
(solar, CNO-processed, and He-rich), and SN luminosities (L = 1.9e8 to 2.5e10 Lsun). The models
simulate events ~1 day after explosion, and we assume a fixed location of the shock front as Rin=8.6e13
cm. We show that the large range of massive star properties at the pre-SN stage causes a diversity
of early-time interacting SN and impostors. We identify three main classes of early-time spectra
consisting of relatively high-ionisation (e.g. Ovi), medium-ionisation (e.g. Ciii), and low-ionisation
lines (e.g. Feii/iii). They are regulated by L and the CSM density. Given a progenitor wind velocity
Vinf, our models also place a lower limit of Mdot > 5e-4 (Vinf/150 km/s) Msun/yr for detection of CSM
interaction signatures in observed spectra. Early-time SN spectra should provide clear constraints
on progenitors by measuring H, He, and CNO abundances if the progenitors come from single stars.
The connections are less clear considering the effects of binary evolution. Yet, our models provide
a clear path for linking the final stages of massive stars to their post-explosion spectra at early
times, and guiding future observational follow-up of transients with facilities such as the Zwicky
Transient Facility.
