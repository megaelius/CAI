We use three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of vertically stratified patches of galactic
discs to study how the spatio-temporal clustering of supernovae (SNe) enhances the power of galactic
winds. SNe that are randomly distributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic
winds because most supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of the
disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered alleviates this problem. Super-bubbles
driven by the combined effects of clustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic
discs well before the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are reduced
dramatically and a large fraction ($\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy released by SNe vents into the halo
powering a strong galactic wind. These energetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative
feedback and eject substantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star formation
rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by the SNe, because the hot gas vents
before doing significant work on the surroundings. We show that our conclusions hold for a range
of galaxy properties, both in the local Universe (e.g., M82) and at high redshift (e.g., $z \sim 2$
star forming galaxies). We further show that if the efficiency of forming star clusters increases
with increasing gas surface density, as suggested by theoretical arguments, the condition for
star cluster-driven super-bubbles to break out of galactic discs corresponds to a threshold star
formation rate surface density for the onset of galactic winds $\sim 0.03$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$
kpc$^{-2}$, of order that observed.
