We use nearly 1,200 supernovae (SNe) from Pan-STARRS and $\sim$200 low-$z$ ($z < 0.1$) SNe Ia to measure
cosmological parameters. Though most of these SNe lack spectroscopic classifications, in a previous
paper (I) we demonstrated that photometrically classified SNe can still be used to infer unbiased
cosmological parameters by using a Bayesian methodology that marginalizes over core-collapse
(CC) SN contamination. Our sample contains nearly twice as many SNe as the largest previous compilation
of SNe Ia. Combining SNe with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints from the Planck satellite,
we measure the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ to be -0.986$\pm$0.058 (stat$+$sys).
If we allow $w$ to evolve with redshift as $w(a) = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$, we find $w_0 = -0.923 \pm 0.148$ and
$w_a =$ -0.404$\pm$0.797. These results are consistent with measurements of cosmological parameters
from the JLA and from a new analysis of 1049 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia (Scolnic et al. 2017).
We try four different photometric classification priors for Pan-STARRS SNe and two alternate ways
of modeling the CC SN contamination, finding that none of these variants gives a $w$ that differs
by more than 1% from the baseline measurement. The systematic uncertainty on $w$ due to marginalizing
over the CC SN contamination, $\sigma_w^{\textrm{CC}} = 0.019$, is approximately equal to the
photometric calibration uncertainty and is lower than the systematic uncertainty in the SN\,Ia
dispersion model ($\sigma_w^{\textrm{disp}} = 0.024$). Our data provide one of the best current
constraints on $w$, demonstrating that samples with $\sim$5% CC SN contamination can give competitive
cosmological constraints when the contaminating distribution is marginalized over in a Bayesian
framework.
