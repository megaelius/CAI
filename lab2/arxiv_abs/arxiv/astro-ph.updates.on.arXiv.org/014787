The secular behavior of an orbit under the gravitational perturbation due to a two-dimensional
uniform disk is studied in this paper, through analytical and numerical approaches. We develop
the secular approximation of this problem and obtain the averaged Hamiltonian for this system first.
We find that, when the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner orbit and the disk radius takes very
small values ($\ll1$), and if the inclination between the inner orbit and the disk is greater than
the critical value of $30^\circ$, the inner orbit will undergo the (classical) Lidov-Kozai resonance
in which variations of eccentricity and inclination are usually very large and the system has two
equilibrium points at $\omega=\pi/2,3\pi/2$ ($\omega$ is the argument of perihelion). The critical
value will slightly drop to about $27^\circ$ as the ratio increases to 0.4. However, the secular
resonances will not occur for the outer orbit and the variations of the eccentricity and inclination
are small. When the ratio of the orbit and the disk radius is nearly $1$, there are many more complicated
Lidov-Kozai resonance types which lead to the orbital behaviors that are different from the classical
Lidov-Kozai case. In these resonances, the system has more equilibrium points which could appear
at $\omega=0,\pi/2,\pi,3\pi/2$, and even other values of $\omega$. The variations of eccentricity
and inclination become relatively moderate, moreover, in some cases the orbit can be maintained
at a highly inclined state. In addition, a analysis shows that a Kuzmin disk can also lead to the (classical)
Lidov-Kozai resonance and the critical inclination is also $30^\circ$.
