We present a study of the three dimensional structure, kinematics, and age distribution of the Orion
OB association, based on the second data release of the Gaia satellite (Gaia DR2). Our goal is to obtain
a complete picture of the star formation history of the Orion complex and to relate our findings to
theories of sequential and triggered star formation. We select the Orion population with simple
photometric criteria, and we construct a three dimensional map in galactic Cartesian coordinates
to study the physical arrangement of the stellar clusters in the Orion region. The map shows structures
that extend for roughly $150 \, \mathrm{pc}$ along the line of sight, divided in multiple sub-clusters.
We separate different groups by using the density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN. We study the
kinematic properties of all the groups found by DBSCAN first by inspecting their proper motion distribution,
and then by applying a kinematic modelling code based on an iterative maximum likelihood approach,
which we use to derive their mean velocity, velocity dispersion and isotropic expansion. By using
an isochrone fitting procedure we provide ages and extinction values for all the groups. We confirm
the presence of an old population ($\sim 15$ Myr) towards the 25 Ori region, and we find that groups
with ages of $12-15 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ are present also towards the Belt region. We notice the presence
of a population of $\sim 10$ Myr also in front of the Orion A molecular cloud. Our findings suggest
that star formation in Orion does not follow a simple sequential scenario, but instead consists
of multiple events, which caused kinematic and physical sub-structure. To fully explain the detailed
sequence of events, specific simulations and further radial velocity data are needed.
