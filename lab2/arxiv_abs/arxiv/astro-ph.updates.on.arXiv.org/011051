The atmospheric monitoring devices for the planned calibration system of the Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) are undergoing intensive development, prototyping and testing. The All-Sky Cameras,
the Sun/Moon Photometers and the FRAM telescopes have been gradually deployed at the future CTA
sites with the primary goal of site characterization, simultaneously allowing the assessment
of their operational reliability in realistic environmental conditions. All three devices have
shown the ability to work smoothly in both the extreme dryness and the large temperature variations
of the southern site as well as in the occasional adverse weather during winter months at the northern
site. The target availability of 95\% of time has not yet been reached mostly due to minor hardware
failures that have proven difficult to fix due to the remoteness of the installation in the absence
of the future CTA infrastructure. The experience gathered during the prototype operations will
contribute to the improved reliability of the final instruments. The Raman LIDARs, described in
separate proceedings of this conference, and the infrared Ceilometer, ready for testing in Prague,
will complement the set of atmospheric calibration devices in near future. The final operational
procedures for the atmospheric calibration of the CTA during its operation are being finalized
foreseeing the use of the All-sky Cameras and the Ceilometer for the monitoring of clouds over the
whole sky and the LIDARs and FRAMs for precision measurements of the atmospheric transmission as
a function of altitude and position within the field-of-view of the CTA array.
