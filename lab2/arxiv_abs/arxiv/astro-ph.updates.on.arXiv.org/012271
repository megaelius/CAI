Upcoming million-star spectroscopic surveys have the potential to revolutionize our view of the
formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way. Realizing this potential requires automated
approaches to optimize estimates of stellar properties, such as chemical element abundances,
from the spectra. The volume and quality of the observations strongly motivate that these approaches
should be data-driven. With this in mind, we introduce SSSpaNG: a data-driven Gaussian Process
model of stellar spectra. We demonstrate the capabilities of SSSpaNG using a sample of APOGEE red
clump stars, whose model parameters we infer via Gibbs sampling. Pooling information between stars
to infer their covariance, we permit clear identification of the correlations between spectral
pixels. Harnessing these correlations, we infer the true spectrum of each star, inpainting missing
regions and denoising by a factor of at least 2-3 for low-signal-to-noise stars. As we marginalize
over the covariance matrix of the spectra, the effective prior on these true spectra is non-Gaussian,
non-convex and sparsifying, promoting typically small but occasionally large excursions from
the mean. The high-fidelity true spectra produced will enable improved elemental abundance measurements
for individual stars. Our model also allows us to quantify the information gained by observing portions
of a star's spectrum, and thereby define the most mutually informative spectral regions. Using
25 windows centred on elemental absorption lines, we demonstrate that the iron-peak and alpha-process
elements are particularly mutually informative for these spectra, and that the majority of information
about a target window is contained in the 10-or-so most informative windows. Our information-gain
metric has the potential to inform models of nucleosynthetic yields and optimize the design of future
observations.
