We present an in-depth and systematic variability study of a sample of 20 powerful blazars, including
12 BL Lacs and 8 flat spectrum radio quasars, applying various analysis tools such as flux distribution,
symmetry analysis, and time series analysis on the decade-long Fermi/LAT observations. The results
show that blazars with steeper \gama-ray spectral indexes are found to be more variable; and the
\gama-ray flux distribution closely resembles lognormal probability distribution function.
The statistical variability properties of the sources as studied by power spectral density analysis
are consistent with \emph{flicker noise} ($P(\nu)\propto1/\nu$) -- an indication of long-memory
processes at work. Statistical analysis of the distribution of flux rise and decay rates in the light
curves of the sources, aimed at distinguishing between particle acceleration and energy dissipation
timescales, counter-intuitively suggests that both kinds of rates follow a similar distribution
and the derived mean variability timescales are in the order of a few weeks. The corresponding emission
region size is used to constrain location of \gama-ray production sites in the sources to be a few
parsecs. Additionally, using Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform methods
and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we detected year timescale quasi-periodic oscillations
in the sources S5 0716+714, Mrk 421, ON +325, PKS 1424-418 and PKS 2155-304. The detection significance
was computed taking proper account of the red-noise and other artifacts inherent in the observations.
We explain the results in the light of current blazar models with relativistic shocks propagating
down the jet viewed close to the line of sight.
