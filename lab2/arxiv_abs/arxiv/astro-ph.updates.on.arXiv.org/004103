Knowledge of the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{0}$ of GRBs allows us to compute their comoving frame
properties shedding light on their physics. Upon collisions with the circumburst matter, the fireball
of a GRB starts to decelerate, producing a peak or a break (depending on the circumburst density profile)
in the light curve of the afterglow. Considering all bursts with known redshift and with an early
coverage of their emission, we find 67 GRBs with a peak in their optical or GeV light curves at a time
$t_{\rm p}$. For another 106 GRBs we set an upper limit $t_{\rm p}^{\rm UL}$. We show that $t_{\rm
p}$ is due to the dynamics of the fireball deceleration and not to the passage of a characteristic
frequency of the synchrotron spectrum across the optical band. Considering the $t_{\rm p}$ of 66
long GRBs and the 85 most constraining upper limits, using censored data analysis methods, we reconstruct
the most likely distribution of $t_{\rm p}$. All $t_{\rm p}$ are larger than the time $t_{\rm p,g}$
when the prompt emission peaks, and are much larger than the time $t_{\rm ph}$ when the fireball becomes
transparent. The reconstructed distribution of $\Gamma_0$ has median value $\sim$300 (150) for
a uniform (wind) circumburst density profile. In the comoving frame, long GRBs have typical isotropic
energy, luminosity, and peak energy $\langle E_{\rm iso}\rangle=3(8)\times 10^{50}$ erg, $\langle
L_{\rm iso}\rangle=3(15) \times 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$ , and $\langle E_{\rm peak}\rangle =1(2)$
keV in the homogeneous (wind) case. We confirm that the significant correlations between $\Gamma$
and the rest frame isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$), luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$) and peak energy
($E_{\rm peak}$) are not due to selection effects. Assuming a typical opening angle of 5 degrees,
we derive the distribution of the jet baryon loading which is centered around a few $10^{-6} {\rm
M_{\odot}}$.
