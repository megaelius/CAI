The observable properties of galaxies are known to depend on both internal processes and the external
environment. In terms of the environmental role, we still do not have a clear picture of the processes
driving the transformation of galaxies. This may be due to the fact that these environmental processes
depend on local physical conditions (e.g., local tidal force or hot gas density), whereas observations
typically probe only broad-brush proxies for these conditions (e.g., host halo mass, distance
to the N^th nearest neighbour, etc.). Here we propose a new method that directly links galaxies to
their local environments, by using spatial cross-correlations of galaxy catalogues with maps
from large-scale structure surveys (e.g., thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich [tSZ] effect, diffuse
X-ray emission, weak lensing of galaxies or the CMB). We focus here on the quenching of galaxies and
its link to local hot gas properties. Maps of galaxy overdensity and quenched fraction excess are
constructed from volume-limited SDSS catalogs, which are cross-correlated with maps of tSZ effect
from Planck and X-ray emission from ROSAT. Strong signals out to Mpc scales are detected for all cross-correlations
and are compared to predictions from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (the EAGLE and BAHAMAS
simulations). The simulations successfully reproduce many, but not all, of the observed power
spectra, with an indication that environmental quenching may be too efficient in the simulations.
We demonstrate that the cross-correlations are sensitive to both the internal and external processes
responsible for quenching. The methods outlined in this paper can be easily adapted to other observables
and, with upcoming surveys, will provide a stringent direct test of physical models for environmental
transformation.
