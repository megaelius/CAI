We present spectro-polarimetric analysis of \thisgrb\ using data from \asat, \fermi, and \swift,
to provide insights into the physical mechanisms of the prompt radiation and the jet geometry. Prompt
emission from \thisgrb\ was very bright (fluence $>10^{-4}$~ergs~cm$^{-2}$) and had a complex
structure composed of the superimposition of several pulses. The energy spectra deviate from the
typical Band function to show a low energy peak $\sim 15$~keV --- which we interpret as a power-law
with two breaks, with a synchrotron origin. Alternately, the prompt spectra can also be interpreted
as Comptonized emission, or a blackbody combined with a Band function. Time-resolved analysis
confirms the presence of the low energy component, while the peak energy is found to be confined in
the range of 100--200~keV. Afterglow emission detected by \fermi-LAT is typical of an external
shock model, and we constrain the initial Lorentz factor using the peak time of the emission. \swift-XRT
measurements of the afterglow show an indication for a jet break, allowing us to constrain the jet
opening angle to $>$ 6$\degr$. Detection of a large number of Compton scattered events by \asat-CZTI
provides an opportunity to study hard X-ray polarization of the prompt emission. We find that the
burst has high, time-variable polarization, with the emission {\bf have higher polarization}
at energies above the peak energy. We discuss all observations in the context of GRB models and polarization
arising due to {\bf due to physical or geometric effects:} synchrotron emission from multiple shocks
with ordered or random magnetic fields, Poynting flux dominated jet undergoing abrupt magnetic
dissipation, sub-photospheric dissipation, a jet consisting of fragmented fireballs, and the
Comptonization model.
