We report on the possibility that the Dark Matter particle is a stable, neutral, as-yet-undiscovered
hadron in the standard model. The existence of a compact color-flavor-spin singlet sexaquark (S,
uuddss) with mass ~2m_p, is compatible with current knowledge. The S interacts with baryons primarily
via a Yukawa interaction of coupling strength alpha_SN, mediated by omega and phi vector mesons
having mass ~1 GeV. If it exists, the S is a very attractive DM candidate. The relic abundance of S Dark
Matter (SDM) is established when the Universe transitions from the quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic
phase at ~150 MeV and is in remarkable agreement with the observed Omega_DM/Omega_b = 5.3+-0.1;
this is a no-free-parameters result because the relevant parameters are known from QCD. Survival
of this relic abundance to low temperature requires the breakup amplitude gtilde <~ 2 10^-6, comfortably
compatible with theory expectations and observational bounds because the breakup amplitude is
dynamically suppressed and many orders of magnitude smaller, as we show. The scattering cross section
can differ by orders of magnitude from Born approximation, depending on alpha_SN, requiring reanalysis
of observational limits. We use direct detection experiments and cosmological constraints to
determine the allowed region of alpha_SN. For a range of allowed values, we predict exotic nuclear
isotopes at a detectable level with mass offset ~2 amu. The most promising approaches for detecting
the sexaquark in accelerator experiments are to search for a long-interaction-length neutral
particle component in the central region of relativistic heavy ion collisions or using a beam-dump
setup, and to search for evidence of missing particle production characterized by unbalanced baryon
number and strangeness using Belle-II or possibly GLUEX at J-Lab.
