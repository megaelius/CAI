3HSP J095507.9+355101 is an extreme blazar to have been possibly associated with a high-energy
neutrino, IceCube-200107A, which was detected one day before the blazar was observed and found
to undergo a hard X-ray flare. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive study of
the predicted multimessenger emission from 3HSP J095507.9+355101 during its recent X-ray flare,
but also in the long term. We focus on single-zone leptohadronic models, where the broadband photon
and high-energy neutrino emissions originate from same region of the jet, but we also explore alternative
scenarios: (i) a blazar-core model, which considers neutrino production in the inner jet close
to the accreting supermassive black hole, (ii) a hidden external-photon model, which considers
neutrino production in the jet through interactions with photons from a possible weak broad line
region, (iii) a one-zone proton synchrotron model, where high-energy protons produce $\gamma$-rays
in the jet via synchrotron, and (iv) an intergalactic cascade scenario, where neutrinos are produced
in the intergalactic medium by interactions of a high-energy cosmic-ray beam escaping the blazar
jet. We find that the Poisson probability to detect one or more neutrinos in 8 years from 3HSP J095507.9+355101
is $\sim 2\%$ ($3\%$) when considering the most optimistic one-zone leptohadronic model (the multi-zone
blazar-core model), while detection of one neutrino event during the X-ray flare is much less likely.
If the association is real, then IceCube-Gen2 and other future detectors should be able to provide
additional evidence for neutrino production in 3HSP J095507.9+355101 and other extreme blazars,
assuming similar physical conditions.
