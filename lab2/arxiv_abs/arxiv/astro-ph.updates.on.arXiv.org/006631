In the era of high-angular resolution astronomical instrumentation, where long and very long baseline
interferometers (constituted by many, $\sim$ 20 or more, telescopes) are expected to work not only
in the millimeter and submillimeter domain, but also at near and mid infrared wavelengths (experiments
such as the Planet Formation Imager, PFI, see Monnier et al. 2018 for an update on its design); any
promising strategy to alleviate the costs of the individual telescopes involved needs to be explored.
In a recent collaboration between engineers, experimental physicists and astronomers in Valparaiso,
Chile, we are gaining expertise in the production of light carbon fiber polymer reinforced mirrors.
The working principle consists in replicating a glass, or other substrate, mandrel surface with
the mirrored adequate curvature, surface characteristics and general shape. Once the carbon fiber
base has hardened, previous studies have shown that it can be coated (aluminum) using standard coating
processes/techniques designed for glass-based mirrors. The resulting surface quality is highly
dependent on the temperature and humidity control among other variables. Current efforts are focused
on improving the smoothness of the resulting surfaces to meet near/mid infrared specifications,
overcoming, among others, possible deteriorations derived from the replication process. In a
second step, at the validation and quality control stage, the mirrors are characterized using simple/traditional
tools like spherometers (down to micron precision), but also an optical bench with a Shack-Hartman
wavefront sensor. This research line is developed in parallel with a more classical glass-based
approach, and in both cases we are prototyping at the small scale of few tens of cms. We here present
our progress on these two approaches.
