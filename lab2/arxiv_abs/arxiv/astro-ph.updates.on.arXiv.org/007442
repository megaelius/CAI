The south-north travel-time differences are measured by applying time-distance helioseismology
to the MDI and HMI medium-degree Dopplergrams covering May 1996-April 2017. Our data analysis corrects
for several sources of systematic effects: P-angle error, surface magnetic field effects, and
center-to-limb variations. An interpretation of the travel-time measurements is obtained using
a forward-modeling approach in the ray approximation. The travel-time differences are similar
in the southern hemisphere for cycles 23 and 24. However, they differ in the northern hemisphere
between cycles 23 and 24. Except for cycle 24's northern hemisphere, the measurements favor a single-cell
meridional circulation model where the poleward flows persist down to $\sim$0.8 $R_\odot$, accompanied
by local inflows toward the activity belts in the near-surface layers. Cycle 24's northern hemisphere
is anomalous: travel-time differences are significantly smaller when travel distances are greater
than 20$^\circ$. This asymmetry between northern and southern hemispheres during cycle 24 was
not present in previous measurements (e.g., Rajaguru & Antia 2015), which assumed a different P-angle
error correction where south-north travel-time differences are shifted to zero at the equator
for all travel distances. In our measurements, the travel-time differences at the equator are zero
for travel distances less than $\sim$30$^\circ$, but they do not vanish for larger travel distances.
This equatorial offset for large travel distances need not be interpreted as a deep cross-equator
flow; it could be due to the presence of asymmetrical local flows at the surface near the end points
of the acoustic ray paths.
