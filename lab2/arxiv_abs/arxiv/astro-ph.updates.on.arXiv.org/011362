Improvement in the precision of measurements of cosmological parameters with Type Ia Supernovae
(SNIa) is expected to come from large photometrically identified (photometric) SN samples. Here
we re-analyse the SDSS photometric SN sample, with roughly 700 high-quality, likely but unconfirmed
SNIa light-curves, to develop new analysis tools aimed at evaluating systematic uncertainties
on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$. Since we require a spectroscopically measured
host galaxy redshift for each SN, we determine the associated selection efficiency of host galaxies
in order to simulate bias corrections. We determine that the mis-association rate of host galaxies
is $0.5\%$; ignoring this effect in simulated bias corrections leads to a $w$-bias of $\Delta w =
-0.0005$, where $w$ is evaluated from SNIa and priors from measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations
and the cosmic microwave background. We assess the uncertainty in our modeling of the host galaxy
selection efficiency and find the associated $w$ uncertainty to be $0.0017$. Finally, we explore
new core collapse (CC) models in simulated training samples and find that adjusting the CC luminosity
distribution to be in agreement with previous Pan-STARRS analyses yields a better match to the SDSS
data. The impact of ignoring this adjustment is $\Delta w = 0.0045$; the impact of replacing the new
CC models with those used by Pan-STARRS is $\Delta w = -0.005$. These systematic uncertainties are
subdominant to the statistical constraints from the SDSS sample, but must be considered in future
photometric analyses of large SN samples such as those from DES, LSST and WFIRST.
