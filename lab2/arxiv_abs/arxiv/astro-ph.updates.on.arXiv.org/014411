The EUV provides most of the ionization that creates the high equivalent width (EW) broad and narrow
emission lines (BELs, NELs) of quasars. Spectra of Hypermassive Schwarzschild black holes (HMBHs,
$M_{BH} \geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) with $\alpha$-discs, decline rapidly in the EUV suggesting much
lower EWs. Model spectra for black holes of mass $10^{6}-10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and accretion rates
$0.03 \leq L_{bol}/L_{edd} \leq 1.0$ were input to the CLOUDY photoionization code. BELs become
$\sim$100 times weaker in EW from $M_{BH} \sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$ to $M_{BH} \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$.
The high ionization BELs (O VI 1034 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm {A}}$, C IV 1549 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm
{A}}$, He II 1640 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm {A}}$) decline in EW from ($M_{BH} \geq 10^6 M_{\odot}$,
reproducing the Baldwin effect, but regain EW for $M_{BH} \geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}$). The low ionization
lines (MgII 2798 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm {A}}$, H$\beta$ 4861 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm {A}}$
and H$\alpha$ 6563 $\overset{\circ}{\mathrm {A}}$) remain weak. Lines for maximally spinning
HMBHs behave similarly. Line ratio diagrams for the BELs show that high OVI/H$\beta$ and low CIV/H$\alpha$
may pick out HMBH, although OVI is often hard to observe. In NEL BPT diagrams HMBHs lie among star-forming
regions, except for highly spinning, high accretion rate HMBHs. In summary, the BELs expected from
HMBHs would be hard to detect using the current optical facilities. From 100 to $10^{12} M_{\odot}$,
the emission lines used to detect AGN only have high EW in the $10^6 - 10^9 M_{\odot}$ window, where
most AGN are found. This selection effect may be distorting reported distributions of $M_{BH}$.
