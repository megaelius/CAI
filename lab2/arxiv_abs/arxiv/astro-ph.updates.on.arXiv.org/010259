We study the formation of coalescing binary black holes via the evolution of isolated field binaries
that go through the common envelope phase in order to obtain the combined distributions of the main
observables of Advanced LIGO. We use a hybrid technique that combines the parametric binary population
synthesis code COMPAS with detailed binary evolution simulations performed with the MESA code.
We then convolve our binary evolution calculations with the redshift- and metallicity-dependent
star-formation rate and the selection effects of gravitational-wave detectors to obtain predictions
of observable properties. By assuming efficient angular momentum transport, we are able to present
a model capable of predicting simultaneously the three main gravitational-wave observables:
the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_{eff}$, the chirp mass $M_{chirp}$ and the cosmological
redshift of merger $z_{merger}$. We find an excellent agreement between our model and the ten events
from the first two advanced detector observing runs. We make predictions for the third observing
run O3 and for Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. We expect 59% of events with $\chi_{eff} < 0.1$,
while the remaining 41% of events with $\chi_{eff} \ge 0.1$ are split into 9% with $M_{chirp} < 15$
M$_\odot$ and 32% with $M_{chirp} \ge 15$ M$_\odot$. In conclusion, the favorable comparison of
the existing LIGO/Virgo observations with our model predictions gives support to the idea that
the majority, if not all of the observed mergers, originate from the evolution of isolated binaries.
The first-born black hole has negligible spin because it lost its envelope after it expanded to become
a giant star, while the spin of the second-born black hole is determined by the tidal spin up of its
naked helium star progenitor by the first-born black hole companion after the binary finished the
common-envelope phase.
