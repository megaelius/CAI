By means of the present geometrical and dynamical observational data, it is very hard to establish,
from a statistical perspective, a clear preference among the vast majority of the proposed models
for the dynamical dark energy and/or modified gravity theories alternative with respect to the
$\Lambda$CDM scenario. On the other hand, on scales much smaller than present Hubble scale, there
are possibly detectable differences in the growth of the matter perturbations for different modes
of the perturbations, even in the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we analyze the evolution
of the dark matter perturbations in the context of $\Lambda$CDM and some dynamical dark energy models
involving future cosmological singularities, such as the sudden future singularity and the finite
scale factor singularity. We employ the Newtonian gauge formulation for the derivation of the perturbation
equations for the growth function, and we abandon both the sub-Hubble approximation and the slowly
varying potential assumption. We apply the Fisher Matrix approach to three future planned galaxy
surveys e.g., DESI, Euclid, and WFirst-2.4. With the mentioned surveys on hand, only with the dynamical
probes, we will achieve multiple goals: $1.$ the improvement in the accuracy of the determination
of the $f\sigma_{8}$ will give the possibility to discriminate between the $\Lambda$CDM and the
alternative dark energy models even in the scale-independent approach; $2.$ it will be possible
to test the goodness of the scale-independence finally, and also to quantify the necessity of a scale
dependent approach to the growth of the perturbations, in particular using surveys which encompass
redshift bins with scales $k<0.005\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$; $3.$ the scale-dependence itself might add
much more discriminating power in general, but further advanced surveys will be needed.
