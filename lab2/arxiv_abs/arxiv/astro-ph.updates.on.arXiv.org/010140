Low-mass stars in eclipsing binary systems show radii larger and effective temperatures lower
than theoretical stellar models predict for isolated stars with the same masses. Eclipsing binaries
with low-mass components are hard to find due to their low luminosity. As a consequence, the analysis
of the known low-mass eclipsing systems is key to understand this behavior. We developed a physical
model of the LMDEB system NSVS 10653195 to accurately measure the masses and radii of the components.
We obtained several high-resolution spectra in order to fit a spectroscopic orbit. Standardized
absolute photometry was obtained to measure reliable color indices and to measure the mean Teff
of the system in out-of-eclipse phases. We observed and analyzed optical VRI and infrared JK band
differential light-curves which were fitted using PHOEBE. A Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
near the solution found provides robust uncertainties for the fitted parameters. NSVS 10653195
is a detached eclipsing binary composed of two similar stars with masses of M1=0.6402+/-0.0052
Msun and M2=0.6511+/-0.0052 Msun and radii of R1=0.687^{+0.017}_{-0.024} Rsun and R2=0.672^{+0.018}_{-0.022}
Rsun. Spectral types were estimated to be K6V and K7V. These stars rotate in a circular orbit with
an orbital inclination of i=86.22+/-0.61 degrees and a period of P=0.5607222(2) d. The distance
to the system is estimated to be d=135.2^{+7.6}_{-7.9} pc, in excellent agreement with the value
from Gaia. If solar metallicity were assumed, the age of the system would be older than log(age)~8
based on the Mbol-log Teff diagram. NSVS 10653195 is composed of two oversized and active K stars.
While their radii is above model predictions their Teff are in better agreement with models.
