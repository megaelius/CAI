The vertical distribution of dust in debris disks is sensitive to the number and size of large planetesimals
dynamically stirring the disk, and is therefore well-suited for constraining the prevalence of
otherwise unobservable Uranus and Neptune analogs. Information regarding stirring bodies has
previously been inferred from infrared and optical observations of debris disk vertical structure,
but theoretical works predict that the small particles traced by short-wavelength observations
will be `puffed up' by radiation pressure, yielding only upper limits. The large grains that dominate
the disk emission at millimeter wavelengths are much less sensitive to the effects of stellar radiation
or stellar winds, and therefore trace the underlying mass distribution more directly. Here we present
ALMA 1.3 mm dust continuum observations of the debris disk around the nearby M star AU Mic. The 3 au
spatial resolution of the observations, combined with the favorable edge-on geometry of the system,
allows us to measure the vertical thickness of the disk. We report a scale height-to-radius aspect
ratio of $h = 0.031_{-0.004}^{+0.005}$ between radii of $\sim 23$ au and $\sim 41$ au. Comparing
this aspect ratio to a theoretical model of size-dependent velocity distributions in the collisional
cascade, we find that the perturbing bodies embedded in the local disk must be larger than about 400
km, and the largest perturbing body must be smaller than roughly 1.8 M$_\odot$. These measurements
rule out the presence of a gas giant or Neptune analog near the $\sim 40$ au outer edge of the debris
ring, but are suggestive of large planetesimals or an Earth-sized planet stirring the dust distribution.
