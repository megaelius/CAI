RRab stars are large amplitude pulsating stars in which the pulsation is associated with strong
shock wake propagating in the atmosphere. The objective of this study is to provide a general overview
of the dynamical structure of the atmosphere occurring over a typical pulsation cycle. We report
new high-resolution observations with high time resolution of H$\alpha$ and sodium lines in the
brightest RR Lyrae star of the sky: RR Lyr (HD 182989). A detailed analysis of line profile variations
over the whole pulsation cycle is performed to understand the dynamical structure of the atmosphere.
The main shock wave appears when it exits from the photosphere at $\varphi\simeq0.89$, i.e., when
the main H$\alpha$ emission is observed. Whereas the acceleration phase of the shock is not observed,
a significant deceleration of the shock front velocity is clearly present. The radiative stage
of the shock wave is short: $4\%$ of the pulsation period ($0.892<\varphi<0.929$). A Mach number
$M>10$ is required to get such a radiative shock. The sodium layer reaches its maximum expansion
well before that of H$\alpha$ ($\Delta\varphi=0.135$). Thus, a rarefaction wave is induced between
the H$\alpha$ and sodium layers. A strong atmospheric compression occurring around $\varphi=0.36$,
which produces the third H$\alpha$ emission, takes place in the highest part of the atmosphere.
The region located lower in the atmosphere where the sodium line is formed is not involved. The amplification
of gas turbulence seems mainly due to strong shock waves propagating in the atmosphere rather than
to the global compression of the atmosphere caused by the pulsation. It has not yet been clearly established
whether the microturbulence velocity increases or decreases with height in the atmosphere. Furthermore,
it seems very probable that an interstellar component is visible within the sodium profile.
