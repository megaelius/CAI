The advent of large surveys is making possible the unravelling of the mass assembly history of the
Milky Way. Studies of the kinematics and chemical compositions of Galactic globular clusters (GCs)
enable the reconstruction of the history of star formation, chemical evolution, and mass assembly
of the Galaxy. Using the latest data release (DR16) of the SDSS/APOGEE survey, we identify 3,090
stars associated with 46 GCs. Using a previously defined kinematic association, we break the sample
down into eight separate groups and examine how the kinematics-based classification maps into
chemical composition space, considering only $\alpha$ (mostly Si and Mg) elements and Fe. Our results
show that: (i) The loci of both in situ and accreted subgroups in chemical space match those of their
field counterparts; (ii) GCs from different individual accreted subgroups occupy the same locus
in chemical space. This could either mean that they share a similar origin or that they are associated
with distinct satellites which underwent similar chemical enrichment histories; (iii) The chemical
compositions of the GCs associated with the low orbital energy subgroup defined by Massari and collaborators
is broadly consistent with an in situ origin. However, at the low metallicity end, the distinction
between accreted and in situ populations is blurred; (iv) Regarding the status of GCs whose origin
is ambiguous, we conclude the following: the position in Si-Fe plane suggests an in situ}origin
for Liller 1 and a likely accreted origin for NGC 5904 and NGC 6388. The case of NGC 288 is unclear, as
its orbital properties suggest an accretion origin, its chemical composition suggests it may have
formed in situ.
