We present a high-sensitivity ($1\sigma<1.6~\mathrm{mJy~beam^{-1}}$) continuum observation
in a 343 arcmin$^2$ area of the northeast region in the Small Magellanic Cloud at a wavelength of 1.1
mm, conducted using the AzTEC instrument on the ASTE telescope. In the observed region, we identified
20 objects by contouring $10\sigma$ emission. Through spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis
using 1.1 mm, $Herschel$, and $Spitzer$ data, we estimated the gas masses of $5\times 10^3-7\times
10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 1000. Dust temperature and the index
of emissivity were also estimated as $18-33$ K and $0.9-1.9$, respectively, which are consistent
with previous low resolution studies. The relation between dust temperature and the index of emissivity
shows a weak negative linear correlation. We also investigated five CO-detected dust-selected
clouds in detail. The total gas masses were comparable to those estimated from the Mopra CO data,
indicating that the assumed gas-to-dust ratio of 1000 and the $X_\mathrm{CO}$ factor of $1\times10^{21}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}~(K~km~s^{-1})^{-1}}$,
with uncertainties of a factor of 2, are reliable for the estimation of the gas masses of molecular
or dust-selected clouds. Dust column density showed good spatial correlation with CO emission,
except for an object that associates with bright young stellar objects. The $8~\mathrm{\mu m}$
filamentary and clumpy structures also showed similar spatial distribution with the CO emission
and dust column density, supporting the fact that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions arise
from the surfaces of dense gas and dust clouds.
