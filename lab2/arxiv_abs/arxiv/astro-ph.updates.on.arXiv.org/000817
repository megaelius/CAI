A fraction of galaxy clusters host diffuse radio sources called radio halos, radio relics and mini-halos.
We present the sample and first results from the Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS)- an extension
of the GMRT Radio Halo Survey (GRHS, Venturi et al. 2007, 2008). It is a systematic radio survey of
galaxy clusters selected from the REFLEX and eBCS X-ray catalogs . Analysis of GMRT data at 610/ 235/
325 MHz on 12 galaxy clusters are presented. We report the detection of a newly discovered mini-halo
in the cluster RXJ1532.9+3021 at 610 MHz. A small scale relic (~200 kpc) is suspected in the cluster
Z348. We do not detect cluster-scale diffuse emission in 11 clusters. Robust upper limits on the
detection of radio halo of size of 1 Mpc are determined. We also present upper limits on the detections
of mini-halos in a sub-sample of cool-core clusters. The upper limits for radio halos and mini-halos
are plotted in the radio power- X-ray luminosity plane and the correlations are discussed. Diffuse
extended emission, not related to the target clusters, but detected as by-products in the sensitive
images of two of the cluster fields (A689 and RXJ0439.0+0715) are reported. Based on the information
about the presence of radio halos (or upper limits), available on 48 clusters out of the total sample
of 67 clusters (EGRHS+GRHS), we find that ~23% of the clusters host radio halos. The radio halo fraction
rises to ~31%, when only the clusters with X-ray luminosities >8x10^44 erg/s are considered.
Mini-halos are found in ~50 % of cool-core clusters. A qualitative examination of the X-ray images
of the clusters with no diffuse radio emission indicates that a majority of these clusters do not
show extreme dynamical disturbances and supports the idea that mergers play an important role in
the generation of radio halos/relics.
