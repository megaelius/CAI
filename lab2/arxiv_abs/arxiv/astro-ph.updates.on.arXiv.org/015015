SPIRou is the newest spectropolarimeter and high-precision velocimeter that has recently been
installed at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii. It operates in the near-infrared
and simultaneously covers the 0.98-2.35 {\mu}m domain at high spectral resolution. SPIRou is optimized
for exoplanet search and characterization with the radial-velocity technique, and for polarization
measurements in stellar lines and subsequent magnetic field studies. The host of the transiting
hot Jupiter HD 189733 b has been observed during early science runs. We present the first near-infrared
spectropolarimetric observations of the planet-hosting star as well as the stellar radial velocities
as measured by SPIRou throughout the planetary orbit and two transit sequences. The planetary orbit
and Rossiter-McLaughlin anomaly are both investigated and modeled. The orbital parameters and
obliquity are all compatible with the values found in the optical. The obtained radial-velocity
precision is compatible with about twice the photon-noise estimates for a K2 star under these conditions.
The additional scatter around the orbit, of about 8 m/s, agrees with previous results that showed
that the activity-induced scatter is the dominant factor. We analyzed the polarimetric signal,
Zeeman broadening, and chromospheric activity tracers such as the 1083nm HeI and the 1282nm Pa\b{eta}
lines to investigate stellar activity. First estimates of the average unsigned magnetic flux from
the Zeeman broadening of the FeI lines give a magnetic flux of 290+-58 G, and the large-scale longitudinal
field shows typical values of a few Gauss. These observations illustrate the potential of SPIRou
for exoplanet characterization and magnetic and stellar activity studies.
