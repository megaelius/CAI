Recently, we demonstrated how an astrophotonic light reformatting device, based on a multicore
fibre photonic lantern and a three-dimensional waveguide component, can be used to efficiently
reformat the point spread function of a telescope to a diffraction-limited psuedo-slit [arXiv:1512.07309].
Here, we demonstrate how such a device can also efficiently mitigate modal noise -- a potential source
of instability in high resolution multi-mode fibre-fed spectrographs). To investigate the modal
noise performance of the photonic reformatter, we have used it to feed light into a bench-top near-infrared
spectrograph (R {\approx} 9,500, {\lambda} {\approx} 1550 nm). One approach to quantifying the
modal noise involved the use of broadband excitation light and a statistical analysis of how the
overall measured spectrum was affected by variations in the input coupling conditions. This approach
indicated that the photonic reformatter could reduce modal noise by a factor of six when compared
to a multi-mode fibre with a similar number of guided modes. Another approach to quantifying the
modal noise involved the use of multiple spectrally narrow lines, and an analysis of how the measured
barycentres of these lines were affected by variations in the input coupling. Using this approach,
the photonic reformatter was observed to suppress modal noise to the level necessary to obtain spectra
with stability close to that observed when using a single mode fibre feed. These results demonstrate
the potential of using photonic reformatters to enable efficient multi-mode spectrographs that
operate at the diffraction limit and are free of modal noise, with potential applications including
radial velocity measurements of M-dwarfs.
