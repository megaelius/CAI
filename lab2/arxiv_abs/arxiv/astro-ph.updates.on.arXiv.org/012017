Based on the SDSS and SDSS-WISE quasar datasets, we put forward two schemes to estimate the photometric
redshifts of quasars. Our schemes are based on the idea that the samples are firstly classified into
subsamples by a classifier and then photometric redshift estimation of different subsamples is
performed by a regressor. Random Forest is adopted as the core algorithm of the classifiers, while
Random Forest and kNN are applied as the key algorithms of regressors. The samples are divided into
two subsamples and four subsamples depending on the redshift distribution. The performance based
on different samples, different algorithms and different schemes are compared. The experimental
results indicate that the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for the two schemes generally
improve to some extent compared to the original scheme in terms of the percents in \frac{|\Delta
z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.1 and \frac{|\Delta z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.2 and mean absolute error. Only given the
running speed, kNN shows its superiority to Random Forest. The performance of Random Forest is a
little better than or comparable to that of kNN with the two datasets. The accuracy based on the SDSS-WISE
sample outperforms that based on the SDSS sample no matter by kNN or by Random Forest. More information
from more bands is considered and helpful to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation.
Evidently it can be found that our strategy to estimate photometric redshift is applicable and may
be applied to other datasets or other kinds of objects. Only talking about the percent in \frac{|\Delta
z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.3, there is still large room for further improvement in the photometric redshift
estimation.
