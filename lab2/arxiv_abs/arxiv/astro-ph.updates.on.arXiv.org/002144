We employ the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility's near-infrared spectrograph SpeX at 0.8-2.4$\mu$m
to investigate the spatial distribution of the stellar populations (SPs) in four well known Starburst
galaxies: NGC34, NGC1614, NGC3310 and NGC7714. We use the STARLIGHT code updated with the synthetic
simple stellar populations models computed by Maraston (2005, M05). Our main results are that the
NIR light in the nuclear surroundings of the galaxies is dominated by young/intermediate age SPs
($t \leq 2\times10^9$yr), summing from $\sim$40\% up to 100\% of the light contribution. In the
nuclear aperture of two sources (NGC1614 and NGC3310) we detected a predominant old SP component
($t > 2\times10^9$yr), while for NGC34 and NGC7714 the younger component prevails. Furthermore,
we found evidence of a circumnuclear star formation ring-like structure and a secondary nucleus
in NGC1614, in agreement with previous studies. We also suggest that the merger/interaction experienced
by three of the galaxies studied, NGC1614, NGC3310 and NGC7714 can explain the lower metallicity
values derived for the young SP component of these sources. In this scenario the fresh unprocessed
metal poorer gas from the destroyed/interacting companion galaxy is driven to the centre of the
galaxies and mixed with the central region gas, before star formation takes place. In order to deepen
our analysis, we performed the same procedure of SP synthesis using Maraston (2011, M11) EPS models.
Our results show that the newer and higher resolution M11 models tend to enhance the old/intermediate
age SP contribution over the younger ages.
