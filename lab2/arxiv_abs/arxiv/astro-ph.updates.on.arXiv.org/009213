We have calculated the figure of equilibrium of a rapidly rotating, differentiated body to determine
the shape, structure, and composition of the dwarf planet Haumea. Previous studies of Haumea's
light curve have suggested Haumea is a uniform triaxial ellipsoid consistent with a Jacobi ellipsoid
with axes $\approx 960 \times 774 \times 513$ km, and bulk density $\approx 2600 \, {\rm kg} \, {\rm
m}^{-3}$. In contrast, observations of a recent stellar occultation by Haumea indicate its axes
are $\approx 1161 \times 852 \times 523$ km and its bulk density $\approx 1885 \, {\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$;
these results suggest that Haumea cannot be a fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium and must be partially
supported by interparticle forces. We have written a code to reconcile these contradictory results
and to determine if Haumea is in fact a fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium. The code calculates the
equilibrium shape, density, and ice crust thickness of a differentiated Haumea after imposing
(semi-) axes lengths $a$ and $b$. We find Haumea is consistent with a differentiated triaxial ellipsoid
fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium with axes of best fit $a$ = 1050 km, $b$ = 840 km, and $c$ = 537 km. This
solution for Haumea has $\rho_{\rm avg} = 2018 \, {\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$, $\rho_{\rm core} = 2680
\, {\rm kg} \, {\rm m}^{-3}$, and core axes $a_{\rm c} = 883$ km, $b_{\rm c} = 723$ km, and $c_{\rm c}=470$
km, which equates to an ice mantle comprising $\sim 17\%$ of Haumea's volume and ranging from 67 to
167 km in thickness. The thick ice crust we infer allows for Haumea's collisional family to represent
only a small fraction of Haumea's pre-collisional ice crust. For a wide range of parameters, the
core density we calculate for Haumea suggests that today the core is composed of hydrated silicates
and likely underwent serpentinization in the past.
