We report on $g$, $r$ and $i$ band observations of the Interstellar Object 'Oumuamua (1I) taken on
2017 October 29 from 04:28 to 08:40 UTC by the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m telescope's ARCTIC
camera. We find that 1I's colors are $g-r=0.41\pm0.24$ and $r-i=0.23\pm0.25$, consistent with
the visible spectra of Masiero (2017), Ye et al. (2017) and Fitzsimmons et al. (2017), and most comparable
to the population of Solar System C/D asteroids, Trojans, or comets. We find no evidence of any cometary
activity at a heliocentric distance of 1.46 au, approximately 1.5 months after 1I's closest approach
distance to the Sun. Significant brightness variability was seen in the $r$ observations, with
the object becoming notably brighter towards the end of the run. By combining our APO photometric
time series data with the Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) data of Knight et al. (2017), taken 20
h later on 2017 October 30, we construct an almost complete light curve with a most probable lightcurve
period of $P \simeq 4~{\rm h}$. Our results imply a double peaked rotation period of 8.1 $\pm$ 0.02
h, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.5 - 2.1 mags. Assuming that 1I's shape can be approximated by
an ellipsoid, the amplitude constraint implies that 1I has an axial ratio of 3.5 to 10.3, which is
strikingly elongated. Assuming that 1I is rotating above its critical break up limit, our results
are compatible with 1I having having modest cohesive strength and may have obtained its elongated
shape during a tidal disruption event before being ejected from its home system. Astrometry useful
for constraining 1I's orbit was also obtained and published in Weaver et al. (2017).
