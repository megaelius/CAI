On 2018 Feb. 4.41, the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) discovered ASASSN-18bt
in the K2 Campaign 16 field. With a redshift of z=0.01098 and a peak apparent magnitude of B_{max}=14.31,
ASASSN-18bt is the nearest and brightest SNe Ia yet observed by the Kepler spacecraft. Here we present
the discovery of ASASSN-18bt, the K2 light curve, and pre-discovery data from ASAS-SN and the Asteroid
Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). The K2 early-time light curve has an unprecedented
30-minute cadence and photometric precision for an SN~Ia light curve, and it unambiguously shows
a ~4 day nearly linear phase followed by a steeper rise. Thus, ASASSN-18bt joins a growing list of
SNe Ia whose early light curves are not well described by a single power law. We show that a double-power-law
model fits the data reasonably well, hinting that two physical processes must be responsible for
the observed rise. However, we find that current models of the interaction with a non-degenerate
companion predict an abrupt rise and cannot adequately explain the initial, slower linear phase.
Instead, we find that existing, published models with shallow 56Ni are able to span the observed
behavior and, with tuning, may be able to reproduce the ASASSN-18bt light curve. Regardless, more
theoretical work is needed to satisfactorily model this and other early-time SNe~Ia light curves.
Finally, we use Swift X-ray non-detections to constrain the presence of circumstellar material
(CSM) at much larger distances and lower densities than possible with the optical light curve. For
a constant density CSM these non-detections constrain rho<4.5 * 10^5 cm^-3 at a radius of 4 *10^15
cm from the progenitor star. Assuming a wind-like environment, we place mass-loss limits of Mdot<
8 * 10^-6 M_sun yr^-1 for v_w=100 km s^-1, ruling out some symbiotic progenitor systems.
