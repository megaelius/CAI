Accurate analyses of present and next-generation galaxy surveys require new ways to handle effects
of non-linear gravitational structure formation in data. To address these needs we present an extension
of our previously developed algorithm for Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies to analyse
matter clustering at non-linear scales in observations. This is achieved by incorporating a numerical
particle mesh model of structure formation into our Bayesian inference framework. The algorithm
simultaneously infers the 3D primordial matter fluctuations from which present non-linear observations
formed and provides reconstructions of velocity fields and structure formation histories. The
physical forward modelling approach automatically accounts for non-Gaussian features in evolved
matter density fields and addresses the redshift space distortion problem associated with peculiar
motions of galaxies. Our algorithm employs a hierarchical Bayes approach to jointly account for
observational effects, such as galaxy biases, selection effects, and noise. Corresponding parameters
are marginalized out via a sophisticated Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach relying on a combination
of a multiple block sampling framework and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. We demonstrate the
performance of the method by applying it to the 2M++ galaxy compilation, tracing the matter distribution
of the Nearby Universe. We show accurate and detailed inferences of the 3D non-linear dark matter
distribution of the Nearby Universe. As exemplified in the case of the Coma cluster, we provide mass
estimates that are compatible with those obtained from weak lensing and X-ray observations. For
the first time, we reconstruct the vorticity of the non-linear velocity field from observations.
In summary, our method provides plausible and detailed inferences of dark matter and velocity fields
of our cosmic neighbourhood.
