We present measurements of the $E$-mode polarization angular auto-power spectrum ($EE$) and temperature-$E$-mode
cross-power spectrum ($TE$) of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) using 150 GHz data from three
seasons of SPTpol observations. We report the power spectra over the spherical harmonic multipole
range $50 < \ell \leq 8000$, and detect nine acoustic peaks in the $EE$ spectrum with high signal-to-noise
ratio. These measurements are the most sensitive to date of the $EE$ and $TE$ power spectra at $\ell
> 1050$ and $\ell > 1475$, respectively. The observations cover 500 deg$^2$, a fivefold increase
in area compared to previous SPTpol analyses, which increases our sensitivity to the photon diffusion
damping tail of the CMB power spectra enabling tighter constraints on \LCDM model extensions. After
masking all sources with unpolarized flux $>50$ mJy we place a 95% confidence upper limit on residual
polarized point-source power of $D_\ell = \ell(\ell+1)C_\ell/2\pi <0.107\,\mu{\rm K}^2$ at
$\ell=3000$, suggesting that the $EE$ damping tail dominates foregrounds to at least $\ell = 4050$
with modest source masking. We find that the SPTpol dataset is in mild tension with the $\Lambda CDM$
model ($2.1\,\sigma$), and different data splits prefer parameter values that differ at the $\sim
1\,\sigma$ level. When fitting SPTpol data at $\ell < 1000$ we find cosmological parameter constraints
consistent with those for $Planck$ temperature. Including SPTpol data at $\ell > 1000$ results
in a preference for a higher value of the expansion rate ($H_0 = 71.3 \pm 2.1\,\mbox{km}\,s^{-1}\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$
) and a lower value for present-day density fluctuations ($\sigma_8 = 0.77 \pm 0.02$).
