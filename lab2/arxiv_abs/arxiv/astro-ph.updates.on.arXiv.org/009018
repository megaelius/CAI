Gaia-DR2 has provided an unprecedented number of white dwarf candidates of our Galaxy. In particular,
it is estimated that Gaia-DR2 has observed nearly 400,000 of these objects and close to 18,000 up
to 100 pc from the Sun. This large quantity of data requires a thorough analysis in order to uncover
their main Galactic population properties, in particular the thin and thick disk and halo components.
Taking advantage of recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques, we make use of
a detailed Random Forest algorithm to analyse an 8-dimensional space (equatorial coordinates,
parallax, proper motion components and photometric magnitudes) of accurate data provided by Gaia-DR2
within 100 pc from the Sun. With the aid of a thorough and robust population synthesis code we simulated
the different components of the Galactic white dwarf population to optimize the information extracted
from the algorithm for disentangling the different population components. The algorithm is first
tested in a known simulated sample achieving an accuracy of 85.3%. Our methodology is thoroughly
compared to standard methods based on kinematic criteria demonstrating that our algorithm substantially
improves previous approaches. Once trained, the algorithm is then applied to the Gaia-DR2 100 pc
white dwarf sample, identifying 12,227 thin disk, 1,410 thick disk and 95 halo white dwarf candidates,
which represent a proportion of 74:25:1, respectively. Hence, the numerical spatial densities
are $(3.6\pm0.4)\times10^{-3}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$, $(1.2\pm0.4)\times10^{-3}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$
and $(4.8\pm0.4)\times10^{-5}\,{\rm pc^{-3}}$ for the thin disk, thick disk and halo components,
respectively. The populations thus obtained represent the most complete and volume-limited samples
to date of the different components of the Galactic white dwarf population.
