The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is under construction to measure the expansion
history of the universe using the baryon acoustic oscillations technique. The spectra of 35 million
galaxies and quasars over 14,000 square degrees will be measured during a 5-year survey. A new prime
focus corrector for the Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory will deliver light to
5,000 individually targeted fiber-fed robotic positioners. The fibers in turn feed ten broadband
multi-object spectrographs. We describe the ProtoDESI experiment, that was installed and commissioned
on the 4-m Mayall telescope from August 14 to September 30, 2016. ProtoDESI was an on-sky technology
demonstration with the goal to reduce technical risks associated with aligning optical fibers
with targets using robotic fiber positioners and maintaining the stability required to operate
DESI. The ProtoDESI prime focus instrument, consisting of three fiber positioners, illuminated
fiducials, and a guide camera, was installed behind the existing Mosaic corrector on the Mayall
telescope. A Fiber View Camera was mounted in the Cassegrain cage of the telescope and provided feedback
metrology for positioning the fibers. ProtoDESI also provided a platform for early integration
of hardware with the DESI Instrument Control System that controls the subsystems, provides communication
with the Telescope Control System, and collects instrument telemetry data. Lacking a spectrograph,
ProtoDESI monitored the output of the fibers using a Fiber Photometry Camera mounted on the prime
focus instrument. ProtoDESI was successful in acquiring targets with the robotically positioned
fibers and demonstrated that the DESI guiding requirements can be met.
