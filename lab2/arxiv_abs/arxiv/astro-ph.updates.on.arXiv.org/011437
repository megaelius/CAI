Many phenomenologically successful cosmological galaxy formation simulations employ kinetic
winds to model galactic outflows, a crucial ingredient in obtaining predictions that agree with
various observations. Yet systematic studies of how variations in kinetic wind scalings might
alter observable galaxy properties are rare. Here we employ GADGET-3 simulations to study how the
baryon cycle, stellar mass function, and other galaxy and CGM predictions vary as a function of the
assumed outflow speed $v_w$ and the scaling of the mass loading factor $\eta$ with velocity dispersion
$\sigma$. We design our fiducial model to reproduce the measured wind properties at 25% of the virial
radius from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations. We find that a strong dependence
of $\eta \sim \sigma^5$ in low mass haloes with $\sigma < 106\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ is required to
match the faint end of the stellar mass functions at $z > 1$. The wind speed also has a major impact,
with faster winds significantly reducing wind recycling and heating more halo gas. Both effects
result in less stellar mass growth in massive haloes and impact high ionization absorption in halo
gas. We cannot simultaneously match the stellar content at $z=2$ and $z=0$ within a single model,
suggesting that an additional feedback source such as AGN might be required in massive galaxies
at lower redshifts, but the amount needed depends strongly on assumptions regarding the outflow
properties. We run a 50 $\mathrm{Mpc/h}$, $2\times576^3$ simulation with our fiducial parameters
and show that it matches a range of star-forming galaxy properties at $z\sim0-2$. In closing, the
results from simulations of galaxy formation are much more sensitive to small changes in the feedback
implementation than to the hydrodynamic technique.
