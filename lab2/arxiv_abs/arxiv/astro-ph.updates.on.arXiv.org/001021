We present a measurement of the correlation function between luminous red galaxies and cool gas
traced by Mg II \lambda \lambda 2796, 2803 absorption, on scales ranging from about 30 kpc to 20 Mpc.
The measurement is based on cross-correlating the positions of about one million red galaxies at
z~0.5 and the flux decrements induced in the spectra of about 10^5 background quasars from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey. We find that: (i) This galaxy-gas correlation reveals a change of slope on scales
of about 1 Mpc, consistent with the expected transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment
to a regime where clustering is dominated by halo-halo correlations. Assuming that, on average,
the distribution of Mg II gas follows that of dark matter up to a gas-to-mass ratio, we find the standard
halo model to provide an accurate description of the gas distribution over three orders of magnitude
in scale. Within this framework we estimate the average host halo mass of luminous red galaxies to
be about 10^{13.5} M_solar, in agreement with other methods. We also find the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio
around LRGs to be consistent with the cosmic value estimated on Mpc scales. Combining our galaxy-gas
correlation and the galaxy-mass correlation function from galaxy-galaxy lensing analyses we
can directly measure the Mg II gas-to-mass ratio as a function of scale and reach the same conclusion.
(ii) From line-width estimates, we show that the velocity dispersion of the gas clouds also shows
the expected 1- and 2-halo behaviors. On large scales the gas distribution follows the Hubble flow,
whereas on small scales we observe the velocity dispersion of the Mg II gas clouds to be lower than
that of collisionless dark matter particles within their host halo. This is in line with the fact
that cool clouds are subject to the pressure of the virialized hot gas.
