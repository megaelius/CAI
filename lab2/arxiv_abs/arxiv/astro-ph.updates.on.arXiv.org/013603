We explore the fundamental relations governing the radial and vertical velocity dispersions of
stars in the Milky Way, from combined studies of complementary surveys including GALAH, LAMOST,
APOGEE, the NASA $Kepler$ and K2 missions, and $Gaia$ DR2. We find that different stellar samples,
even though they target different tracer populations and employ a variety of age estimation techniques,
follow the same set of fundamental relations. We provide the clearest evidence to date that, in addition
to the well-known dependence on stellar age, the velocity dispersions of stars depend on orbital
angular momentum $L_z$, metallicity and height above the plane $|z|$, and are well described by
a multiplicatively separable functional form. The dispersions have a power-law dependence on
age with exponents of 0.441$\pm 0.007$ and 0.251$\pm 0.006$ for $\sigma_z$ and $\sigma_R$ respectively,
and the power law is valid even for the oldest stars. For the solar neighborhood stars, the apparent
break in the power law for older stars, as seen in previous studies, is due to the anti-correlation
of $L_z$ with age. The dispersions decrease with increasing $L_z$ until we reach the Sun's orbital
angular momentum, after which $\sigma_z$ increases (implying flaring in the outer disc) while
$\sigma_R$ flattens. The dispersions increase with decreasing metallicity, suggesting that
the dispersions increase with birth radius. The dispersions also increase linearly with $|z|$.
The same set of relations that work in the solar neighborhood also work for stars between $3<R/{\rm
kpc}<20$. Finally, the high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars follow the same relations as the low-[$\alpha$/Fe]
stars.
