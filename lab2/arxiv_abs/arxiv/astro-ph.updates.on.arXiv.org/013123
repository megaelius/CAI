Evidence for the emergence of twisted flux tubes into the solar atmosphere has, so far, come from
indirect signatures. In this work, we investigate the topological input of twisted flux tube emergence
directly by studying helicity and winding fluxes. In magnetohydrodynamic simulations with domains
spanning from the top of the convection zone to the lower corona, we simulate the emergence of twisted
flux tubes with a range of different initial field strengths. One important feature of this work
is the inclusion of a convectively-unstable layer beneath the photosphere. We find approximately
self-similar behaviour in the helicity input for the different field strengths considered. As
the tubes rise and reach the photosphere, there is a strong input of negative helicity since we consider
left-handed twisted tubes. This phase is then followed by a reduction of the negative input and,
for low initial field strengths, a net positive helicity input. This phase corresponds to the growing
influence of convection on the field and the development of serpentine field structures during
emergence. The winding flux can be used to detect when the twisted cores of the tubes reach the photosphere,
giving clear information about the input of topologically complex magnetic field into the solar
atmosphere. In short, the helicity and winding fluxes can provide much information about how a magnetic
field emerges that is not directly available from other sources, such as magnetograms. In evaulating
the helicity content of these simualtions we test numerous means for creating synthetic magnetograms,
including methods which acount for both the evolving geometry and the finite extent of the photosphere.
Whilst the general qualitative behaviours are same in each case, the different forms of averaging
do affect the helicity and winding inputs quantitatively.
