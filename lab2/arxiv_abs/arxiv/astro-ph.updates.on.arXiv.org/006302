We use the photon flux and absorption tracer algorithm presented in Katz et al. 2018, to characterise
the contribution of haloes of different mass and stars of different age and metallicity to the reionization
of the Universe. We employ a suite of cosmological multifrequency radiation hydrodynamics AMR
simulations that are carefully calibrated to reproduce a realistic reionization history and galaxy
properties at $z \geq 6$. In our simulations, haloes with mass $10^9{\rm M_{\odot}}h^{-1}<M<10^{10}{\rm
M_{\odot}}h^{-1}$, stars with metallicity $10^{-3}Z_{\odot}<Z<10^{-1.5}Z_{\odot}$, and
stars with age $3\,{\rm Myr} < t < 10 \, {\rm Myr}$ dominate reionization by both mass and volume. We
show that the sources that reionize most of the volume of the Universe by $z=6$ are not necessarily
the same sources that dominate the meta-galactic UV background at the same redshift. We further
show that in our simulations, the contribution of each type of source to reionization is not uniform
across different gas phases. The IGM, CGM, filaments, ISM, and rarefied supernova heated gas have
all been photoionized by different classes of sources. Collisional ionisation contributes at
both the lowest and highest densities. In the early stages of the formation of individual HII bubbles,
reionization proceeds with the formation of concentric shells of gas ionised by different classes
of sources, leading to large temperature variations as a function of galacto-centric radius. The
temperature structure of individual HII bubbles may thus give insight into the star formation history
of the galaxies acting as the first ionising sources. Our explorative simulations highlight how
the complex nature of reionization can be better understood by using our photon tracer algorithm.
