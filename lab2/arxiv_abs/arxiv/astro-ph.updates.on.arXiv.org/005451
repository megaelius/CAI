We outline a mechanism that explains the observed lack of circumbinary planets (CBPs) via coupled
stellar-tidal evolution of isolated binary stars. Tidal forces between low-mass, short-period
binary stars on the pre-main sequence slow the stellar rotations, transferring rotational angular
momentum to the orbit as the stars approach the tidally locked state. This transfer increases the
binary orbital period, expanding the region of dynamical instability around the binary, and destabilizing
CBPs that tend to preferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After
the stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking can significantly
shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of dynamical stability, over time impacting where
surviving CBPs are observed relative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of
parameter space and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most plausible
initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major axis doubles from its initial
value. We examine the dynamical and observable consequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical
instability limit by running N-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and find that
typically, at least one planet is ejected from the system. We apply our theory to the shortest period
{\it Kepler} binary that possesses a CBP, Kepler-47, and find that its existence is consistent with
our model. Under conservative assumptions, we find that coupled stellar-tidal evolution of pre-main
sequence binary stars removes at least one close-in CBP in $87\%$ of multi-planet circumbinary
systems.
