The study of Earth-mass extrasolar planets via the radial-velocity technique and the measurement
of the potential cosmological variability of fundamental constants call for very-high-precision
spectroscopy at the level of $\updelta\lambda/\lambda<10^{-9}$. Wavelength accuracy is obtained
by providing two fundamental ingredients: 1) an absolute and information-rich wavelength source
and 2) the ability of the spectrograph and its data reduction of transferring the reference scale
(wavelengths) to a measurement scale (detector pixels) in a repeatable manner. The goal of this
work is to improve the wavelength calibration accuracy of the HARPS spectrograph by combining the
absolute spectral reference provided by the emission lines of a thorium-argon hollow-cathode
lamp (HCL) with the spectrally rich and precise spectral information of a Fabry-P\'erot-based
calibration source. On the basis of calibration frames acquired each night since the Fabry-P\'erot
etalon was installed on HARPS in 2011, we construct a combined wavelength solution which fits simultaneously
the thorium emission lines and the Fabry-P\'erot lines. The combined fit is anchored to the absolute
thorium wavelengths, which provide the `zero-point' of the spectrograph, while the Fabry-P\'erot
lines are used to improve the (spectrally) local precision. The obtained wavelength solution is
verified for auto-consistency and tested against a solution obtained using the HARPS Laser-Frequency
Comb (LFC). The combined thorium+Fabry-P\'erot wavelength solution shows significantly better
performances compared to the thorium-only calibration. The presented techniques will therefore
be used in the new HARPS and HARPS-N pipeline, and will be exported to the ESPRESSO spectrograph.
