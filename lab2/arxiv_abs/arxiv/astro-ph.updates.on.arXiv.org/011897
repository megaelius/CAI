In 2019 the International System of units (SI) conceptually re-invented itself. This was necessary
because quantum-electronic devices had become so precise that the old SI could no longer calibrate
them. The new system defines values of fundamental constants (including $c,h,k,e$ but not $G$)
and allows units to be realized from the defined constants through any applicable equation of physics.
In this new and more abstract SI, units can take on new guises --- for example, the kilogram is at present
best implemented as a derived electrical unit. Relevant to astronomy, however, is that several
formerly non-SI units, such as electron-volts, light-seconds, and what we may call "gravity seconds"
$GM/c^3$, can now be interpreted not as themselves units, but as shorthand for volts and seconds
being used with particular equations of physics. Moreover, the classical astronomical units have
exact and rather convenient equivalents in the new SI: zero AB magnitude amounts to $\simeq5\times10^{10}$
photons $\rm m^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ per logarithmic frequency or wavelength interval, $\rm 1\,au\simeq
500$ light-seconds, $\rm 1\,pc\simeq 10^8$ light-seconds, while a solar mass $\simeq5$ gravity-seconds.
As a result, the unit conversions ubiquitous in astrophysics can now be eliminated, without introducing
other problems, as the old-style SI would have done. We review a variety of astrophysical processes
illustrating the simplifications possible with the new-style SI, with special attention to gravitational
dynamics, where care is needed to avoid propagating the uncertainty in $G$. Well-known systems
(GPS satellites, GW170817, and the M87 black hole) are used as examples wherever possible.
