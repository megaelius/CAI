Galaxy clusters appear as extended sources in XMM-Newton images, but not all extended sources are
clusters. So, their proper classification requires visual inspection with optical images, which
is a slow process with biases that are almost impossible to model. We tackle this problem with a novel
approach, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a state-of-the-art image classification
tool, for automatic classification of galaxy cluster candidates. We train the networks on combined
XMM-Newton X-ray observations with their optical counterparts from the all-sky Digitized Sky
Survey. Our data set originates from the X-CLASS survey sample of galaxy cluster candidates, selected
by a specially developed pipeline, the XAmin, tailored for extended source detection and characterisation.
Our data set contains 1 707 galaxy cluster candidates classified by experts. Additionally, we create
an official Zooniverse citizen science project, The Hunt for Galaxy Clusters, to probe whether
citizen volunteers could help in a challenging task of galaxy cluster visual confirmation. The
project contained 1 600 galaxy cluster candidates in total of which 404 overlap with the expert's
sample. The networks were trained on expert and Zooniverse data separately. The CNN test sample
contains 85 spectroscopically confirmed clusters and 85 non-clusters that appear in both data
sets. Our custom network achieved the best performance in the binary classification of clusters
and non-clusters, acquiring accuracy of 90 %, averaged after 10 runs. The results of using CNNs on
combined X-ray and optical data for galaxy cluster candidate classification are encouraging and
there is a lot of potential for future usage and improvements.
