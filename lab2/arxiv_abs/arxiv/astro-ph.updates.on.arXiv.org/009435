Combining the precise parallaxes and optical photometry delivered by ${\it Gaia}$'s second data
release (${\it Gaia}$ DR2) with the photometric catalogues of PanSTARRS-1, 2MASS, and AllWISE,
we derive Bayesian stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions for 265 million stars brighter
than $G=18$. Because of the wide wavelength range used, our results substantially improve the accuracy
and precision of previous extinction and effective temperature estimates. After cleaning our
results for both unreliable input and output data, we retain 137 million stars, for which we achieve
a median precision of $5\%$ in distance, 0.20 mag in $V$-band extinction, and 245 K in effective temperature
for $G\leq14$, degrading towards fainter magnitudes ($12\%$, 0.20 mag, and 245 K at $G=16$; $16\%$,
0.23 mag, and 260 K at $G=17$, respectively). We find a very good agreement with the asteroseismic
surface gravities and distances of 7000 stars in the ${\it Kepler}$ and the ${\it K2}$-C3 and ${\it
K2}$-C6 fields, with stellar parameters from the APOGEE survey, as well as with distances to star
clusters. Our results are available through the ADQL query interface of the ${\it Gaia}$ mirror
at the Leibniz-Institut f\"{u}r Astrophysik Potsdam (${\tt gaia.aip.de}$), and as binary tables
at ${\tt data.aip.de}$. As a first application, in this paper we provide distance- and extinction-corrected
colour-magnitude diagrams, extinction maps as a function of distance, and extensive density maps,
demonstrating the potential of our value-added dataset for mapping the three-dimensional structure
of our Galaxy. In particular, we see a clear manifestation of the Galactic bar in the stellar density
distributions, an observation that can almost be considered a direct imaging of the Galactic bar.
Finally, our results also serve to assess targeting strategies of the future 4MOST spectroscopic
survey.
