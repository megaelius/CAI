The heliocentric redshifts ($z_\mathrm{hel}$) of about 150 Type Ia supernovae in the Pantheon
compilation are significantly discrepant from their corresponding values in the preceeding JLA
compilation --- with 58 having differences between 5 to 137 times the quoted measurement uncertainty.
Both catalogues include corrections to the redshifts and magnitudes of the supernovae to account
for the motion of the heliocentric frame relative to the `CMB rest frame', as well as corrections
for the directionally coherent bulk flow of local galaxies with respect to this frame. The latter
is done employing modelling of peculiar velocities which assume the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological
model but provide evidence for residual bulk flows which are discordant with this model. Until 27
November 2018, these peculiar velocity corrections in the Pantheon catalogue were made at redshifts
exceeding 0.2 although no relevant information to make such corrections is available. We study
the impact of these vexed issues on the $\sim 4\sigma$ discrepancy between the Hubble constant of
$H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5$~km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ inferred assuming $\Lambda$CDM from CMB observations
by Planck, and the measurement of e.g. $H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.4$~km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ by the SH0ES project
which extended the local distance ladder using Type Ia supernovae. Using the same methodology as
the latter study we find that for supernovae whose redshifts are discrepant between Pantheon and
JLA with $\Delta z_\mathrm{hel} > 0.0025$, the Pantheon redshifts favour $H_0 \simeq 72$~km\,s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$,
while the JLA redshifts favour $H_0 \simeq 68$~km\,s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. Thus systematic uncertainties
that apparently still plague supernova cosmology undermine the significance of the claimed `Hubble
tension'.
