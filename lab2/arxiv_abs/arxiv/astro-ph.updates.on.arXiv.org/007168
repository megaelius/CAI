Mapping the underlying density field, including non-visible dark matter, using weak gravitational
lensing measurements is now a standard tool in cosmology. Due to its importance to the science results
of current and upcoming surveys, the quality of the convergence reconstruction methods should
be well understood. We compare three methods: Kaiser-Squires (KS), Wiener filter, and GLIMPSE.
KS is a direct inversion, not accounting for survey masks or noise. The Wiener filter is well-motivated
for Gaussian density fields in a Bayesian framework. GLIMPSE uses sparsity, aiming to reconstruct
non-linearities in the density field. We compare these methods with several tests using public
Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data and realistic DES simulations. The Wiener
filter and GLIMPSE offer substantial improvements over smoothed KS with a range of metrics. Both
the Wiener filter and GLIMPSE convergence reconstructions show a 12 per cent improvement in Pearson
correlation with the underlying truth from simulations. To compare the mapping methods' abilities
to find mass peaks, we measure the difference between peak counts from simulated {\Lambda}CDM shear
catalogues and catalogues with no mass fluctuations (a standard data vector when inferring cosmology
from peak statistics); the maximum signal-to-noise of these peak statistics is increased by a factor
of 3.5 for the Wiener filter and 9 for GLIMPSE. With simulations we measure the reconstruction of
the harmonic phases; the phase residuals' concentration is improved 17 per cent by GLIMPSE and 18
per cent by the Wiener filter. The correlation between reconstructions from data and foreground
redMaPPer clusters is increased 18 per cent by the Wiener filter and 32 per cent by GLIMPSE.
