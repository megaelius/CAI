The PAMELA collaboration recently released the $e^+$ absolute spectrum between 1 and 300 GeV in
addition to the positron fraction and the $e^-$ spectrum previously measured in the same period.
We use the newly developed 3D upgrade of the DRAGON package to model those data. This code allows us
to consider a realistic spiral arm source distribution in the Galaxy, which impacts the high energy
shape of the propagated spectra. At low energy we treat solar modulation with the HelioProp code
and compare its results with those obtained using the usual force-field approximation. We show
that all PAMELA data sets can be consistently, and accurately, described in terms of a standard background
on top of which a charge symmetric $e^+$ + $e^-$ extra-component with harder injection spectrum
is added; this extra contribution is peaked at about 1-10 TeV and may originate from a diffuse population
of sources located in the Galactic arms. For the first time we compute the energy required to sustain
such a relevant positron flux in the Galaxy finding that it is naturally compatible with an astrophysical
origin. We considered several reference setups: we find that models with a low (or null) reacceleration
- tuned against light nuclei data - nicely describe both PAMELA leptonic and hadronic data with no
need to introduce a low energy break in the proton and Helium spectra, as it would be required for high
reacceleration models. We also compare our models with the preliminary $e^-$ and $e^+$ absolute
spectra recently measured by AMS-02. We find that those data, differently from what inferred from
the positron fraction alone, favor a high energy cutoff (about 10 TeV) of the extra-component if
this is uniquely generated in the Galactic arms. A lower cutoff may be allowed if a relevant contribution
from powerful $e^-$ + $e^+$ nearby accelerators (e.g. one or few pulsars) is invoked.
