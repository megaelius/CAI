We study the connection between the observed star formation rate-stellar mass (SFR-$M_*$) relation
and the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) by means of a Subhalo Abundance Matching technique
coupled to merger trees extracted from a N-body simulation. Our approach consist of forcing the
model to match the observed SMF at redshift $z \sim 2.3$, and let it evolve down to $z \sim 0.3$ according
to a $\tau$ model, an exponentially declining functional form which describes the star formation
rate decay of both satellite and central galaxies. In this study, we use three different sets of SMFs:
ZFOURGE data from \cite{tomczak14}; UltraVISTA data from \cite{ilbert13} and COSMOS data from
\cite{davidzon17}. We also build a mock survey combining UltraVISTA with ZFOURGE. Our modelling
of quenching time scales is consistent with the evolution of the SMF down to $z \sim 0.3$, with different
accuracy depending on the particular survey used for calibration. We tested our model against the
observed SMFs at low redshift and it predicts residuals (observation-model) within $1\sigma$
observed scatter along most of the stellar mass range investigated, and with mean residuals below
0.1 dex in the range $\sim [10^{8.7}-10^{11.7}] M_{\odot}$. We then compare the SFR-$M_*$ relation
predicted by the model with the observed one at different redshifts. The predicted SFR-$M_*$ relation
underpredicts the median SFR at fixed stellar mass relative to observations at all redshifts. Nevertheless,
the shapes are consitent with the observed relations up to intermediate mass galaxies, followed
by a rapid decline for massive galaxies.
