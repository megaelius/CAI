We introduce a $\textit{frequency-dependent}$ Doppler and aberration transformation kernel
for the harmonic multipoles of a general cosmological observable with spin weight $s$, Doppler
weight $d$ and arbitrary frequency spectrum. In the context of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
studies, the frequency-dependent formalism allows to correct for the motion-induced aberration
and Doppler effects on individual frequency maps with different masks. It also permits to deboost
background radiations with non-blackbody frequency spectra, like extragalactic foregrounds
and CMB spectra with primordial spectral distortions. The formalism can also be used to correct
individual E and B polarization modes and account for motion-induced E/B mixing of polarized observables
with $d\neq1$ at different frequencies. We apply the generalized aberration kernel on polarized
and unpolarized CMB specific intensity at 100 and 217 GHz and show that the motion-induced effects
typically increase with the frequency of observation. In all-sky CMB experiments, the frequency-dependence
of the motion-induced effects for a blackbody spectrum are overall negligible. However in a cut-sky
analysis, ignoring the frequency dependence can lead to percent level error in the polarized and
unpolarized power spectra over all angular scales. In the specific cut-sky used in our analysis
($b > 45^\circ, f_\text{sky}\simeq14\%$), and for the dipole-inferred velocity $\beta=0.00123$
typically attributed to our peculiar motion, the Doppler and aberration effects can change polarized
and unpolarized power spectra of specific intensity in the CMB rest frame by $1-2\%$, but we find
the polarization cross-leakage between E and B modes to be negligible.
