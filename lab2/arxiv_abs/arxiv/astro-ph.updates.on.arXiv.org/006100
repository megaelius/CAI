The rare case of changing-look (CL) AGNs, with the appearance or disappearance of broad Balmer emission
lines within a few years, challenges our understanding of the AGN unified model. We present a sample
of 21 new CL AGNs at $0.08<z<0.58$, which doubles the number of such objects known to date. These new
CL AGNs were discovered by several ways, from (1) repeat spectra in the SDSS, (2) repeat spectra in
the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and SDSS, and (3) photometric
variability and new spectroscopic observations. We use the photometric data from surveys, including
the SDSS imaging survey, the Pan-STARRS1, the DESI Legacy imaging survey, the Wide-field Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE), the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, and the Palomar Transient Factory.
The estimated upper limits of transition timescale of the CL AGNs in this sample spans from 0.9 to
13 years in the rest frame. The continuum flux in the optical and mid-infrared becomes brighter when
the CL AGNs turn on, or vice versa. Variations of more than 0.2 mag in $W1$ band were detected in 15 CL
AGNs during the transition. The optical and mid-infrared variability is not consistent with the
scenario of variable obscuration in 10 CL AGNs at more than $3\sigma$ confidence level. We confirm
a bluer-when-brighter trend in the optical. However, the mid-infrared WISE colors $W1-W2$ become
redder when the objects become brighter in the $W1$ band, possibly due to a stronger hot dust contribution
in the $W2$ band when the AGN activity becomes stronger. The physical mechanism of type transition
is important for understanding the evolution of AGNs.
