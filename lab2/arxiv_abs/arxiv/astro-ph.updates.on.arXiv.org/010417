We report the first detection of galactic spiral structure by means of thermal emission from magnetically
aligned dust grains. Our 89 $\mu$m polarimetric imaging of NGC 1068 with the High-resolution Airborne
Wideband Camera/Polarimeter (HAWC+) on NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy
(SOFIA) also sheds light on magnetic field structure in the vicinity of the galaxy's inner-bar and
active galactic nucleus (AGN). We find correlations between the 89 $\mu$m magnetic field vectors
and other tracers of spiral arms, and a symmetric polarization pattern as a function of the azimuthal
angle arising from the projection and inclination of the disk field component in the plane of the
sky. The observations can be fit with a logarithmic spiral model with pitch angle of $16.9^{+2.7}_{-2.8}$$^{\circ}$
and a disk inclination of $48\pm2^{\circ}$. We infer that the bulk of the interstellar medium from
which the polarized dust emission originates is threaded by a magnetic field that closely follows
the spiral arms. Inside the central starburst disk ($<1.6$ kpc), the degree of polarization is found
to be lower than for far-infrared sources in the Milky Way, and has minima at the locations of most
intense star formation near the outer ends of the inner-bar. Inside the starburst ring, the field
direction deviates from the model, becoming more radial along the leading edges of the inner-bar.
The polarized flux and dust temperature peak $\sim 3-6''$ NE of the AGN at the location of a bow shock
between the AGN outflow and the surrounding interstellar medium, but the AGN itself is weakly polarized
($< 1$%) at both 53 and 89 $\mu$m.
