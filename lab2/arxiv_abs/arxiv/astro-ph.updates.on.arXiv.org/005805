Despite more than 30 years of searches, the compact object in Supernova (SN) 1987A has not yet been
detected. We present new limits on the compact object in SN 1987A using millimeter, near-infrared,
optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray observations from ALMA, VLT, HST, and Chandra. The limits are approximately
0.1 mJy ($0.1\times 10^{-26}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$) at 213 GHz, 1 Lsun ($6\times 10^{-29}$
erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$) in optical if our line-of-sight is free of ejecta dust, and $10^{36}$
erg s$^{-1}$ ($2\times 10^{-30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$) in 2-10 keV X-rays. Our X-ray
limits are an order of magnitude less constraining than previous limits because we use a more realistic
ejecta absorption model based on three-dimensional neutrino-driven SN explosion models (presented
in an accompanying article). We also investigate the total energy budget and find that the allowed
bolometric luminosity of the compact object is 22 Lsun if our line-of-sight is free of ejecta dust,
or 138 Lsun if dust-obscured. Depending on assumptions, these values limit the effective temperature
of a neutron star to <4-8 MK and do not exclude models, which typically are in the range 3-4 MK. For the
simplest accretion model, the accretion rate for an efficiency $\eta$ is limited to $< 10^{-11}
\eta^{-1}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$, which excludes most predictions. For pulsar activity modeled by a rotating
magnetic dipole in vacuum, the limit on the magnetic field strength ($B$) for a given spin period
($P$) is $B < 10^{14} P^2$ G s$^{-2}$. By combining information about radiation reprocessing and
geometry, it is likely that the compact object is a dust-obscured thermally-emitting neutron star,
which might appear as a point source in the ejecta dust emission.
