We report a strong candidate multiplanetary system found by analyzing a very high-magnification
($A\sim 900$) microlensing event KMT-2019-BLG-1953. A single-lens single-source (1L1S) model
appears to approximately delineate the observed light curve, but the residuals from the model exhibit
small but obvious deviations in the peak region. Although models with a binary lens (2L1S) and binary
source (1L2S) improve the fit, there still remain small residuals from the models, and these residuals
can be explained by either triple-lens (3L1S) or binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) models. Among
the two models, we judge that the 3L1S model provides a more plausible interpretation first because
the signature of the second planet according to the 3L1S solution appears in the region where it is
expected, i.e., around the peak of a very high-magnification event, and second because the 2L2S
model is physically implausible. From the 3L1S modeling, we find four sets of solutions caused by
the close/wide degeneracies in the planet separations from the host, $s_2$ and $s_3$. From Bayesian
analysis, we estimate that the host of the planets has a mass of $M_{\rm host}=0.31^{+0.37}_{-0.17}~M_\odot$
and that the planetary system is located at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=7.04^{+1.10}_{-1.33}~{\rm
kpc}$ toward the Galactic center. The mass of the first planet, $M_2$, is in the range of $0.42 \lesssim
M_2/M_{\rm J}\lesssim 0.62$ and that of the second planet, $M_3$, is in the ranges of $0.27 \lesssim
M_3/M_{\rm J}\lesssim 0.48$ for solutions with $s_3<1.0$ and $2.1 \lesssim M_3/M_{\rm J} \lesssim
2.8$ for solutions with $s_3>1.0$.
