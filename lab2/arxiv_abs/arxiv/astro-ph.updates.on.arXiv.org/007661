In this study we explore the complex multi-phase gas of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding
galaxies. We propose and implement a novel, super-Lagrangian 'CGM zoom' scheme in the moving-mesh
code AREPO, which focuses more resolution into the CGM and intentionally lowers resolution in the
dense ISM. We run two cosmological simulations of the same galaxy halo, once with a simple 'no feedback'
model, and separately with a more comprehensive physical model including galactic-scale outflows
as in the Illustris simulation. Our chosen halo has a total mass of ~10^12 Msun at z ~ 2, and we achieve
a median gas mass (spatial) resolution of ~2,200 solar masses (~95 parsecs) in the CGM, six-hundred
(fourteen) times better than in the Illustris-1 simulation, a higher spatial resolution than any
cosmological simulation at this mass scale to date. We explore the primary channel(s) of cold-phase
CGM gas production in this regime. We find that winds substantially enhance the amount of cold gas
in the halo, also evidenced in the covering fractions of HI and the equivalent widths of MgII out to
large radii, in better agreement with observations than the case without galactic winds. Using
a tracer particle analysis to follow the thermodynamic history of gas, we demonstrate how the majority
of this cold, dense gas arises due to rapid cooling of the wind material interacting with the hot halo,
and how large amounts of cold, ~10^4 K gas can be produced and persist in galactic halos with Tvir ~
10^6 K. At the resolutions presently considered, the quantitative properties of the CGM we explore
are not appreciably affected by the refinement scheme.
