A good constraint of when the growth of dust grains from sub-micrometer to millimeter sizes occurs,
is crucial for planet formation models. This provides the first step towards the production of pebbles
and planetesimals in protoplanetary disks. Currently, it is well established that Class II objects
have large dust grains. However, it is not clear when in the star formation process this grain growth
occurs. We use multi-wavelength millimeter observations of a Class I protostar to obtain the spectral
index of the observed flux densities $\alpha_\mathrm{mm}$ of the unresolved disk and the surrounding
envelope. Our goal is to compare our observational results with visibility modeling at both wavelengths
simultaneously. We present data from NOEMA at 2.7 mm and SMA at 1.3 mm of the Class I protostar, Per-emb-50.
We model the dust emission with a variety of parametric and radiative transfer models to deduce the
grain size from the observed emission spectral index. We find a spectral index in the envelope of
Per-emb-50 of $\alpha_{\rm env}$=$3.3\pm0.3$, similar to the typical ISM values. The radiative
transfer modeling of the source confirms this value of $\alpha_{\rm env}$ with the presence of dust
with a $a_\mathrm{max}$$\leq$100 $\mu$m. Additionally, we explore the backwarming effect, where
we find that the envelope structure affects the millimeter emission of the disk. Our results reveal
grains with a maximum size no larger than $100$ $\mu$m in the inner envelope of the Class I protostar
Per-emb-50, providing an interesting case to test the universality of millimeter grain growth
expected in these sources.
