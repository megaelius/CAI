We present a sample of 131 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at redshifts 0.8<z<1.6
with double peaks in either of the high-ionization narrow emission lines [NeV]3426 or [NeIII]3869.
These sources were selected with the intention of identifying high-redshift analogs of the z<0.8
active galactic nuclei (AGN) with double-peaked [OIII]5007 lines, which might represent AGN outflows
or dual AGN. Lines of high-ionization potential are believed to originate in the inner, highly photoionized
portion of the narrow line region (NLR), and we exploit this assumption to investigate the possible
kinematic origins of the double-peaked lines. For comparison, we measure the [NeV]3426 and [NeIII]3869
double peaks in low-redshift (z<0.8) [OIII]-selected sources. We find that [NeV]3426 and [NeIII]3869
show a correlation between line-splitting and line-width similar to that of [OIII]5007 in other
studies; and the velocity-splittings are correlated with the quasar Eddington ratio. These results
suggest an outflow origin for at least a subset of the double-peaks, allowing us to study the high-ionization
gas kinematics around quasars. However, we find that a non-neligible fraction of our sample show
no evidence for an ionization stratification. For these sources, the outflow scenario is less compelling,
leaving the dual AGN scenario as a viable possibility. Finally, we find that our sample shows an anti-correlation
between the velocity-offset ratio and luminosity ratio of the components, which is a potential
dynamical argument for the presence of dual AGN. Therefore, this study serves as a first attempt
at extending the selection of candidate dual AGN to higher redshifts.
