Despite recent success in forming realistic disc galaxies at redshift zero, simulations still
form the bulk of their stars prematurely. We investigate the process of stellar mass assembly in
low-mass simulated galaxies, a dwarf and a typical spiral, focusing on the effects of radiation
from young stellar clusters. We employ a novel model of star formation in which stars form deterministically
with a small efficiency per free-fall time, as observed in molecular clouds. Stellar feedback includes
radiation pressure from massive stars and energy from supernova explosions and stellar winds.
In galaxies with masses up to those of typical spirals, radiation efficiently suppresses star formation
by dispersing and heating high density gas, mostly in the central regions, preventing the formation
of a massive bulge. Once the galaxies reach this radiation-regulated growth regime, their global
properties are robust to the specific choice of model parameters. Only when radiative feedback
is included, do galaxies exhibit constant or even rising star formation histories, forming more
than 50% of their stars at z<1, an observed phenomenon that has so far eluded analytical and numerical
models. Low-mass galaxies with radiation pressure have a factor of ~100 reduction in the star formation
rate at z = 2, and a factor of ~10 at z = 0.5. We conclude that radiation feedback is the main mechanism
that effectively decouples the growth of the galaxy from that of the DM halo. Radiation does not affect
the total baryon content of galaxies, but instead maintains gas in a warm, low density phase where
it cannot fuel star formation. We find that the fraction of cold baryons within the simulated dwarf
galaxy is 20-30%, in agreement with THINGS. Lastly, unlike SN energy, radiation from massive stars
reduces the central density of the dark matter halo of a galaxy with M_* ~10^8 M_sun, in support of
recent observations.
