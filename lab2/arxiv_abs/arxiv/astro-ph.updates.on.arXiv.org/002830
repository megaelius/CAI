Lomax et al. have constructed an ensemble of 60 prestellar cores having masses, sizes, projected
shapes, temperatures and non-thermal radial velocity dispersions that match, statistically,
the cores in Ophiuchus; and have simulated the evolution of these cores using SPH. Each core has been
evolved once with no radiative feedback from stars, once with continuous radiative feedback, and
once with episodic radiative feedback. Here we analyse the multiplicity statistics from these
simulations. With episodic radiative feedback, (i) the multiplicity frequency is ~60% higher
than in the field; (ii) the multiplicity frequency and the mean semi-major axis both increase with
primary mass; (iii) one third of multiple systems are hierarchical systems with more than two components;
(iv) in these hierarchical systems the inner pairings typically have separations of a few au and
mass ratios concentrated towards unity, whereas the outer pairings have separations of order 100
au and a flatter distribution of mass ratios. The binary statistics are compatible with observations
of young embedded populations, and -- if wider orbits are disrupted preferentially by external
perturbations -- with observations of mature field populations. With no radiative feedback, the
results are similar to those from simulations with episodic feedback. With continuous radiative
feedback, brown dwarfs are under-produced, the number of multiple systems is too low, and the statistical
properties of multiple systems are at variance with observation. This suggests that star formation
in Ophiuchus may only be representative of global star formation if accretion onto protostars,
and hence radiative feedback, is episodic.
