We search for passive galaxies at $z>3$ in the GOODS-South field, using different techniques based
on photometric data, and paying attention to develop methods that are sensitive to objects that
have become passive shortly before the epoch of observation. We use CANDELS HST catalogues, ultra-deep
$Ks$ data and new IRAC photometry, performing spectral energy distribution fitting using models
with abruptly quenched star formation histories. We then single out galaxies which are best fitted
by a passively evolving model, and having only low probability $( < 5 \%)$ star-forming solutions.
We verify the effects of including nebular lines emission, and we consider possible solutions at
different redshifts. The number of selected sources dramatically depends on the models used in
the SED fitting. Without including emission lines and with photometric redshifts fixed at the CANDELS
estimate, we single out 30 candidates; the inclusion of nebular lines emission reduces the sample
to 10 objects; allowing for solutions at different redshifts, only 2 galaxies survive as robust
candidates. Most of the candidates are not far-infrared emitters, corroborating their association
with passive galaxies. Our results translate into an upper limit in the number density of $\sim 0.173$
arcmin$^2$ above the detection limit. However, we conclude that the selection of passive galaxies
at $z>3$ is still subject to significant uncertainties, being sensitive to assumptions in the SED
modeling adopted and to the relatively low S/N of the objects. By means of dedicated simulations,
we show that JWST will greatly enhance the accuracy, allowing for a much more robust classification.
