We study the effects of Kelvin Helmholtz Instability (KHI) on the cold streams that feed massive
halos at high redshift, generalizing our earlier results to include the effects of radiative cooling
and heating from a UV background, using analytic models and high resolution idealized simulations.
We currently do not consider self-shielding, thermal conduction or gravity. A key parameter in
determining the fate of the streams is the ratio of the cooling time in the turbulent mixing layer
which forms between the stream and the background following the onset of the instability, t_{cool,mix},
to the time in which the mixing layer expands to the width of the stream in the non-radiative case,
t_{shear}. This can be converted into a critical stream radius, R_{s,crit}, such that R_{s}/R_{s,crit}=t_{shear}/t_{cool,mix}.
If R_{s}<R_{s,crit}, the non-linear evolution proceeds similarly to the non-radiative case studied
by Mandelker et al. 2019a. If R_{s}>R_{s,crit}, which we find to almost always be the case for astrophysical
cold streams, the stream is not disrupted by KHI. Rather, background mass cools and condenses onto
the stream, and can increase the mass of cold gas by a factor of ~3 within 10 stream sound crossing times.
The entrainment of background mass causes the stream to decelerate and loose kinetic energy, though
the thermal energy lost by the entrained gas dominates over the kinetic energy lost by the stream.
~(10-20)% of the latter is maintained as turbulent and thermal energy within the stream in a steady-state.
The rest of the kinetic and thermal energy losses are radiated away, primarily from gas with T<5x10^4
K, suggesting much of it will be emitted in Ly$\alpha$.
