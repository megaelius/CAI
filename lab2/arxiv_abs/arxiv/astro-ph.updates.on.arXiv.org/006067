2MASX J04035024-0239275 is a bright red elliptical galaxy at redshift 0.0661 that presents two
extended sources at 2\arcsec~to the north-east and 1\arcsec~to the south-west. The sizes and surface
brightnesses of the two blue sources are consistent with a gravitationally-lensed background
galaxy. In this paper we present MUSE observations of this galaxy from the All-weather MUse Supernova
Integral-field Nearby Galaxies (AMUSING) survey, and report the discovery of a background lensed
galaxy at redshift 0.1915, together with other 15 background galaxies at redshifts ranging from
0.09 to 0.9, that are not multiply imaged. We have extracted aperture spectra of the lens and all the
sources and fit the stellar continuum with STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar and emission line
properties. A trace of past merger and active nucleus activity is found in the lensing galaxy, while
the background lensed galaxy is found to be star-forming. Modeling the lensing potential with a
singular isothermal ellipsoid, we find an Einstein radius of 1\farcs45$\pm$0\farcs04, which
corresponds to 1.9 kpc at the redshift of the lens and it is much smaller than its effective radius
($r_{\rm eff}\sim$ 9\arcsec). Comparing the Einstein mass and the STARLIGHT stellar mass within
the same aperture yields a dark matter fraction of $18 \% \pm 8$ \% within the Einstein radius. The
advent of large surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will discover a number
of strong-lensed systems, and here we demonstrate how wide-field integral field spectroscopy
offers an excellent approach to study them and to precisely model lensing effects.
