The structural stratification of a solar-type main sequence star primarily depends on its mass
and chemical composition. The surface heavy element abundances of the solar-type stars are reasonably
well determined using conventional spectroscopy, however the second most abundant element helium
is not. This is due to the fact that the envelope temperature of such stars is not high enough to excite
helium. Since the helium abundance of a star affects its structure and subsequent evolution, the
uncertainty in the helium abundance of a star makes estimates of its global properties (mass, radius,
age etc.) uncertain as well. The detections of the signatures of the acoustic glitches from the precisely
measured stellar oscillation frequencies provide an indirect way to estimate the envelope helium
content. We use the glitch signature caused by the ionization of helium to determine the envelope
helium abundance of 38 stars in the {\it Kepler} seismic LEGACY sample. Our results confirm that
atomic diffusion does indeed take place in solar-type stars. We use the measured surface abundances
in combination with the settling predicted by the stellar models to determine the initial abundances.
The initial helium and metal mass fractions have subsequently been used to get the preliminary estimates
of the primordial helium abundance, $Y_p = 0.244\pm0.019$, and the galactic enrichment ratio,
$\Delta Y / \Delta Z = 1.226\pm0.849$. Although the current estimates have large errorbars due to
the limited sample size, this method holds great promises to determine these parameters precisely
in the era of upcoming space missions.
