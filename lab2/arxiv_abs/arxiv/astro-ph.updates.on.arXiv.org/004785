(abridged) We develop Bayesian methods and detection criteria for orbital fitting, and revise
the detectability of exoplanets in light of the in-flight properties of Gaia. Limiting ourselves
to one-planet systems as a first step of the development, we simulate Gaia data for exoplanet systems
over a grid of S/N, orbital period, and eccentricity. The simulations are then fit using Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods. We investigate the detection rate according to three information criteria
and the delta chi^2. For the delta chi^2, the effective number of degrees of freedom depends on the
mission length. We find that the choice of the Markov chain starting point can affect the quality
of the results; we therefore consider two limit possibilities: an ideal case, and a very simple method
that finds the starting point assuming circular orbits. Using Jeffreys' scale of evidence, the
fraction of false positives passing a strong evidence criterion is < ~0.2% (0.6%) when considering
a 5 yr (10 yr) mission and using the Akaike information criterion or the Watanabe-Akaike information
criterion, and <0.02% (<0.06%) when using the Bayesian information criterion. We find that there
is a 50% chance of detecting a planet with a minimum S/N=2.3 (1.7). This sets the maximum distance
to which a planet is detectable to ~70 pc and ~3.5 pc for a Jupiter-mass and Neptune-mass planet, respectively,
assuming a 10 yr mission, a 4 au semi-major axis, and a 1 M_sun star. The period is the orbital parameter
that can be determined with the best accuracy, with a median relative difference between input and
output periods of 4.2% (2.9%) assuming a 5 yr (10 yr) mission. The median accuracy of the semi-major
axis of the orbit can be recovered with a median relative error of 7% (6%). The eccentricity can also
be recovered with a median absolute accuracy of 0.07 (0.06).
