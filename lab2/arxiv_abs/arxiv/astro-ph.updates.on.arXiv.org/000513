A recent JHKs study of several grand-design spiral galaxies shows a bimodal distribution of their
system of star clusters and star forming complexes in colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams.
In a comparison with stellar population models including gas, the (J-H) vs (H-Ks) diagram reveals
that embedded clusters, still immersed in their parental clouds of gas and dust, generally have
a redder (H-Ks) colour than older clusters, whose gas and dust have already been ejected. This bimodal
behaviour is also evident in the colour-magnitude diagram MK vs (J-Ks), where the brightest clusters
split into two sequences separating younger from older clusters. In addition, the reddening-free
index Qd = (H-Ks) - 0.884 (J-H) has been shown to correlate with age for the young clusters and thus
provided an effective way to differentiate the embedded clusters from the older ones. We aim to study
the behaviour of these photometric indices for star cluster systems in the Local Group. We investigate
the effectiveness of the Qd index in sorting out clusters of different ages at their early evolutionary
stages. Surface photometry was carried out for 2MASS images of populous clusters younger than ~100Myr
whose ages were available. Some clusters, particularly the embedded ones, were studied for the
first time using this method. The integrated magnitudes and colours extracted from the surface
photometry of the most populous clusters/complexes in the Local Group shows the expected bimodal
distribution in the colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams. In particular, we confirm the
index Qd as a powerful tool for distinguishing clusters younger than about 7Myr from older clusters.
