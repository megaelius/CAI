Red sequence galaxies form with an intense burst of star formation in the early universe to evolve
passively into massive, metal rich, old galaxies at z ~ 0. But Abell 1314 (z=0.034) is found to host
almost all red sequence galaxy members -- identified using the mz index, classified using the Principle
Component Analysis technique and SDSS colour correlations -- some of which show properties of low-mass,
star forming, and metal rich galaxies. The variably spread Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) near the
core forms a vital part in influencing the evolution of these members. To study their evolution,
I correlated different parameters of the rest-frame narrowband photometry and the derived luminosity-weighted
mean Single Stellar Population model ages and metallicities. The study finds the member galaxies
evolve differently in three different sections of the cluster: 1. the region of < 200 kpc hosts
passively evolving old, massive systems which accumulate mass by dry, minor mergers, 2. the zone
between 200-500 kpc shows stripped systems (or in the process of being gas stripped) by ram pressure
with moderate star formation history, 3. the outer regions (> 500 kpc) show low-mass red objects
with blue, star forming Butcher-Oemler galaxy like colours. This sort of environmental condition
is known to harbour hybrid systems, like, the pseudo bulges, blue sequence E/S0 and Butcher-Oemler
like satellite cluster galaxies. Overall, the cluster is found to be poor, quiescent with galaxies
to have formed by the monolithic structure formation in the early universe and are now evolving with
mergers and gas stripping processes by ram pressure.
