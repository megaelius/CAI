One of the principal bottlenecks to atmosphere characterisation in the era of all-sky surveys is
the availability of fast, autonomous and robust atmospheric retrieval methods. We present a new
approach using unsupervised machine learning to generate informed priors for retrieval of exoplanetary
atmosphere parameters from transmission spectra. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to
efficiently compress the information content of a library of transmission spectra forward models
generated using the PLATON package. We then apply a $k$-means clustering algorithm in PCA space
to segregate the library into discrete classes. We show that our classifier is almost always able
to instantaneously place a previously unseen spectrum into the correct class, for low-to-moderate
spectral resolutions, $R$, in the range $R~=~30-300$ and noise levels up to $10$~per~cent of the
peak-to-trough spectrum amplitude. The distribution of physical parameters for all members of
the class therefore provides an informed prior for standard retrieval methods such as nested sampling.
We benchmark our informed-prior approach against a standard uniform-prior nested sampler, finding
that our approach is up to a factor two faster, with negligible reduction in accuracy. We demonstrate
the application of this method to existing and near-future observatories, and show that it is suitable
for real-world application. Our general approach is not specific to transmission spectroscopy
and should be more widely applicable to cases that involve repetitive fitting of trusted high-dimensional
models to large data catalogues, including beyond exoplanetary science.
