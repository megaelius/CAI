Precise measurement of the foreground synchrotron emission, which contaminates the faint polarized
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), is a major challenge for the next-generation of CMB
experiments. To address this, dedicated foreground measurement experiments are being undertaken
at radio frequencies between 2 and 40 GHz. Foreground polarized synchrotron emission measurements
are particularly challenging, primarily due to the complicated frequency dependence in the presence
of Faraday rotation, and are best recovered through broad fractional-bandwidth polarization
measurements at frequencies $\lesssim 5$ GHz. A unique opportunity for measuring the foreground
polarized synchrotron emission will be provided by the 15-m SKA-MPG telescope operating in the
frequency range 1.7 to 3.5~GHz (S-Band). Here, we present the scope of a Southern sky survey in S-Band
at 1 degree angular resolution and explore its added advantage for application of powerful techniques,
such as, Stokes $Q$, $U$ fitting and RM-synthesis. A full Southern-sky polarization survey with
this telescope, when combined with other on-going efforts at slightly higher frequencies, will
provide an excellent frequency coverage for modeling and extrapolating the foreground polarized
synchrotron emission to CMB frequencies ($\gtrsim80$~GHz) with rms brightness temperature better
than 10~nK per 1 degree$^2$. We find that this survey will be crucial for understanding the effects
of Faraday depolarization, especially in low Galactic latitude regions. This will allow better
foreground cleaning and thus will contribute significantly in further improving component separation
analyses and increase usable sky area for cosmological analysis of the \textit{Planck} data, and
the \textit{LiteBIRD} mission in the future.
