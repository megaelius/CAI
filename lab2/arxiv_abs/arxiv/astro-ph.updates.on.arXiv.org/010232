We present measurements of the properties of the central radio source in M87 using Event Horizon
Telescope data obtained during the 2017 campaign. We develop and fit geometric crescent models
(asymmetric rings with interior brightness depressions) using two independent sampling algorithms
that consider distinct representations of the visibility data. We show that the crescent family
of models is statistically preferred over other comparably complex geometric models that we explore.
We calibrate the geometric model parameters using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) models of the emission region and estimate physical properties of the source. We further
fit images generated from GRMHD models directly to the data. We compare the derived emission region
and black hole parameters from these analyses with those recovered from reconstructed images.
There is a remarkable consistency among all methods and data sets. We find that >50% of the total flux
at arcsecond scales comes from near the horizon, and that the emission is dramatically suppressed
interior to this region by a factor >10, providing direct evidence of the predicted shadow of a black
hole. Across all methods, we measure a crescent diameter of 42+/-3 micro-as and constrain its fractional
width to be <0.5. Associating the crescent feature with the emission surrounding the black hole
shadow, we infer an angular gravitational radius of GM/Dc2 = 3.8+/- 0.4 micro-as. Folding in a distance
measurement of 16.8(+0.8,-0.7) Mpc gives a black hole mass of M = 6.5 +/- 0.2(stat) +/-0.7(sys) 10^9
Msun. This measurement from lensed emission near the event horizon is consistent with the presence
of a central Kerr black hole, as predicted by the general theory of relativity.
