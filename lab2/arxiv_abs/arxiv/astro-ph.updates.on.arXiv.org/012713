The Lya line in the UV and the [CII] line in the FIR are widely used tools to identify galaxies and to
get insights about their ISM properties in the Early Universe. Combining data obtained with ALMA
in band 7 as part of the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at EarlyTimes (ALPINE) with spectroscopic
data from DEIMOS/Keck, VIMOS/VLT and FORS2/VLT we assembled an unique sample of 53 main sequence
galaxies at 4.4<z<6 in which we detect both the Lya line and the [CII]. We use [CII], observed with
ALMA, as a tracer of the systemic velocity, and we exploit the available optical spectroscopy to
obtain the Lya-[CII] and the ISM-[CII] velocity offsets. We find that 90% of the objects have Lya-[CII]
offsets in the range 0<Dv_Lya-[CII]<400 km/s, in line with the few measurements available so far
in the Early Universe, and much smaller than those observed at lower redshifts. At the same time,
we observe ISM-[CII] offsets in the range -500<Dv_ISM-[CII]<0 km/s, in line with values at all redshifts,
that we interpret as evidence for outflows in these galaxies. We find significant anti-correlations
between Dv_Lya-[CII] and the Lya equivalent width EW0(Lya)(or equivalently f_esc(Lya)), with
galaxies that show smaller Dv_Lya-[CII] having larger EW0(Lya) and f_esc(Lya). We interpret these
results in the framework of the uniform expanding shell model: the escape of Lya photons is determined
by the neutral hydrogen column density NHI. In galaxies with slow outflows (0 <v_out<300km/s) when
NHI is high, Dv_Lya-[CII] is high and f_esc(Lya) is low, and vice-versa. In galaxies with fast outflows
(v_out>300km/s), the probability of Lya photons to escape is high and Dv_Lya-[CII]is always small.
We suggest that the observed increase of the Lya escape observed in the literature between z~2 and
~6 is not due to a higher incidence of fast outflows at high redshift, but rather to a decrease of NHI
in the ISM.
