Information about the spin state of asteroids is important for our understanding of the dynamical
processes affecting them. However, spin properties of asteroids are known for only a small fraction
of the whole population. To enlarge the sample of asteroids with a known rotation state and basic
shape properties, we combined sparse-in-time photometry from the Lowell Observatory Database
with flux measurements from NASA's WISE satellite. We applied the light curve inversion method
to the combined data. The thermal infrared data from WISE were treated as reflected light because
the shapes of thermal and visual light curves are similar enough for our purposes. While sparse data
cover a wide range of geometries over many years, WISE data typically cover an interval of tens of
hours, which is comparable to the typical rotation period of asteroids. The search for best-fitting
models was done in the framework of the Asteroids@home distributed computing project. By processing
the data for almost 75,000 asteroids, we derived unique shape models for about 900 of them. Some of
them were already available in the DAMIT database and served us as a consistency check of our approach.
In total, we derived new models for 662 asteroids, which significantly increased the total number
of asteroids for which their rotation state and shape are known. For another 789 asteroids, we were
able to determine their sidereal rotation period and estimate the ecliptic latitude of the spin
axis direction. We studied the distribution of spins in the asteroid population. We revealed a significant
discrepancy between the number of prograde and retrograde rotators for asteroids smaller than
about 10 km. Combining optical photometry with thermal infrared light curves is an efficient approach
to obtaining new physical models of asteroids.
