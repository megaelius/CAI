We present the first robust measurement of the high redshift mass-metallicity (MZ) relation at
10^{8}< M/M_{\sun} < 10^{10}, obtained by stacking spectra of 83 emission-line galaxies
with secure redshifts between 1.3 < z < 2.3. For these redshifts, infrared grism spectroscopy
with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 is sensitive to the R23 metallicity diagnostic:
([OII]3726,3729 + [OIII] 4959,5007)/H\beta. Using spectra stacked in four mass quartiles, we
find a MZ relation that declines significantly with decreasing mass, extending from 12+log(O/H)
= 8.8 at M=10^{9.8} M_{\sun} to 12+log(O/H)= 8.2 at M=10^{8.2} M_{\sun}. After correcting for systematic
offsets between metallicity indicators, we compare our MZ relation to measurements from the stacked
spectra of galaxies with M>10^{9.5} M_{\sun} and z~2.3. Within the statistical uncertainties,
our MZ relation agrees with the z~2.3 result, particularly since our somewhat higher metallicities
(by around 0.1 dex) are qualitatively consistent with the lower mean redshift z=1.76 of our sample.
For the masses probed by our data, the MZ relation shows a steep slope which is suggestive of feedback
from energy-driven winds, and a cosmological downsizing evolution where high mass galaxies reach
the local MZ relation at earlier times. In addition, we show that our sample falls on an extrapolation
of the star-forming main sequence (the SFR-M_{*} relation) at this redshift. This result indicates
that grism emission-line selected samples do not have preferentially high SFRs. Finally, we report
no evidence for evolution of the mass-metallicity-SFR plane; our stack-averaged measurements
show excellent agreement with the local relation.
