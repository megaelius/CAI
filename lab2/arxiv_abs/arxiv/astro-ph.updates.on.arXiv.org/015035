Soft X-ray spectra 3.33 A - 6.15 A from the RESIK instrument on CORONAS-F constitute a unique database
for the study of the physical conditions of solar flare plasmas, enabling the calculation of differential
emission measures. The two RESIK channels for the shortest wavelengths overlap with the lower end
of RHESSI spectral energy range, which is located around 3 keV, making it possible to compare both
data sets. We aim to compare observations from RESIK and RHESSI spectrometers and cross-correlate
these instruments. Observations are compared with synthetic spectra calculated based on the results
of one-dimensional hydrodynamical (1D-HD) modelling. The analysis was performed for the flare
on 20 September 2002. We estimated the geometry of the flaring loop, necessary for 1D-HD modelling,
based on images from RHESSI and SOHO/EIT. The distribution of non-thermal electrons (NTEs) was
determined from RHESSI spectra. The 1D-HD model assumes that non-thermal electrons with a power-law
spectrum were injected at the apex of the flaring loop. The NTEs then heat and evaporate the chromosphere,
filling the loop with hot and dense plasma radiating in soft X-rays. The total energy of electrons
was constrained by comparing observed and calculated fluxes from GOES 1 - 8 A data. We determined
the temperature and density at every point of the flaring loop throughout the evolution of the flare,
calculating the resulting X-ray spectra. The synthetic spectra calculated based on the results
of hydrodynamic modelling for the 20 September 2002 flare are consistent within a factor of two with
the observed RESIK spectra during most of the duration of the flare. This discrepancy factor is probably
related to the uncertainty on the cross-calibration between RESIK and RHESSI instruments.
