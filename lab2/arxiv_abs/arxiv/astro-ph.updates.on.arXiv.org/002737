Motivated by recent numerical simulations of molecular cloud (MC)evolution, in which the clouds
engage in global gravitational contraction, and local collapse events culminate significantly
earlier than the global collapse, we investigate the growth of density perturbations embedded
in a collapsing background, to which we refer as an Inverse Hubble Flow (IHF). We use the standard
procedure for the growth of perturbations in a universe that first expands (the usual Hubble Flow)
and then recollapses (the IHF). We find that linear density perturbations immersed in an IHF grow
faster than perturbations evolving in a static background (the standard Jeans analysis). A fundamental
distinction between the two regimes is that, in the Jeans case, the time $\tau_\mathrm{nl}$ for
a density fluctuation to become nonlinear increases without limit as its initial value approaches
zero, while in the IHF case $\tau_\mathrm{nl} \le \tau_\mathrm{ff}$ always, where $\tau_\mathrm{ff}$
is the free-fall time of the background density. We suggest that this effect, although moderate,
implies that small-scale density fluctuations embedded in globally-collapsing clouds must collapse
earlier than their parent cloud, regardless of whether the initial amplitude of the fluctuations
is moderate or strongly nonlinear, thus allowing the classical mechanism of Hoyle fragmentation
to operate in multi-Jeans-mass MCs. More fundamentally, our results show that, contrary to the
standard paradigm that fluctuations of all scales grow at the same rate in the linear regime, the
hierarchical nesting of the fluctuations of different scales does affect their growth even in the
linear stage.
