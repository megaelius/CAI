In the cores of ellipticals, clusters and groups of galaxies the gas has a cooling time shorter than
1 Gyr. It is possible to probe cooling flows through the detection of Fe XVII and O VII emission lines,
but so far O VII was not detected in any individual object. The Reflection Grating Spectrometers
(RGS) aboard XMM-Newton are currently the only instruments able to detect O VII in extended objects
like elliptical galaxies and galaxy clusters. We have searched for evidence of O VII through all
the archival RGS observations of galaxy clusters, groups of galaxies and elliptical galaxies focusing
on those with core temperatures below 1 keV. We have discovered O VII resonance (21.6A) and forbidden
(22.1A) lines for the first time in the spectra of individual objects. O VII was detected at a level
higher than three sigma in six elliptical galaxies: M 84, M 86, M 89, NGC 1316, NGC 4636, and NGC 5846.
M 84, M 86 and M 89 are members of the Virgo Cluster, the others are central dominant galaxies of groups,
and most them show evidence of O VI in UV spectra. We detect no significant trend between the Fe XVII
and O VII resonance-to-forbidden line ratios, possibly due to the limited statistics. The observed
line ratios <Fe(r/f), O(r/f)>= (0.52+/-0.02, 0.9+/-0.2) indicated that the spectra of
all these ellipticals are affected by resonance scattering, suggesting low turbulence. Deeper
exposures will help to understand whether the Fe XVII and O VII lines are both produced by the same
cooling gas or by multi-phase gas. Our O VII luminosities correspond to 0.2-2 Msun/yr that agree
with the predictions for ellipticals. Such weak cooling rates would not be detected in clusters
because their spectra are dominated by the emission of hotter gas and due to their larger distance
the expected O VII line flux would be undetectable.
