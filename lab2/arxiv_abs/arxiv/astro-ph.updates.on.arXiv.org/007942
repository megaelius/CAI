Stellar activity is one of the primary limitations to the detection of low-mass exoplanets using
the radial-velocity (RV) technique. We propose to estimate the variations in shape of the CCF by
fitting a Skew Normal (SN) density which, unlike the commonly employed Normal density, includes
a skewness parameter to capture the asymmetry of the CCF induced by stellar activity and the convective
blueshift. The performances of the proposed method are compared to the commonly employed Normal
density using both simulations and real observations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise
ratio. When considering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry of
the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using the parameters estimated
with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with the commonly employed Normal density. Using
the proposed SN approach, the uncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are
on average 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the Normal. The uncertainties
estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on average 15% smaller than the uncertainties
measured on the Bisector Inverse Slope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate
the asymmetry of the CCF. We also propose a new model to account for stellar activity when fitting
a planetary signal to RV data. Based on simple simulations, we were able to demonstrate that this
new model improves the planetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to account
for stellar activity. The SN density is a better model than the Normal density for characterizing
the CCF since the correlations used to probe stellar activity are stronger and the uncertainties
of the RV estimate and the asymmetry of the CCF are both smaller.
