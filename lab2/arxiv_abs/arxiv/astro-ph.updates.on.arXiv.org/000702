We present a rigorous and practical way of constraining the Galactic potential based on the phase-space
information for many individual stars. Such an approach is needed to dynamically model the data
from ongoing spectroscopic surveys of the Galaxy and in the future Gaia. This approach describes
the orbit distribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF) proposed
by McMillan & Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these parametrized DFs are flexible
enough to capture well the observed phase-space distributions of individual abundance-selected
Galactic sub-populations of stars (`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational
potential, which enables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic mono-abundance
populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to constrain the Galactic potential parameters
by constructing the joint likelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing
over the DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection function
inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the uncertainties of the individual position-velocity
observations. On that basis, we study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential
with that can be reached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By
creating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and realistic spatial selection
function, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with sample sizes of a few
thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that are smooth in the actions and of no time-variation
remain important limitations in our current study.
