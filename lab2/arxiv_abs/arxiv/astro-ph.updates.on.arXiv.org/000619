Modern data of the extinction curve from the ultraviolet to the near infrared are revisited to study
the property of dust grains in the Milky Way (MW) and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We confirm
that the graphite-silicate mixture of grains yields the observed extinction curve with the simple
power-law distribution of the grain size but with a cutoff at some maximal size: the parameters are
tightly constrained to be $q = 3.5 \pm 0.2$ for the size distribution $a^{-q}$ and the maximum radius
$a_{max} = 0.24 \pm 0.05$ um, for both MW and SMC. The abundance of grains, and hence the elemental
abundance, is constrained from the reddening versus hydrogen column density, E(B-V)/N_H. If we
take the solar elemental abundance as the standard for the MW, >56 % of carbon should be in graphite
dust, while it is <40 % in the SMC using its available abundance estimate. This disparity and the
relative abundance of C to Si explain the difference of the two curves. We find that 50-60 % of carbon
may not necessarily be in graphite but in the amorphous or the glassy phase. Iron may also be in the
metallic phase or up to ~80 % in magnetite rather than in silicates, so that the Mg/Fe ratio in astronomical
olivine is arbitrary. With these substitutions the parameters of the grain size remain unchanged.
The mass density of dust grains relative to hydrogen is $\rho_{dust}/\rho_H = 1/(120 {+10 \atop
-16})$ for the MW and $1/(760 {+70 \atop -90}) for the SMC under some abundance constraints. We underline
the importance of the wavelength-dependence slope of the extinction curve in the near infrared
in constructing the dust model: if $A_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{-gamma}$ with gamma ~ 1.6, the
power-law grain-size model fails, whereas it works if gamma ~ 1.8-2.0.
