Much of the progress made in time-domain astronomy is accomplished by relating observational multi-wavelength
time series data to models derived from our understanding of physical laws. This goal is typically
accomplished by dividing the task in two: collecting data (observing), and constructing models
to represent that data (theorizing). Owing to the natural tendency for specialization, a disconnect
can develop between the best available theories and the best available data, potentially delaying
advances in our understanding new classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open-Source
Fitter for Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient datasets from open online
catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo ensembles of semi-analytical
light curve fits to those datasets and their associated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally
delivers the fitting results back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the
community. MOSFiT is designed to help bridge the gap between observations and theory in time-domain
astronomy; in addition to making the application of existing models and creation of new models as
simple as possible, MOSFiT yields statistically robust predictions for transient characteristics,
with a standard output format that includes all the setup information necessary to reproduce a given
result. As large-scale surveys such as LSST discover entirely new classes of transients, tools
such as MOSFiT will be critical for enabling rapid comparison of models against data in statistically
consistent, reproducible, and scientifically beneficial ways.
