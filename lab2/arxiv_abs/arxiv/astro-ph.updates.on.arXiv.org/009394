We review the current theoretical models of the inward advection of the large scale external magnetic
fields in accretion discs. The most plausible theories for launching astrophysical jets rely on
strong magnetic fields at the inner parts of the host accretion disks. An internal dynamo can in principle
generate small scale magnetic fields in situ but generating a large scale field in a disk seems a difficult
task in the dynamo theories. In fact, as far as numerous numerical experiments indicate, a dynamo-generated
field in general would not be coherent enough over the large length scales of order the disk's radius.
Instead, a large scale poloidal field dragged in from the environment, and compressed by the accretion,
provides a more promising possibility. The difficulty in the latter picture, however, arises from
the reconnection of the radial field component across the mid-plane which annihilates the field
faster than it is dragged inward by the accretion. We review the different mechanisms proposed to
overcome these theoretical difficulties. In fact, it turns out, that a combination of different
effects, including magnetic buoyancy and turbulent pumping, is responsible for the vertical transport
of the field lines toward the surface of the disk. The radial component of the poloidal field vanishes
at the mid-plane, which efficiently impedes reconnection, and grows exponentially toward the
surface where it can become much larger than the vertical field component. This allows the poloidal
field to be efficiently advected to small radii until the allowed bending angle drops to of order
unity, and the field can drive a strong outflow.
