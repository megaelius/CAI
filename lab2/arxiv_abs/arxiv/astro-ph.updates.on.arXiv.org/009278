The elemental-abundance signatures of the very first stars are imprinted on the atmospheres of
CEMP-no stars, as various evidence suggests they are bona-fide second-generation stars. It has
recently been recognized that the CEMP-no stars can be sub-divided into at least two groups, based
on their distinct morphology in the $A$(C)-[Fe/H] space, indicating the likely existence of multiple
pathways for their formation. In this work, we compare the halo CEMP-no group morphology with that
of stars found in satellite dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way -- a very similar $A$(C)-[Fe/H] pattern
is found, providing clear evidence that halo CEMP-no stars were indeed accreted from their host
mini-halos, similar in nature to those that formed in presently observed ultra-faint dwarfs (UFDs)
and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We also infer that the previously noted "anomalous" CEMP-no
halo stars (with high $A$(C) and low [Ba/Fe] ratios) that otherwise would be associated with Group
I may have the same origin as the Group III CEMP-no halo stars, by analogy with the location of several
Group III CEMP-no stars in the UFDs and dSphs and their distinct separation from that of the CEMP-$s$
stars in the $A$(Ba)-$A$(C) space. Interestingly, CEMP-no stars associated with UFDs include
both Group II and Group III stars, while the more massive dSphs appear to have only Group II stars.
We conclude that understanding the origin of the CEMP-no halo stars requires knowledge of the masses
of their parent mini-halos, which is related to the amount of carbon dilution prior to star formation,
in addition to the nature of their nucleosynthetic origin.
