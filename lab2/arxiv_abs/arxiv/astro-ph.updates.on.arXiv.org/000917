(Abridged) Dust is expected to be ubiquitous in extrasolar planetary systems owing to the dynamical
activity of minor bodies. Inner dust populations are, however, still poorly known because of the
high contrast and small angular separation with respect to their host star. We aim to determine the
level of near-infrared exozodiacal dust emission around a sample of 42 nearby main sequence stars
with spectral types ranging from A to K and to investigate its correlation with various stellar parameters
and with the presence of cold dust belts. We use high-precision K-band visibilities obtained with
the FLUOR interferometer on the shortest baseline of the CHARA array. The calibrated visibilities
are compared with the expected visibility of the stellar photosphere to assess whether there is
an additional, fully resolved circumstellar emission. Near-infrared circumstellar emission
amounting to about 1% of the stellar flux is detected around 13 of our 42 target stars. Follow-up observations
showed that one of them (eps Cep) is associated with a stellar companion, while another one was detected
around what turned out to be a giant star (kap CrB). The remaining 11 excesses found around single
main sequence stars are most probably associated with hot circumstellar dust, yielding an overall
occurrence rate of 28+8-6% for our (biased) sample. We show that the occurrence rate of bright exozodiacal
discs correlates with spectral type, K-band excesses being more frequent around A-type stars.
It also correlates with the presence of detectable far-infrared excess emission in the case of solar-type
stars. This study provides new insight into the phenomenon of bright exozodiacal discs, showing
that hot dust populations are probably linked to outer dust reservoirs in the case of solar-type
stars. For A-type stars, no clear conclusion can be made regarding the origin of the detected near-infrared
excesses.
