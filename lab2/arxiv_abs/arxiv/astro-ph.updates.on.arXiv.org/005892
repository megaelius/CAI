Properties of the Sun's interior can be determined accurately from helioseismological measurements
of solar oscillations. These measurements, however, are in conflict with photospheric elemental
abundances derived using 3-D hydrodynamic models of the solar atmosphere. This divergence of theory
and helioseismology is known as the $"$solar modeling problem$"$. One possible solution is that
the photospheric neon abundance, which is deduced indirectly by combining the coronal Ne/O ratio
with the photospheric O abundance, is larger than generally accepted. There is some support for
this idea from observations of cool stars. The Ne/O abundance ratio has also been found to vary with
the solar cycle in the slowest solar wind streams and coronal streamers, and the variation from solar
maximum to minimum in streamers ($\sim$0.1 to 0.25) is large enough to potentially bring some of
the solar models into agreement with the seismic data. Here we use daily-sampled observations from
the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory taken in 2010--2014, to
investigate whether the coronal Ne/O abundance ratio shows a variation with the solar cycle when
the Sun is viewed as a star. We find only a weak dependence on, and moderate anti-correlation with,
the solar cycle with the ratio measured around 0.2--0.3 MK falling from 0.17 at solar minimum to 0.11
at solar maximum. The effect is amplified at higher temperatures (0.3--0.6 MK) with a stronger anti-correlation
and the ratio falling from 0.16 at solar minimum to 0.08 at solar maximum. The values we find at solar
minimum are too low to solve the solar modeling problem.
