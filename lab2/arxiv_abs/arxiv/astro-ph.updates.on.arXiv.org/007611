Three-dimensional magnetic topology is crucial to understanding the explosive release of magnetic
energy in the corona during solar flares. Much attention has been given to the pre-flare magnetic
topology to identify candidate sites of magnetic reconnection, yet it is unclear how the magnetic
reconnection and its attendant topological changes shape the eruptive structure and how the topology
evolves during the eruption. Here we employed a realistic, data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic
simulation to study the evolving magnetic topology for an X9.3 eruptive flare that occurred on 2017
September 6. The simulation successfully reproduces the eruptive features and processes in unprecedented
detail. The numerical results reveal that the pre-flare corona contains multiple twisted flux
systems with different connections, and during the eruption, these twisted fluxes form a coherent
flux rope through tether-cutting-like magnetic reconnection below the rope. Topological analysis
shows that the rising flux rope is wrapped by a quasi-separatrix layer, which intersects itself
below the rope, forming a topological structure known as hyperbolic flux tube, where a current sheet
develops, triggering the reconnection. By mapping footpoints of the newly-reconnected field
lines, we are able to reproduce both the spatial location and, for the first time, the temporal separation
of the observed flare ribbons, as well as the dynamic boundary of the flux rope's feet. Futhermore,
the temporal profile of the total reconnection flux is comparable to the soft X-ray light curve.
Such a sophisticated characterization of the evolving magnetic topology provides important insight
into the eventual understanding and forecast of solar eruptions.
