The understanding of stellar structure represents the crossroads of our theories of the nuclear
force and the gravitational interaction under the most extreme conditions observably accessible.
It provides a powerful probe of General Relativity on its strong field regime, and opens fruitful
avenues for the exploration of new gravitational physics. The latter can be captured via the so-called
modified theories of gravity. These theories typically change the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations of stellar's hydrostatic equilibrium, having a large impact on the astrophysical properties
of the corresponding stars. For relativistic stars, such as neutron stars, the uncertainty on the
equation of state of matter at supranuclear densities intertwines with the new parameters coming
from the modified gravity side, providing a whole new phenomenology for the typical predictions
of stellar structure models, such as mass-radius relations, maximum masses, or moment of inertia.
For non-relativistic stars, the weakening/strengthening of the gravitational force inside astrophysical
bodies via the modified Newtonian (Poisson) equation may induce changes on the star's mass, radius,
central density or luminosity, having an impact, for instance, in the Chandrasekhar's limit for
white dwarfs, or in the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning for high-mass brown dwarfs. This
work aims to provide a broad overview of the main such results achieved in the recent literature for
many such modified theories of gravity, by combining the results and constraints obtained from
the analysis of relativistic and non-relativistic stars in different scenarios. Moreover, we
will build a bridge between the efforts of the community working on different theories, formulations,
types of stars, theoretical modellings, and observational aspects, highlighting some of the most
promising opportunities in the field.
