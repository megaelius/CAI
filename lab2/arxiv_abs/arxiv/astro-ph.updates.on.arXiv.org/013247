TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up) is the world's first orbital detector of ultra-high-energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs). It was launched into orbit on 28th April 2016 as a part of the scientific payload
of the Lomonosov satellite. The main aim of the mission was to test the technique of measuring the
ultraviolet fluorescence and Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers generated by primary
cosmic rays with energies above ~100 EeV in the Earth atmosphere from space. During its operation
for 1.5 years, TUS registered almost 80,000 events with a few of them satisfying conditions anticipated
for extensive air showers (EASs) initiated by UHECRs. Here we discuss an event registered on 3rd
October 2016. The event was measured in perfect observation conditions as an ultraviolet track
in the nocturnal atmosphere of the Earth, with the kinematics and the light curve similar to those
expected from an EAS. A reconstruction of parameters of a primary particle gave the zenith angle
around 44$^\circ$ but an extreme energy not compatible with the cosmic ray energy spectrum obtained
with ground-based experiments. We discuss in details all conditions of registering the event,
explain the reconstruction procedure and its limitations and comment on possible sources of the
signal, both of anthropogenic and astrophysical origin. We believe this detection represents
a significant milestone in the space-based observation of UHECRs because it proves the capability
of an orbital telescope to detect light signals with the apparent motion and light shape similar
to what are expected from EASs. This is important for the on-going development of the future missions
KLYPVE-EUSO and POEMMA, aimed for studying UHECRs from space.
