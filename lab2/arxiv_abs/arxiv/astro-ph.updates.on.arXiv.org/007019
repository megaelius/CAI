The bulk of the X-ray emission in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is produced very close to the accreting
supermassive black hole (SMBH), in a corona of hot electrons which up scatters optical and ultraviolet
photons from the accretion flow. The cutoff energy ($E_{\rm C}$) of the primary X-ray continuum
emission carries important information on the physical characteristics of the X-ray emitting
plasma, but little is currently known about its potential relation with the properties of accreting
SMBHs. Using the largest broad-band (0.3-150 keV) X-ray spectroscopic study available to date,
we investigate how the corona is related to the AGN luminosity, black hole mass and Eddington ratio
($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). Assuming a slab corona the median values of the temperature and optical
depth of the Comptonizing plasma are $kT_{\rm e}=105 \pm 18$ keV and $\tau=0.25\pm0.06$, respectively.
When we properly account for the large number of $E_{\rm C}$ lower limits, we find a statistically
significant dependence of the cutoff energy on the Eddington ratio. In particular, objects with
$ \lambda_{\rm Edd}>0.1$ have a significantly lower median cutoff energy ($E_{\rm C}=160\pm41$
keV) than those with $\lambda_{\rm Edd}\leq 0.1$ ($E_{\rm C}=370\pm51$ keV). This is consistent
with the idea that radiatively compact coronae are also cooler, because they tend to avoid the region
in the temperature-compactness parameter space where runaway pair production would dominate.
We show that this behaviour could also straightforwardly explain the suggested positive correlation
between the photon index ($\Gamma$) and the Eddington ratio, being able to reproduce the observed
slope of the $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ trend.
