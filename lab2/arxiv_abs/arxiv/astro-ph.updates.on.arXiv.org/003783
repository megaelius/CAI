We are entering the era of high-precision and high-resolution spectroscopy of exoplanets. Such
observations herald the need for robust self-consistent spectral models of exoplanetary atmospheres
to investigate intricate atmospheric processes and to make observable predictions. Spectral
models of plane-parallel exoplanetary atmospheres exist, mostly adapted from other astrophysical
applications, with different levels of sophistication and accuracy. There is a growing need for
a new generation of models custom-built for exoplanets and incorporating state-of-the-art numerical
methods and opacities. The present work is a step in this direction. Here we introduce GENESIS, a
plane-parallel, self-consistent, line-by-line exoplanetary atmospheric modelling code which
includes (a) formal solution of radiative transfer using the Feautrier method, (b) radiative-convective
equilibrium with temperature correction based on the Rybicki linearisation scheme, (c) latest
absorption cross sections, and (d) internal flux and external irradiation, under the assumptions
of hydrostatic equilibrium, local thermodynamic equilibrium and thermochemical equilibrium.
We demonstrate the code here with cloud-free models of giant exoplanetary atmospheres over a range
of equilibrium temperatures, metallicities, C/O ratios and spanning non-irradiated and irradiated
planets, with and without thermal inversions. We provide the community with theoretical emergent
spectra and pressure-temperature profiles over this range, along with those for several known
hot Jupiters. The code can generate self-consistent spectra at high resolution and has the potential
to be integrated into general circulation and non-equilibrium chemistry models as it is optimised
for efficiency and convergence. GENESIS paves the way for high-fidelity remote sensing of exoplanetary
atmospheres at high resolution with current and upcoming observations.
