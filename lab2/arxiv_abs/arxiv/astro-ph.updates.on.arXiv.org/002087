Neutrino oscillations, especially to light sterile states, can affect the nucleosynthesis yields
because of their possible feedback effect on the electron fraction (Ye). For the first time, we perform
nucleosynthesis calculations for neutrino-driven wind trajectories from the neutrino-cooling
phase of an 8.8 Msun electron-capture supernova, whose hydrodynamic evolution was computed in
spherical symmetry with sophisticated neutrino transport and whose Ye evolution was post-processed
by including neutrino oscillations both between active and active-sterile flavors. We also take
into account the alpha-effect as well as weak magnetism and recoil corrections in the neutrino absorption
and emission processes. We observe effects on the Ye evolution which depend in a subtle way on the
relative radial positions of the sterile MSW resonances, of collective flavor transformations,
and on the formation of alpha-particles. For the adopted supernova progenitor, we find that neutrino
oscillations, also to a sterile state with eV-mass, do not significantly affect the element formation
and in particular cannot make the post-explosion wind outflow neutron rich enough to activate a
strong r-process. Our conclusions become even more robust when, in order to mimic equation-of-state
dependent corrections due to nucleon potential effects in the dense-medium neutrino opacities,
four cases with reduced Ye in the wind are considered. In these cases, despite the conversion of neutrinos
to sterile neutrinos, Ye increases compared to the values obtained without oscillations and active
flavor transformations. This is a consequence of a complicated interplay between sterile-neutrino
production, neutrino-neutrino interactions, alpha-effect.
