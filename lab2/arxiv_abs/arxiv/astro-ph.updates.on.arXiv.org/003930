Planetary embryos form protoplanets via mutual collisions, which can lead to the development of
magma oceans. During their solidification, large amounts of the mantles' volatile contents may
be outgassed. The resulting H$_2$O/CO$_2$ dominated steam atmospheres may be lost efficiently
via hydrodynamic escape due to the low gravity and the high stellar EUV luminosities. Protoplanets
forming later from such degassed building blocks could therefore be drier than previously expected.
We model the outgassing and subsequent hydrodynamic escape of steam atmospheres from such embryos.
The efficient outflow of H drags along heavier species (O, CO$_2$, noble gases). The full range of
possible EUV evolution tracks of a solar-mass star is taken into account to investigate the escape
from Mars-sized embryos at different orbital distances. The envelopes are typically lost within
a few to a few tens of Myr. Furthermore, we study the influence on protoplanetary evolution, exemplified
by Venus. We investigate different early evolution scenarios and constrain realistic cases by
comparing modeled noble gas isotope ratios with observations. Starting from solar values, consistent
isotope ratios (Ne, Ar) can be found for different solar EUV histories, as well as assumptions about
the initial atmosphere (either pure steam or a mixture with accreted H). Our results generally favor
an early accretion scenario with a small amount of accreted H and a low-activity Sun, because in other
cases too much CO$_2$ is lost during evolution, which is inconsistent with Venus' present atmosphere.
Important issues are likely the time at which the initial steam atmosphere is outgassed and/or the
amount of CO$_2$ which may still be delivered at later evolutionary stages. A late accretion scenario
can only reproduce present isotope ratios for a highly active young Sun, but then very massive steam
atmospheres would be required.
