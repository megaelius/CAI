We recently developed an automated method, auto-GMM to decompose simulated galaxies. It extracts
kinematic structures in an accurate, efficient, and unsupervised way. We use auto-GMM to study
the stellar kinematic structures of disk galaxies from the TNG100 run of IllustrisTNG. We identify
four to five structures that are commonly present among the diverse galaxy population. Structures
having strong to moderate rotation are defined as cold and warm disks, respectively. Spheroidal
structures dominated by random motions are classified as bulges or stellar halos, depending on
how tightly bound they are. Disky bulges are structures that have moderate rotation but compact
morphology. Across all disky galaxies and accounting for the stellar mass within 3 half-mass radii,
the kinematic spheroidal structures, obtained by summing up stars of bulges and halos, contribute
~45% of the total stellar mass, while the disky structures constitute 55%. This study also provides
important insights about the relationship between kinematically and morphologically derived
galactic structures. Comparing the morphology of kinematic structures with that of traditional
bulge+disk decomposition, we conclude: (1) the morphologically decomposed bulges are composite
structures comprised of a slowly rotating bulge, an inner halo, and a disky bulge; (2) kinematically
disky bulges, akin to what are commonly called pseudo bulges in observations, are compact disk-like
components that have rotation similar to warm disks; (3) halos contribute almost 30% of the surface
density of the outer part of morphological disks when viewed face-on; and (4) both cold and warm disks
are often truncated in central regions.
