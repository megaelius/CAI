HD 15082 (WASP-33) is the hottest and fastest rotating star known to harbor a transiting extrasolar
planet (WASP-33b). The lack of high precision radial velocity (RV) data stresses the need for precise
light curve analysis and gathering further RV data. By using available photometric and RV data,
we perform a blend analysis, compute more accurate system parameters, confine the planetary mass
and attempt to cast light on the observed transit anomalies. We combine the original HATNet observations
and various followup data to jointly analyze the signal content and extract the transit component
and use our RV data to aid the global parameter determination. The blend analysis of the combination
of multicolor light curves yields the first independent confirmation of the planetary nature of
WASP-33b. We clearly identify three frequency components in the 15-21 1/day regime with amplitudes
7-5 mmag. These frequencies correspond to the delta Scuti-type pulsation of the host star. None
of these pulsation frequencies or their low-order linear combinations are in close resonance with
the orbital frequency. We show that these pulsation components explain some but not all of the observed
transit anomalies. The grand-averaged transit light curve shows that there is a ~1.5 mmag brightening
shortly after the planet passes the mid-transit phase. Although the duration and amplitude of this
brightening varies, it is visible even through the direct inspections of the individual transit
events (some 40-60% of the followup light curves show this phenomenon). We suggest that the most
likely explanation of this feature is the presence of a well-populated spot belt which is highly
inclined to the orbital plane. This geometry is consistent with the inference from the spectroscopic
anomalies. Finally, we constrain the planetary mass to M_p=3.27+/-0.73 M_J by using our RV data
collected by the TRES spectrograph.
