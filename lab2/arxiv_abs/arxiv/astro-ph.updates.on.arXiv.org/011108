Martin & Lubow (2017) found that an initially sufficiently misaligned low mass protoplanetary
disc around an eccentric binary undergoes damped nodal oscillations of tilt angle and longitude
of ascending node. Dissipation causes evolution towards a stationary state of polar alignment
in which the disc lies perpendicular to the binary orbital plane with angular momentum aligned to
the eccentricity vector of the binary. We use hydrodynamic simulations and analytic methods to
investigate how the mass of the disc affects this process. The simulations suggest that a disc with
nonzero mass settles into a stationary state in the frame of the binary, the generalised polar state,
at somewhat lower levels of misalignment with respect to the binary orbital plane, in agreement
with the analytic model. Provided that discs settle into this generalised polar state, the observational
determination of the misalignment angle and binary properties can be used to determine the mass
of a circumbinary disc. We apply this constraint to the circumbinary disc in HD 98800. We obtain analytic
criteria for polar alignment of a circumbinary ring with mass that approximately agree with the
simulation results. Very broad misaligned discs undergo breaking, but the inner regions at least
may still evolve to a polar state. The long term evolution of the disc depends on the evolution of the
binary eccentricity that we find tends to decrease. Although the range of parameters required for
polar alignment decreases somewhat with increasing disc mass, such alignment appears possible
for a broad set of initial conditions expected in protostellar circumbinary discs.
