Gas convection is observed in the solar photosphere as the granulation, i.e., having highly time-dependent
cellular patterns, consisting of numerous bright cells called granules and dark surrounding-channels
called intergranular lanes. Many efforts have been made to characterize the granulation, which
may be used as an energy source for various types of dynamical phenomena. Although the horizontal
gas flow dynamics in intergranular lanes may play a vital role, but they are poorly understood. This
is because the Doppler signals can be obtained only at the solar limb, where the signals are severely
degraded by a foreshortening effect. To reduce such a degradation, we use Hinode's spectroscopic
data, which are free from a seeing-induced image degradation, and improve its image quality by correcting
for straylight in the instruments. The dataset continuously covers from the solar disk to the limb,
providing a multidirectional line-of-sight (LOS) diagnosis against the granulation. The obtained
LOS flow-field variation across the disk indicates a horizontal flow speed of 1.8-2.4 km/s. We also
derive the spatial distribution of the horizontal flow speed, which is 1.6 km/s in granules and 1.8
km/s in intergranular lanes, and where the maximum speed is inside intergranular lanes. This result
newly suggests the following sequence of horizontal flow: A hot rising gas parcel is strongly accelerated
from the granular center, even beyond the transition from the granules to the intergranular lanes,
resulting in the fastest speed inside the intergranular lanes, and the gas may also experience decelerations
in the intergranular lane.
