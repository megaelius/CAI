Supergiant X-ray binaries usually comprise a neutron star accreting from the wind of a OB supergiant
companion. They are classified as classical systems and the supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs).
The different behavior of these sub-classes of sources in X-rays, with SFXTs displaying much more
pronounced variability, is usually (at least) partly ascribed to different physical properties
of the massive star clumpy stellar wind. In case of SFXTs, a systematic investigation of the effects
of clumps on flares/outbursts of these sources has been reported by Bozzo et al. (2017) exploiting
the capabilities of the instruments on-board XMM-Newton to perform a hardness-resolved spectral
analysis on timescales as short as a few hundreds of seconds. In this paper, we use six XMM-Newton
observations of IGR J18027-2016 to extend the above study to a classical supergiant X-ray binary
and compare the findings with those derived in the case of SFXTs. As these observations of IGR J18027-2016
span different orbital phases, we also study its X-ray spectral variability on longer timescales
and compare our results with previous publications. Although obtaining measurements of the clump
physical properties from X-ray observations of accreting supergiant X-ray binaries was already
proven to be challenging, our study shows that similar imprints of clumps are found in the X-ray observations
of the supergiant fast X-ray transients and at least one classical system, i.e. IGR J18027-2016.
This provides interesting perspectives to further extend this study to many XMM-Newton observations
already performed in the direction of other classical supergiant X-ray binaries.
