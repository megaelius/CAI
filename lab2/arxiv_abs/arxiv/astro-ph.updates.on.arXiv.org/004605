Atmospheric properties of F-,G- and K-type stars can be measured by spectral model fitting. These
methods require data with good signal-to-noise ratio and reliable continuum normalisation. This
is particularly challenging for the spectra we have obtained with the CORALIE \'{e}chelle spectrograph
for FGK stars with transiting M-dwarf companions. The spectra tend to have low signal-to-noise
ratios, which makes it difficult to analyse them using existing methods. Our aim is to create a reliable
automated spectral analysis routine to determine $T_{\rm eff}$, [Fe/H], $V \sin i$ from the CORALIE
spectra of FGK stars. We use wavelet decomposition to distinguish between noise, continuum trends,
and stellar spectral features in the CORALIE spectra. A subset of wavelet coefficients from the
target spectrum are compared to those from a grid of models in a Bayesian framework to determine the
posterior probability distributions of the atmospheric parameters. By testing our method using
synthetic spectra we found that our method converges on the best fitting atmospheric parameters.
We test the wavelet method on 20 FGK exoplanet host stars for which higher quality data have been independently
analysed using equivalent width measurements. We find that we can determine $T_{\rm eff}$ to a precision
of $85$K, [Fe/H] to a precision of 0.06 dex and $V \sin i$ to a precision of 1.35 kms$^{-1}$ for stars
with $V \sin i$ $\geq$ 5 kms$^{-1}$. We find an offset in metallicity $\approx -$0.18 dex relative
to the equivelent width fitting method. We can determine $\log g$ to a precision of $0.13$ dex but
measurements are only reliable to confirm dwarf-like surface gravity. The wavelet method can be
used to determine $T_{\rm eff}$, [Fe/H] and $V \sin i$ for FGK stars from \'{e}chelle spectra. We
find that our method is self consistent, and robust for spectra with SNR$\gtrapprox 40$.
