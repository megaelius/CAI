The cataclysmic variable MV Lyr was present in the Kepler field yielding a light curve with the duration
of almost 1500 days with 60 second cadence. Such high quality data of this nova-like system with obvious
fast optical variability show multicomponent power density spectra. Our goal is to study the light
curve from different point of view, and perform a shot profile analysis. We search for characteristics
not discovered with standard power density spectrum based methods. The shot profile method identifies
individual shots in the light curve, and averages them in order to get all substructures with typical
time scales. We also tested the robustness of our analysis using simple shot noise model. We obtained
mean profiles with multicomponent features. The shot profile method distinguishes substructures
with similar time scales which appear as a single degenerate feature in power density spectra. Furthermore,
this method yields the identification of another high frequency component in the power density
spectra of Kepler and XMM-Newton data not detected so far. Moreover, we found side-lobes accompanied
with the central spike, making the profile very similar to another Kepler data of blazar W2R 1926+42,
and Ginga data of Cyg X-1. All three objects show similar time scale ratios of the rising vs. declining
part of the central spikes, while the two binaries have also similar rising profiles of the shots
described by a power-law function. The similarity of both binary shot profiles suggests that the
shots originate from the same origin, e.g. aperiodic mass accretion in the accretion disc. Moreover,
the similarity with the blazar may imply that the ejection fluctuations in the blazar jet are connected
to accretion fluctuations driving the variability in binaries. This points out to connection between
jet and the accretion disc.
