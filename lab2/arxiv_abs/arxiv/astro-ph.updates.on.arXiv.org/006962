We present a reformulation of axion modified electrodynamics where the four Maxwell's equations
maintain a similar form to the unmodified versions, with all modifications redefined within the
constitutive relations between the $\vec{D}$, $\vec{H}$, $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{E}$ fields. In
this reformulation the axion induced bound charge density, polarization current density and bound
current density are identified along with the associated axion induced vacuum polarization and
magnetization, which are shown to satisfy the charge-current continuity equation. This representation
is consistent with Wilczek's original calculations from the polarization of vacuum fields. The
reformulation is important when considering conversions of axions into photons, relevant in many
experimental contexts. For example, when a DC $\vec{B}$-field is applied, oscillating bound vacuum
charges and polarization currents are induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. In contrast,
when a large DC $\vec{E}$ field is applied, an oscillating bound current or magnetization of the
vacuum is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion mass. Moreover, the integral forms of the
equations can be used to clearly define the boundary conditions between distinct media either with
or without axion induced vacuum polarization or magnetization. This provides clarity when considering
experiments sensitive to axion induced electric and/or magnetic effects inside or outside the
high DC field region. For example, a capacitor in a high DC magnetic field can act as a detector for
low-mass axions without suppression of of the signal due to electromagnetic shielding. Also, we
calculate the voltages and currents induced by low mass axions in an inductive sensor under a DC electric
field, which is the dual experiment to a capacitive sensor under a DC magnetic field.
