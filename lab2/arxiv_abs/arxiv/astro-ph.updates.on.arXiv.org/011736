The observation of maximally-rotating neutron stars (in comparison with non-rotating ones) may
provide more information on the behavior of nuclear matter at high densities. In the present work
we provide a theoretical treatment concerning the effects of the upper bound of the sound speed in
dense matter on the bulk properties of maximally-rotating (at mass-shedding limit) neutron stars.
In particular, we consider two upper bounds for the speed of sound, $\upsilon_{s} = c$ and $\upsilon_{s}
= c/\sqrt{3}$, and the one provided by the relativistic kinetic theory. We investigate to what extent
the possible predicted (from various theories and conjectures) upper bounds on the speed of sound
constrain the ones of various key quantities, including the maximum mass and the corresponding
radius, Keplerian frequency, Kerr parameter and moment of inertia. We mainly focus on the lower
proposed limit, $\upsilon_{s}=c/\sqrt{3}$, and we explore in which mass region a rotating neutron
star collapses to a black hole. In any case, useful relations of the mentioned bulk properties with
the transition density are derived and compared with the corresponding non-rotating cases. We
concluded that the proposed limit $\upsilon_{s}=c/\sqrt{3}$ leads to dramatic decrease on the
values of the maximum mass, Kerr parameter and moment of inertia preventing a neutron star to reach
values which derived with the consideration of realistic equations of state or from other constraints.
Possible measurements of the Kerr parameter and moment of inertia would shed light on these issues
and help to reveal the speed of sound bound in dense matter.
