The streaming instability is a mechanism for concentrating solid particles in protoplanetary
disks that can lead to gravitational collapse and planetesimal formation. The energy source that
drives this instability is the radial pressure gradient in the disk. Despite its key role in producing
particle clumping and determining critical length scales in the instability's linear regime,
the influence of the pressure gradient on planetesimal properties has not been examined in detail.
In this work, we use high resolution simulations of the streaming instability that include particle
self-gravity to study how the initial mass function of planetesimals depends on the radial pressure
gradient. Fitting our results to a power-law, $dN/dM \propto M^{-p}$, we find that a value of $p$
~ 1.6 describes simulations in which the pressure gradient varies by more than a factor of two. An
exponentially truncated power-law provides a better representation of the cumulative mass function,
and fitting to this function we obtain a single low mass slope $p^\prime$ ~ 1.3. The characteristic
truncation mass is on the order of $M_G = 4 \pi^5 G^2 \Sigma_p^3 / \Omega^4$. We rule out a cubic dependence
of the characteristic mass with pressure gradient suggested by linear considerations, finding
instead at most a weak and possibly not significant dependence. These results strengthen the case
for a streaming-derived initial mass function that depends at most weakly on the aerodynamic properties
of the disk and participating solids. A simulation initialized with zero pressure gradient, which
is not subject to the streaming instability, also yields a top-heavy mass function but with a significantly
different shape. We discuss the consistency of the theoretically predicted mass function with
observations of small-body populations in the Kuiper Belt, and describe implications for models
of early stage planet formation.
