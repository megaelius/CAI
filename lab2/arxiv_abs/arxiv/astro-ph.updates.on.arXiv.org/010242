LOFAR is a leading aperture synthesis telescope operated in the Netherlands with stations across
Europe. The LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) will produce more than 3000 14 TB data sets, mapping
the entire northern sky at low frequencies. The data produced by this survey is important for understanding
the formation and evolution of galaxies, supermassive black holes and other astronomical phenomena.
All of the LoTSS data needs to be processed by the LOFAR Direction Independent (DI) pipeline, prefactor.
Understanding the performance of this pipeline is important when trying to optimize the throughput
for large projects, such as LoTSS and other deep surveys. Making a model of its completion time will
enable us to predict the time taken to process large data sets, optimize our parameter choices, help
schedule other LOFAR processing services, and predict processing time for future large radio telescopes.
We tested the prefactor pipeline by scaling several parameters, notably number of CPUs, data size
and size of calibration sky model. We present these results as a comprehensive model which will be
used to predict processing time for a wide range of processing parameters. We also discover that
smaller calibration models lead to significantly faster calibration times, while the calibration
results do not significantly degrade in quality. Finally, we validate the model and compare predictions
with production runs from the past six months, quantifying the performance penalties incurred
by processing on a shared cluster. We conclude by noting the utility of the results and model for the
LoTSS Survey, LOFAR as a whole and for other telescopes.
