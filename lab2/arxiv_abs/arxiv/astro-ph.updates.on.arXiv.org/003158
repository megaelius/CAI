Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with s-process enrichment (CEMP-s) are believed to be the products
of mass transfer from an AGB companion, which has long since become a white dwarf. The surface abundances
of CEMP-s stars are thus commonly assumed to reflect the nucleosynthesis output of the first AGB
stars. We have previously shown that, for this to be the case, some physical mechanism must counter
atomic diffusion in these nearly fully radiative stars, which otherwise leads to surface abundance
anomalies clearly inconsistent with observations. Here we take into account angular momentum
accretion by these stars. We compute in detail the evolution of typical CEMP-s stars from the ZAMS,
through the mass accretion, and up the RGB for a wide range of specific angular momentum of the accreted
material, corresponding to rotation velocities between about 0.3 and 300 km/s. We find that only
for specific angular momentum above 1e+17 cm2/s (rotation velocities above 20 km/s) angular momentum
accretion directly causes chemical dilution of the accreted material. This could nevertheless
be relevant to CEMP-s stars, which are observed to rotate more slowly, if they undergo continuous
angular momentum loss akin to solar-like stars. In models with rotation velocities characteristic
of CEMP-s stars, rotational mixing primarily serves to inhibit atomic diffusion, such that the
maximal surface abundance variations (with respect to the composition of the accreted material)
prior to first dredge-up remain within about 0.4 dex without thermohaline mixing or about 0.5-1.5
dex with thermohaline mixing. Even in models with the lowest rotation velocities (under a km/s),
rotational mixing is able to severely inhibit atomic diffusion, compared to non-rotating models.
We thus conclude that it offers a natural solution to the problem posed by atomic diffusion and cannot
be neglected in models of CEMP-s stars.
