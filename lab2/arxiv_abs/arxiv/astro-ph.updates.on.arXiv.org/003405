We apply the statistical methods by Schoenrich, Binney & Asplund to assess the quality of distances
and kinematics in the RAVE-TGAS and LAMOST-TGAS samples of Solar neighbourhood stars. These methods
yield a nominal distance accuracy of 1-2%. Other than common tests on parallax accuracy, they directly
test distance estimations including the effects of distance priors. We show how to construct these
priors including the survey selection functions (SSFs) directly from the data. We demonstrate
that neglecting the SSFs causes severe distance biases. Due to the decline of the SSFs in distance,
the simple 1/parallax estimate only mildly underestimates distances. We test the accuracy of measured
line-of-sight velocities (v_los) by binning the samples in the nominal v_los uncertainties. We
find: a) the LAMOST v_los have a ~ -5 km/s offset; b) the average LAMOST measurement error for v_los
is ~7 km/s, significantly smaller than, and nearly uncorrelated with the nominal LAMOST estimates.
The RAVE sample shows either a moderate distance underestimate, or an unaccounted source of v_los
dispersion (e_v) from measurement errors and binary stars. For a subsample of suspected binary
stars in RAVE, our methods indicate significant distance underestimates. Separating a sample
in metallicity or kinematics to select thick-disc/halo stars, discriminates between distance
bias and e_v. For LAMOST, this separation yields consistency with pure v_los measurement errors.
We find an anomaly near longitude l~(300+/-60)deg and distance s~(0.32+/-0.03)kpc on both sides
of the galactic plane, which could be explained by either a localised distance error or a breathing
mode.
