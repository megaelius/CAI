We surveyed 20 AGB stars of different chemical types using the APEX telescope, and combined this
with an IRAM 30 m and APEX survey of CS and SiS emission towards over 30 S-type stars. For those stars
with detections, we performed radiative transfer modelling to determine abundances and abundance
distributions. We detect CS towards all the surveyed carbon stars, some S-type stars, and the highest
mass-loss rate oxygen-rich stars ($> 5\times 10^{-6}$ Msol yr$^{-1}$). SiS is detected towards
the highest mass-loss rate sources of all chemical types ($> 8\times 10^{-7}$ Msol yr$^{-1}$).
We find CS peak fractional abundances ranging from ~ $ 4\times 10^{-7}$ to ~ $2\times 10^{-5}$ for
the carbon stars, from ~ $ 3\times 10^{-8}$ to ~ $1\times 10^{-7}$ for the oxygen-rich stars and from
~ $ 1\times 10^{-7}$ to ~ $8\times 10^{-6}$ for the S-type stars. We find SiS peak fractional abundances
ranging from ~ $ 9\times 10^{-6}$ to ~ $ 2\times 10^{-5}$ for the carbon stars, from ~ $ 5\times 10^{-7}$
to ~ $ 2\times 10^{-6}$ for the oxygen-rich stars, and from ~ $ 2\times 10^{-7}$ to ~ $ 2\times 10^{-6}$
for the S-type stars. We derived Si$^{32}$S/Si$^{34}$S = 11.4 for AI Vol, the only star for which
we had a reliable isotopologue detection. Overall, we find that wind density plays an important
role in determining the chemical composition of AGB CSEs. It is seen that for oxygen-rich AGB stars
both CS and SiS are detected only in the highest density circumstellar envelopes and their abundances
are generally lower than for carbon-rich AGB stars by around an order of magnitude. For carbon-rich
and S-type stars SiS was also only detected in the highest density circumstellar envelopes, while
CS was detected consistently in all surveyed carbon stars and sporadically among the S-type stars.
