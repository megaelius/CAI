We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the tadpole,
a small globule in the Carina Nebula that hosts the HH 900 jet+outflow system. Our data include $^{12}$CO,
$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O J=2-1, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O J=3-2, and serendipitous detections of DCN
J=3-2 and CS J=7-6. With angular resolution comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), our
data reveal for the first time the bipolar molecular outflow in CO, seen only inside the globule,
that is launched from the previously unseen jet-driving protostar (the HH 900 YSO). The biconical
morphology joins smoothly with the externally irradiated outflow seen in ionized gas tracers outside
the globule, tracing the overall morphology of a jet-driven molecular outflow. Continuum emission
at the location of the HH 900 YSO appears to be slightly flattened perpendicular to outflow axis.
Model fits to the continuum have a best-fit spectral index of $\sim 2$, suggesting cold dust and the
onset of grain growth. In position-velocity space, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O gas kinematics trace
a C-shaped morphology, similar to infall profiles seen in other sources, although the global dynamical
behaviour of the gas remains unclear. Line profiles of the CO isotopologues display features consistent
with externally heated gas. We estimate a globule mass of $\sim 1.9$ M$_{\odot}$, indicating a remaining
lifetime of $\sim 4$ Myr, assuming a constant photoevaporation rate. This long globule lifetime
will shield the disk from external irradiation perhaps prolonging its life and enabling planet
formation in regions where disks are typically rapidly destroyed.
