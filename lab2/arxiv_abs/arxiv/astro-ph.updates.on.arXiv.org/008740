Future observations of the large-scale structure have the potential to investigate cosmological
models with a high degree of complexity, including the properties of gravity on large scales, the
presence of a complicated dark energy component, and the addition of neutrinos changing structures
on small scales. Here we study Horndeski theories of gravity, the most general minimally coupled
scalar-tensor theories of second order. While the cosmological background evolution can be described
by an effective equation of state, the perturbations are characterised by four free functions of
time. We consider a specific parametrisation of these functions tracing the dark energy component.
The likelihood of the full parameter set resulting from combining cosmic microwave background
primary anisotropies including their gravitational lensing signal, tomographic angular galaxy
clustering and weak cosmic shear, together with all possible non-vanishing cross-correlations
is evaluated; both with the Fisher-formalism as well as without the assumption of a specific functional
form of the posterior through Monte-Carlo Markov-chains (MCMCs). Our results show that even complex
cosmological models can be constrained and could exclude variations of the effective Newtonian
gravitational coupling larger than 10\% over the age of the Universe. In particular, we confirm
strong correlations between parameter groups. Furthermore, we find that the expected contours
from MCMC are significantly larger than those from the Fisher analysis even with the vast amount
of signal provided by stage IV experiments, illustrating the importance of a proper treatment of
non-Gaussian likelihoods and the high level of precision needed for unlocking the sensitivity
on gravitational parameters.
