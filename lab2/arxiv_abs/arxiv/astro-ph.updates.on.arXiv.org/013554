We examine Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) Goode Solar Telescope (GST) high-spatial resolution
(0''.06), high-cadence (3.45 s), H-alpha-0.8 Angstrom images of central-disk solar spicules,
using data of Samanta et al. (2019). We compare with coronal-jet chromospheric-component observations
of Sterling et al. (2010a). Morphologically, bursts of spicules, referred to as "enhanced spicular
activities" by Samanta et al. (2019), appear as scaled-down versions of the jet's chromospheric
component. Both the jet and the enhanced spicular activities appear as chromospheric-material
strands, undergoing twisting-type motions of ~20---50 km/s in the jet and ~20---30 km/s in the enhanced
spicular activities. Presumably, the jet resulted from a minifilament-carrying magnetic eruption.
For two enhanced spicular activities that we examine in detail, we find tentative candidates for
corresponding erupting microfilaments, but not expected corresponding base brightenings. Nonetheless,
the enhanced-spicular-activities' interacting mixed-polarity base fields, frequent-apparent-twisting
motions, and morphological similarities to the coronal jet's chromospheric-temperature component,
suggest that erupting microfilaments might drive the enhanced spicular activities but be hard
to detect, perhaps due to H-alpha opacity. Degrading the BBSO/GST-image resolution with a 1''.0-FWHM
smoothing function yields enhanced spicular activities resembling the "classical spicules"
described by, e.g., Beckers (1968). Thus, a microfilament eruption might be the fundamental driver
of many spicules, just as a minifilament eruption is the fundamental driver of many coronal jets.
Similarly, a 0".5-FWHM smoothing renders some enhanced spicular activities to resemble previously-reported
"twinned" spicules, while the full-resolution features might account for spicules sometimes
appearing as 2D-sheet-like structures.
