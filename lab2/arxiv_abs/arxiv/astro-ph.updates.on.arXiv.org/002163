Context. Blazars are a subset of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets that are oriented along our
line of sight. Variability and spectral energy distribution (SED) studies are crucial tools for
understanding the physical processes responsible for observed AGN emission. Aims. We report peculiar
behaviour in the bright gamma-ray blazar PKS 1424-418 and use its strong variability to reveal information
about the particle acceleration and interactions in the jet. Methods. Correlation analysis of
the extensive optical coverage by the ATOM telescope and nearly continuous gamma-ray coverage
by the Fermi Large Area Telescope is combined with broadband, time-dependent modeling of the SED
incorporating supplemental information from radio and X-ray observations of this blazar. Results.
We analyse in detail four bright phases at optical-GeV energies. These flares of PKS 1424-418 show
high correlation between these energy ranges, with the exception of one large optical flare that
coincides with relatively low gamma-ray activity. Although the optical/gamma-ray behaviour
of PKS 1424-418 shows variety, the multiwavelength modeling indicates that these differences
can largely be explained by changes in the flux and energy spectrum of the electrons in the jet that
are radiating. We find that for all flares the SED is adequately represented by a leptonic model that
includes inverse Compton emission from external radiation fields with similar parameters. Conclusions.
Detailed studies of individual blazars like PKS 1424-418 during periods of enhanced activity in
different wavebands are helping us identify underlying patterns in the physical parameters in
this class of AGN.
