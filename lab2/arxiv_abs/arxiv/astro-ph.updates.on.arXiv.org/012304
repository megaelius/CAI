The beyond-Horndeski gravity has recently been reformulated in the dark energy paradigm - which
has been dubbed, Unified Dark Energy (UDE). The evolution equations for the given UDE appear to correspond
to a non-conservative dark energy scenario, in which the total energy-momentum tensor is not conserved.
We investigate both the background cosmology and, the large-scale imprint of the UDE by probing
the angular power spectrum of galaxy number counts, on ultra-large scales; taking care to include
the full relativistic corrections in the observed overdensity. The background evolution shows
that only an effective mass smaller than the Planck mass is needed in the early universe in order for
predictions in the given theory to match current observational constraints. We found that the effective
mass-evolution-rate parameter, which drives the evolution of the UDE, acts to enhance the observed
power spectrum and, hence, relativistic effects (on ultra-large scales) by enlarging the UDE sound
horizon. Conversely, both the (beyond) Horndeski parameter and the kineticity act to diminish
the observed power spectrum, by decreasing the UDE sound horizon. Our results show that, in a universe
with UDE, a multi-tracer analysis will be needed to detect the relativistic effects in the large-scale
structure. In the light of a multi-tracer analysis, the various relativistic effects hold the potential
to distinguish different gravity models. Moreover, while the Doppler effect will remain significant
at all epochs and, thus can not be ignored, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay and the potential
(difference) effects, respectively, will only become significant at epochs near z=3 and beyond,
and may be neglected at late epochs. In the same vein, the Doppler effect alone can serve as an effective
cosmological probe for the large-scale structure or gravity models, in the angular power spectrum
- at all z.
