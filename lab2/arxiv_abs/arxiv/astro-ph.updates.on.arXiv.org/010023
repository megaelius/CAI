On 2019 April 25.346 and 26.640 UT the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave (GW) observatories announced
the detection of the first candidate events in Observing Run 3 that contain at least one neutron star.
S190425z is a likely binary neutron star (BNS) merger at $d_L = 156 \pm 41$ Mpc, while S190426c is possibly
the first NS-BH merger ever detected, at $d_L = 377 \pm 100$ Mpc, although with marginal statistical
significance. Here we report our optical follow-up observations for both events using the MMT 6.5-m
telescope, as well as our spectroscopic follow-up of candidate counterparts (which turned out
to be unrelated) with the 4.1-m SOAR telescope. We compare to publicly reported searches, explore
the overall areal coverage and depth, and evaluate those in relation to the optical/NIR kilonova
emission from the BNS merger GW170817, to theoretical kilonova models, and to short GRB afterglows.
We find that for a GW170817-like kilonova, the partial volume covered spans up to about 40% for S190425z
and 60% for S190426c. For an on-axis jet typical of short GRBs, the search effective volume is larger,
but such a configuration is expected in at most a few percent of mergers. We further find that wide-field
$\gamma$-ray and X-ray limits rule out luminous on-axis SGRBs, for a large fraction of the localization
regions, although these searches are not sufficiently deep in the context of the $\gamma$-ray emission
from GW170817 or off-axis SGRB afterglows. The results indicate that some optical follow-up searches
are sufficiently deep for counterpart identification to about 300 Mpc, but that localizations
better than 1000 deg$^2$ are likely essential.
