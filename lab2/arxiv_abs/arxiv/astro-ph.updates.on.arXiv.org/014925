In a very recent paper [1], we have proposed a novel $4$-dimensional gravitational theory with two
dynamical degrees of freedom, which serves as a consistent realization of $D\to4$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity with the rescaled Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\tilde{\alpha}$. This has been made
possible by breaking a part of diffeomorphism invariance, and thus is consistent with the Lovelock
theorem. In the present paper, we study cosmological implications of the theory in the presence
of a perfect fluid and clarify the similarities and differences between the results obtained from
the consistent $4$-dimensional theory and those from the previously considered, naive (and inconsistent)
$D\rightarrow 4$ limit. Studying the linear perturbations, we explicitly show that the theory
only has tensorial gravitational degrees of freedom (besides the matter degree) and that for $\tilde{\alpha}>0$
and $\dot{H}<0$, perturbations are free of any pathologies so that we can implement the setup to
construct early and/or late time cosmological models. Interestingly, a $k^4$ term appears in the
dispersion relation of tensor modes which plays significant roles at small scales and makes the
theory different than not only general relativity but also many other modified gravity theories
as well as the naive (and inconsistent) $D\to 4$ limit. Taking into account the $k^4$ term, the observational
constraint on the propagation of gravitational waves yields the bound $\tilde{\alpha} \lesssim
{\cal O}(1)\,{\rm eV}^{-2}$. This is the first bound on the only parameter (besides the Newton's
constant and the choice of a constraint that stems from a temporal gauge fixing) in the consistent
theory of $D\to 4$ Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
