Ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) are objects with spectral types equal or later than M7. Most of them have
been discovered using wide-field imaging surveys. The Virtual Observatory (VO) has proven to be
of great utility to efficiently exploit these astronomical resources. We aim to validate a VO methodology
designed to discover and characterize UCDs in the J-PLUS photometric survey. J-PLUS is a multiband
survey carried out with the wide angle T80Cam optical camera mounted on the 0.83-m telescope JAST/T80
in the Observatorio Astrof\'isico de Javalambre. In this work we make use of the Internal Data Release
(IDR) covering 528 deg$^2$. We complement J-PLUS photometry with other catalogues in the optical
and IR using VOSA, a VO tool that estimates physical parameters from the spectral energy distribution
fitting to collections of theoretical models. Objects identified as UCDs are distinguished from
background M giants and highly reddened stars using parallaxes and proper motions from Gaia DR2.
We identify 559 UCDs, ranging from i=16.2 to 22.4 mag, of which 187 are candidate UCDs not previously
reported in the literature. This represents an increase in the number of known UCDs of about 50% in
the studied region of the sky, particularly at the faint end of our sensitivity, which is interesting
as reference for future wide and deep surveys such as Euclid. Three candidates constitute interesting
targets for exoplanet surveys because of their proximity (<40 pc). We also analyze the kinematics
of UCDs in our catalogue and find evidence that it is consistent with a Galactic thin-disk population,
except for 6 objects that might be members of the thick disk. The results obtained validate the proposed
methodology, which will be used in future J-PLUS and J-PAS releases. Considering the region of the
sky covered by the IDR used, we foresee to discover 3,000-3,500 new UCDs at the end of the J-PLUS project.
