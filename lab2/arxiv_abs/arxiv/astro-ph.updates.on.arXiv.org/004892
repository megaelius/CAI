What do we see when we look at a nearby, well-resolved galaxy? Thousands of individual sources are
detected in multiband imaging observations of even a fraction of a nearby galaxy, and characterizing
those sources is a complex process. This work analyses a ten-band photometric catalogue of nearly
70 000 point sources in a 7.3 square arcmin region of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 83, made as part
of the Early Release Science programme with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. Colour
distributions were measured for both broad-band and broad-and-narrow-band colours; colours
made from broad-bands with large wavelength differences generally had broader distributions
although B - V was an exception. Two- and three-dimensional colour spaces were generated using various
combinations of four bands and clustered with the K-Means and Mean Shift algorithms. Neither algorithm
was able to consistently segment the colour distributions: while some distinct features in colour
space were apparent in visual examinations, these features were not compact or isolated enough
to be recognized as clusters in colour space. K-Means clustering of the UBVI colour space was able
to identify a group of objects more likely to be star clusters. Mean Shift was successful in identifying
outlying groups at the edges of colour distributions. For identifying objects whose emission is
dominated by spectral lines, there was no clear benefit from combining narrow-band photometry
in multiple bands compared to a simple continuum subtraction. The clustering analysis results
are used to inform recommendations for future surveys of nearby galaxies.
