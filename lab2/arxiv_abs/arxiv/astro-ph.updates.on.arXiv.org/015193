We for the first time provide self-consistent axisymmetric phase-space distribution models for
the Milky Way's dark matter (DM) halo which are carefully matched against the latest kinematic measurements
through Bayesian analysis. By using broad priors on the individual galactic components, we derive
conservative estimates for the astrophysical factors entering the interpretation of direct and
indirect DM searches. While the resulting DM density profiles are in good agreement with previous
studies, implying $\rho_\odot \approx 10^{-2} \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$, the presence of baryonic
disc leads to significant differences in the local DM velocity distribution in comparison with
the spherical models. For direct detection, this implies roughly 30% stronger cross-section limits
at DM masses near detectors maximum sensitivity and up to an order of magnitude weaker limits at the
lower end of the mass range. Furthermore, by performing Monte-Carlo simulations for the upcoming
Darwin and DarkSide 20k experiments, we demonstrate that upon successful detection of heavy DM
with coupling just below the current limits, the carefully constructed axisymmetric models can
eliminate bias and reduce uncertainties by up to 40% in the reconstructed DM coupling and mass, but
also help in a more reliable determination of the scattering operator. Furthermore, the velocity
anisotropies induced by the baryonic disc, as well as halo rotation, can lead to significantly larger
annual modulation amplitude and sizeable differences in the directional distribution of the expected
DM-induced events. For indirect searches, we provide the differential $J$-factors and compute
several moments of the relative velocity distribution that are needed for computing the rate of
velocity-dependent annihilations. However, accurate predictions are still hindered by large
uncertainties regarding the central DM distribution.
