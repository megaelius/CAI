We study the influence of density-dependent symmetry energy at high densities in simulations of
core-collapse supernova, black hole formation and proto-neutron star cooling by extending the
relativistic mean field (RMF) theory used for the Shen EOS table. We adopt the extended RMF theory
to examine the density dependence of the symmetry energy with a small value of the slope parameter
$L$, while the original properties of the symmetric nuclear matter are unchanged. In order to assess
matter effects at high densities, we perform numerical simulations of gravitational collapse
of massive stars adopting the EOS table at high densities beyond $10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$ with the small
$L$ value, which is in accord with the experimental and observational constraints, and compare
them with the results obtained by using the Shen EOS. Numerical results for 11.2M$_{\odot}$ and
15M$_{\odot}$ stars exhibit minor effects around the core bounce and in the following evolution
for 200 ms. Numerical results for 40M$_{\odot}$ and 50M$_{\odot}$ stars reveal a shorter duration
toward the black hole formation with a smaller maximum mass for the small $L$ case. Numerical simulations
of proto-neutron star cooling through neutrino emissions demonstrate increasing effects of the
symmetry energy over 10 s due to neutron-rich environment at late phase. Neutrino cooling drastically
proceeds in a relatively long time scale with high luminosities and average energies due to hot and
high density central object for the small $L$ case. Evolution toward the cold neutron star is affected
because of the different behavior of neutron-rich matter under the change in the symmetry energy
at high densities. In contrast, supernova dynamics around core bounce takes place similarly in
less neutron-rich environment since the symmetric nuclear matter remains the same.
