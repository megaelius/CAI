We use the Planck nominal mission temperature maps to examine the stacked thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(tSZ) signal of 188042 "locally brightest galaxies" (LBGs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 7. Our LBG sample closely matches that of Planck Collaboration XI (2013, PCXI),
but our analysis differs in several ways. We work directly in terms of physically observable quantities,
requiring minimal assumptions about the gas pressure profile. We explicitly model the dust emission
from each LBG and simultaneously measure both the stacked tSZ and dust signals as a function of stellar
mass $M_*$. There is a small residual bias in stacked tSZ measurements; we measure this bias and subtract
it from our results, finding that the effects are non-negligible at the lowest masses in the LBG sample.
Finally, we compare our measurements with two pressure profile models, finding that the profile
from Battaglia et al. (2012b) provides a better fit to the results than the Arnaud et al. (2010) "universal
pressure profile". However, within the uncertainties, we find that the data are consistent with
a self-similar scaling with mass -- more precise measurements are needed to detect the relatively
small deviations from self-similarity predicted by these models. Our results are consistent with
PCXI for LBGs with $\log(M_*/M_\odot) > 11.3$; below this mass, however, we do not see evidence
for a stacked tSZ signal, in contrast to PCXI. The difference likely arises from our consideration
of dust and stacking bias effects. In particular, we note that the stacked dust emission is comparable
to or larger than the stacked tSZ signal for $\log(M_*/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.3$. Future tSZ analyses
with larger samples and lower noise levels should be able to probe deviations from self-similarity
and thus provide constraints on models of feedback and the evolution of hot halo gas over cosmic time.
