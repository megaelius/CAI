PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is a gamma-ray binary system consisting of a pulsar in an eccentric orbit around
a bright Oe stellar-type companion star that features a dense circumstellar disc. The high- and
very-high-energy (HE, VHE) gamma-ray emission from PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 around the times of its
periastron passage are characterised, in particular, at the time of the HE gamma-ray flares reported
to have occurred in 2011, 2014, and 2017. Spectra and light curves were derived from observations
conducted with the H.E.S.S.-II array in 2014 and 2017. A local double-peak profile with asymmetric
peaks in the VHE light curve is measured, with a flux minimum at the time of periastron $t_p$ and two
peaks coinciding with the times at which the neutron star crosses the companion's circumstellar
disc ($\sim t_p \pm 16$ d). A high VHE gamma-ray flux is also observed at the times of the HE gamma-ray
flares ($\sim t_p + 30$ d) and at phases before the first disc crossing ($\sim t_p - 35$ d). PSR B1259-63/LS
2883 displays periodic flux variability at VHE gamma-rays without clear signatures of super-orbital
modulation in the time span covered by H.E.S.S. observations. In contrast, the photon index of the
measured power-law spectra remains unchanged within uncertainties for about 200 d around periastron.
Lower limits on exponential cut-off energies up to $\sim 40$ TeV are placed. At HE gamma-rays, PSR
B1259-63/LS 2883 has now been detected also before and after periastron, close to the disc crossing
times. Repetitive flares with distinct variability patterns are detected in this energy range.
Such outbursts are not observed at VHEs, although a relatively high emission level is measured.
The spectra obtained in both energy regimes displays a similar slope, although a common physical
origin either in terms of a related particle population, emission mechanism, or emitter location
is ruled out.
