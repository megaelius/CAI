The origin of the narrow Fe-K{\alpha} fluorescence line at 6.4 keV from active galactic nuclei has
long been under debate; some of the possible sites are the outer accretion disk, the broad line region,
a molecular torus, or interstellar/intracluster media. In February-March 2016, we performed
the first X-ray microcalorimeter spectroscopy with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) onboard
the Hitomi satellite of the Fanaroff-Riley type I radio galaxy NGC 1275 at the center of the Perseus
cluster of galaxies. With the high energy resolution of ~5 eV at 6 keV achieved by Hitomi/SXS, we detected
the Fe-K{\alpha} line with ~5.4 {\sigma} significance. The velocity width is constrained to be
500-1600 km s$^{-1}$ (FWHM for Gaussian models) at 90% confidence. The SXS also constrains the continuum
level from the NGC 1275 nucleus up to ~20 keV, giving an equivalent width ~20 eV of the 6.4 keV line.
Because the velocity width is narrower than that of broad H{\alpha} line of ~2750 km s$^{-1}$, we
can exclude a large contribution to the line flux from the accretion disk and the broad line region.
Furthermore, we performed pixel map analyses on the Hitomi/SXS data and image analyses on the Chandra
archival data, and revealed that the Fe-K{\alpha} line comes from a region within ~1.6 kpc from the
NGC 1275 core, where an active galactic nucleus emission dominates, rather than that from intracluster
media. Therefore, we suggest that the source of the Fe-K{\alpha} line from NGC 1275 is likely a low-covering
fraction molecular torus or a rotating molecular disk which probably extends from a pc to hundreds
pc scale in the active galactic nucleus system.
