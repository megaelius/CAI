Galactic infrared (IR) bubbles, which have shell-like structures in the mid-IR wavelengths, are
known to contain massive stars near their centers. IR bubbles in inner Galactic regions ($|$l$|\leq$
65$^{\circ}$, $|$b$|\leq$ 1$^{\circ}$) have so far been studied well to understand the massive
star formation mechanisms. In this study, we expand the research area to the whole Galactic plane
(0$^{\circ}\leq$ l $<$360$^{\circ}$, $|$b$|\leq$ 5$^{\circ}$), using the AKARI all-sky survey
data. We limit our study on large bubbles with angular radii of $>1'$ to reliably identify and characterize
them. For the 247 IR bubbles in total, we derived the radii and the covering fractions of the shells,
based on the method developed in \citet{Hattori2016}. We also created their spectral energy distributions,
using the AKARI and Herschel photometric data, and decomposed them with a dust model, to obtain the
total IR luminosity and the luminosity of each dust component, i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), warm dust and cold dust. As a result, we find that there are systematic differences in the
IR properties of the bubbles between inner and outer Galactic regions. The total IR luminosities
are lower in outer Galactic regions, while there is no systematic difference in the range of the shell
radii between inner and outer Galactic regions. More IR bubbles tend to be observed as broken bubbles
rather than closed ones and the fractional luminosities of the PAH emission are significantly higher
in outer Galactic regions. We discuss the implications of these results for the massive stars and
the interstellar environments associated with the Galactic IR bubbles.
