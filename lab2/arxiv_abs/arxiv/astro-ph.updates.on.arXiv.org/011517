Aims. Our aim is to determine the distance of the UV outflow components from the central source, their
abundances and total column density, and the mechanism responsible for their observed absorption
variability. Methods. We studied the UV spectra acquired during the campaign as well as from three
previous epochs (2002-2010). Our main analysis tools are ionic column-density extraction techniques
and photoionization models (both equilibrium and time-dependent models) based on the code Cloudy.
Results. For component 1 (at -600 km/s) our findings include the following: metallicity that is
roughly twice solar; a simple model based on a fixed total column-density absorber, reacting to
changes in ionizing illumination that matches the different ionic column densities derived from
four spectroscopic epochs spanning 13 years; and a distance of R=6+2.5-1.5 pc from the central source.
Component 2 (at -1430 km/s) has shallow troughs and is at a much larger R. For component 3 (at -1880
km/s) our findings include: a similar metallicity to component 1; a photoionization-based model
can explain the major features of its complicated absorption trough variability and an upper limit
of 60 or 150 pc on R. This upper limit is consistent and complementary to the X-ray derived lower limit
of 12 or 31 pc for R. The total column density of the UV phase is roughly 1% and 0.1% of the lower and upper
ionization components of the warm absorber, respectively. Conclusions. The NGC 7469 outflow shows
super-solar metallicity similar to the outflow in Mrk 279, carbon and nitrogen are twice and four
times more abundant than their solar values, respectively. Similar to the NGC 5548 case, a simple
model can explain the physical characteristics and the variability observed in the outflow.
