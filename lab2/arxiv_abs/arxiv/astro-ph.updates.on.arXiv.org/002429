The present-day orbit distribution of the Neptune Trojans is a powerful probe of the dynamical environment
of the outer solar system during the late stages of planet migration. In this work, I conservatively
debias the inclination, eccentricity, and libration amplitude distributions of the Neptune Trojans
by reducing a priori unknown discovery and follow-up survey properties to nuisance parameters
and using a likelihood-free Bayesian rejection sampler for parameter estimation. Using this survey-agnostic
approach, I confirm that the Neptune Trojans are a dynamically excited population: at $>$95%
confidence, the Neptune Trojans' inclination width must be $\sigma_i > 11^\circ$. For comparison
and motivation purposes, I also model the Jupiter Trojan orbit distributions in the same basis and
produce new estimates of their parameters (Jupiter Trojan $\sigma_i=14.4^\circ \pm 0.5^\circ$,
$\sigma_{L11} = 11.8^\circ \pm 0.5^\circ$, and $\sigma_e = 0.061\pm 0.002$). The debiased inclination,
libration amplitude, and eccentricity distributions of the Neptune Trojans are nominally very
similar to those of the Jupiter Trojans. I use these new constraints to inform a suite of simulations
of Neptune Trojan capture by an eccentric, rapidly-migrating Neptune from an initially dynamically-hot
disk. These simulations demonstrate that if migration and eccentricity-damping timescales were
short ($\tau_a \lesssim 10$ Myr, $\tau_e \lesssim 1$ Myr), the disk that Neptune migrated into must
have been pre-heated (prior to Neptune's appearance) to a width comparable to the Neptune Trojans'
extant width to produce a captured population with an inclination distribution width consistent
with that of the observed population.
