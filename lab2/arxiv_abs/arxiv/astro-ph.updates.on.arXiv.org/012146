The space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler have already brought stringent constraints on the internal
structure of low-mass evolved stars, a large part of which results from the detection of mixed modes.
However, all the potential of these oscillation modes as a diagnosis of the stellar interior has
not been fully exploited yet. In particular, the coupling factor or the gravity-offset of mixed
modes, $q$ and $\varepsilon_{\rm g}$, are expected to provide additional constraints on the mid-layers
of red giants, which are located between the hydrogen-burning shell and the neighborhood of the
base of the convective zone. In the present paper, we investigate the potential of the coupling factor
in probing the mid-layer structure of evolved stars. Guided by typical stellar models and general
physical considerations, we modeled the coupling region along with evolution. We subsequently
obtained an analytical expression of $q$ based on the asymptotic theory of mixed modes and compared
it to observations. We show that the value of $q$ is degenerate with respect to the thickness of the
coupling evanescent region and the local density scale height. A structural interpretation of
the global variations in $q$ observed on the subgiant and the red giant branches, as well as on the
red clump, was obtained in the light of this model. We demonstrate that $q$ has the promising potential
to probe the migration of the base of the convective region as well as convective extra-mixing in
evolved red giant stars with typically $\nu_{\rm max} \lesssim 100~\mu$Hz. We also show that the
frequency-dependence of $q$ cannot be neglected in the oscillation spectra of such stars, which
is in contrast with what is assumed in the current measurement methods. This analytical study paves
the way for a more quantitative exploration of the link of $q$ with the internal properties of evolved
stars using stellar models.
