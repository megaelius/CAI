We present HCN J=4-3 and HCO^+ J=4-3 maps of six nearby star-forming galaxies, NGC 253, NGC 1068,
IC 342, M82, M83, and NGC 6946, obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the MALATANG
survey. All galaxies were mapped in the central 2 arcmin $\times$ 2 arcmin region at 14 arcsec (FWHM)
resolution (corresponding to linear scales of ~ 0.2-1.0 kpc). The L_IR-L'_dense relation, where
the dense gas is traced by the HCN J=4-3 and the HCO^+ J=4-3 emission, measured in our sample of spatially-resolved
galaxies is found to follow the linear correlation established globally in galaxies within the
scatter. We find that the luminosity ratio, L_IR/L'_dense, shows systematic variations with L_IR
within individual spatially resolved galaxies, whereas the galaxy-integrated ratios vary little.
A rising trend is also found between L_IR/L'_dense ratio and the warm-dust temperature gauged by
the 70 \mu m/100 \mu m flux ratio. We find the luminosity ratios of IR/HCN(4-3) and IR/HCO^+(4-3),
which can be taken as a proxy for the efficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (SFE_dense),
appears to be nearly independent of the dense-gas fraction (f_dense) for our sample of galaxies.
The SFE of the total molecular gas (SFE_mol) is found to increase substantially with f_dense when
combining our data with that on local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies and high-z quasars. The
mean L'_HCN(4-3)/L'_HCO^+(4-3) line ratio measured for the six targeted galaxies is 0.9+/-0.6.
No significant correlation is found for the L'_HCN(4-3)/L'_HCO^+(4-3) ratio with the SFR as traced
by L_IR, nor with the warm-dust temperature, for the different populations of galaxies.
