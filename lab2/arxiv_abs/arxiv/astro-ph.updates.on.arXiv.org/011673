The cosmic infrared background (CIB) provides a fundamental observational constraint on the star-formation
history of galaxies over cosmic history. We estimate the contribution to the CIB from catalogued
galaxies in the COSMOS field by using a novel map fitting technique on the \textit{Herschel} SPIRE
maps. Prior galaxy positions are obtained using detections over a large range in wavelengths in
the $K_{\rm s}$--3\,GHz range. Our method simultaneously fits the galaxies, the system foreground,
and the leakage of flux from galaxies located in masked areas and corrects for an "over-fitting"
effect not previously accounted for in stacking methods. We explore the contribution to the CIB
as a function of galaxy survey wavelength and depth. We find high contributions to the CIB with the
deep $r$ ($m_{\rm AB} \le 26.5$), $K_{\rm s}$ ($m_{\rm AB} \le 24.0$) and 3.6\,$\mu$m ($m_{\rm AB}
\le 25.5$) catalogues. We combine these three deep catalogues and find a total CIB contributions
of 10.5 $\pm$ 1.6, 6.7 $\pm$ 1.5 and 3.1 $\pm$ 0.7\,nWm$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$ at 250, 350 and 500\,$\mu$m,
respectively. Our CIB estimates are consistent with recent phenomenological models, prior based
SPIRE number counts and with (though more precise than) the diffuse total measured by FIRAS. Our
results raise the interesting prospect that the CIB contribution at $\lambda \le 500\,\mu$m from
known galaxies has converged. Future large-area surveys like those with the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope are therefore likely to resolve a substantial fraction of the population responsible
for the CIB at 250\,$\mu$m $\leq \lambda \leq$ 500\,$\mu$m.
