Coupled models of mantle thermal evolution, volcanism, outgassing, weathering, and climate evolution
for Earth-like (in terms of size and composition) stagnant lid planets are used to assess their prospects
for habitability. The results indicate that planetary CO$_2$ budgets ranging from $\approx 3$
orders of magnitude lower than Earth's to $\approx 1$ order of magnitude larger, and radiogenic
heating budgets as large or larger than Earth's, allow for habitable climates lasting 1-5 Gyrs.
The ability of stagnant lid planets to recover from potential snowball states is also explored;
recovery is found to depend on whether atmosphere-ocean chemical exchange is possible. For a "hard"
snowball with no exchange, recovery is unlikely, as most CO$_2$ outgassing takes place via metamorphic
decarbonation of the crust, which occurs below the ice layer. However, for a "soft" snowball where
there is exchange between atmosphere and ocean, planets can readily recover. For both hard and soft
snowball states, there is a minimum CO$_2$ budget needed for recovery; below this limit any snowball
state would be permanent. Thus there is the possibility for hysteresis in stagnant lid planet climate
evolution, where planets with low CO$_2$ budgets that start off in a snowball climate will be permanently
stuck in this state, while otherwise identical planets that start with a temperate climate will
be capable of maintaining this climate for 1 Gyrs or more. Finally, the model results have important
implications for future exoplanet missions, as they can guide observations to planets most likely
to possess habitable climates.
