We derive the mass model of the Milky Way (MW) using a cored dark matter (DM) halo profile and recent
data. The method used consists in fitting a spherically symmetric model of the Galaxy with a Burkert
DM halo profile to available data: MW terminal velocities in the region inside the solar circle,
circular velocity as recently estimated from maser star forming regions at intermediate radii,
and velocity dispersions of stellar halo tracers for the outermost Galactic region. The latter
are reproduced by integrating the Jeans equation for every modeled mass distribution, and by allowing
for different velocity anisotropies for different tracer populations. For comparison we also
consider a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We find that the cored profile is the preferred one, with
a shallow central density of rho_H~4x10^7M_s/kpc^3 and a large core radius R_H~10 kpc, as observed
in external spirals and in agreement with the mass model underlying the Universal Rotation Curve
of spirals. We describe also the derived model uncertainties, which are crucially driven by the
poorly constrained velocity dispersion anisotropies of halo tracers. The emerging cored DM distribution
has implications for the DM annihilation angular profile, which is much less boosted in the Galactic
center direction with respect to the case of the standard \Lambda CDM, NFW profile. Using the derived
uncertainties we discuss finally the limitations and prospects to discriminate between cored
and cusped DM profile with a possible observed diffuse DM annihilation signal. The present mass
model aims to characterize the present-day description of the distribution of matter in our Galaxy,
which is needed to frame current crucial issues of Cosmology, Astrophysics and Elementary Particles.
