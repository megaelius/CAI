In coalescing neutron star (NS) binaries, tidal force can resonantly excite low-frequency (< 500
Hz) oscillation modes in the NS, transferring energy between the orbit and the NS. This resonant
tide can induce phase shift in the gravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window
of studying NS interior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal excitations
of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure inertial modes (due to Coriolis
force), with the rotational effect treated in an approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs,
the buoyancy and rotational effects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes.
We develop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies and tidal coupling
coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase shift in the gravitational waveform due
to each resonance during binary inspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification.
We derive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on various properties
of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M = 1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation
rates (< 300 Hz), the gravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01
radian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a radian or more for low-mass
NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant phase shift can also be produced when the combination
of stratification and rotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame) modified
g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected by stratification, and that
the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a small but finite inertial-frame frequency based
on the Cowling approximation, in fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited.
