The Compact High Energy Camera (CHEC) is a camera design for the Small-Sized Telescopes (SSTs; 4
m diameter mirror) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). The SSTs are focused on very-high-energy
$\gamma$-ray detection via atmospheric Cherenkov light detection over a very large area. This
implies many individual units and hence cost-effective implementation. CHEC relies on dual-mirror
optics to reduce the plate-scale and make use of 6 $\times$ 6 mm$^2$ pixels, leading to a low-cost
($\sim$150 kEuro), compact (0.5 m $\times$ 0.5 m), and light ($\sim$45 kg) camera with 2048 pixels
providing a camera FoV of $\sim$9 degrees. The electronics are based on custom TARGET (TeV array
readout with GSa/s sampling and event trigger) ASICs and FPGAs sampling incoming signals at a gigasample
per second, with flexible camera-level triggering within a single backplane FPGA. CHEC is designed
to observe in the $\gamma$-ray energy range of 1$-$300 TeV, and at impact distances up to $\sim$500
m. To accommodate this and provide full flexibility for later data analysis, full waveforms with
96 samples for all 2048 pixels can be read out at rates up to $\sim$900 Hz. The first prototype, CHEC-M,
based on multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPMs) as photosensors, was commissioned and characterised
in the laboratory and during two measurement campaigns on a telescope structure at the Paris Observatory
in Meudon. In this paper, the results and conclusions from the laboratory and on-site testing of
CHEC-M are presented. They have provided essential input on the system design and on operational
and data analysis procedures for a camera of this type. A second full-camera prototype based on Silicon
photomultipliers (SiPMs), addressing the drawbacks of CHEC-M identified during the first prototype
phase, has already been built and is currently being commissioned and tested in the laboratory.
