We present 3D numerical simulations and an analytic model of reflection-driven MHD turbulence
in the solar wind. Our simulations describe transverse, non-compressive MHD fluctuations within
a narrow magnetic flux tube that extends from the photosphere out to a heliocentric distance $r$
of 21 solar radii $(R_s)$. We launch outward-propagating "$z^+$ fluctuations" into the simulation
domain by imposing a randomly evolving photospheric velocity field. As these fluctuations propagate
away from the Sun, they undergo partial reflection, producing inward-propagating "$z^-$ fluctuations."
Counter-propagating fluctuations subsequently interact, causing fluctuation energy to cascade
to small scales and dissipate. Our analytic model incorporates alignment, allows for strongly
or weakly turbulent nonlinear interactions, and divides the $z^+$ fluctuations into two populations
with different characteristic radial correlation lengths. The inertial-range power spectra
in our simulations evolve toward a $k_\perp^{-3/2}$ scaling at $r>10 R_s$, where $k_\perp$ is the
wave-vector component perpendicular to the background magnetic field. In two of our simulations,
the $z^+$ power spectra are much flatter between the coronal base and $r \simeq 4 R_s$. We argue that
these spectral scalings are caused by: (1) high-pass filtering in the upper chromosphere; (2) the
anomalous coherence of inertial-range $z^-$ fluctuations in a reference frame propagating outwards
with the $z^+$ fluctuations; and (3) the change in the sign of the radial derivative of the Alfv\'en
speed at $r=r_m \simeq 1.7 R_s$, which disrupts this anomalous coherence between $r=r_m$ and $r\simeq
2r_m$. At $r>1.3 R_s$, the turbulent heating rate in our simulations is comparable to the heating
rate in a previously developed solar-wind model that agreed with a number of observational constraints.
