The GOES X1 flare SOL2014-10-25T17:08:00 was a three-ribbon solar flare observed with IRIS in the
near and far ultraviolet. One of the flare ribbons crossed a sunspot umbra, producing a dramatic,
$\sim1000$% increase in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) continuum radiation. We comprehensively
analyze the ultraviolet spectral data of the umbral flare brightenings, which provide new challenges
for radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of the chromospheric velocity field and the white-light
continuum radiation. The emission line profiles in the umbral flare brightenings exhibit redshifts
and profile asymmetries, but these are significantly smaller than in another, well-studied X-class
solar flare. We present a ratio of the NUV continuum intensity to the Fe II 2814.45 Ang intensity.
This continuum-to-line ratio is a new spectral diagnostic of significant heating at high column
mass (log $m/$[g cm$^{-2}] >-2$) during solar flares because the continuum and emission line radiation
originate from relatively similar temperatures but moderately different optical depths. The
full spectral readout of these IRIS data also allow for a comprehensive survey of the flaring NUV
landscape: in addition to many lines of Fe II and Cr II, we identify a new solar flare emission line,
He I $\lambda2829.91$ (as previously identified in laboratory and early-type stellar spectra).
The Fermi/GBM hard X-ray data provide inputs to radiative-hydrodynamic models (which will be presented
in Paper II) in order to better understand the large continuum-to-line ratios, the origin of the
white-light continuum radiation, and the role of electron beam heating in the low atmosphere.
