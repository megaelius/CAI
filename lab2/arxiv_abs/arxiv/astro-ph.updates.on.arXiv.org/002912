We study the properties of tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies in the context of a catalog
of ~500,000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We explore whether selection effects can
account for the overrepresentation of TDEs in E+A/post-starburst galaxies by creating matched
galaxy samples. Accounting for possible selection effects due to black hole (BH) mass, redshift
completeness, strong AGN presence, bulge colors, and surface brightness can reduce the apparent
overrepresentation of TDEs in E+A host galaxies by a factor of ~4 (from ~100-190 to ~25-48), but cannot
fully explain the preference. We find that TDE host galaxies have atypical photometric properties
compared to similar, "typical" galaxies. In particular, TDE host galaxies tend to live in or near
the "green valley" between star-forming and passive galaxies, and have bluer bulge colors ($\Delta
(g-r)$ ~ 0.3 mag), lower half-light surface brightnesses (by ~1 mag/sq."), higher Sersic indices
($\Delta n_g$ ~ 3), and higher bulge-to-total-light ratios ($\Delta B/T$ ~ 0.5) than galaxies with
matched BH masses. We find that TDE host galaxies appear more centrally concentrated, and that all
have high galaxy Sersic indices and B/T fractions---on average in the top 10% of galaxies of the same
BH mass---, suggesting a higher nuclear stellar density. We identify a region in Sersic index and
BH mass parameter space that contains ~2% of our reference catalog galaxies but >60% of TDE host galaxies.
In summary, TDE host galaxies appear to reside in or near the green valley, and to be more centrally
concentrated, with brighter and bluer cores, than typical galaxies of the same BH mass. These photometric
properties may be particularly useful for selecting candidate TDEs for spectroscopic follow-up
observations in large transient surveys. [abbreviated]
