We present high spatial resolution (FWHM$\sim$0.14'') observations of the CO($8-7$) line in GDS-14876,
a compact star-forming galaxy at $z=2.3$ with total stellar mass of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})=10.9$.
The spatially resolved velocity map of the inner $r\lesssim1$~kpc reveals a continous velocity
gradient consistent with the kinematics of a rotating disk with $v_{\rm rot}(r=1\rm kpc)=163\pm5$
km s$^{-1}$ and $v_{\rm rot}/\sigma\sim2.5$. The gas-to-stellar ratios estimated from CO($8-7$)
and the dust continuum emission span a broad range, $f^{\rm CO}_{\rm gas}=M_{\rm gas}/M_{\star}=13-45\%$
and $f^{\rm cont}_{\rm gas}=50-67\%$, but are nonetheless consistent given the uncertainties
in the conversion factors. The dynamical modeling yields a dynamical mass of$\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\odot})=10.58^{+0.5}_{-0.2}$
which is lower, but still consistent with the baryonic mass, $\log$(M$_{\rm bar}$= M$_{\star}$
+ M$^{\rm CO}_{\rm gas}$/M$_{\odot}$)$=11.0$, if the smallest CO-based gas fraction is assumed.
Despite a low, overall gas fraction, the small physical extent of the dense, star-forming gas probed
by CO($8-7$), $\sim3\times$ smaller than the stellar size, implies a strong concentration that
increases the gas fraction up to $f^{\rm CO, 1\rm kpc}_{\rm gas}\sim 85\%$ in the central 1 kpc. Such
a gas-rich center, coupled with a high star-formation rate, SFR$\sim$ 500 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
suggests that GDS-14876 is quickly assembling a dense stellar component (bulge) in a strong nuclear
starburst. Assuming its gas reservoir is depleted without replenishment, GDS-14876 will quickly
($t_{\rm depl}\sim27$ Myr) become a compact quiescent galaxy that could retain some fraction of
the observed rotational support.
