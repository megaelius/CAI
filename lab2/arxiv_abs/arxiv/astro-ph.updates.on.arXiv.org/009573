We analyze the dust environment of the distant comet C/2014 A4 (SONEAR), with a perihelion distance
near 4.1~au, using comprehensive observations obtained by different methods. We present an analysis
of spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry of comet C/2014 A4 (SONEAR), which were performed
on November 5~--~7, 2015, when its heliocentric distance was 4.2~au and phase angle was 4.7$^\circ$.
Long-slit spectra and photometric and linear polarimetric images were obtained using the focal
reducer SCORPIO-2 attached to the prime focus of the 6-m telescope BTA (SAO RAS, Russia). We simulated
the behavior of color and polarization in the coma presenting the cometary dust as a set of polydisperse
polyshapes rough spheroids. No emissions were detected in the 3800~--~7200~$\AA$ wavelength
range. The continuum showed a reddening effect with the normalized gradient of reflectivity 21.6$\pm$0.2\%
per 1000~$\AA$ within the 4650~--~6200~$\AA$ wavelength region. The fan-like structure in the
sunward hemisphere was detected. The radial profiles of surface brightness differ for r-sdss and
g-sdss filters, indicating predominance of submicron and micron-sized particles in cometary
coma. The dust color (g--r) varies from 0.75$ \pm $0.05$^m$ to 0.45$ \pm $0.06$^m$ along the tail.
For aperture radius near 20~000~km, the dust productions in various filters were estimated as $Af\rho
$~=~680$\pm$18~cm (r-sdss) and 887$ \pm $16~cm (g-sdss). The polarization map showed spatial
variations of polarization over the coma from about --3\% near the nucleus to --8\% at cometocentric
distance about 150~000~km. Our simulations show that the dust particles were dominated (or covered)
by ice and tholin-like organics. Spatial changes in the color and polarization can be explained
by particle fragmentation.
