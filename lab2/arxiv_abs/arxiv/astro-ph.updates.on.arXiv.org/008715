Ultrarefractory (UR) phases in CAIs could have formed at higher T compared to common CAI minerals
and thus they potentially provide constraints on very high-T processes in the solar nebula. We report
a detailed characterization of an UR phase davisite bearing CAI from a reduced type CV chondrite.
Absence of secondary iron- and/or alkali-rich phases and occurrence of LIME olivine indicate that
primitive chemical and isotopic compositions are preserved in the CAI. Davisite occur only in one
lithological unit that consists of three chemically and isotopically distinct parts: i) $^{16}$O-poor
regions with reversely-zoned melilite and davisite; ii) $^{16}$O-rich regions consisting of
unzoned, gehlenitic melilite, diopside and spinel; and iii) spinel framboids composed of $^{16}$O-rich
spinel and $^{16}$O-poor melilite. Random distribution of chemical and isotopic heterogeneities
with sharp boundaries in the CAI indicates its formation by an aggregation of mineral assemblages
formed and processed separately at different time and/or space. Although isotope exchange prior
to the final agglomeration of the CAI cannot be ruled out, we suggest that modification of chemical
and isotopic composition of porous CAI precursors or aggregation of isotopically distinct mineral
assemblages are alternative scenarios for the origin of O-isotopic heterogeneity in CAIs. In either
case, coexistence of spatially and/or temporally distinct $^{16}$O-rich and -poor gaseous reservoirs
at the earliest stage of the solar system formation is required. The grain-scale oxygen isotopic
disequilibrium in the CAI indicate that post-formation heating of the CAI was short, which can be
achieved by rapid outward transport of the CAI. High Ti$^{3+}$/Ti$^{\mathrm{tot}}$ ratios of
pyroxene and presence of LIME olivine document that the entire CAI formation process took place
under highly reducing conditions.
