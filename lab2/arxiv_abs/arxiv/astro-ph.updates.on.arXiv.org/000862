The ALHAMBRA (Advance Large Homogeneous Area Medium Band Redshift Astronomical) survey has observed
8 different regions of the sky, including sections of the COSMOS, DEEP2, ELAIS, GOODS-N, SDSS and
Groth fields using a new photometric system with 20 contiguous ~ $300\AA$ filters covering the optical
range, combining them with deep $JHKs$ imaging. The observations, carried out with the Calar Alto
3.5m telescope using the wide field (0.25 sq. deg FOV) optical camera LAICA and the NIR instrument
Omega-2000, correspond to ~700hrs on-target science images. The photometric system was designed
to maximize the effective depth of the survey in terms of accurate spectral-type and photo-zs estimation
along with the capability of identification of relatively faint emission lines. Here we present
multicolor photometry and photo-zs for ~438k galaxies, detected in synthetic F814W images, complete
down to I~24.5 AB, taking into account realistic noise estimates, and correcting by PSF and aperture
effects with the ColorPro software. The photometric ZP have been calibrated using stellar transformation
equations and refined internally, using a new technique based on the highly robust photometric
redshifts measured for emission line galaxies. We calculate photometric redshifts with the BPZ2
code, which includes new empirically calibrated templates and priors. Our photo-zs have a precision
of $dz/(1+z_s)=1%$ for I<22.5 and 1.4% for 22.5<I<24.5. Precisions of less than 0.5%
are reached for the brighter spectroscopic sample, showing the potential of medium-band photometric
surveys. The global $P(z)$ shows a mean redshift <z>=0.56 for I<22.5 AB and <z>=0.86
for I<24.5 AB. The data presented here covers an effective area of 2.79 sq. deg, split into 14 strips
of 58.5'x15.5' and represents ~32 hrs of on-target.
