We investigate emission lines of Lya, [OIII]5007, Ha, and [CII]158um from 1125 galaxies at z=4.9-7.0.
Our sample is composed of 1098 Lya emitters (LAEs) at z=4.9, 5.7, 6.6, and 7.0 identified by Subaru/Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC) narrowband surveys in the 4deg2 area covered by Spitzer large area survey with
Subaru/HSC (SPLASH) and 29 galaxies at z=5.148-7.508 with deep [CII] ALMA or PdBI data in the literature.
Fluxes of strong rest-frame optical emission lines of [OIII] and Ha (Hb) are constrained by significant
excesses found in the SPLASH 3.6 and 4.5um photometry. At z=4.9, the rest-frame Ha equivalent width,
EW^0_Ha, and the Lya escape fraction, f_Lya, positively correlate with the rest-frame Lya equivalent
width, EW_Lya. The f_Lya-EW_Lya correlation is similarly found at z~0-2, suggesting no evolution
of the correlation over z~0-5. The typical ionizing photon production efficiency of LAEs is logxi_ion/[Hz
erg^-1]~25.5, significantly (60-100%) higher than those of LBGs at a given UV magnitude. At z=5.7-7.0,
there exists an interesting turn-over trend that the [OIII]/Ha flux ratio increases in EW_Lya~0-30A,
where it reaches a maximum, and then decreases out to EW_Lya~130A. We also identify a negative correlation
between a [CII] luminosity to star-formation rate ratio (L_[CII]/SFR) and EW_Lya at the 4.5sigma
confidence level. We carefully investigate the physical origins of the trend and the correlations
with stellar-synthesis and photoionization models covering the vast parameter space of metallicity,
ionization parameter, and stellar age, and find that the [OIII]/Ha turn-over trend is explained
by a simple anti-correlation between EW_Lya and metallicity, indicative of the detections of the
very metal-poor (~0.04Zo) galaxies with EW_Lya~200A. Moreover, this simple anti-correlation
explains self-consistently all of the correlations of Lya, Ha, [OIII]/Ha, and [CII] identified
in our study.
