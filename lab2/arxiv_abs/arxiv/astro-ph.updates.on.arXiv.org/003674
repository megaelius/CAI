The recent discovery of fast transient events near critical curves of massive galaxy clusters,
which are interpreted as highly magnified individual stars in giant arcs due to caustic crossing,
opens up the possibility of using such microlensing events to constrain a range of dark matter models
such as primordial black holes and scalar field dark matter. Based on a simple analytic model, we
study lensing properties of a point mass lens embedded in a high magnification region, and derive
the dependence of the peak brightness, microlensing time scales, and event rates on the mass of the
point mass lens as well as the radius of a source star that is magnified, assuming the transverse velocity
of $500~{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. We find that the lens mass and source radius of the first event MACS J1149
Lensed Star 1 (LS1) are constrained, with the lens mass range of $0.1~M_\odot \lesssim M \lesssim
4\times 10^3M_\odot$ and the source radius range of $40~R_\odot \lesssim R \lesssim 260~R_\odot$.
In the most plausible case with $M\approx 0.3~M_\odot$ and $R\approx 180~R_\odot$, the source
star should have been magnified by a factor of $\approx 4300$ at the peak. The derived lens properties
are fully consistent with the interpretation that MACS J1149 LS1 is a microlensing event produced
by a star that contributes to the intra-cluster light. We argue that compact dark matter models with
high fractional mass densities for the mass range $10^{-5}M_\odot \lesssim M\lesssim 10^2M_\odot$
are inconsistent with the observation of MACS J1149 LS1 because such models predict too low magnifications.
Our work demonstrates a potential use of caustic crossing events in giant arcs to constrain compact
dark matter.
