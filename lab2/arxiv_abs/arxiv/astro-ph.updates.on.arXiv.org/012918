Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have long been observed to "twinkle" (i.e., their brightness varies
with time) on timescales from days to years in the UV/optical bands. Such AGN UV/optical variability
is essential for probing the physics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the accretion disk, and
the broad-line region. Here we show that the temperature fluctuations of an AGN accretion disk,
which is magnetically coupled with the corona, can account for observed high-quality AGN optical
light curves. We calculate the temperature fluctuations by considering the gas physics of the accreted
matter near the SMBH. We find that the resulting simulated AGN UV/optical light curves share the
same statistical properties as the observed ones as long as the dimensionless viscosity parameter
$\alpha$, which is widely believed to be controlled by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in
the accretion disk, is about $0.01$---$0.2$. Moreover, our model can simultaneously explain the
larger-than-expected accretion disk sizes and the dependence of UV/optical variability upon
wavelength for NGC 5548. Our model also has the potential to explain some other observational facts
of AGN UV/optical variability, including the timescale-dependent bluer-when-brighter color
variability and the dependence of UV/optical variability on AGN luminosity and black hole mass.
Our results also demonstrate a promising way to infer the black-hole mass, the accretion rate, and
the radiative efficiency, thereby facilitating understanding of the gas physics and MHD turbulence
near the SMBH and its cosmic mass growth history by fitting the AGN UV/optical light curves in the
era of time-domain astronomy.
