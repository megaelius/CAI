The discovery of a binary neutron star merger (NSM) through both its gravitational wave and electromagnetic
emission has revealed these events to be key sites of r-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we evaluate
the prospects of finding the remnants of Galactic NSMs by detecting the gamma-ray decay lines from
their radioactive r-process ejecta. The most promising isotope appears to be $^{126}$Sn, with
several lines in the energy range $415 - 695$ keV, because its half-life $t_{1/2} = 2.30(14)\times
10^{5}$ yr is comparable to the ages of the most recent NSMs; as $^{126}$Sn resides close to the second
r-process peak, its production in NSMs is also likely to be robust. Using a Monte Carlo procedure,
we predict that multiple remnants are detectable as individual sources by next-generation gamma-ray
telescopes which achieve sub-MeV line sensitivities of $\sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-6}$ $\gamma$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. However, given the unknown locations of the remnants, the most promising search strategy
is a systematic survey of the Galactic plane and bulge extending to high Galactic latitudes. Individual
known supernova remnants which may be mis-classified NSM remnants could also be targeted, especially
those located outside the Galactic plane. Once candidate NSM remnants are identified, the co-detection
of gamma-ray lines from $^{230}$Th could shed light on the production yield of heavy actinide nuclei
in NSMs. We also investigate the diffuse flux from longer-lived nuclei (e.g. $^{182}$Hf) that could
in principle trace the Galactic spatial distribution of NSMs over longer timescales, but find that
the detection of the diffuse flux appears challenging even with next-generation telescopes.
