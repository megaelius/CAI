We present the analysis, based on spectra collected at the Large Binocular Telescope, of the stellar
populations in seven spheroidal galaxies in the cluster XLSSJ0223 at $z$$\sim$1.22. The aim is
to constrain the epoch of their formation and their star formation history. Using absorption line
strenghts and full spectral fitting, we derive for the stellar populations of the seven spheroids
a median age <Age>=2.4$\pm$0.6 Gyr, corresponding to a median formation redshift $<$$z_f$$>$$\sim2.6_{-0.5}^{+0.7}$
(lookback time = 11$_{-1.0}^{+0.6}$ Gyr). We find a significant scatter in age, showing that massive
spheroids, at least in our targeted cluster, are not coeval. The median metallicity is [Z/H]=0.09$\pm$0.16,
as for early-types in clusters at 0$<$$z$<0.9. This lack of evolution of [Z/H] over the range 0$<$$z$$<$1.3,
corresponding to the last 9 billions years, suggests that no significant additional star formation
and chemical enrichment are required for cluster spheroids to reach the present-day population.
We do not detect significant correlation between age and velocity dispersion $\sigma_e$, or dynamical
mass M$_{dyn}$, or effective stellar mass density $\Sigma_e$. On the contrary, the metallicity
[Z/H] of the seven spheroids is correlated to their dynamical mass M$_{dyn}$, according to a relation
similar to the one for local spheroids. [Z/H] is also anticorrelated to stellar mass density $\Sigma_e$
because of the anticorrelation between M$_{dyn}$ and $\Sigma_e$. Therefore, the basic trends
observed in the local universe were already established at $z\sim1.3$, i.e. more massive spheroids
are more metal rich, have lower stellar mass density and tend to be older than lower-mass galaxies.
