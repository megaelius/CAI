[Abridged] Clumping in the radiation-driven winds of hot, massive stars affects the derivation
of synthetic observables across the electromagnetic spectrum. We implement a formalism for treating
wind clumping - in particular the light-leakage effects associated with a medium that is porous
in physical and velocity space - into the global (photosphere+wind) NLTE model atmosphere code
FASTWIND. We assume a stochastic, two-component wind consisting of a mixture of optically thick
and thin clumps embedded in a rarefied inter-clump medium. We account fully for the reductions in
opacity associated with porosity in physical and velocity-space, and for the well-known effect
that opacities depending on rho^2 are higher in clumpy winds than in smooth ones of equal mass-loss
rate. By formulating our method in terms of suitable mean and effective opacities for the clumpy
wind, we are able to compute models with the same speed (~15 min. on a modern laptop) as in previous
code-generations. Some first, generic results of the new models include: i) Confirming earlier
results that velocity-space porosity is critical for analysis of UV wind lines in O-stars; ii) for
the optical Halpha line, optically thick clumping effects are small for O-stars, but potentially
very important for late B and A-supergiants; iii) spatial porosity is a marginal effect for absorption
of high-energy X-rays in O-stars, as long as the mean-free path between clumps are kept at realistic
values; iv) porosity is negligible at typical O-star radio-photosphere radii; v) regarding the
wind ionization balance, a general trend is that increased rates of recombination in simulations
with optically thin clumps lead to overall lower degrees of ionization than in corresponding smooth
models, but that this effect now is counteracted by the increased levels of light-leakage associated
with porosity in physical and velocity space.
