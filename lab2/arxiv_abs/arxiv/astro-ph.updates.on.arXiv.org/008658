Despite the first detection of X-rays from massive stars occurring four decades ago, the physical
dependence of the emission mechanism(s) on the underlying stellar and binary properties of the
emitters remains uncertain. The young massive cluster Westerlund 1 provides an ideal testbed for
understanding this phenomenon, with over 50 cluster members detected in historical X-ray observations.
In the decade since these data were obtained, significant new multi-epoch observations of the cluster
have been made, allowing a fundamental reappraisal of the nature of both X-ray bright and dark stars.
A total of 45 X-ray sources within Wd1 now have precise spectral classifications. These observations
identify 16 candidate and confirmed massive binaries; by comparison 22 stars have X-ray properties
that imply a contribution from a wind collision zone. X-ray emission appears confined to O9-B0.5
supergiants, Wolf-Rayets and a small group of highly luminous interacting/post-interaction
binaries. Despite their presence in large numbers, no emission is seen from earlier, less evolved
O stars or later, cooler B super-/hypergiants. We suppose that the lack of X-ray emission from O giants
is due to their comparatively low bolometric luminosities if, as expected, they follow the canonical
L_X/L_bol relation for hot stars. The transition away from X-ray emission for OB supergiants occurs
at the location of the bistability jump; we speculate that below this limit, stellar wind velocities
are insufficient for internal, X-ray emitting shocks to form. Our results are consistent with recent
findings that massive binaries are not uniformly brighter than single stars of comparable luminosity
and spectral type, although it is noteworthy that the brightest and hardest stellar X-ray sources
within Wd1 are all either confirmed or candidate massive, interacting/post-interaction binaries
