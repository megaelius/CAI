We present a detailed investigation of X-ray source contents of eight young open clusters with ages
between 4 to 46 Myr using archival X-ray data from XMM-Newton. The probable cluster memberships
of the X-ray sources have been established on the basis of multi-wavelength archival data, and samples
of 152 pre-main sequence (PMS) low mass (< 2 M_\odot), 36 intermediate mass (2 - 10 M_\odot) and
16 massive (> 10 M_\odot) stars have been generated. X-ray spectral analyses of high mass stars
reveal the presence of high temperature plasma with temperature <2 keV, and mean L_X/L_{bol}
of 10^{-6.9}. In the case of PMS low mass stars, the plasma temperatures have been found to be in the
range of 0.2 keV to 3 keV with a median value of ~1.3 keV, with no significant difference in plasma temperatures
during their evolution from 4 to 46 Myr. The X-ray luminosity distributions of the PMS low mass stars
have been found to be similar in the young star clusters under study. This may suggest a nearly uniform
X-ray activity in the PMS low mass stars of ages ~4--14 Myr. These observed values of L_X/L_{bol}
are found to have a mean value of 10^{-3.6\pm0.4}, which is below the X-ray saturation level.The
L_X/L_{bol} values for the PMS low mass stars are well correlated with their bolometric luminosities,
that implies its dependence on the internal structure of the low mass stars. The difference between
the X-ray luminosity distributions of the intermediate mass stars and the PMS low mass stars has
not been found to be statistically significant. Their L_X/L_{bol} values, however have been found
to be significantly different from each other with a confidence level greater than 99.999%. The
possibility of X-ray emission from the intermediate mass stars due to a low mass star in close proximity
of the intermediate mass star can not be ruled out due to the limited spatial resolution of XMM-Newton.
