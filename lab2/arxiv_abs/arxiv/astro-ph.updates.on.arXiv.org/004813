Low-mass galaxies are subject to strong galactic outflows, in which cosmic rays may play an important
role, they can be best traced with low-frequency radio continuum observations, which are less affected
by spectral ageing. We present a study of the nearby star burst dwarf irregular galaxy IC 10 using
observations at 140 MHz with the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR), at 1580 MHz with the Very Large Array
(VLA) and at 6200 MHz with the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg telescope. We find that IC 10 has a low-frequency
radio halo, which manifests itself as a second component (thick disc) in the minor axis profiles
of the non-thermal radio continuum emission at 140 and 1580 MHz. These profiles are then fitted with
1D cosmic-ray transport models for pure diffusion and advection. We find that a diffusion model
fits best, with a diffusion coefficient of $D=(0.4$-$0.8) \times 10^{26}(E/{\rm GeV})^{0.5}~{\rm
cm^2\,s^{-1}}$, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than estimates both from anisotropic
diffusion and the diffusion length. In contrast, advection models, which cannot be ruled out due
to the mild inclination, while providing poorer fits, result in advection speeds close to the escape
velocity of $\approx$$50~\rm km\,s^{-1}$, as expected for a cosmic-ray driven wind. Our favoured
model with an accelerating wind provides a self-consistent solution, where the magnetic field
is in energy equipartition with both the warm neutral and warm ionized medium with an important contribution
from cosmic rays. Consequently, cosmic rays can play a vital role for the launching of galactic winds
in the disc--halo interface.
