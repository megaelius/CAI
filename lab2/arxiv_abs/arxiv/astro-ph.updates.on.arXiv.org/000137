Constraining the accretion flow geometry of black hole binaries in outburst is complicated by the
inability of simplified multi-colour disc models to distinguish between changes in the inner disc
radius and alterations to the emergent spectrum, parameterised by the phenomenological colour
correction factor, f_col. We analyse Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the low mass Galactic
black hole X-ray binary, GX 339-4, taken over seven epochs when the source was experiencing a state
transition. The accretion disc component is isolated using a pipeline resulting in robust detections
for disc luminosities, 0.001 < L_disc / L_Edd < 0.5. Assuming that the inner disc remains situated
at the innermost stable circular orbit over the course of a state transition, we measure the relative
degree of change in f_col required to explain the spectral evolution of the disc component. A variable
f_col that increases by a factor of ~ 2.0 - 3.5 as the source transitions from the high/soft state to
the low/hard state can adequately explain the observed disc spectral evolution. For the observations
dominated by a disc component, the familiar scaling between the disc luminosity and effective temperature,
L_disc ~ T_eff^4, is observed; however, significant deviations from this relation appear when
GX 339-4 is in the hard intermediate and low/hard states. Allowing for an evolving f_col between
spectral states, the L_disc-T_eff^4 law is recovered over the full range of disc luminosities,
although this depends heavily on the physically conceivable range of f_col. We demonstrate that
physically reasonable changes in f_col provide a viable description for multiple state transitions
of a black hole binary without invoking radial motion of the inner accretion disc.
