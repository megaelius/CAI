Lyman-alpha (Lya) is intrinsically the brightest line emitted from active galaxies. While it originates
from many physical processes, for star-forming galaxies the intrinsic Lya luminosity is a direct
tracer of the Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation produced by the most massive O- and early-type B-stars
with lifetimes of a few Myrs. As such, Lya luminosity should be an excellent instantaneous star formation
rate (SFR) indicator. However, its resonant nature and susceptibility to dust as a rest-frame UV
photon makes Lya very hard to interpret due to the uncertain Lya escape fraction, f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$.
Here we explore results from the CALYMHA survey at z=2.2, follow-up of Lya emitters (LAEs) at z=2.2-2.6
and a z~0-0.3 compilation of LAEs to directly measure f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$ with H-alpha (Ha). We
derive a simple empirical relation that robustly retrieves f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$ as a function of
Lya rest-frame EW (EW$_0$): f$_{esc,Ly\alpha}$= 0.0048 EW$_0$[A]$\pm0.05$ and we show that it
constrains a well-defined anti-correlation between ionisation efficiency and dust extinction
in LAEs. Observed Lya luminosities and EW$_0$ are easy measurable quantities at high redshift,
thus making our relation a practical tool to estimate intrinsic Lya and LyC luminosities under well
controlled and simple assumptions. Our results allow observed Lya luminosities to be used to compute
SFRs for LAEs at z~0-2.6 within 0.2 dex of the Ha dust corrected SFRs. We apply our empirical SFR(Lya,EW$_0$)
calibration to several sources at z>2.6 to find that star-forming LAEs have SFRs typically ranging
from 0.1 to 20 M$_{\odot}$/yr and that our calibration might be even applicable for the most luminous
LAEs within the epoch of re-ionisation. Our results imply high ionisation efficiencies and low
dust content in LAEs across cosmic time, and will be easily tested with future observations with
JWST.
