We present a new cosmological probe for galaxy clusters, the halo sparsity. This characterises
halos in terms of the ratio of halo masses measured at two different radii and carries cosmological
information encoded in the halo mass profile. Building upon the work of Balmes et al. (2014) we test
the properties of the sparsity using halo catalogs from a numerical N-body simulation of ($2.6$
Gpc/h)$^3$ volume with $4096^3$ particles. We show that at a given redshift the average sparsity
can be predicted from prior knowledge of the halo mass function. This provides a quantitative framework
to infer cosmological parameter constraints using measurements of the sparsity of galaxy clusters.
We show this point by performing a likelihood analysis of synthetic datasets with no systematics,
from which we recover the input fiducial cosmology. We also perform a preliminary analysis of potential
systematic errors and provide an estimate of the impact of baryonic effects on sparsity measurements.
We evaluate the sparsity for a sample of 104 clusters with hydrostatic masses from X-ray observations
and derive constraints on the cosmic matter density $\Omega_m$ and the normalisation amplitude
of density fluctuations at the $8$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ scale, $\sigma_8$. Assuming no systematics, we
find $\Omega_m=0.42\pm 0.17$ and $\sigma_8=0.80\pm 0.31$ at $1\sigma$, corresponding to $S_8\equiv
\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m}=0.48\pm 0.11$. Future cluster surveys may provide opportunities for
precise measurements of the sparsity. A sample of a few hundreds clusters with mass estimate errors
at a few percent level can provide competitive cosmological parameter constraints complementary
to those inferred from other cosmic probes.
