We present results for a galaxy-galaxy lensing study based on imaging data from the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope Legacy WIDE survey (CFHTLS-WIDE). From a 12 million object multi-colour catalogue for
124 deg^2 of photometric data in the u*g'r'i'z' filters we compute photometric redshifts (with
a scatter of \sigma_{\Delta z/(1+z)} = 0.033 and an outlier rate of \eta=2.0 per cent for i'<=22.5)
and extract galaxy shapes down to i'=24.0. We select a sample of lenses and sources with 0.05 <
z_d <= 1 and 0.05 < z_s <= 2. We fit three different galaxy halo profiles to the lensing signal,
a singular isothermal sphere (SIS), a truncated isothermal sphere (BBS) and a universal density
profile (NFW). We derive velocity dispersions by fitting an SIS out to 100 h^{-1} kpc to the excess
surface mass density \Delta\Sigma and perform maximum likelihood analyses out to a maximum scale
of 2 h^{-1} Mpc to obtain halo parameters and scaling relations. We find luminosity scaling relations
of \sigma_{red} ~ L^{0.24+-0.03} for the red lens sample, \sigma_{blue} ~ L^{0.23+-0.03} for blue
lenses and \sigma ~ L^{0.29+-0.02} for the combined lens sample with zeropoints of \sigma*_{red}=162+-2
km/s, \sigma*_{blue}=115+-3 km/s and \sigma*=135+-2 km/s at a chosen reference luminosity L*_{r'}
= 1.6 \times 10^10 h^{-2} L_{r',sun}. The steeper slope for the combined sample is due to the different
zeropoints of the blue and red lenses and the fact that blue lenses dominate at low luminosities and
red lenses at high luminosities. The mean effective redshifts for the lens samples are <z_{red}>=0.28
for red lenses, <z_{blue}>=0.35 for blue lenses and <z>=0.34 for the combined lens
sample.
