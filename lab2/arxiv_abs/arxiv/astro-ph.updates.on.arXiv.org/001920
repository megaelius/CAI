The remarkable HST datasets from the CANDELS, HUDF09, HUDF12, ERS, and BORG/HIPPIES programs have
allowed us to map out the evolution of the UV LF from z~10 to z~4. We develop new color criteria that
more optimally utilize the full wavelength coverage from the optical+near-IR observations over
our search fields, while simultaneously minimizing the incompleteness and eliminating redshift
gaps. We have identified 5991, 3391, 940, 598, 225, and 6 galaxy candidates at z~4, z~5, z~6, z~7,
z~8, and z~10, respectively from the ~1000 arcmin**2 area covered by these datasets. The large z~4-8
samples we have identified in the five CANDELS fields allow us to assess the cosmic variance; the
largest variations are apparent at z>=7. Our new LF determinations at z~4 and z~5 span a 6-mag
baseline (-22.5 to -16 AB mag). These determinations agree well with previous estimates, but the
larger samples and the larger volumes probed here result in a more reliable sampling of >L* galaxies
and allow us to reassess the form of the UV LFs. Our new LF results strengthen our earlier findings
to 4.5 sigma significance for a steeper UV LF at z>4, with alpha evolving from alpha=-1.64+/-0.04
at z~4 to alpha=-2.06+/-0.12 at z~7. The observed steepening of the UV LF is consistent with that
expected from the evolution of the halo mass function. With our improved constraints at the bright
end, we find less evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* over the redshift range z~4 to z~7
consistent with current models; the observed evolution in the LF is now largely represented by changes
in phi*. Even with the much larger sample of bright galaxies, we find no evidence for the LF having
a non-Schechter-like form at z~4-8. A simple conditional LF model based on halo growth and a modest
evolution in the M/L ratio of halos provides a good representation of the evolution of the UV LF.
