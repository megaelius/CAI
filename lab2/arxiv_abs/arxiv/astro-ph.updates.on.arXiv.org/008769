We present a temperature and a magnetic-field surface map of the K2 subgiant of the active binary
II Peg. Employed are high resolution Stokes IV spectra obtained with the new Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric
and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Our main result is
that the temperature features on II Peg closely correlate with its magnetic field topology. We find
a warm spot (350K warmer with respect to the effective temperature) of positive polarity and radial
field density of 1.1 kG coexisting with a cool spot (780K cooler) of negative polarity of 2 kG. Several
other cool features are reconstructed containing both polarities and with (radial) field densities
of up to 2 kG. The largest cool spot is reconstructed with a temperature contrast of 550 K, an area of
almost 10% of the visible hemisphere, and with a multipolar magnetic morphology. A meridional and
an azimuthal component of the field of up to +/-500G is detected in two surface regions between spots
with strong radial fields but different polarities. A force-free magnetic-field extrapolation
suggests that the different polarities of cool spots and the positive polarity of warm spots are
physically related through a system of coronal loops of typical height of approx. 2 Rstar. While
the H-alpha line core and its red-side wing exhibit variations throughout all rotational phases,
a major increase of blue-shifted H-alpha emission was seen for the phases when the warm spot is approaching
the stellar central meridian indicating high-velocity mass motion within its loop. We explain
the warm spots due to photospheric heating by a shock front from a siphon-type flow between regions
of different polarities while the majority of the cool spots is likely formed due to the expected
convective suppression like on the Sun.
