Recent observations of protoplanetary disks have revealed ring-like structures that can be associated
to pressure maxima. Pressure maxima are known to be dust collectors and planet migration traps.
Most of planet formation works are based either on the pebble accretion model or on the planetesimal
accretion model. However, recent studies proposed the possible formation of Jupiter by the hybrid
accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. We aim to study the full process of planet formation consisting
of dust evolution, planetesimal formation and planet growth at a pressure maximum in a protoplanetary
disk. We compute, through numerical simulations, the gas and dust evolution, including dust growth,
fragmentation, radial drift and particle accumulation at a pressure bump. We also consider the
formation of planetesimals by streaming instability and the formation of a moon-size embryo that
grows into a giant planet by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. We find that pressure
maxima in protoplanetary disks are efficient collectors of dust drifting inwards. The condition
of planetesimal formation by streaming instability is fulfilled due to the large amount of dust
accumulated at the pressure bump. Then, a massive core is quickly formed (in $\sim 10^4$ yr) by the
accretion of pebbles. After the pebble isolation mass is reached, the growth of the core slowly continues
by the accretion of planetesimals. The energy released by planetesimal accretion delays the onset
of runaway gas accretion, allowing a gas giant to form after $\sim$1 Myr of disk evolution. The pressure
maximum also acts as a migration trap. Pressure maxima in protoplanetary disks are preferential
locations for dust traps, planetesimal formation by streaming instability and planet migration
traps. All these conditions allow the fast formation of a giant planet by the hybrid accretion of
pebbles and planetesimals.
