There have been few attempts in the past to understand the collision of individual cases of interacting
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). We selected 8 cases of interacting CMEs and estimated their propagation
and expansion speeds, direction of impact and masses exploiting coronagraphic and heliospheric
imaging observations. Using these estimates with ignoring the errors therein, we find that the
nature of collision is perfectly inelastic for 2 cases (e.g., 2012 March and November), inelastic
for 2 cases (e.g., 2012 June and 2011 August), elastic for 1 case (e.g., 2013 October) and super-elastic
for 3 cases (e.g., 2011 February, 2010 May and 2012 September). Admitting large uncertainties in
the estimated directions, angular widths and pre-collision speeds; the probability of perfectly
inelastic collision for 2012 March and November cases diverge from 98%-60% and 100%-40%, respectively,
reserving some probability for other nature of collision. Similarly, the probability of inelastic
collision diverge from 95%-50% for 2012 June case, 85%-50% for 2011 August case, and 75%-15% for
2013 October case. We note that probability of super-elastic collision for 2011 February, 2010
May and 2012 September CMEs diverge from 90%-75%, 60%-45% and 90%-50%, respectively. Although
the sample size is small, we find a good dependence of nature of collision on CMEs parameters. The
crucial pre-collision parameters of the CMEs responsible for increasing the probability of super-elastic
collision, in descending order of priority, are their lower approaching speed, higher expansion
speed of the following CME over the preceding one, and longer duration of collision phase.
