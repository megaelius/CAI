We show that old isolated neutron stars in groups and clusters of galaxies experiencing a Quark-Nova
phase (QN: an explosive transition to a quark star) may be the sources of FRBs. Each fragment ("chunk")
of the ultra-relativistic QN ejecta provides a collisionless plasma for which the ambient medium
(galactic/halo, the intra-group/intra-cluster medium) acts as a relativistic plasma beam. Plasma
instabilities (the Buneman and the Buneman-induced thermal Weibel instabilities, successively)
are induced by the beam in the chunk. These generate particle bunching and observed coherent emission
at GHz frequency with a corresponding fluence in the Jy ms range. The duration (from micro-seconds
to hundreds of milli-seconds), repeats (on timescales of minutes to months), frequency drift and
the high occurrence rate of FRBs (a few per thousand years per galaxy) in our model are in good agreement
with observed properties of FRBs. All FRBs intrinsically repeat in our model and non-repetition
(i.e. the non detection of the fainter QN chunks) is detector-dependent and an artifact of the bandwidth
and of the fluence sensitivity threshold. Key properties of FRB 121102 (its years of activity) and
of FRB 180916.J0158+65 (its 16 day period) are recovered in our model. We give specific predictions,
notably: (i) because of the viewing angle (Doppler) effect, sub-GHz detectors (CHIME) will be associated
with dimmer and longer duration FRBs than GHz detectors (e.g. Parkes and ASKAP); (ii) CHIME should
detect on average 5 times more FRBs from a given QN than ASKAP and Parkes; (iii) super FRBs (i.e. tens
of thousands of Jy ms fluence) should be associated with intra-cluster medium QNe; (iii) monster
FRBs (i.e. millions of Jy ms fluence) associated with inter-galactic medium QNe might plausibly
occur with frequencies at the lower limit of the LOFAR's low-band antenna.
