The upcoming new generation of optical spectrographs on four-meter-class telescopes will provide
invaluable information for reconstructing the history of star formation in individual galaxies
up to redshifts of about 0.7. We aim at defining simple but robust and meaningful physical parameters
that can be used to trace the coexistence of widely diverse stellar components: younger stellar
populations superimposed on the bulk of older ones. We produce spectra of galaxies closely mimicking
data from the forthcoming Stellar Populations at intermediate redshifts Survey (StePS), a survey
that uses the WEAVE spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope. First, we assess our ability
to reliably measure both ultraviolet and optical spectral indices in galaxies of different spectral
types for typically expected signal-to-noise levels. Then, we analyze such mock spectra with a
Bayesian approach, deriving the probability density function of r- and u-band light-weighted
ages as well as of their difference. We find that the ultraviolet indices significantly narrow the
uncertainties in estimating the r- and u-band light-weighted ages and their difference in individual
galaxies. These diagnostics, robustly retrievable for large galaxy samples even when observed
at moderate signal-to-noise ratios, allow us to identify secondary episodes of star formation
up to an age of ~0.1 Gyr for stellar populations older than ~1.5 Gyr, pushing up to an age of ~1 Gyr for
stellar populations older than ~5 Gyr. The difference between r-band and u-band light-weighted
ages is shown to be a powerful diagnostic to characterize and constrain extended star-formation
histories and the presence of young stellar populations on top of older ones. This parameter can
be used to explore the interplay between different galaxy star-formation histories and physical
parameters such as galaxy mass, size, morphology, and environment.
