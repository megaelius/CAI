Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are one of the most promising targets for multimessenger
astronomy. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of BHNS undergoing merger
we showed that a magnetically--driven jet can be launched by the remnant if the NS is endowed with
a dipole B field extending from the interior into the exterior as in a radio pulsar. These self-consistent
studies considered a BHNS system with mass ratio $q=3:1$, BH spin $a/M_{BH}=0.75$ aligned with
the total orbital angular momentum (OAM), and a NS that is irrotational, threaded by an aligned B
field, and modeled by an $\Gamma$--law equation of state with $\Gamma=2$. Here, as a crucial step
in establishing BHNS systems as viable progenitors of central engines that power short gamma--ray
bursts (sGRBs) and thereby solidify their role as multimessenger sources, we survey different
BHNS configurations that differ in BH spin ($a/M_{BH} =-0.5,\,0,\,0.5,\,0.75$), in the mass ratio
($q=3:1$ and $q=5:1$), and in the orientation of the B field (aligned and tilted by $90^\circ$ with
respect to the OAM). We find that by $\Delta t\sim 3500M-4000M \sim 88(M_{NS}/1.4M_\odot){\rm
ms}-100(M_{NS}/1.4M_\odot)\rm ms$ after the peak gravitational wave signal a jet is launched
in the cases where the initial BH spin is $a/M_{BH}= 0.5$ or $0.75$. The lifetime of the jets[$\Delta
t\sim 0.5(M_{NS}/1.4M_\odot){\rm s-0.7}(M_{NS}/1.4M_\odot)\rm s$] and their Poynting luminosities
[$L_{jet}\sim 10^{51\pm 1}\rm erg/s$] are consistent with sGRBs, as well as with the Blandford--Znajek
mechanism. By the time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale
B field collimation in the other configurations we simulate. These results suggest that future
multimessenger detections from BHNSs are more likely produced by binaries with highly spinning
BH companions and small tilt-angle B fields.
