We have studied double-detonation explosions in double-degenerate (DD) systems with different
companion white dwarfs (WD) for modeling type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) by means of high-resolution
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We have found that only the primary WDs explode
in some of the DD systems, while the explosions of the primary WDs induce the explosions of the companion
WDs in the other DD systems. The former case is so-called Dynamically-Driven Double-Degenerate
Double-Detonation (D$^6$) explosion, or helium-ignited violent merger explosion. The supernova
ejecta of the primary WDs strip materials from the companion WDs, whose mass is $\sim 10^{-3}M_\odot$.
The stripped materials contain carbon and oxygen when the companion WDs are carbon-oxygen (CO)
WDs with He shells $\lesssim 0.04M_\odot$. Since they contribute to low-velocity ejecta components
as observationally interfered for iPTF14atg, D$^6$ explosions can be counterparts of sub-luminous
SNe Ia. The stripped materials may contribute to low-velocity C seen in several SNe Ia. In the latter
case, the companion WDs explode through He detonation if they are He WDs, and through double-detonation
mechanism if they are CO WDs with He shells. We name these explosions "triple" and "quadruple" detonation
(TD/QD) explosions after the number of detonations. The QD explosion may be counterparts of luminous
SNe Ia, such as SN 1991T and SN 1999aa, since they yield a large amount of $^{56}$Ni, and their He-detonation
products contribute to the early emissions accompanying such luminous SNe Ia. On the other hand,
the TD explosion may not yield a sufficient amount of $^{56}$Ni to explain luminous SNe Ia.
