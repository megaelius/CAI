We present the near-infrared observations of population II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge from
VVV survey. We identify 340 population II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge from VVV survey based on
their match with OGLE-III Catalogue. The single-epoch $JH$ and multi-epoch $K_s$ observations
complement the accurate periods and optical $(VI)$ mean-magnitudes from OGLE. The sample consisting
of BL Herculis and W Virginis subtypes is used to derive period-luminosity relations after correcting
mean-magnitudes for the extinction. Our $K_s$-band period-luminosity relation, $K_s = -2.189(0.056)~[\log(P)
- 1] + 11.187(0.032)$, is consistent with published work for BL Herculis and W Virginis variables
in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We present a combined OGLE-III and VVV catalogue with periods, classification,
mean magnitudes and extinction for 264 Galactic bulge population II Cepheids having good-quality
$K_s$-band light curves. The absolute magnitudes for population II Cepheids and RR Lyraes calibrated
using Gaia and Hubble Space Telescope parallaxes, together with calibrated magnitudes for Large
Magellanic Cloud population II Cepheids, are used to obtain a distance to the Galactic center, $R_0=8.34\pm0.03{\mathrm{(stat.)}}\pm0.41{\mathrm{(syst.)}}$,
which changes by $^{+ 0.05}_{-0.25}$ with different extinction laws. While noting the limitation
of small number statistics, we find that the present sample of population II Cepheids in the Galactic
bulge shows a nearly spheroidal spatial distribution, similar to metal-poor RR Lyrae variables.
We do not find evidence of the inclined bar as traced by the metal-rich red-clump stars. The number
density for population II Cepheids is more limited as compared to abundant RR Lyraes but they are
bright and exhibit a wide range in period that provides a robust period-luminosity relation for
an accurate estimate of the distance to the Galactic center.
