We investigate the morphological properties of 494 galaxies at z>1 from the GMASS survey, in
their optical rest-frame, using HST/WFC3-IR images from CANDELS. The fractions of ellipticals
and disks decline between z=1 to z=3, while at higher z the galaxy population is dominated by irregulars.
Ellipticals have the highest concentration and Gini values, while irregulars assume the lowest
ones. However, at 1<z<3, morphological parameters are not as effective in distinguishing
the different Hubble types as they are at low z. No significant morphological k-correction was found
to be required for the Hubble type classification. From a quantitative point of view, however, there
are some differences between the optical and UV morphologies. Different morphological types occupy
the two peaks of the (U-B) colour distribution: the majority of irregulars are found in the blue peak,
while ellipticals mainly populate the red one. Disks have a smoother colour distribution. We also
found that, in an UVJ diagram, the quiescent region is inhabited mainly by ellipticals and, to a less
extent, by disks. Only 33% of all ellipticals in our sample are red and passively evolving galaxies,
a percentage that is consistent with results obtained at z<1. There is a remarkable structural
similarity between red and blue ellipticals: they share the same Hubble type and have consistent
distributions of all morphological parameters, except asymmetry, with blue ellipticals being
less asymmetric than red ones. We finally compared our morphological and spectroscopic classifications.
Almost all irregulars have a star-forming spectrum. The majority of disks show signs of star-formation
activity in their spectra, though in some cases their red continuum indicates the presence of older
stellar populations. Finally, an elliptical morphology may be associated with either passively
evolving or strongly star-forming galaxies.
