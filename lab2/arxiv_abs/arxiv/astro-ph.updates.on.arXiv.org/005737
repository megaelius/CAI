While detecting low mass exoplanets at tens of au is beyond current instrumentation, debris discs
provide a unique opportunity to study the outer regions of planetary systems. Here we report new
ALMA observations of the 80-200 Myr old Solar analogue HD 107146 that reveal the radial structure
of its exo-Kuiper belt at wavelengths of 1.1 and 0.86 mm. We find that the planetesimal disc is broad,
extending from 40 to 140 au, and it is characterised by a circular gap extending from 60 to 100 au in
which the continuum emission drops by about 50%. We also report the non-detection of the CO J=3-2
emission line, confirming that there is not enough gas to affect the dust distribution. To date,
HD 107146 is the only gas-poor system showing multiple rings in the distribution of millimeter sized
particles. These rings suggest a similar distribution of the planetesimals producing small dust
grains that could be explained invoking the presence of one or more perturbing planets. Because
the disk appears axisymmetric, such planets should be on circular orbits. By comparing N-body simulations
with the observed visibilities we find that to explain the radial extent and depth of the gap, it would
be required the presence of multiple low mass planets or a single planet that migrated through the
disc. Interior to HD 107146's exo-Kuiper belt we find extended emission with a peak at ~20 au and consistent
with the inner warm belt that was previously predicted based on 22$\mu$m excess as in many other systems.
This warm belt is the first to be imaged, although unexpectedly suggesting that it is asymmetric.
This could be due to a large belt eccentricity or due to clumpy structure produced by resonant trapping
with an additional inner planet.
