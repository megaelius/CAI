[Abridged] We test the evolutionary model of cool close binaries on the observed properties of near
contact binaries (NCBs). Those with a more massive component filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries
whereas in SD2 binaries the Roche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model
assumes that, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor), mass transfer
occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of mass transfer, before mass equalization,
is identified with SD1 binary. We show that the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around
the less massive component (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the value
determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge sticks out above the Roche lobe.
It means, that in a binary with a (typical) mass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer
than resulting from the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why
we observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to predictions identifying
the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the Thermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued
mass transfer, past mass equalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified
with this phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are comparable to one
another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27 SD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries
(CBs) shows that relative number of both types of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of
mass transfer. Total masses, orbital angular momenta and orbital periods of SD1 and SD2 binaries
are indistinguishable from each other whereas they differ substantially from the corresponding
parameters of CBs. We conclude that the results of the analysis fully support the model presented
in this paper.
