The origin of the Halley-type comets (HTCs) is one of the last mysteries of the dynamical evolution
of the Solar System. Prior investigation into their origin has focused on two source regions: the
Oort cloud and the Scattered Disc. From the former it has been difficult to reproduce the non-isotropic,
prograde skew in the inclination distribution of the observed HTCs without invoking a multi-component
Oort cloud model and specific fading of the comets. The Scattered Disc origin fares better but suffers
from needing an order of magnitude more mass than is currently advocated by theory and observations.
Here we revisit the Oort cloud origin and include cometary fading. Our observational sample stems
from the JPL catalogue. We only keep comets discovered and observed after 1950 but place no a priori
restriction on the maximum perihelion distance of observational completeness. We then numerically
evolve half a million comets from the Oort cloud through the realm of the giant planets and keep track
of their number of perihelion passages with perihelion distance q<2.5AU, below which the activity
is supposed to increase considerably. We can simultaneously fit the HTC inclination and semi-major
axis distribution very well with a power law fading function of the form m^-k, where m is the number
of perihelion passages with q<2.5 AU and k is the fading index. We match both the inclination and
semi-major axis distributions when k~1 and the maximum imposed perihelion distance of the observed
sample is q~1.8AU. The value of k is higher than the one obtained for the Long-Period Comets (LPCs),
with k~0.7. This increase in k is most likely the result of cometary surface processes. We argue the
HTC sample is now most likely complete for q<1.8AU. We calculate that the steady-state number
of active HTCs with diameter D>2.3km and q<1.8AU is of the order of 100.
