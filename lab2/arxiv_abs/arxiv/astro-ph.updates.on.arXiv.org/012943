We present here AMUSING\textrm{++}; the largest compilation of nearby galaxies observed with
the MUSE integral field spectrograph so far. This collection consists of 635 galaxies from different
MUSE projects covering the redshift interval $0.0002<z<0.1$. The sample and its main properties
are characterized and described in here. It includes galaxies of almost all morphological types,
with a good coverage in the color-magnitude diagram, within the stellar mass range between 10$^8$
to 10$^{12}$M$_\odot$, and with properties resembling those of a diameter-selected sample. The
AMUSING++ sample is therefore suitable to study, with unprecendent detail, the properties of nearby
galaxies at global and local scales, providing us with more than 50 million individual spectra.
We use this compilation to investigate the presence of galactic outflows. We exploit the use of combined
emission-line images to explore the shape of the different ionized components and the distribution
along classical diagnostic diagrams to disentangle the different ionizing sources across the
optical extension of each galaxy. We use the cross correlation function to estimate the level of
symmetry of the emission lines as an indication of the presence of shocks and/or active galactic
nuclei. We uncovered a total of 54 outflows, comprising $\sim$8\% of the sample. A large number of
the discovered outflows correspond to those driven by active galactic nuclei ($\sim$60\%), suggesting
some bias in the selection of our sample. No clear evidence was found that outflow host galaxies are
highly star-forming, and outflows appear to be found within all galaxies around the star formation
sequence.
