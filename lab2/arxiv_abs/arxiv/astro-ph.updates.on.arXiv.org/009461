The Evryscope is a telescope array designed to open a new parameter space in optical astronomy, detecting
short timescale events across extremely large sky areas simultaneously. The system consists of
a 780 MPix 22-camera array with an 8150 sq. deg. field of view, 13" per pixel sampling, and the ability
to detect objects down to Mg=16 in each 2 minute dark-sky exposure. The Evryscope, covering 18,400
sq.deg. with hours of high-cadence exposure time each night, is designed to find the rare events
that require all-sky monitoring, including transiting exoplanets around exotic stars like white
dwarfs and hot subdwarfs, stellar activity of all types within our galaxy, nearby supernovae, and
other transient events such as gamma ray bursts and gravitational-wave electromagnetic counterparts.
The system averages 5000 images per night with ~300,000 sources per image, and to date has taken over
3.0M images, totaling 250TB of raw data. The resulting light curve database has light curves for
9.3M targets, averaging 32,600 epochs per target through 2018. This paper summarizes the hardware
and performance of the Evryscope, including the lessons learned during telescope design, electronics
design, a procedure for the precision polar alignment of mounts for Evryscope-like systems, robotic
control and operations, and safety and performance-optimization systems. We measure the on-sky
performance of the Evryscope, discuss its data-analysis pipelines, and present some example variable
star and eclipsing binary discoveries from the telescope. We also discuss new discoveries of very
rare objects including 2 hot subdwarf eclipsing binaries with late M-dwarf secondaries (HW Vir
systems), 2 white dwarf / hot subdwarf short-period binaries, and 4 hot subdwarf reflection binaries.
We conclude with the status of our transit surveys, M-dwarf flare survey, and transient detection.
