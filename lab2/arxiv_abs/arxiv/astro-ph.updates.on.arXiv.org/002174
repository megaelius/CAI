The evolution and fate of very massive stars (VMS) is tightly connected to their mass-loss properties.
Their initial and final masses differ significantly as a result of mass loss. VMS have strong stellar
winds and extremely high ionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanical
and radiative feedback in giant Hii regions. However, how VMS mass-loss properties change during
stellar evolution is poorly understood. In the framework of the VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey (VFTS),
we explore the mass-loss transition region from optically thin O to denser WNh star winds, thereby
testing theoretical predictions. To this purpose we select 62 O, Of, Of/WN, and WNh stars, an unprecedented
sample of stars with the highest masses and luminosities known. We perform a spectral analysis of
optical VFTS as well as near-infrared VLT/SINFONI data using the non-LTE radiative transfer code
CMFGEN to obtain stellar and wind parameters. For the first time, we observationally resolve the
transition between optically thin O and optically thick WNh star winds. Our results suggest the
existence of a kink between both mass-loss regimes, in agreement with recent MC simulations. For
the optically thick regime, we confirm the steep dependence on the Eddington factor from previous
theoretical and observational studies. The transition occurs on the MS near a luminosity of 10^6.1Lsun,
or a mass of 80...90Msun. Above this limit, we find that - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping
(with f = 0.1) - wind mass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currently
adopted in stellar evolution calculations. We also show that this results in substantial helium
surface enrichment. Based on our spectroscopic analyses, we are able to provide the most accurate
ionising fluxes for VMS known to date, confirming the pivotal role of VMS in ionising and shaping
their environments.
