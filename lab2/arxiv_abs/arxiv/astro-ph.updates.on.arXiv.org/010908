In $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, to first order, galaxies form out of the cooling of baryons within the
virial radius of their dark matter halo. The fractions of mass and angular momentum retained in the
baryonic and stellar components of disc galaxies put strong constraints on our understanding of
galaxy formation. In this work, we derive the fraction of angular momentum retained in the stellar
component of spirals, $f_j$, the global star formation efficiency $f_M$, and the ratio of the asymptotic
circular velocity ($V_{\rm flat}$) to the virial velocity $f_V$, and their scatter, by fitting
simultaneously the observed stellar mass-velocity (Tully-Fisher), size-mass, and mass-angular
momentum (Fall) relations. We compare the goodness of fit of three models: (i) where the logarithm
of $f_j$, $f_M$, and $f_V$ vary linearly with the logarithm of the observable $V_{\rm flat}$; (ii)
where these values vary as a double power law; and (iii) where these values also vary as a double power
law but with a prior imposed on $f_M$ such that it follows the expectations from widely used abundance
matching models. We conclude that the scatter in these fractions is particularly small ($\sim 0.07$
dex) and that the linear model is by far statistically preferred to that with abundance matching
priors. This indicates that the fundamental galaxy formation parameters are small-scatter single-slope
monotonic functions of mass, instead of being complicated non-monotonic functions. This incidentally
confirms that the most massive spiral galaxies should have turned nearly all the baryons associated
with their haloes into stars. We call this the failed feedback problem.
