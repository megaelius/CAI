Rotational mapping and glint are two proposed methods to directly detect liquid water on the surface
of habitable exoplanets. However, false positives for both methods may prevent the unambiguous
detection of exoplanet oceans. We use simulations of Earth as an exoplanet to introduce a combination
of multiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and accompanying
analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean detection by spatially mapping the
ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates, the glint spot appears to "blink" as Lambertian scattering
continents interrupt the specular reflection from the ocean. This manifests itself as a strong
source of periodic variability in crescent-phase reflected light curves. We invert these light
curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent albedo of two surfaces at both quadrature
and crescent phase. At crescent phase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal
slices is increased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to the contribution
from glint. The land-bearing slices exhibit no significant change in apparent albedo with phase.
The presence of forward-scattering clouds in our simulated observation increases the overall
reflectivity toward crescent, but clouds do not correlate with any specific surfaces, thereby
allowing for the phase-dependent glint effect to be interpreted as distinct from cloud scattering.
Retrieving the same longitudinal map at quadrature and crescent phases may be used to tie changes
in the apparent albedo with phase back to specific geographic surfaces, although this requires
ideal geometries. We estimate that crescent-phase time-dependent glint detections are feasible
for between 1-10 habitable zone exoplanets orbiting the nearest G, K, and M dwarfs using a space-based,
high-contrast, direct-imaging telescope with a diameter >6 m.
