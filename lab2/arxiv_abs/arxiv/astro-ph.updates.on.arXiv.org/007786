The radio-loud/radio-quiet (RL/RQ) dichotomy in quasars is still an open question. Although it
is thought that accretion onto supermassive black holes in the centre the host galaxies of quasars
is responsible for some radio continuum emission, there is still a debate as to whether star formation
or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity dominate the radio continuum luminosity. To date, radio
emission in quasars has been investigated almost exclusively using high-frequency observations
in which the Doppler boosting might have an important effect on the measured radio luminosity, whereas
extended structures, best observed at low radio frequencies, are not affected by the Doppler enhancement.
We used a sample of quasars selected by their optical spectra in conjunction with sensitive and high-resolution
low-frequency radio data provided by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) as part of the LOFAR Two-Metre
Sky Survey (LoTSS) to investigate their radio properties using the radio loudness parameter ($\mathcal{R}
= \frac{L_{\mathrm{144-MHz}}}{L_{\mathrm{i\,band}}}$). The examination of the radio continuum
emission and RL/RQ dichotomy in quasars exhibits that quasars show a wide continuum of radio properties
(i.e. no clear bimodality in the distribution of $\mathcal{R}$). Radio continuum emission at low
frequencies in low-luminosity quasars is consistent with being dominated by star formation. We
see a significant albeit weak dependency of $\mathcal{R}$ on the source nuclear parameters. For
the first time, we are able to resolve radio morphologies of a considerable number of quasars. All
these crucial results highlight the impact of the deep and high-resolution low-frequency radio
surveys that foreshadow the compelling science cases for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).
