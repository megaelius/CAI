We have obtained measurements and upper limits on the emission of Cyg X-1 in the photon energy range
of 0.03--300 GeV based on observations by Fermi. We present the results separately for the hard and
soft spectral states, as well for all of the analysed data. In the hard state, we detect a weak steady
emission in the 0.1--10 GeV range with a power-law photon index of Gamma=2.6+-0.2 at a 4 sigma statistical
significance. This measurement, even if considered to be an upper limit, strongly constrains Compton
emission of the steady radio jet, present in that state. The number of relativistic electrons in
the jet has to be low enough for the spectral components due to Compton upscattering of the stellar
blackbody and synchrotron radiation to be within the observed fluxes. If optically-thin synchrotron
emission of the jet is to account for the MeV tail, as implied by the recently-claimed strong polarization
in that energy range, the magnetic field in the jet has to be much above equipartition. The GeV-range
measurements also strongly constrain models of hot accretion flows, most likely present in the
hard state, in which gamma-rays are produced from decay of neutral pions produced in collisions
of energetic ions in an inner part of the flow. In the soft state, the obtained upper limits constrain
electron acceleration in a non-thermal corona, most likely present around a blackbody accretion
disc. The coronal emission above 30 MeV has to be rather weak, which is most readily explained by absorption
of gamma-rays in pair-producing photon-photon collisions. Then, the size of the bulk of the corona
is less than a few tens of the gravitational radii.
