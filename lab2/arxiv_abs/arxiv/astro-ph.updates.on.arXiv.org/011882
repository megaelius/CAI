Thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) is a phenomenon that can occur in solar coronal loops when the heating
is quasi-constant and highly-stratified. Under such heating conditions, coronal loops undergo
cycles of evaporation and condensation. The recent observations of ubiquitous long-period intensity
pulsations in coronal loops and their relationship with coronal rain have demonstrated that understanding
the characteristics of TNE cycles is an essential step in constraining the circulation of mass and
energy in the corona. We report unique observations with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and
the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) that link the captured thermal properties across the extreme
spatiotemporal scales covered by TNE processes. Within the same coronal loop bundle, we captured
6 hr period coronal intensity pulsations in SDO/AIA and coronal rain observed off-limb in the chromospheric
Halpha and Ca II K spectral lines with SST/CRISP and SST/CHROMIS. We combined a multi-thermal analysis
of the cycles with AIA and an extensive spectral characterisation of the rain clumps with the SST.
We find clear evidence of evaporation-condensation cycles in the corona which are linked with periodic
coronal rain showers. The high-resolution spectroscopic instruments at the SST reveal the fine-structured
rain strands and allow us to probe the cooling phase of one of the cycles down to chromospheric temperatures.
These observations reinforce the link between long-period intensity pulsations and coronal rain.
They also demonstrate the capability of TNE to shape the dynamics of active regions on the large scales
as well as on the smallest scales currently resolvable.
