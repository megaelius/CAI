Modern observatories and instruments require optics fabricated at larger sizes with more stringent
performance requirements. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope will be the world's largest solar
telescope at 4.0 m aperture delivering a 300 Watt beam and a 5 arc-minute field. Spatial variation
of retardance is a limitation to calibration of the full field. Three polarimeters operate seven
cameras simultaneously in narrow bandpasses from 380 nm to 1800 nm. The DKIST polarization calibration
optics must be 120 mm in diameter at Gregorian focus to pass the beam and operate under high heat load,
UV flux and environmental variability. Similar constraints apply to the instrument modulators
with large beams near focal planes at F/18 to F/62. We assess how design factors can produce more spatial
and spectral errors simulating elliptical retardance caused by polishing errors. We measure over
5deg circular retardance and spectral oscillations over +-2 for optics specified as strictly linear
retarders. Spatial variations on scales larger than 10 mm contain 90% of the variation. Different
designs can be a factor of 2 more sensitive to polishing errors with dissimilar spatial distributions
even when using identical retardance bias values and materials. The calibration for the on axis
beam is not impacted once circular retardance is included. Calibration of the full field is limited
by spatial retardance variation unless techniques account for this variation. We show calibration
retarder variation at amplitudes of 1deg retardance for field angles greater than roughly one arc
minute for both quartz and MgF_2 retarders at visible wavelengths with significant variation between
the three DKIST calibration retarders. We present polishing error maps to inform new calibration
techniques attempting to deliver absolute accuracy of system calibration below effective cross-talk
levels of 1deg retardance.
