We present the methodology for a joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing from
the fourth data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) and galaxy clustering from the
partially overlapping BOSS and 2dFLenS surveys. Cross-correlations between galaxy positions
and ellipticities are incorporated into the analysis, developing a hybrid model of non-linear
scales that blends perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, and assessing signal contributions
by astrophysical effects. All weak lensing signals are measured consistently via Fourier-space
statistics that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing. The calibration
of photometric redshift distributions and multiplicative gravitational shear bias is updated,
and a more complete tally of residual calibration uncertainties is propagated into the likelihood.
A dedicated suite of more than 20000 mocks is used to assess the performance of covariance models
and to quantify the impact of survey geometry and spatial variations of survey depth on signals and
their errors. The sampling distributions for the likelihood and the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit
statistic are validated, with proposed changes to calculating the effective number of degrees
of freedom. Standard weak lensing point estimates on $S_8=\sigma_8\,(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{1/2}$
derived from its marginal posterior are easily misinterpreted to be biased low, and an alternative
estimator and associated credible interval are proposed. Known systematic effects pertaining
to weak lensing modelling and inference are shown to bias $S_8$ by no more than 0.1 standard deviations,
with the caveat that no conclusive validation data exist for models of intrinsic galaxy alignments.
Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, $S_8$ constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak
lensing alone and by 29% for the joint analysis. [abridged]
