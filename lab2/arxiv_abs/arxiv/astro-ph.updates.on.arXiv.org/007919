We study a very young star-forming region in the outer Galaxy that is the most concentrated source
of outflows in the Spitzer Space Telescope GLIMPSE360 survey. This region, dubbed CMa-l224, is
located in the Canis Major OB1 association. CMa-l224 is relatively faint in the mid-infrared, but
it shines brightly at the far-infrared wavelengths as revealed by the Herschel Space Observatory
data from the Hi-GAL survey. Using the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m data from the Spitzer/GLIMPSE360 survey,
combined with the JHK$_s$ 2MASS and the 70-500 $\mu$m Herschel/Hi-GAL data, we develop a young stellar
object (YSO) selection criteria based on color-color cuts and fitting of the YSO candidates' spectral
energy distributions with YSO 2D radiative transfer models. We identify 293 YSO candidates and
estimate physical parameters for 210 sources well-fit with YSO models. We select an additional
47 sources with GLIMPSE360-only photometry as `possible YSO candidates'. The vast majority of
these sources are associated with high H$_2$ column density regions and are good targets for follow-up
studies. The distribution of YSO candidates at different evolutionary stages with respect to Herschel
filaments supports the idea that stars are formed in the filaments and become more dispersed with
time. Both the supernova-induced and spontaneous star formation scenarios are plausible in the
environmental context of CMa-l224. However, our results indicate that a spontaneous gravitational
collapse of filaments is a more likely scenario. The methods developed for CMa-l224 can be used for
larger regions in the Galactic plane where the same set of photometry is available.
