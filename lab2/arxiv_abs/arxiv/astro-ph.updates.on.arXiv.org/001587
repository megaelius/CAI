We investigate the velocity vs. position phase space of z ~ 1 cluster galaxies using a set of 424 spectroscopic
redshifts in 9 clusters drawn from the GCLASS survey. Dividing the galaxy population into three
categories: quiescent, star-forming, and poststarburst, we find that these populations have
distinct distributions in phase space. Most striking are the poststarburst galaxies, which are
commonly found at small clustercentric radii with high clustercentric velocities, and appear
to trace a coherent ``ring" in phase space. Using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that
the coherent distribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using a simple
quenching scenario. Specifically, the phase space is best reproduced if satellite quenching occurs
on a rapid timescale (0.1 < tau_{Q} < 0.5 Gyr) after galaxies make their first passage of R ~
0.5R_{200}, a process that takes a total time of ~ 1 Gyr after first infall. We compare this quenching
timescale to the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburst galaxies and
find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapid quenching (tau_{Q} = 0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4}
Gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy. The similarity between the quenching timescales derived
from these independent indicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. Given that
the model implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within R_{200}, this would suggest
that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gas component of galaxies are the most plausible
candidates for the physical mechanism. The high cold gas consumption rates at z ~ 1 make it difficult
to determine if hot or cold gas stripping is dominant; however, measurements of the redshift evolution
of the satellite quenching timescale and location may be capable of distinguishing between the
two.
