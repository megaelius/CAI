PSR J1012+5307, a millisecond pulsar in orbit with a helium white dwarf (WD), has been timed with
high precision for about 25 years. One of the main objectives of this long-term timing is to use the
large asymmetry in gravitational binding energy between the neutron star and the WD to test gravitational
theories. Such tests, however, will be eventually limited by the accuracy of the distance to the
pulsar. Here, we present VLBI (very long baseline interferometry) astrometry results spanning
approximately 2.5 years for PSR J1012+5307, obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array as part of
the MSPSRPI project. These provide the first proper motion and absolute position for PSR J1012+5307
measured in a quasi-inertial reference frame. From the VLBI results, we measure a distance of $0.83^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$kpc
(all the estimates presented in the abstract are at 68% confidence) for PSR J1012+5307, which is
the most precise obtained to date. Using the new distance, we improve the uncertainty of measurements
of the unmodeled contributions to orbital period decay, which, combined with three other pulsars,
places new constraints on the coupling constant for dipole gravitational radiation $\kappa_D=(-1.7\pm1.7)\times
10^{-4}$ and the fractional time derivative of Newton's gravitational constant $\dot{G}/G = -1.8^{\,+5.6}_{\,-4.7}\times
10^{-13}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ in the local universe. As the uncertainties of the observed decays of
orbital period for the four leading pulsar-WD systems become negligible in $\approx10$ years,
the uncertainties for $\dot{G}/G$ and $\kappa_D$ will be improved to $\leq1.5\times10^{-13}\,{\rm
yr^{-1}}$ and $\leq1.0\times10^{-4}$, respectively, predominantly limited by the distance
uncertainties.
