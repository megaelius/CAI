Stellar population parameters correlate with a range of galaxy properties, but it is unclear which
relations are causal and which are the result of another underlying trend. In this series, we quantitatively
compare trends between stellar population properties and galaxy structural parameters in order
to determine which relations are intrinsically tighter, and are therefore more likely to reflect
a causal relation. Specifically, we focus on the galaxy structural parameters of mass $M$, gravitational
potential $\Phi\sim M/R_e$, and surface mass density $\Sigma\sim M/R_e^2$. In Barone et al. (2018)
we found that for early-type galaxies the age-$\Sigma$ and [Z/H]-$\Phi$ relations show the least
intrinsic scatter as well as the least residual trend with galaxy size. In this work we study the ages
and metallicities measured from full spectral fitting of 2085 star-forming galaxies from the SDSS
Legacy Survey, selected so all galaxies in the sample are probed to one effective radius. As with
the trends found in early-type galaxies, we find that in star-forming galaxies age correlates best
with stellar surface mass density, and [Z/H] correlates best with gravitational potential. We
discuss multiple mechanisms that could lead to these scaling relations. For the [Z/H]--$\Phi$
relation we conclude that gravitational potential is the primary regulator of metallicity, via
its relation to the gas escape velocity. The age--$\Sigma$ relation is consistent with compact
galaxies forming earlier, as higher gas fractions in the early universe cause old galaxies to form
more compactly during their in-situ formation phase, and may be reinforced by compactness-related
quenching mechanisms.
