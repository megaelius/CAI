Recent dynamical analysis based on Gaia data have revealed major accretion events in Milky Way's
history. Nevertheless, our understanding of the primordial Galaxy is hindered because the bona
fide identification of the most metal-poor and correspondently oldest accreted stars remains
challenging. Contrary to alpha-elements, neutron-capture elements present unexplained large
abundance spreads for low metallicity stars, that could result from a mixture of formation sites.
We have analysed the abundances of yttrium, europium, magnesium and iron in Milky Way satellite
galaxies, field halo stars and globular clusters. The chemical information has been complemented
with orbital parameters based on Gaia data. In particular, the orbit's average inclination has
been considered. The [Y/Eu] abundance behaviour with respect to the [Mg/Fe] turnovers for satellite
galaxies of different masses reveals that higher luminosity systems, for which the [Mg/Fe] abundance
declines at higher metallicities, present enhanced [Y/Eu] abundances, particularly in the [Fe/H]
regime between -2.25 and -1.25 dex. In addition, the analysis has uncovered a chemo-dynamical correlation
for both globular clusters and field stars of the Galactic halo, accounting for about half of the
[Y/Eu] abundance spread. [Y/Eu] under-abundances typical of protracted chemical evolutions,
are preferentially observed in polar-like orbits, pointing to a possible anisotropy in the accretion
processes. Our results strongly suggest that the observed [Y/Eu] abundance spread in the Milky
Way halo could result from a mixture of systems with different masses. They also highlight that both
nature and nurture are relevant to the Milky Way formation, since its primordial epochs, opening
new pathways for chemical diagnostics of our Galaxy building up.
