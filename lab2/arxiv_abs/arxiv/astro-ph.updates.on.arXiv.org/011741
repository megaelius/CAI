Photoevaporation and magnetically driven winds are two independent mechanisms to remove mass
from protoplanetary disks. In addition to accretion, the effect of these two principles acting
concurrently could be significant and the transition between those two has not been extensively
studied and quantified in the literature yet. In order to contribute to the understanding of disk
winds, we present the phenomena emerging in the framework of two-dimensional axisymmetric, non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamic simulations including EUV-/ X-ray driven photoevaporation. Of particular
interest are the examination of the transition region between photoevaporation and magnetically
driven wind, the possibility of emerging magneto-centrifugal wind effects, as well as the morphology
of the wind itself depending on the strength of the magnetic field. We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5D axisymmetric
configuration with additional treatment of EUV-/ X-ray heating and dynamic ohmic diffusion based
on a semi-analytical chemical model. We identify the transition between both outflow types to occur
for values of the initial plasma beta $\beta \geq 10^7$, while magnetically driven winds generally
outperform photoevaporation for stronger fields. In our simulations we observe irregular and
asymmetric outflows for stronger magnetic fields. In the weak field regime the photoevaporation
rates are slightly lowered by perturbations of the gas density in the inner regions of the disk. Overall,
our results predict a wind with a lever arm smaller than 1.5, consistent with a hot magneto-thermal
wind. Stronger accretion flows are present for values of $\beta < 10^7$.
