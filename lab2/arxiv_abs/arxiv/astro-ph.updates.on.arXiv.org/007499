This white paper envisions a revolutionary post-DESI, post-LSST dark energy program based on intensity
mapping of the redshifted 21 cm emission line from neutral hydrogen out to redshift z ~ 6 at radio frequencies.
The proposed intensity mapping survey has the unique capability to quadruple the volume of the Universe
surveyed by optical programs, provide a percent-level measurement of the expansion history to
z ~ 6, open a window to explore physics beyond the concordance {\\Lambda}CDM model, and to significantly
improve the precision on standard cosmological parameters. In addition, characterization of
dark energy and new physics will be powerfully enhanced by cross-correlations with optical surveys
and cosmic microwave background measurements. The rich dataset obtained by the proposed intensity
mapping instrument will be simultaneously useful in exploring the time-domain physics of fast
radio transients and pulsars, potentially in live "multi-messenger" coincidence with other observatories.
The core Dark Energy/Inflation science advances enabled by this program are the following: i) Measure
the expansion history of the universe in the pre-acceleration era at the same precision as at lower
redshifts, providing an unexplored window for new physics. ii) Observe, or constrain, the presence
of inflationary relics in the primordial power spectrum, improving existing constraints by an
order of magnitude; iii) Observe, or constrain, primordial non-Gaussianity with unprecedented
precision, improving constraints on several key numbers by an order of magnitude. Detailed mapping
of the enormous, and still largely unexplored, volume of space observable in the mid-redshift (z
~ 2 - 6) range will thus provide unprecedented information on fundamental questions of vacuum energy
and early-universe physics.
