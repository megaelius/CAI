Every quasar (QSO) spectrum contains absorption-line signatures from the interstellar medium,
disk-halo interface, and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW). We analyze Hubble Space
Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) spectra of 132 QSOs to study the significance and
origin of SiIV absorption at $|v_{\rm LSR}|\leq100$ km/s in the Galactic halo. The gas in the north
predominantly falls in at $-50\lesssim v_{\rm LSR}\lesssim 0$ km/s, whereas in the south, no such
pattern is observed. The SiIV column density has an average and a standard deviation of $\langle
N_{\rm SiIV}\rangle=(3.8\pm1.4)\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. At $|b|\gtrsim 30$ degree, $N_{\rm
SiIV}$ does not significantly correlate with $b$, which cannot be explained by a commonly adopted
flat-slab geometry. We propose a two-component model to reconstruct the $N_{\rm SiIV}$-$b$ distribution:
a plane-parallel component $N_{\rm DH}^{\perp}$ to account for the MW's disk-halo interface and
a global component $N_{\rm G}$ to reproduce the weak dependence on $b$. We find $N_{\rm DH}^{\perp}=1.3^{+4.7}_{-0.7}\times10^{12}$
cm$^{-2}$ and $N_{\rm G}=(3.4\pm0.3)\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ on the basis of Bayesian analyses
and block bootstrapping. The global component is most likely to have a Galactic origin, although
its exact location is uncertain. If it were associated with the MW's CGM, we would find $M_{\rm gas,
all}\gtrsim4.7\times10^9\ M_{\odot} (\frac{C_f}{1})(\frac{R}{75\ {\rm kpc}})^2 (\frac{f_{\rm
SiIV}}{0.3})^{-1}(\frac{Z}{0.3\ Z_{\odot}})^{-1}$ for the cool gas at all velocities in the
Galactic halo. Our analyses show that there is likely a considerable amount of gas at $|v_{\rm LSR}|\leq100$
km s$^{-1}$ hidden in the MW's CGM. Along with this work, we make our QSO dataset publicly available
as the COS Quasar Database for Galactic Absorption Lines (COS-GAL).
