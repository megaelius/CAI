We present the largest survey of spectrally resolved mid-infrared water emission to date, with
spectra for 11 disks obtained with the Michelle and TEXES spectrographs on Gemini North. Water emission
is detected in 6 of 8 disks around classical T Tauri stars. Water emission is not detected in the transitional
disks SR 24 N and SR 24 S, in spite of SR 24 S having pre-transitional disk properties like DoAr 44, which
does show water emission (Salyk et al. 2015). With R~100,000, the TEXES water spectra have the highest
spectral resolution possible at this time, and allow for detailed lineshape analysis. We find that
the mid-IR water emission lines are similar to the "narrow component" in CO rovibrational emission
(Banzatti & Pontoppidan 2015), consistent with disk radii of a few AU. The emission lines are either
single peaked, or consistent with a double peak. Single-peaked emission lines cannot be produced
with a Keplerian disk model, and may suggest that water participates in the disk winds proposed to
explain single-peaked CO emission lines (Bast et al. 2011, Pontoppidan et al. 2011). Double-peaked
emission lines can be used to determine the radius at which the line emission luminosity drops off.
For HL Tau, the lower limit on this measured dropoff radius is consistent with the 13 AU dark ring (ALMA
partnership et al. 2015). We also report variable line/continuum ratios from the disks around DR
Tau and RW Aur, which we attribute to continuum changes and line flux changes, respectively. The
reduction in RW Aur line flux corresponds with an observed dimming at visible wavelengths (Rodriguez
et al. 2013).
