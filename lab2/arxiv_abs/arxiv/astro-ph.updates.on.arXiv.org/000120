The saturation level of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in a strongly radiation dominated
accretion disk is studied using a new Godunov radiation MHD code in the unstratified shearing box
approximation. Since vertical gravity is neglected in this work, our focus is on how the MRI saturates
in the optically thick mid-plane of the disk. We confirm that turbulence generated by the MRI is very
compressible in the radiation dominated regime, as found by previous calculations using the flux-limited
diffusion approximation. We also find little difference in the saturation properties in calculations
that use a larger horizontal domain (up to four times the vertical scale height in the radial direction).
However, in strongly radiation pressure dominated disks (one in which the radiation energy density
reaches 1% of the rest mass energy density of the gas), we find Maxwell stress from the MRI turbulence
is larger than the value produced when radiation pressure is replaced with the same amount of gas
pressure. At the same time, the ratio between Maxwell stress and Reynolds stress is increased by
almost a factor of 8 compared with the gas pressure dominated case. We suggest that this effect is
caused by radiation drag, which acts like bulk viscosity and changes the effective magnetic Prandtl
number of the fluid. Radiation viscosity significantly exceeds both the microscopic plasma viscosity
and resistivity, ensuring that radiation dominated systems occupy the high magnetic Prandtl number
regime. Nevertheless, we find radiative shear viscosity is negligible compared to the Maxwell
and Reynolds stress in the flow. This may have important implications for the structure of radiation
dominated accretion disks.
