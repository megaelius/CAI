The powerlaw X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei at moderate to high accretion rates normally
appear softer when they brighten, for which the underlying mechanisms are yet unclear. Utilizing
XMM-Newton observations and excluding photons $<$ 2 keV to avoid contamination from the soft excess,
in this work we scrutinize the powerlaw spectral variability of NCG 4051 from two new aspects. We
first find that a best-fit "softer-when-brighter" relation is statistically insufficient to
explain the observed spectral variabilities, and intervals deviated from the empirical relation
are clearly visible in the light curve of 2 -- 4 keV/4 -- 10 keV count rate ratio. The deviations are
seen not only between but also within individual XMM-Newton exposures, consistent with random
variations of the corona geometry or inner structure (with timescales as short as $\sim$ 1 ks), in
addition to those behind the smooth "softer-when-brighter" trend. We further find the "softer-when-brighter"
trend gradually weakens with the decreasing timescale (from $\sim$ 100 ks down to 0.5 ks). These
findings indicate that the powerlaw spectral slope is not solely determined by its brightness.
We propose a two-tier geometry, including flares/nano-flares on top of the inner disc and an embedding
extended corona (heated by the flares, in analogy to solar corona) to explain the observations together
with other observational clues in literature. Rapid spectral variabilities could be due to individual
flares/nano-flares, while slow ones are driven by the variations in the global activity of inner
disc region (akin to the variation of solar activity, but not the accretion rate) accompanied with
heating/cooling and inflation/contraction of the extended corona.
