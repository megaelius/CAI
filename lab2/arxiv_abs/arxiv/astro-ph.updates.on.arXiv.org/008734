Rapidly and differentially rotating compact stars are believed to be formed in binary neutron star
merger events, according to both numerical simulations and the multi-messenger observation of
GW170817. The lifetime and evolution of such a differentially rotating star, is tightly related
to the observations in the post-merger phase. Various studies on the maximum mass of differentially
rotating neutron stars have been done in the past, most of which assume the so-called $j$-const law
as the rotation profile inside the star and consider only neutron star equations of state. In this
paper, we extend the studies to strange star models, as well as to a new rotation profile model. Significant
differences are found between differentially rotating strange stars and neutron stars, with both
differential rotation laws. A moderate differential rotation rate for neutron stars is found to
be too large for strange stars, resulting in a rapid drop in the maximum mass as the differential rotation
degree is increased further from $\hat{A}\sim2.0$, where $\hat{A}$ is a parameter characterizing
the differential rotation rate for $j$-const law. As a result the maximum mass of a differentially
rotating self-bound star drops below the uniformly rotating mass shedding limit for a reasonable
degree of differential rotation. The continuous transition to the toroidal sequence is also found
to happen at a much smaller differential rotation rate and angular momentum than for neutron stars.
In spite of those differences, $\hat{A}$-insensitive relation between the maximum mass for a given
angular momentum is still found to hold, even for the new differential rotation law. Astrophysical
consequences of these differences and how to distinguish between strange star and neutron star
models with future observations are also discussed.
