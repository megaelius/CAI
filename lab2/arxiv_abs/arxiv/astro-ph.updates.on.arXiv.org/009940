We performed a fluctuation analysis of the Hubble Extremely Deep Field (XDF) at four optical wavelength
bands and found large fluctuations that are significantly brighter than those expected for ordinary
galaxies. Good cross-correlations with flat spectra are found down to 0.2 arcsec, indicating the
existence of a spatial structure even at the 0.2 arcsec scale. The detected auto and cross-correlations
provide a lower limit of 24 nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ for the absolute sky brightness at 700-900 nm, which
is consistent with previous observations. We searched for candidate objects to explain the detected
large fluctuation using the catalog of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), and found that the surface
number density of faint compact objects (FCOs) rapidly increases toward the faint end. Radial profiles
of FCOs are indistinguishable from the PSF, and the effective radius based on de Vaucouleur's law
is estimated to be smaller than 0.02 arcsec. The SEDs of FCOs follow a power law at optical wavelengths,
but show greater emission and structure at $\lambda$ > 1 $\mu$m. Assuming that the FCOs are the cause
of the excess brightness and fluctuations, the faint magnitude limit is 34.9 mag for the F775W band,
and the surface number density reaches $2.6 \times 10^3$ (arcsec)$^{-2}$. Recent gamma-ray observations
require that the redshift of FCOs must be less than 0.1, if FCOs are the origin of the excess optical
and infrared background. Assuming that FCOs consist of missing baryons, the mass and luminosity
of a single FCO range from $10^{2}$ to 1$0^{3}$ solar units, and mass-to-luminosity ratio is significantly
lower than 1.0 solar unit. The maximum effective radius of an FCO is 4.7 pc. These results and the good
correlation between near-infrared and X-ray background indicate that FCOs could be powered by
the gravitational energy associated with black holes.
