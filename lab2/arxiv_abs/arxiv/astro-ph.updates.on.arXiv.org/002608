We present the first observations of the Frontier Fields Cluster Abell S1063 taken with the newly
commissioned Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field spectrograph. Because
of the relatively large field of view (1 arcmin^2), MUSE is ideal to simultaneously target multiple
galaxies in blank and cluster fields over the full optical spectrum. We analysed the four hours of
data obtained in the Science Verification phase on this cluster and measured redshifts for 53 galaxies.
We confirm the redshift of five cluster galaxies, and determine the redshift of 29 other cluster
members. Behind the cluster, we find 17 galaxies at higher redshift, including three previously
unknown Lyman-alpha emitters at z>3, and five multiply-lensed galaxies. We report the detection
of a new z=4.113 multiply lensed galaxy, with images that are consistent with lensing model predictions
derived for the Frontier Fields. We detect C III], C IV, and He II emission in a multiply lensed galaxy
at z=3.116, suggesting the likely presence of an active galactic nucleus. We also created narrow-band
images from the MUSE datacube to automatically search for additional line emitters corresponding
to high-redshift candidates, but we could not identify any significant detections other than those
found by visual inspection. With the new redshifts, it will become possible to obtain an accurate
mass reconstruction in the core of Abell S1063 through refined strong lensing modelling. Overall,
our results illustrate the breadth of scientific topics that can be addressed with a single MUSE
pointing. We conclude that MUSE is a very efficient instrument to observe galaxy clusters, enabling
their mass modelling, and to perform a blind search for high-redshift galaxies.
