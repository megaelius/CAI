The accretion flow around the Galactic Center black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is expected to have
an electron temperature that is distinct from the ion temperature, due to weak Coulomb coupling
in the low-density plasma. We present four two-temperature general relativistic radiative magnetohydrodynamic
(GRRMHD) simulations of Sgr A* performed with the code KORAL. These simulations use different electron
heating prescriptions, motivated by different models of the underlying plasma microphysics.
We compare the Landau-damped turbulent cascade model used in previous work with a new prescription
we introduce based on the results of particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection. With
the turbulent heating model, electrons are preferentially heated in the polar outflow, whereas
with the reconnection model electrons are heated by nearly the same fraction everywhere in the accretion
flow. The spectra of the two models are similar around the submillimetre synchrotron peak, but the
models heated by magnetic reconnection produce variability more consistent with the level observed
from Sgr A*. All models produce 230~GHz images with distinct black hole shadows which are consistent
with the image size measured by the Event Horizon Telescope, but only the turbulent heating produces
an anisotropic `disc-jet' structure where the image is dominated by a polar outflow or jet at frequencies
below the synchrotron peak. None of our models can reproduce the observed radio spectral slope,
the large near-infrared and X-ray flares, or the near-infrared spectral index, all of which suggest
non-thermal electrons are needed to fully explain the emission from Sgr A*.
