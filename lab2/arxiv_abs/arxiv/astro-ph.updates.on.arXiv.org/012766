This is the last of three papers describing an `absolute' calibration of the GONG magnetograph using
and end-to-end simulation of its measurement process. The simulation begins with a MURaM 3D MHD
datacube and ends with a `synthetic magnetogram' of the corresponding magnetic field values as
they would be observed by GONG. We determine a calibration by comparing the synthetic magnetic field
measurements with the MURaM magnetic field values that produced them. The previous two papers have
described the GONG measurement process (both instrument and data processing), our simulation
of it, and the theory of magnetogram comparison and calibration. In this paper, we address some final
points on calibration, combine all of this work into a set of calibration curves, and consider the
results. We also review the results of the previous two papers for locality of reference. Our calibration
indicates that GONG magnetograms underestimate weak flux by a factor of over 2 near disk center,
but that factor decreases to about 1 as the line-of-sight approaches the limb. A preliminary investigation
of the generalizability of these results suggests other instruments will be affected in a similar
way. We also find that some differences in previous magnetograph comparisons are artifacts of instrumental
resolution which do not reflect an intrinsic calibration difference, and the measurements are
more similar than sometimes thought. These results are directly applicable to question of solar
wind prediction model accuracies, particularly in the search for the cause of the common discrepancy
between predicted solar wind magnetic flux at 1 AU and values measured in situ by current satellite
missions.
