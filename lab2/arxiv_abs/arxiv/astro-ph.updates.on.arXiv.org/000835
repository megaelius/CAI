The newly formed giant planets may have migrated and crossed a number of mutual mean motion resonances
(MMRs) when smaller objects (embryos) were accreting to form the terrestrial planets. We investigated
the effects of the planetesimal-driven migration of Jupiter and Saturn, and the influence of their
mutual 1:2 MMR crossing on terrestrial planet formation for the first time, by performing N-body
simulations. These simulations considered distinct timescales of MMR crossing and planet migration.
In total, 68 high-resolution simulation runs using 2000 disk planetesimals were performed, which
was a significant improvement on previously published results. Even when the effects of the 1:2
MMR crossing and planet migration were included in the system, Venus and Earth analogs (considering
both orbits and masses) successfully formed in several runs. In addition, we found that the orbits
of planetesimals beyond a ~1.5-2 AU were dynamically depleted by the strengthened sweeping secular
resonances associated with Jupiter's and Saturn's more eccentric orbits (relative to present-day)
during planet migration. However, this depletion did not prevent the formation of massive Mars
analogs (planets with more than 1.5 times Mars' mass). Although late MMR crossings (at t > 30 Myr)
could remove such planets, Mars-like small mass planets survived on overly excited orbits (high
e and/or i), or were completely lost in these systems. We conclude that the orbital migration and
crossing of the mutual 1:2 MMR of Jupiter and Saturn are unlikely to provide suitable orbital conditions
for the formation of solar system terrestrial planets. This suggests that to explain Mars' small
mass and the absence of other planets between Mars and Jupiter, the outer asteroid belt must have
suffered a severe depletion due to interactions with Jupiter/Saturn, or by an alternative mechanism
(e.g., rogue super-Earths).
