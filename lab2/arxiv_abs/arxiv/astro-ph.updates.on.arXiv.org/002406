We report high-resolution (R = 30\ 000, 45\ 000 and 75\ 000) echelle and medium-resolution (R = 22\
000 and 10\ 000) spectroscopic observations of the long-period, eclipsing binary $\epsilon$ Aurigae
during the 2009 - 2011 eclipse. Low-excitation shell lines, viz, the K {\sevensize \rm I} line at
7699 \AA\ (with 346 data points), Cr {\sevensize \rm I} lines at 5345.807 \AA\ and 5348.326 \AA\ and
Fe {\sevensize \rm I} line at 5110.435 \AA\ which originated from the disk shaped secondary, H$\alpha$
and the shell components of the Na D$_{1}$ and D$_{2}$ lines show significant variation in their
shapes and radial velocities during the eclipse. The equivalent width curve shown by the K {\sevensize
\rm I} line around the ingress and egress phases indicates that the gas density in the trailing edge
is about a factor of two higher than the density in the leading edge. Using a geometrical model, in
which a homogeneous, cylindrical Keplarian disk eclipses the F0Ia primary star and the shell absorption
lines originate from the gaseous atmosphere around an opaque disk, we fit the equivalent width and
the radial velocity curves of the K {\sevensize \rm I} line covering the full eclipse. A reasonably
good fit can be achieved by a low-mass binary model where the mass of the central star of the disk is
5.4 M$_{\odot}$ and the mass of the primary is 2.5 M$_{\odot}$ and a disk size of 8.9 AU. The low-mass
of the primary, with enhanced $s$-process elements found by Sadakane et al. (2010), supports that
it is a post-AGB F supergiant. For the high-mass binary model, the modelled radial velocity curve
deviates significantly from the observations.
