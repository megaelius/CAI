Very-high-energy (VHE; $\geq 10$ GeV) photons are expected from the nearest and brightest Gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). These energetic photons could provide compelling evidence about the radiative
processes, physical composition of the ejecta, emitting regions, among others. VHE photons, at
energies higher than 300 GeV, were recently reported by the MAGIC collaboration for GRB 190114C.
Immediately, GRB 190114C was followed up by a massive observational campaign covering a large fraction
of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this paper, we obtain the LAT light curve around the reported
position of GRB 190114C and show that it exhibits similar features to other bright LAT-detected
bursts; the first high-energy photon ($\geq$ 100 MeV) is delayed with the onset of the prompt phase
and the flux light curve exhibits a long-lived emission (lasting much longer than the prompt phase)
and a short-lasting bright peak (located at the beginning of long-lived emission). Analyzing the
multi-wavelength observations, we show that the short-lasting LAT and GBM bright peaks are consistent
with the synchrotron self-Compton reverse-shock model and the long-lived LAT, GBM, X-ray, optical
and radio emissions with the standard synchrotron forward-shock model that evolves from a stratified
stellar-wind like medium to a uniform ISM-like medium. Given the best-fit values, a bright optical
flash produced by synchrotron reverse-shock emission is expected. From our analysis we infer that
the high-energy photons are produced in the deceleration phase of the outflow and some additional
processes to synchrotron in the forward shocks should be considered to properly describe the LAT
photons with energies beyond the synchrotron limit. Moreover, we claim that an outflow endowed
with magnetic fields could describe the polarization and properties exhibited in the light curve
of GRB 190114C.
