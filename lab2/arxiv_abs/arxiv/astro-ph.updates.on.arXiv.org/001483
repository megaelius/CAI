Binary population synthesis (BPS) modelling is a very effective tool to study the evolution and
properties of close binary systems. The uncertainty in the parameters of the model and their effect
on a population can be tested in a statistical way, which then leads to a deeper understanding of the
underlying physical processes involved. To understand the predictive power of BPS codes, we study
the similarities and differences in the predicted populations of four different BPS codes for low-
and intermediate-mass binaries. We investigate whether the differences are caused by different
assumptions made in the BPS codes or by numerical effects. To simplify the complex problem of comparing
BPS codes, we equalise the inherent assumptions as much as possible. We find that the simulated populations
are similar between the codes. Regarding the population of binaries with one WD, there is very good
agreement between the physical characteristics, the evolutionary channels that lead to the birth
of these systems, and their birthrates. Regarding the double WD population, there is a good agreement
on which evolutionary channels exist to create double WDs and a rough agreement on the characteristics
of the double WD population. Regarding which progenitor systems lead to a single and double WD system
and which systems do not, the four codes agree well. Most importantly, we find that for these two populations,
the differences in the predictions from the four codes are not due to numerical differences, but
because of different inherent assumptions. We identify critical assumptions for BPS studies that
need to be studied in more detail.
