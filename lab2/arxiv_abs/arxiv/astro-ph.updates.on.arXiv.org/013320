A compact binary system implicating at least one rotating neutron star undergoes gravitomagnetic
tidal resonances as it inspirals toward its final merger. These have a dynamical impact on the phasing
of the emitted gravitational waves. The resonances are produced by the inertial modes of vibration
of the rotating star. Four distinct modes are involved, and the resonances occur within the frequency
band of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors when the star spins at a frequency that lies
within this band. The resonances are driven by the gravitomagnetic tidal field created by the companion
star; this is described by a post-Newtonian vector potential, which is produced by the mass currents
associated with the orbital motion. These resonances were identified previously by Flanagan and
Racine [Phys. Rev. D 75, 044001 (2007)], but these authors accounted only for the response of a single
mode, the r-mode, a special case of inertial modes. All four relevant modes are included in the analysis
presented in this paper. The total accumulated gravitational-wave phase shift is shown to range
from approximately $10^{-2}$ radians when the spin and orbital angular momenta are aligned, to
approximately $10^{-1}$ radians when they are anti-aligned. Such phase shifts will become measurable
in the coming decades with the deployment of the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors
(Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope); they might even come to light within this decade, thanks
to planned improvements in the current detectors. With good constraints on the binary masses and
spins gathered from the inspiral waveform, the phase shifts deliver information regarding the
internal structure of the rotating neutron star, and therefore on the equation of state of nuclear
matter.
