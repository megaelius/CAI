Context: The period-luminosity diagram (PLD) has proven to be a powerful tool for studying populations
of pulsating red giants. Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) provides a large data set including many long-period
variables (LPVs) on which this tool can be applied. Aims: We investigate the location of LPVs from
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds in the PLD using various optical and infrared luminosity indicators
from Gaia and 2MASS, respectively. We thereby distinguish between stars of different masses and
surface chemistry. Methods: The data set taken from the Gaia DR2 catalogue of LPVs allows for a homogeneous
study from low- to high-mass LPVs. These sources are divided into sub-populations of asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars according to their mass and their O- or C-rich nature using the Gaia-2MASS
diagram developed by our group. This diagram uses a Wesenheit index Wrp based on Wesenheit functions
in the Gaia and 2MASS photometric bands. Four different luminosity indicators are used to study
the period-luminosity (P-L) relations. Results: We provide the first observational evidence
of a P-L relation offset for both fundamental and 1O pulsators between low- and intermediate-mass
O-rich stars, in agreement with published pulsation predictions. Among the luminosity indicators
explored, sequence C' is the narrowest in the P-Wrp diagram, and is thus to be preferred over the other
PLDs for the determination of distances using LPVs. The majority of massive asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars and red supergiants form a smooth extension of sequence C of low- and intermediate-mass
AGB stars in the P-Wrp diagram, suggesting that they pulsate in the fundamental mode. All results
are similar in the two Magellanic Clouds.
