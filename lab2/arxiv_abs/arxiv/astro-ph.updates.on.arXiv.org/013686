We qualitatively assess and map the relative contribution of pre-processing and cluster related
processes to the build-up of A963, a massive cluster at z=0.2 showing an unusually high fraction
of star forming galaxies in its interior. We use Voronoi binning of positions of cluster members
on the plane of the sky in order to map the 2D variations of galaxy properties in the centre and infall
region of A963. We map four galaxy parameters (fraction of star forming galaxies, specific star
formation rate, HI deficiency and age of the stellar population) based on full SED fitting, 21cm
imaging and optical spectroscopy. We find an extended region dominated by passive galaxies along
a north-south axis crossing the cluster centre, possibly associated with known filaments of the
large-scale structure. There are signs that the passive galaxies in this region were quenched long
before their arrival in the vicinity of the cluster. Contrary to that, to the east and west of the cluster
centre lie regions of recent accretion dominated by gas rich, actively star forming galaxies not
associated with any substructure or filament. The few passive galaxies in this region appear to
be recently quenched, and some gas rich galaxies show signs of ongoing ram-pressure stripping.
We report the first tentative observations at 21cm of ongoing ram-pressure stripping at z=0.2,
as well as observed inflow of low-entropy gas into the cluster along filaments of the large-scale
structure. The observed galaxy content of A963 is a result of strongly anisotropic accretion of
galaxies with different properties. Gas rich, star forming galaxies are being accreted from the
east and west of the cluster and these galaxies are being quenched at r<R200, while the bulk of the
accretion, containing multiple groups, happens along the north-south axis and brings mostly passive
galaxies.
