Finding the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart of binary compact star merger, especially the binary
neutron star (BNS) merger, is critically important for gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, cosmology
and fundamental physics. On Aug. 17, 2017, Advanced LIGO and \textit{Fermi}/GBM independently
triggered the first BNS merger, GW170817, and its high energy EM counterpart, GRB 170817A, respectively,
resulting in a global observation campaign covering gamma-ray, X-ray, UV, optical, IR, radio as
well as neutrinos. The High Energy X-ray telescope (HE) onboard \textit{Insight}-HXMT (Hard X-ray
Modulation Telescope) is the unique high-energy gamma-ray telescope that monitored the entire
GW localization area and especially the optical counterpart (SSS17a/AT2017gfo) with very large
collection area ($\sim$1000 cm$^2$) and microsecond time resolution in 0.2-5 MeV. In addition,
\textit{Insight}-HXMT quickly implemented a Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation to scan
the GW localization area for potential X-ray emission from the GW source. Although it did not detect
any significant high energy (0.2-5 MeV) radiation from GW170817, its observation helped to confirm
the unexpected weak and soft nature of GRB 170817A. Meanwhile, \textit{Insight}-HXMT/HE provides
one of the most stringent constraints (~10$^{-7}$ to 10$^{-6}$ erg/cm$^2$/s) for both GRB170817A
and any other possible precursor or extended emissions in 0.2-5 MeV, which help us to better understand
the properties of EM radiation from this BNS merger. Therefore the observation of \textit{Insight}-HXMT
constitutes an important chapter in the full context of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger
observation of this historical GW event.
