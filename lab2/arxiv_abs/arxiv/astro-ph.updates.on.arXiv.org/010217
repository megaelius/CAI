We analyze the statistics of pulse arrival times in fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 and demonstrate
that they are remarkably similar to statistics of magnetar high-energy short bursts. Motivated
by this correspondence, we propose that repeating FRBs are generated during short bursts in the
closed field line zone of magnetar magnetospheres via a pulsar-like emission mechanism. Crustal
slippage events dislocate field line foot points, initiating intense particle acceleration and
pair production, giving rise to coherent radio emission similar to that generated near pulsar polar
caps. We argue that the energetics of FRB 121102 can be readily accounted for if the efficiency of
the conversion of Poynting flux into coherent radio emission is $\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}$, values
consistent with empirical efficiencies of radio emission in pulsars and radio-loud magnetars.
Such a mechanism could operate only in magnetars with preexisting low twist of the magnetosphere,
so that the charge density in the closed zone is initially insufficient to screen the electric field
provoked by the wiggling of magnetic field lines and is low enough to let $\sim 1$ GHz radio emission
escape the magnetosphere, which can explain the absence of FRBs from known magnetars. The pair cascades
crowd the closed flux tubes with plasma, screening the accelerating electric field, thus limiting
the radio pulse duration to $\sim1$ ms. Within the framework of our model, the current dataset of
the polarization angle variation in FRB 121102 suggests a magnetic obliquity $\alpha\lesssim40^\circ$
and viewing angle $\zeta$ with respect to the spin axis $\alpha<\zeta<180^\circ-\alpha$.
