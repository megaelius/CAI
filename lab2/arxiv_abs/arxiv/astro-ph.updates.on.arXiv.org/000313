We report spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type IIb SN 2011dh obtained between
4 and 34 days after the estimated date of explosion (May 31.5 UT). These data cover a wide wavelength
range from 2000 Angstroms in the ultraviolet (UV) to 2.4 microns in the near-infrared (NIR). NIR
spectra reveal helium in the atmosphere 3 days before the B-band maximum and confirm the classification
of SN 2011dh as a Type IIb. Optical spectra provide line profiles and velocity measurements of H I,
He I, Ca II and Fe II. UV spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph show that
the UV flux for SN 2011dh is low compared to other SN IIb. H I features are strong early and weaken during
the period of our observations. He I features are first detected eleven days after the explosion
and become progressively stronger. For all phases at which He is detected, the hydrogen line-forming
region is separated from the helium layer by about 4000 km/s. This velocity gap is consistent with
a H-rich shell surrounding the progenitor and we estimate the shell mass for SN 2011dh relative to
other SN IIb. Both H I and He I maintain a constant velocity after B-max while Ca II and Fe II velocities
continue to decline. Light curves are presented for twelve passbands. SN 2011dh reached a maximum
bolometric luminosity of 1.7 x 10^{42} erg/s, about 23 days after the explosion. NIR emission contributes
more than 35% of the total bolometric flux. We compare our results to other studies of SN 2011dh and
to other Type IIb SN. We find that SN IIb with different masses for the H shell have similar peak luminosities,
decline rates and colors from the time of maximum. That suggests that the progenitors inside of the
H shells are close to the same composition and mass. These data will provide firm constraints for
models of SN 2011dh based on the explosion of a yellow supergiant.
