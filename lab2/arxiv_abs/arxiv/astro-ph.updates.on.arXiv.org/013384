Active galactic nuclei are supermassive black holes surrounded by an accretion disk, two populations
of clouds, bipolar jets, and a dusty torus. The clouds move in Keplerian orbits at high velocities.
In particular, the broad-line region (BLR) clouds have velocities ranging from $1000$ to $10000$
km s$^{-1}$. Given the extreme proximity of these clouds to the supermassive black hole, frequent
collisions with the accretion disk should occur. The impact of BLR clouds onto the accretion disk
can produce strong shock waves where particles might be accelerated. The goal of this work is to investigate
the production of relativistic particles, and the associated non-thermal radiation in these events.
In particular, we apply the model we develop to the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. We analyze the efficiency
of diffusive shock acceleration in the shock of colliding clouds of the BLR with the accretion disk.
We calculate the spectral energy distribution of photons generated by the relativistic particles
and estimate the number of simultaneous impacts needed to explain the gamma radiation observed
by the Fermi satellite in Seyfert galaxies. We find that is possible to understand the measured gamma
emission in terms of the interaction of clouds with the disk if the hard X-ray emission of the source
is at least obscured between $20\%$ and $40\%$. The total number of clouds contained in the BLR region
might be between $3\times10^{8}$ and $6\times10^{8}$, which are values in good agreement with
the observational evidence. The maximum energy achieved by the protons ($\sim$ PeV) in this context
allows the production of neutrinos in the observing range of IceCube.
