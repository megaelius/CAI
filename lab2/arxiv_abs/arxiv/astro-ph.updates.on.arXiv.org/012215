Convection is thought to act as a turbulent viscosity in damping tidal flows and in driving spin and
orbital evolution in close convective binary systems. This turbulent viscosity should be reduced,
compared to mixing-length predictions, when the forcing (tidal) frequency $|{\omega}_t|$ exceeds
the turnover frequency ${\omega}_{cv}$ of the dominant convective eddies. However, two contradictory
scaling laws have been proposed and this issue remains highly disputed. To revisit this controversy,
we conduct the first direct numerical simulations (DNS) of convection interacting with the equilibrium
tidal flow in an idealized global model of a low-mass star. We present direct computations of the
turbulent effective viscosity, ${\nu}_E$, acting on the equilibrium tidal flow. We unexpectedly
report the coexistence of the two disputed scaling laws, which reconciles previous theoretical
(and numerical) findings. We recover the universal quadratic scaling ${\nu}_E \propto (|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv})^{-2}$
in the high-frequency regime $|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv} \gg 1$. Our results also support the
linear scaling ${\nu}_E \propto (|{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv})^{-1}$ in an intermediate regime
with $1 \leq |{\omega}_t|/{\omega}_{cv} = \mathcal{O}(10)$. Both regimes may be relevant to explain
the observed properties of close binaries, including spin synchronization of solar-type stars
and the circularization of low-mass stars. The robustness of these two regimes of tidal dissipation,
and the transition between them, should be explored further in more realistic models. A better understanding
of the interaction between convection and tidal flows is indeed essential to correctly interpret
observations of close binary stars and short-period planetary orbits.
