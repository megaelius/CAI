Binary stars are common. While only those with small separations may exchange gas with one another,
even the widest binaries interact with their gaseous surroundings. Drag forces and accretion rates
dictate how these systems are transformed by these interactions. We perform three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flows, in which a binary moves supersonically
relative to a homogeneous medium, using the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH. We simulate a range
of values of the initial semi-major axis of the orbit relative to the gravitational focusing impact
parameter of the pair. When the binary separation is less than the gravitational focusing impact
parameter, the pair orbits within a shared bow shock. When the pair is wider, each object has an individual
bow-shock structure. The long-term evolution of the binary is determined by the timescales for
accretion, slowing of the center of mass, and orbital inspiral. We find a clear hierarchy of these
timescales; a binary's center-of-mass motion is slowed over a shorter timescale than the pair inspirals
or accretes. In contrast to previous analytic predictions, which assume an unperturbed background
medium, we find that the timescale for orbital inspiral is proportional to the semi-major axis to
the $0.19 \pm 0.01$ power. This positive scaling indicates that gaseous drag forces can drive binaries
either to coalescence or to the critical separation at which gravitational radiation dominates
their further evolution. We discuss the implications of our results for binaries embedded in the
interstellar medium, active galactic nuclei disks, and common envelope phases.
