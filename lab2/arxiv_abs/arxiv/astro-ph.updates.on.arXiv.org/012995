The Sagittarius stream is one of the best tools that we currently have to estimate the mass and shape
of our Galaxy. However, assigning membership and obtaining the phase-space distribution of the
stars that form the tails is quite challenging. Our goal is to produce a catalogue of RR Lyrae stars
of Sagittarius and obtain an empiric measurement of the trends along the stream in sky position,
distance and tangential velocities. We generate two initial samples from the Gaia DR2 RR Lyrae catalogue:
one, selecting only the stars within \pm20deg of the orbital plane of Sagittarius (Strip) and the
other, the result of applying the Pole Count Map (nGC3) algorithm. We then use the model-independent,
deterministic method developed in this work to remove most of the contamination by detecting and
isolating the stream in distance and proper motions. The output is two empiric catalogues: the Strip
sample (higher-completeness, lower-purity) which contains 11 677 stars, and the nGC3 sample (higher-purity,
lower-completeness) with 6 608 stars. We characterise the changes along the stream in all the available
dimensions, the 5 astrometric ones plus the metallicity, covering more than 2pi rad in the sky and
obtain new estimates for the apocentres and the mean [Fe/H] of the RR Lyrae population. Also, we show
the first map of the two components of the tangential velocity, thanks to the combination of distances
and proper motions. Finally, we detect the bifurcation in the leading arm and report no significant
difference between the two branches, either in metallicity, kinematics or distance. We provide
the largest sample of RR Lyrae candidates of Sagittarius, which can be used as an input for a spectroscopic
follow-up or as a reference for the new generation of models of the stream through the interpolators
in distance and velocity that we have constructed.
