We present an extended version of the semi-analytical model, GalICS. Like its predecessor, eGalICS
applies a post-treatment of the baryonic physics on pre-computed dark-matter merger trees extracted
from an N-body simulation. We review all the mechanisms that affect, at any given time, the formation
and evolution of a galaxy in its host dark-matter halo. We mainly focus on the gas cycle from the smooth
cosmological accretion to feedback processes. To follow this cycle with high accuracy we introduce
some novel prescriptions: i) a smooth baryonic accretion with two phases: a cold mode and a hot mode
built on the continuous dark-matter accretion. In parallel to this smooth accretion, we implement
the standard photoionisation modelling to reduce the input gas flow on the smallest structures.
ii) a complete monitoring of the hot gas phase. We compute the evolution of the core density, the mean
temperature and the instantaneous escape fraction of the hot atmosphere by considering that the
hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the dark-matter potential well, and by applying a principle
of conservation of energy on the treatment of gas accretion, supernovae and super massive black
hole feedback iii) a new treatment for disc instabilities based on the formation, the migration
and the disruption of giant clumps. The migration of such clumps in gas-rich galaxies allows to form
pseudo-bulges. The different processes in the gas cycle act on different time scales, and we thus
build an adaptive time-step scheme to solve the evolution equations. The model presented here is
compared in detail to the observations of stellar-mass functions, star formation rates, and luminosity
functions, in a companion paper.
