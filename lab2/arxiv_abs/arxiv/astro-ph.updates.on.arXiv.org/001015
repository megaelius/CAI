We present an analysis of high-resolution N-body simulations of decaying dark matter cosmologies
focusing on the statistical properties of the transmitted Lyman-alpha forest flux in the high-redshift
intergalactic medium. In this type of model a dark matter particle decays into a slightly less massive
stable dark matter daughter particle and a comparably light particle. The small mass splitting
provides a non-relativistic kick velocity V_k to the daughter particle resulting in free-streaming
and subsequent damping of small-scale density fluctuations. Current Lyman-alpha forest power
spectrum measurements probe comoving scales up to ~ 2-3 h^-1 Mpc at redshifts z ~ 2-4, providing one
of the most robust ways to probe cosmological density fluctuations on relatively small scales.
The suppression of structure growth due to the free-streaming of dark matter daughter particles
also has a significant impact on the neutral hydrogen cloud distribution, which traces the underlying
dark matter distribution well at high redshift. We exploit Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum measurements
to constrain the amount of free-streaming of dark matter in such models and thereby place limits
on decaying dark matter based only on the dynamics of cosmological perturbations without any assumptions
about the interactions of the decay products. We find that SDSS 1D Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum
data place a lifetime-dependent upper limit V_k < 30-70 km/s for decay lifetimes < 10 Gyr.
This is the most stringent model-independent bound on invisible dark matter decays with small mass
splittings. For large mass splittings (large V_k), Lyman-alpha forest data restrict the dark matter
lifetime to Gamma^-1 > 40 Gyr. Forthcoming BOSS data should be able to provide more stringent
constraints on exotic dark matter, mainly because the larger BOSS quasar spectrum sample will significantly
reduce statistical errors.
