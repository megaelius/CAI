A large population of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) was recently discovered in the Coma cluster.
Here we present optical spectra of three such UDGs, DF7, DF44 and DF17, which have central surface
brightnesses of $\mu_g \approx 24.4-25.1$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The spectra were acquired as part
of an ancillary program within the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey. We stacked 19 fibers in the central regions
from larger integral field units (IFUs) per source. With over 13.5 hours of on-source integration
we achieved a mean signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the optical of $9.5$\AA$^{-1}$, $7.9$\AA$^{-1}$
and $5.0$\AA$^{-1}$, respectively, for DF7, DF44 and DF17. Stellar population models applied
to these spectra enable measurements of recession velocities, ages and metallicities. The recession
velocities of DF7, DF44 and DF17 are $6599^{+40}_{-25}$km/s, $6402^{+41}_{-39}$km/s and $8315^{+43}_{-43}$km/s,
spectroscopically confirming that all of them reside in the Coma cluster. The stellar populations
of these three galaxies are old and metal-poor, with ages of $7.9^{+3.6}_{-2.5}$Gyr, $8.9^{+4.3}_{-3.3}$Gyr
and $9.1^{+3.9}_{-5.5}$Gyr, and iron abundances of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ $-1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$,
$-1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ and $-0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$, respectively. Their stellar masses are $3$-$6\times10^8
M_\odot$. The UDGs in our sample are as old or older than galaxies at similar stellar mass or velocity
dispersion (only DF44 has an independently measured dispersion). They all follow the well-established
stellar mass$-$stellar metallicity relation, while DF44 lies below the velocity dispersion-metallicity
relation. These results, combined with the fact that UDGs are unusually large for their stellar
mass, suggest that stellar mass plays a more important role in setting stellar population properties
for these galaxies than either size or surface brightness.
