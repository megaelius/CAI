We present the discovery of PSR J0250+5854, a radio pulsar with a spin period of 23.5 s. This is the
slowest-spinning radio pulsar known. PSR J0250+5854 was discovered by the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky
Survey (LOTAAS), an all-Northern-sky survey for pulsars and fast transients at a central observing
frequency of 135 MHz. We subsequently detected pulsations from the pulsar in the interferometric
images of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, allowing for sub-arcsecond localization. This, along
with a pre-discovery detection 2 years prior, allowed us to measure the spin-period derivative
to be $\dot{P}=2.7 \times 10^{-14}$ s s$^{-1}$. The observed spin period derivative of PSR J0250+5854
indicates a surface magnetic field strength, characteristic age and spin-down luminosity of $2.6
\times 10^{13}$G, $13.7$ Myr and $8.2 \times 10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ respectively, for a dipolar
magnetic field configuration. This also places the pulsar beyond the conventional pulsar death
line, where radio emission is expected to cease. The spin period of PSR J0250+5854 is similar to those
of the high-energy-emitting magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs). However,
the pulsar was not detected by the Swift/XRT in the energy band of 0.3-10 keV, placing a bolometric
luminosity limit of $1.5 \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for an assumed $N_{\rm H}=1.35\times10^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$ and a temperature of 85 eV (typical of XDINSs). We discuss the implications of the discovery
for models of the pulsar death line as well as the prospect of finding more similarly long-period
pulsars, including the advantages provided by LOTAAS for this.
