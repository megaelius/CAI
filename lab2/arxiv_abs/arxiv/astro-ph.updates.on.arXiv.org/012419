It has been suggested by Weinberg et al. (2013) that an instability due to the nonlinear coupling
of a neutron star's tide to its $p$- and $g$-modes could affect the gravitational-wave phase evolution
of a neutron-star binary. Weinberg (2016) suggests that this instability can turn on as the gravitational-waves
pass through the sensitive band of ground-based detectors, although the size of the effect is not
known. The discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 provides an opportunity to look
for evidence of nonlinear tides from $p$-$g$ mode coupling. We compute Bayesian evidences that
compare waveform models that include the $p$-$g$ mode coupling to models that do not. Using the waveform
model and priors of Essick et al. (2016) we find that the observation of GW170817 is consistent with
$p$-$g$ mode coupling, in agreement with Abbott, B. P., et al. (2019a). We investigate the properties
of the model and find that this consistency is due to degeneracy in a large region of the parameter
space between the the model that includes nonlinear tides from $p$-$g$ mode coupling and the standard
post-Newtonian model that does not. We investigate the consistency of the GW170817 signal with
regions of the parameter space where the effect of nonlinear tides is not degenerate with the standard
model. Regions of the nonlinear tide parameter space that have a fitting factor of less than 99$\%$
(98.5$\%$) are disfavored by a Bayes factor of 15 (25). We conclude that the consistency of the GW170817
signal with the model of Essick et al. (2016) is due to parameter degeneracy and that regions where
nonlinear tides produce a measurable effect are strongly disfavored.
