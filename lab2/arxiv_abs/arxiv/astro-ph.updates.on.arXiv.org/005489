The presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can strongly affect its host. Due to the copious
radiative power of the nucleus, the effects of radiative feedback can be detected over the entire
host galaxy and sometimes well into the intergalactic space. In this paper we model the observed
size-luminosity relationship of the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of AGN. We model the NLR as a collection
of clouds in pressure equilibrium with the ionizing radiation, with each cloud producing line emission
calculated by Cloudy. The sizes of the NLRs of powerful quasars are reproduced without any free parameters,
as long as they contain massive ($10^5 - 10^7 M_\odot$) ionization-bounded clouds. At lower AGN
luminosities the observed sizes are larger than the model sizes, likely due to additional unmodeled
sources of ionization (e.g., star formation). We find that the observed saturation of sizes at $\sim
10$ kpc which is observed at high AGN luminosities ($L_\text{ion} \simeq 10^{46}$ erg/s) is naturally
explained by optically thick clouds absorbing the ionizing radiation and preventing illumination
beyond a critical distance. Using our models in combination with observations of the [O III]/IR
ratio and the [O III] size -- IR luminosity relationship, we calculate the covering factor of the
obscuring torus (and therefore the type 2 fraction within the quasar population) to be $f=0.5$,
though this is likely an upper bound. Finally, because the gas behind the ionization front is invisible
in ionized gas transitions, emission-based NLR mass calculations underestimate the mass of the
NLR and therefore of the energetics of ionized-gas winds.
