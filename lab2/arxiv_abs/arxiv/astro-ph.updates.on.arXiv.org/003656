We present 108 full-sky gravitational lensing simulation datasets generated by performing multiple-lens
plane ray-tracing through high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations. The datasets
include full-sky convergence and shear maps from redshifts $z=0.05$ to $5.3$ at intervals of $150
\, h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ comoving radial distance (corresponding to a redshift interval of $\Delta
z \simeq 0.05$ at the nearby Universe), enabling the construction of a mock shear catalog for an arbitrary
source distribution up to $z=5.3$. The dark matter halos are identified from the same $N$-body simulations
with enough mass resolution to resolve the host halos of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) CMASS
and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). Angular positions and redshifts of the halos are provided by a
ray-tracing calculation, enabling the creation of a mock halo catalog to be used for galaxy-galaxy
and cluster-galaxy lensing. The simulation also yields maps of gravitational lensing deflections
for a source redshift at the last scattering surface, and we provide 108 realizations of lensed cosmic
microwave background (CMB) maps in which the post-Born corrections caused by multiple light scattering
are included. We present basic statistics of the simulation data, including the angular power spectra
of cosmic shear, CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, galaxy-galaxy lensing signals
for halos, and their covariances. The angular power spectra of the cosmic shear and CMB anisotropies
agree with theoretical predictions within $5\%$ up to $\ell = 3000$ (or at an angular scale $\theta
> 0.5$ arcsin). The simulation datasets are generated primarily for the ongoing Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
survey but are freely available for download at this http URL
