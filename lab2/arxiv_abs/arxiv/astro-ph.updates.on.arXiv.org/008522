We examine the possible dependence of the radial oxygen abundance distribution on non-axisymmetrical
structures (bar/spirals) and other macroscopic parameters such as the mass, the optical radius
R25, the color g-r, and the surface brightness of the galaxy. A sample of disk galaxies from the CALIFA
DR3 is considered. We adopted the Fourier amplitude A2 of the surface brightness as a quantitative
characteristic of the strength of non-axisymmetric structures in a galactic disk, in addition
to the commonly used morphologic division for A, AB, and B types based on the Hubble classification.
To distinguish changes in local oxygen abundance caused by the non-axisymmetrical structures,
the multiparametric mass--metallicity relation was constructed as a function of parameters such
as the bar/spiral pattern strength, the disk size, color index g-r in the SDSS bands, and central
surface brightness of the disk. The gas-phase oxygen abundance gradient is determined by using
the R calibration. We find that there is no significant impact of the non-axisymmetric structures
such as a bar and/or spiral patterns on the local oxygen abundance and radial oxygen abundance gradient
of disk galaxies. Galaxies with higher mass, however, exhibit flatter oxygen abundance gradients
in units of dex/kpc, but this effect is significantly less prominent for the oxygen abundance gradients
in units of dex/R25 and almost disappears when the inner parts are avoided. We show that the oxygen
abundance in the central part of the galaxy depends neither on the optical radius R25 nor on the color
g-r or the surface brightness of the galaxy. Instead, outside the central part of the galaxy, the
oxygen abundance increases with g-r value and central surface brightness of the disk.
