Context. Umbral flashes (UFs) are most common phenomenon of wave processes in sunspots. Studying
the relationship between wave time dynamics and UF origin requires further investigating their
fine spatial and height structure. Aims. We investigated the association between a short-time
increase in the variations of 3-minute EUV emission at footpoints of coronal magnetic loops and
the UF emergence in sunspot umbrae. Methods. We applied the Pixelized Wavelet Filtering (PWF) technique
to analyze a cube of the images obtained by SDO/AIA at 1600{\AA}, 304{\AA}, and 171{\AA} to study
the spatio-temporal dynamic of oscillations in individual magnetic loops. The time-distance
plots were used to obtain the wave front propagation velocity. We used the magnetic field extrapolation
for SDO/HMI magnetograms to obtain localization of the magnetic loop footpoins. Results. For the
first time, we obtained 2D images of fine wave processes in magnetic structures of different scales
related to umbral flashes. UFs sources were mainly localized at the magnetic loop footpoints anchored
in an umbra.We revealed two types UFs, point and extended. The first type is related to the footpoints
of open field lines, the second is associated with the closed. The time dynamics of UFs shows an increase
the oscillations before the peak value within one low-frequency wave train. It is shown that the
maxima of oscillation trains coincide with the peak intensity of umbral flashes. Conclusions.
The sunspot wave dynamics showed a relation between the localization of oscillations power peak
at the coronal magnetic loop footpoints and the UF origin. The spatial structure of the UF sources,
their power and lifetime are determined by the cut-off frequency of the waves for the detected waveguides.
We concluded that UFs are a process of short-time increase of the wave activity at the footpoints
of magnetic loops.
