We study the distribution of the Milky Way satellites stellar and dark matter debris. For the first
time we address the question of the tidal disruption of satellites in simulations by utilising simultaneously
a) a realistic set of orbits extracted from cosmological simulations, b) a three component host
galaxy with live halo, disc and bulge components, and c) satellites from hydrodynamical simulations.
We analyse the statistical properties of the satellite debris of all massive galaxies reaching
the inner Milky Way on a timescale of 2 Gyr. Up to 80$\%$ of the dark matter is stripped from the satellites,
while this happens for up to 30$\%$ of their stars. The stellar debris ends mostly in the inner Milky
Way halo, whereas the dark matter debris shows a flat mass distribution over the full main halo. The
dark matter debris follows a density profile with inner power law index $\alpha_{\rm DM}=-0.66$
and outer index $\beta_{\rm DM}=2.94$, while for stars $\alpha_{*}=-0.44$ and $\beta_{*}=6.17$.
In the inner 25 kpc, the distribution of the stellar debris is flatter than that of the dark matter
debris and the orientations of their short axes differ significantly. Changing the orientation
of the stellar disc by 90$^{\rm{o}}$ has only a minor impact on the distribution of the satellite
debris. Our results indicate that the dark matter is more easily stripped than stars from the Milky
Way satellites. The structure of the debris is dominated by the satellite orbital properties. The
radial profiles, the flattening and the orientation of the stellar and dark matter debris are significantly
different, which prevents the prediction of the dark matter distribution from the observed stellar
component.
