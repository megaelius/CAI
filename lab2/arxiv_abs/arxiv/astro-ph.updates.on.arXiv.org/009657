Kepler-9, discovered by Holman et al. 2010, was the first system with multiple confirmed transiting
planets and the first system to clearly show long-anticipated transit timing variations (TTVs).
We review the historical circumstances behind the discovery and characterization of these planets
and the publication of Holman et al. 2010. It was the first major novel exoplanet discovery of the
Kepler Space Telescope mission. The Kepler pipeline identified two Saturn-radius candidates
(called Kepler Objects of Interest or KOIs): KOI-377.01 with a 19-day period and KOI-377.02 with
a 39-day period. Even with only 9 transits for KOI-377.01 and 6 of KOI-377.02, the transit times were
completely inconsistent with a linear ephemeris and showed strongly anti-correlated variations
in transit times. Holman et al. 2010 were able to readily show that these objects were planetary mass,
confirming them as bona fide planets Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. As a multi-transiting system exhibiting
strong TTVs, the relative planetary properties (e.g., mass ratio, radius ratio) were strongly
constrained, opening a new chapter in comparative planetology. KOI-377.03, a small planet with
a 1.5-day period, was not initially discovered by the Kepler pipeline, but was identified during
the analysis of the other planets and was later confirmed as Kepler-9d through the BLENDER technique
by Torres et al. 2011. Holman et al. 2010 included significant dynamical analysis to characterize
Kepler-9's particular TTVs: planets near resonance show large amplitude anti-correlated TTVs
with a period corresponding to the rotation of the line of conjunctions and an additional "chopping"
signal due to the changing positions of the planets. We also review the updated properties of this
system and propose ideas for future investigations.
