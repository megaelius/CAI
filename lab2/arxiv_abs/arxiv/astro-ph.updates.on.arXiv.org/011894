Star-forming galaxies can in principle be transformed into passive systems by a multitude of processes
that quench star formation, such as the halting of gas accretion (starvation) or the rapid removal
of gas in AGN-driven outflows. However, it remains unclear which processes are the most significant,
primary drivers of the SF-passive bimodality. We address this key issue in galaxy evolution by studying
the chemical properties of 80,000 local galaxies in SDSS DR7. In order to distinguish between different
quenching mechanisms, we analyse the stellar metallicities of star-forming, green valley and
passive galaxies. We find that the significant difference in stellar metallicity between passive
galaxies and their star-forming progenitors implies that for galaxies at all masses, quenching
must have involved an extended phase of starvation. However, some form of gas ejection also has to
be introduced into our models to best match the observed properties of local passive galaxies, indicating
that, while starvation is likely to be the prerequisite for quenching, it is the combination of starvation
and outflows that is responsible for quenching the majority of galaxies. Closed-box models indicate
that the duration of the quenching phase is 2-3 Gyr, with an $e$-folding time of 2-4 Gyr, after which
further star formation is prevented by an ejective/heating mode. Alternatively, leaky-box models
find a longer duration for the quenching phase of 5-7 Gyr and an $e$-folding time of $\sim$1 Gyr, with
outflows becoming increasingly important with decreasing stellar mass. Finally, our analysis
of local green valley galaxies indicates that quenching is slower in the local Universe than at high-redshift.
