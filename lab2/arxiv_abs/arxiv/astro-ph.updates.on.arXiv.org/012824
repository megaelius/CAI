The polarity of the toroidal magnetic field in the solar convection zone periodically reverses
in the course of the 11/22-year solar cycle. Among the various processes that contribute to the removal
of `old-polarity' toroidal magnetic flux is the emergence of flux loops forming bipolar regions
at the solar surface. We quantify the loss of subsurface net toroidal flux by this process. To this
end, we determine the contribution of an individual emerging bipolar loop and show that it is unaffected
by surface flux transport after emergence. Together with the linearity of the diffusion process
this means that the total flux loss can be obtained by adding the contributions of all emerging bipolar
magnetic regions. The resulting total loss rate of net toroidal flux amounts to 1.3 X 10^{15} Mx/s
during activity maxima and 6.1 X 10^{14} Mx/s during activity minima, to which ephemeral regions
contribute about 90% and 97%, respectively. This rate is consistent with the observationally inferred
loss rate of toroidal flux into interplanetary space and corresponds to a decay time of the subsurface
toroidal flux of about 12 years, also consistent with a simple estimate based on turbulent diffusivity.
Consequently, toroidal flux loss by flux emergence is a relevant contribution to the budget of net
toroidal flux in the solar convection zone. That the toroidal flux loss rate due to flux emergence
is consistent with what is expected from turbulent diffusion, and that the corresponding decay
time is similar to the length of the solar cycle are important constraints for understanding the
solar cycle and the Sun's internal dynamics.
