Context: Using the recent observational data of R\"oser et al. we present $N$-body simulations
of the Hyades open cluster. Aims: We make an attempt to determine initial conditions of the Hyades
cluster at the time of its formation in order to reproduce the present-day cumulative mass profile,
stellar mass and luminosity function (LF). Methods: We performed direct $N$-body simulations
of the Hyades in an analytic Milky Way potential that account for stellar evolution and include primordial
binaries in a few models. Furthermore, we applied a Kroupa (2001) IMF and used extensive ensemble-averaging.
Results: We find that evolved single-star King initial models with King parameters $W_0 = 6-9$ and
initial particle numbers $N_0 = 3000$ provide good fits to the observational present-day cumulative
mass profile within the Jacobi radius. The best-fit King model has an initial mass of $1721\ M_\odot$
and an average mass loss rate of $-2.2 \ M_\odot/\mathrm{Myr}$. The K-band LFs of models and observations
show a reasonable agreement. Mass segregation is detected in both observations and models. If 33%
primordial binaries are included the initial particle number is reduced by 5% as compared to the
model without primordial binaries. Conclusions: The present-day properties of the Hyades can
be well reproduced by a standard King or Plummer initial model when choosing appropriate initial
conditions. The degeneracy of good-fitting models can be quite high due to the large dimension of
the parameter space. More simulations with different Roche-lobe filling factors and primordial
binary fractions are required to explore this degeneracy in more detail.
