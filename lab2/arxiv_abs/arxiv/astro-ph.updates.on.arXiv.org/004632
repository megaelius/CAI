On 2016 September 20, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph observed an active region during
its earliest emerging phase for almost 7 hours. The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory observed continuous emergence of small-scale magnetic bipoles with
a rate of $\sim$10$^{16}$ Mx~s$^{-1}$. The emergence of magnetic fluxes and interactions between
different polarities lead to frequent occurrence of ultraviolet (UV) bursts, which exhibit as
intense transient brightenings in the 1400 \AA{} images. In the meantime, discrete small patches
with the same magnetic polarity tend to move together and merge, leading to enhancement of the magnetic
fields and thus formation of pores (small sunspots) at some locations. The spectra of these UV bursts
are characterized by the superposition of several chromospheric absorption lines on the greatly
broadened profiles of some emission lines formed at typical transition region temperatures, suggesting
heating of the local materials to a few tens of thousands of kelvin in the lower atmosphere by magnetic
reconnection. Some bursts reveal blue and red shifts of $\sim$100~km~s$^{-1}$ at neighboring
pixels, indicating the spatially resolved bidirectional reconnection outflows. Many such bursts
appear to be associated with the cancellation of magnetic fluxes with a rate of the order of $\sim$10$^{15}$
Mx~s$^{-1}$. We also investigate the three-dimensional magnetic field topology through a magneto-hydrostatic
model and find that a small fraction of the bursts are associated with bald patches (magnetic dips).
Finally, we find that almost all bursts are located in regions of large squashing factor at the height
of $\sim$1 Mm, reinforcing our conclusion that these bursts are produced through reconnection
in the lower atmosphere.
