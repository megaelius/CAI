The chemical yields of supernovae and the metal enrichment of the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM)
are not well understood. This paper introduces the CHEmical Enrichment RGS Sample (CHEERS), which
is a sample of 44 bright local giant ellipticals, groups and clusters of galaxies observed with XMM-Newton.
This paper focuses on the abundance measurements of O and Fe using the reflection grating spectrometer
(RGS). The deep exposures and the size of the sample allow us to quantify the intrinsic scatter and
the systematic uncertainties in the abundances using spectral modeling techniques. We report
the oxygen and iron abundances as measured with RGS in the core regions of all objects in the sample.
We do not find a significant trend of O/Fe as a function of cluster temperature, but we do find an intrinsic
scatter in the O and Fe abundances from cluster to cluster. The level of systematic uncertainties
in the O/Fe ratio is estimated to be around 20-30%, while the systematic uncertainties in the absolute
O and Fe abundances can be as high as 50% in extreme cases. We were able to identify and correct a systematic
bias in the oxygen abundance determination, which was due to an inaccuracy in the spectral model.
The lack of dependence of O/Fe on temperature suggests that the enrichment of the ICM does not depend
on cluster mass and that most of the enrichment likely took place before the ICM was formed. We find
that the observed scatter in the O/Fe ratio is due to a combination of intrinsic scatter in the source
and systematic uncertainties in the spectral fitting, which we are unable to disentangle. The astrophysical
source of intrinsic scatter could be due to differences in AGN activity and ongoing star formation
in the BCG. The systematic scatter is due to uncertainties in the spatial line broadening, absorption
column, multi-temperature structure and the thermal plasma models. (Abbreviated).
