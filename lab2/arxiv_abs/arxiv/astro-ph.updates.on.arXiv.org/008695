We investigate the global seasonal variations of near-surface relative humidity and relevant
attributes, like temperature and water vapor volume mixing ratio on Mars using calculations from
modelled and measurement data. We focus on 2 am local time snapshots to eliminate daily effects related
to differences in insolation, and to be able to compare calculations based on modelling data from
the LMDZ GCM with the observations of MGS TES. We study the seasonal effects by examining four specific
dates in the Martian year, the northern spring equinox, summer solstice, autumn equinox and winter
solstice. We identify three specific zones, where the near-surface relative humidity levels are
systematically higher than in their vicinity regardless of season. We find that these areas coincide
with low thermal inertia features, which control surface temperatures on the planet, and are most
likely covered with unconsolidated fine dust with grain sizes less than $\sim$ 40$\mu$m. By comparing
the data of relative humidity, temperature and water vapor volume mixing ratio at two different
heights (near-surface, $\sim$ 23 m above the surface), we demonstrate that the thermal inertia
could play an important role in determining near-surface humidity levels. We also notice that during
the night the water vapor levels drop at $\sim$ 4 m above the surface. This, together with the temperature
and thermal inertia values, shows that water vapor likely condenses in the near-surface atmosphere
and on the ground during the night at the three aforementioned regions. This condensation may be
in the form of brines, wettening of the fine grains or deliquescence. This study specifies areas
of interest on the surface of present day Mars for the proposed condensation, which may be examined
by in-situ measurements in the future.
