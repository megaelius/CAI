Current observation techniques are able to probe the atmosphere of some giant exoplanets and get
some clues about their atmospheric composition. However, the chemical compositions derived from
observations are not fully understood, as for instance in the case of the CH4/CO abundance ratio,
which is often inferred different from what has been predicted by chemical models. Recently, the
warm Neptune GJ3470b has been discovered and because of its close distance from us and high transit
depth, it is a very promising candidate for follow up characterisation of its atmosphere. We study
the atmospheric composition of GJ3470b in order to compare with the current observations of this
planet, to prepare the future ones, but also as a typical case study to understand the chemical composition
of warm (sub-)Neptunes. The metallicity of such atmospheres is totally uncertain, and vary probably
to values up to 100x solar. We explore the space of unknown parameters to predict the range of possible
atmospheric compositions. Within the parameter space explored we find that in most cases methane
is the major carbon-bearing species. We however find that in some cases, typically for high metallicities
with a sufficiently high temperature the CH4/CO abundance ratio can become lower than unity, as
suggested by some multiwavelength photometric observations of other warm (sub-)Neptunes, such
as GJ1214b and GJ436b. As for the emission spectrum of GJ3470b, brightness temperatures at infrared
wavelengths may vary between 400 and 800K depending on the thermal profile and metallicity. Combined
with a hot temperature profile, a substantial enrichment in heavy elements by a factor of 100 with
respect to the solar composition can shift the carbon balance in favour of carbon monoxide at the
expense of CH4. Nevertheless, current observations of this planet do not allow yet to determine
which model is more accurate.
