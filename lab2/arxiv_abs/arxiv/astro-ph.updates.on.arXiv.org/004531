ASPIICS is a novel externally occulted coronagraph that will be launched onboard the PROBA-3 mission
of ESA. The external occulter (EO) will be placed on one satellite ~150 m ahead of the second satellite
with an optical instrument. During part of each orbit, the satellites will fly in a precise formation,
constituting a giant externally occulted coronagraph. Large distance between the EO and the primary
objective will allow observations of the white-light solar corona starting already from ~1.1RSun.
We analyze influence of shifts of the satellites and misalignments of optical elements on diffracted
light. Based on the quantitative influence of misalignments on diffracted light, we will provide
a "recipe" for choosing the size of the internal occulter (IO) to achieve a trade-off between the
minimal height of observations and sustainability to possible misalignments. We implement a numerical
model of the diffracted light and its propagation through the optical system, and compute intensities
of diffracted light throughout the instrument. Our numerical model extends axi-symmetrical model
of Rougeot et al. 2017 to non-symmetrical cases. The computations fully confirm main properties
of the diffracted light obtained from semi-analytical consideration. Results: relative influences
of various misalignments are significantly different. We show that: the IO with R=1.1RSun is large
enough to compensate possible misalignments in ASPIICS, apodizing the edge of the IO leads to additional
suppression of the diffracted light. Conclusions: the most important misalignment is the tilt
of the telescope WRT the line connecting the center of the EO and the entrance aperture. Special care
should be taken to co-align the EO and the coronagraph, i.e. co-aligning the diffraction fringe
from the EO and the IO. We suggest that the best orientation strategy is to point the coronagraph to
the center of the EO.
