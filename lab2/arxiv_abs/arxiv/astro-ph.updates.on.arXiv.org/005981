Techniques to classify galaxies and estimate their properties based on the photometric observations
solely will be necessary for future large cosmology missions, such as Euclid. However, the classification
accuracy is always lower in photometric surveys and can be systematically biased with respect to
classifications based upon spectroscopic data. Our aim is to test how precisely the detailed classification
scheme introduced by Siudek et al. accepted for galaxies at z~0.7 could be reproduced if only photometric
data were available. We applied the FEM unsupervised clustering algorithm to 54,293 VIPERS galaxies.
To construct the parameter space, we used reliable photometric redshifts and 12 rest frame magnitudes
obtained by the SED-fitting with the photo-z scatter~0.03, and the outlier rate~2%. Subsequently,
we compared the results to the analogous classification based on spectroscopic redshifts and corresponding
absolute magnitudes. The FEM algorithm divided the VIPERS data into four main groups: (1) red, (2)
green, (3) blue, and (4) outliers. Each group was further divided into 3, 3, 4, and 2 subclasses, respectively.
The accuracy of reproducing galaxy classes using spectroscopic data is high 92%, 84%, 96% for red,
green, and blue classes, respectively. Our method was able to efficiently separate outliers (stars
and broad-line AGNs), but failed to distinguish a class of star-forming galaxies with redder r-K
colours and higher SFR than remaining star-forming classes. The presented verification of the
photometric classification demonstrates that large photometric samples can be used to distinguish
different galaxy classes at z>0.5 with an accuracy provided so far only by spectroscopic data except
for particular galaxy classes. Confirming the synergy between classifications based on spectroscopic
and photometric data demonstrates the usefulness of our approach in future large surveys.
