[Abbreviated] We review the results of high dispersion spectroscopy of 17 circumnuclear starforming
regions (CNSFRs) in 3 nearby early spiral galaxies, NGC2903, NGC3310 and NGC3351. We find that single
Gaussian fitting to the H?beta and [OIII]5007A line profiles results in velocity dispersions around
32km/s and 52km/s, respectively, while the IR CaII triplet cross-correlation technique provides
stellar velocity dispersion values close to 50km/s. Even though multiple kinematical components
are present, the relation between gas velocity dispersion and Balmer emission line luminosity
(L-sigma relation) reproduces the correlation for disk giant HII regions albeit with a larger scatter.
The scatter in the L-sigma relation is considerably reduced when theoretical evolutionary corrections
are applied suggesting that an age range is present in the sample of CNSFRs. To analyse the observed
complex profiles, we performed multiple Gaussian component fits to the Hbeta and [OIII]?5007A
lines obtaining optimal fits with two Gaussians of different width. These best fits indicate that
the narrower component has average velocity dispersion close to 23km/s while the broader component
shows average values in the range 50-60km/s for both lines, close to the observed stellar velocity
dispersions. The fluxes of the broad and narrow Hbeta components are similar. This is not the case
for [OIII]5007A for which the broad components have higher fluxes than the narrow ones, thus producing
a clear segregation in their [OIII]/Hbeta ratios. We suggest a possible scenario for understanding
the behaviour of CNSFRs in the L-sigma and sigma_gas-sigma_star diagrams involving an inner gaseous
disk responsible for the narrow component of the emission lines.
