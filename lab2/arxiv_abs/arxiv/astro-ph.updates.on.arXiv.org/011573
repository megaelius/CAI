The rich information on (sub)millimeter dust continuum emission from distant galaxies in the public
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archive is contained in thousands of inhomogeneous
observations from individual PI-led programs. To increase the usability of these data for studies
deepening our understanding of galaxy evolution, we have developed automated mining pipelines
for the ALMA archive in the COSMOS field (A3COSMOS) that efficiently exploit the available information
for large numbers of galaxies across cosmic time and keep the data products in sync with the increasing
public ALMA archive: (a) a dedicated ALMA continuum imaging pipeline, (b) two complementary photometry
pipelines for both blind source extraction and prior source fitting, (c) a counterpart association
pipeline utilizing the multiwavelength data available (including quality assessment based on
machine-learning techniques), (d) an assessment of potential (sub)millimeter line contribution
to the measured ALMA continuum, and (e) extensive simulations to provide statistical corrections
to biases and uncertainties in the ALMA continuum measurements. Application of these tools yields
photometry catalogs with ~1000 (sub)millimeter detections (spurious fraction ~8%-12%) from
over 1500 individual ALMA continuum images. Combined with ancillary photometric and redshift
catalogs and the above quality assessments, we provide robust information on redshift, stellar
mass, and star formation rate for ~700 galaxies at redshifts 0.5-6 in the COSMOS field (with undetermined
selection function). The ALMA photometric measurements and galaxy properties are released publicly
within our blind extraction, prior fitting, and galaxy property catalogs, plus the images. These
products will be updated on a regular basis in the future.
