Globular clusters are source of gamma-ray radiation. At GeV energies, their emission is attributed
to magnetospheric activity of millisecond pulsars residing in the clusters. Inverse Compton scattering
of ambient photon fields on relativistic particles diffusing through cluster environment is thought
to be the source of GeV-TeV emission of globular clusters. Using pair starved polar cap model gamma-ray
emission from synthetic millisecond pulsar was modelled. In addition to pulsar emission characteristics,
the synthetic pulsar model yielded spectra of electrons escaping pulsar magnetosphere. To simulate
gamma-ray emission of globular cluster, both products of synthetic millisecond pulsar modelling
were used. Gamma-ray spectra of synthetic millisecond pulsars residing in the cluster were summed
to produce the magnetospheric component of cluster emission. Electrons ejected by these pulsars
were injected into synthetic globular cluster environment. Their diffusion and interaction,
both, with cluster magnetic field and ambient photon fields, were performed with Bednarek &
Sitarek (2007) model yielding ICS component of cluster emission. The sum of the magnetospheric
and ICS components gives the synthetic gamma-ray spectrum of globular cluster. The synthetic cluster
spectrum stretches from GeV to TeV energies. Detailed modelling was preformed for two globular
clusters: Ter 5 and 47 Tuc. Simulations are able to reproduce (within errors) the shape and the flux
level of the GeV part of the spectrum observed for both clusters with the Fermi/LAT instrument. The
synthetic flux level obtained in the TeV part of the clusters' spectrum is in agreement with a H.E.S.S.
upper limit determined for 47 Tuc, and with emission level recently detected for Ter 5 with H.E.S.S.
telescope. The synthetic globular cluster model, however, is not able to reproduce the exact shape
of the TeV spectrum observed for Ter 5.
