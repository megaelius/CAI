Structures of X-ray emitting magnetic polar regions on neutron stars in X-ray pulsars are studied
in a range of the accretion rate, 10$^{17}$ g s$^{-1} \sim 10^{18}$ g s$^{-1}$. It is shown that a thin
but tall, radiation energy dominated, X-ray emitting polar cone appears at each of the polar regions.
The height of the polar cone is several times as large as the neutron star radius. The energy gain due
to the gravity of the neutron star in the polar cone exceeds the energy loss due to photon diffusion
in the azimuthal direction of the cone, and a significant amount of energy is advected to the neutron
star surface. Then, the radiation energy carried with the flow should become so large for the radiation
pressure to overcome the magnetic pressure at the bottom of the cone. As a result, the matter should
expand in the tangential direction along the neutron star surface, dragging the magnetic lines
of force, and form a mound-like structure. The advected energy to the bottom of the cone should finally
be radiated away from the surface of the polar mound and the matter should be settled on the neutron
star surface there. From such configurations, we can expect an X-ray spectrum composed of a multi-color
blackbody spectrum from the polar cone region and a quasi-single blackbody spectrum from the polar
mound region. These spectral properties agree with observations. A combination of a fairly sharp
pencil beam and a broad fan beam is expected from the polar cone region, while a broad pencil beam is
expected from the polar mound region. With these X-ray beam properties, basic patterns of pulse
profiles of X-ray pulsars can be explained too.
