In previous papers it was shown that in a quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) metric, impulses of gamma
radiation can arise that have several properties in common with the observed gamma-ray bursts.
This happens when the bang-time function $t_B(r)$ has a gate-shaped hump around the origin of the
QSS region. The gamma rays arise along two preferred directions of the QSS geometry (coincident
with dipole extrema when axially symmetric, otherwise unrelated). In these directions, the rays
of the relic radiation are blueshifted rather than redshifted. The blueshift is generated in a thin
region between the Big Bang (BB) and the extremum-redshift hypersurface (ERH). But the Szekeres
models can describe the real Universe only forward in time from the last-scattering hypersurface
(LSH) because the matter in them has zero pressure. The ERH is tangent to the BB at the origin, so in
a neighbourhood thereof the ERH lies earlier than the LSH and no blueshift is generated in the physical
region. The question thus arose whether the BB and ERH can be ``unglued'' if the QSS region has no origin,
but the areal radius function $\Phi$ has a local maximum or minimum somewhere. In the present paper
it is demonstrated that this is indeed the case. If the hump in $t_B(r)$ is centered around the minimum
of $\Phi$, then the BB and ERH in general do not coincide there and a stronger blueshift is generated
on rays passing nearby. It follows that a lower and narrower hump on the BB set can generate sufficient
blueshift to move the initial frequencies of the relic radiation to the gamma range. These facts
are demonstrated by numerical calculations in an explicit example of a QSS region.
