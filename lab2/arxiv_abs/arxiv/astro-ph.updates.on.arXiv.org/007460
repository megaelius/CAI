Cold neutral gas is a key ingredient for growing the stellar and central black hole mass in galaxies
throughout cosmic history. We have used the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) to detect a rare
example of redshifted $^{12}$CO(2-1) absorption in PKS B1740-517, a young ($t \sim 1.6 \times 10^{3}$
yr) and luminous ($L_{\rm 5 GHz} \sim 6.6 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ) radio galaxy at $z = 0.44$
that is undergoing a tidal interaction with at least one lower-mass companion. The coincident HI
21-cm and molecular absorption have very similar line profiles and reveal a reservoir of cold gas
($M_{\rm gas} \sim 10^{7} - 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$), likely distributed in a disc or ring within a few
kiloparsecs of the nucleus. A separate HI component is kinematically distinct and has a very narrow
line width ($\Delta{v}_{\rm FWHM} \lesssim 5$ km s$^{-1}$), consistent with a single diffuse cloud
of cold ($T_{\rm k} \sim 100$ K) atomic gas. The $^{12}$CO(2-1) absorption is not associated with
this component, which suggests that the cloud is either much smaller than 100 pc along our sight-line
and/or located in low-metallicity gas that was possibly tidally stripped from the companion. We
argue that the gas reservoir in PKS B1740-517 may have accreted onto the host galaxy $\sim$50 Myr
before the young radio AGN was triggered, but has only recently reached the nucleus. This is consistent
with the paradigm that powerful luminous radio galaxies are triggered by minor mergers and interactions
with low-mass satellites and represent a brief, possibly recurrent, active phase in the life cycle
of massive early type galaxies.
