We apply gravity-based and density-based methods to identify clouds in numerical simulations
of the star-forming, three-phase interstellar medium (ISM), and compare their properties and
their global correlation with the star formation rate over time. The gravity-based method identifies
bound objects, which have masses M ~ 10^3 - 10^4 M_solar at densities n_H ~ 100 cm^-3, and traditional
virial parameters alpha_v ~ 0.5 - 5. For clouds defined by a density threshold n_H,min , the average
virial parameter decreases, and the fraction of material that is genuinely bound increases, at
higher n_H,min. Surprisingly, these clouds can be unbound even when alpha_v < 2, and high mass clouds
(10^4 - 10^6 M_solar) are generally unbound. This suggests that the traditional alpha_v is at best
an approximate measure of boundedness in the ISM. All clouds have internal turbulent motions increasing
with size as sigma ~ 1 km/s(R/ pc)^1/2, similar to observed relations. Bound structures comprise
a small fraction of the total simulation mass, with star formation efficiency per free-fall time
epsilon_ff ~ 0.4. For n_H,min = 10 - 100 cm^-3, epsilon_ff ~ 0.03 - 0.3, increasing with density. Temporal
correlation analysis between SFR(t) and aggregate mass M(n_H,min;t) at varying n_H,min shows
that time delays to star formation are t_delay ~ t_ff(n_H,min). Correlation between SFR(t) and
M(nH,min;t) systematically tightens at higher n_H,min. Considering moderate-density gas, selecting
against high virial parameter clouds improves correlation with SFR, consistent with previous
work. Even at high n_H,min, the temporal dispersion in (SFR-epsilon_ff M/t_ff )/<SFR> is ~ 50%,
due to the large-amplitude variations and inherent stochasticity of the system.
