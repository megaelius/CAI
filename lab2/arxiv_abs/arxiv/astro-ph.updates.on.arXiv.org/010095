We present Searches After Gravitational-waves Using ARizona Observatories (SAGUARO), a comprehensive
effort dedicated to the discovery and characterization of optical counterparts to gravitational
wave (GW) events. SAGUARO utilizes ground-based facilities ranging from 1.5m to 10m in diameter,
located primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. We provide an overview of SAGUARO's telescopic resources,
pipeline for transient detection, and database for candidate visualization. We describe SAGUARO's
discovery component, which utilizes the $5$~deg$^2$ field-of-view optical imager on the Mt. Lemmon
1.5m telescope, reaching limits of $\approx 21.3$~AB mag while rapidly tiling large areas. We also
describe the follow-up component of SAGUARO, used for rapid vetting and monitoring of optical candidates.
With the onset of Advanced LIGO/Virgo's third observing run, we present results from the first three
SAGUARO searches following the GW events S190408an, S190425z and S190426c, which serve as a valuable
proof-of-concept of SAGUARO. We triggered and searched 15, 60 and 60 deg$^{2}$ respectively, 17.6,
1.4 and 41.8 hrs after the initial GW alerts. We covered 7.8, 3.0 and 5.1\% of the total probability
within the GW event localizations, reaching 3$\sigma$ limits of 19.8, 21.3 and 20.8 AB mag, respectively.
Although no viable counterparts associated with these events were found, we recovered 6 known transients
and ruled out 5 potential candidates. We also present Large Binocular Telescope spectroscopy of
PS19eq/SN2019ebq, a promising kilonova candidate that was later determined to be a supernova.
With the ability to tile large areas and conduct detailed follow-up, SAGUARO represents a significant
addition to GW counterpart searches.
