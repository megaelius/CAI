We present Herschel and XMM-Newton observations of ULASJ1234+0907 ($z=2.503$), the reddest broad-line
Type 1 quasar currently known with (i-K)>7.1. Herschel observations indicate that the quasar
host is a hyperluminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) with a total infrared luminosity of log10(LIR/L0)=13.90+/-0.02.
A greybody fit gives a dust temperature of Td=60+/-3K assuming an emissivity index of beta=1.5,
considerably higher than in submillimeter bright galaxies observed at similar redshifts. The
star formation rate is estimated to be >2000M0/yr even accounting for a significant contribution
from an AGN component to the total infrared luminosity or requiring that only the far infra-red luminosity
is powered by a starburst. XMM-Newton observations constrain the hard X-ray luminosity to be L(2-10keV)=1.3e45
erg/s putting ULASJ1234+0907 among the brightest X-ray quasars known. Through very deep optical
and near infra-red imaging of the field at sub-arcsecond seeing, we demonstrate that despite its
extreme luminosity, it is highly unlikely that ULASJ1234+0907 is being lensed. We measure a neutral
hydrogen column density of NH=9e21/cm^2 corresponding to AV~6 mags. The observed properties of
ULASJ1234+0907 - high luminosity and Eddington ratio, broad lines, moderate column densities
and significant infra-red emission from re-processed dust - are similar to those predicted by galaxy
formation simulations for the AGN blowout phase. The high Eddington ratio combined with the presence
of significant amounts of dust in this quasar, is expected to drive strong outflows due to the effects
of radiation pressure on dust. We conclude that ULASJ1234+0907 is a prototype galaxy caught at the
peak epoch of galaxy formation, which is transitioning from a starburst to optical quasar via a dusty
quasar phase.
