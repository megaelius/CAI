We constrain the spectral index of polarized synchrotron emission, $\beta_s$, by correlating
the recently released 2.3 GHz S-Band Polarization All Sky Survey (S-PASS) data with the 23 GHz 9-year
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sky maps. We sub-divide the S-PASS field, which covers
the Southern Ecliptic hemisphere, into $15^{\circ}\times 15^{\circ}$ regions, and estimate
the spectral index of polarized synchrotron emission within each region using a simple but robust
T-T plot technique. Three different versions of the S-PASS data are considered, corresponding
to either no correction for Faraday rotation; Faraday correction based on the rotation measure
model presented by the S-PASS team; or Faraday correction based on a rotation measure model presented
by Hutschenreuter and En{\ss}lin. We find that the correlation between S-PASS and WMAP is strongest
when applying the S-PASS model. Adopting this correction model, we find that the mean spectral index
of polarized synchrotron emission gradually steepens from $\beta_s\approx-2.8$ at low Galactic
latitudes to $\beta_s\approx-3.2$ at high Galactic latitudes, in good agreement with previously
published results. Finally, we consider two special cases defined by the BICEP2 and SPIDER fields,
and obtain mean estimates of $\beta_{BICEP2}=-3.22\pm0.06$ and $\beta_{SPIDER}=-3.21\pm0.03$,
respectively. Adopting the WMAP 23 GHz sky map bandpass filtered to including angular scales only
between $2^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ}$ as a spatial template, we constrain the root-mean-square
synchrotron polarization amplitude to be less than $0.03\mu K$ ($0.009\mu K$) at 90 GHz (150 GHz)
for the BICEP2 field, corresponding roughly to a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r\lesssim0.02$ ($r\lesssim0.005$),
respectively. Very similar constraints are obtained for the SPIDER field.
