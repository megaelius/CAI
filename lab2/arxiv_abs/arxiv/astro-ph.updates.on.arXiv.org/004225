Recent observational results from integral field spectroscopic (IFS) surveys indicate that the
fraction of galaxies that are slow rotators, $F_{\rm SR}$, depends primarily on stellar mass, with
no significant dependence on environment. We investigate these trends and the formation paths
of slow rotators using the EAGLE and Hydrangea hydro-dynamical simulation suites. EAGLE consists
of several cosmological boxes of volumes up to $(100\,\rm Mpc)^3$, while Hydrangea consists of
$24$ cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters and their large scale environment. Together
they provide a statistically significant sample in the stellar mass range of interest, $10^{9.5}\,\rm
M_{\odot}-10^{12}\,\rm M_{\odot}$, of $16,431$ galaxies. We construct IFS-like cubes and measure
stellar spin parameters, $\lambda_{\rm R}$, and ellipticities, allowing us to classify galaxies
into slow and fast rotators as in observations. The simulated galaxies display a primary dependence
of $F_{\rm SR}$ on stellar mass, with a weak dependence on environment. At fixed stellar mass, satellite
galaxies are more likely to be slow rotators than centrals. In addition, $F_{\rm SR}$ shows a dependence
on halo mass at fixed stellar mass for central galaxies, while no such trend is seen for satellites.
We find that $\approx 70$% of slow rotators at $z=0$ have experienced at least one merger with mass
ratio $\ge 0.1$, with dry major mergers being at least twice more common than minor and wet major mergers
in this population. Individual dry mergers tend to decrease $\lambda_{\rm R}$, while wet mergers
mostly increase it. However, $30$% of slow rotators at $z=0$ have not experienced mergers, and those
inhabit halos with median spins twice smaller than the halos hosting the rest of the slow rotators.
Thus, although the formation paths of slow rotators can be varied, dry major mergers and/or halos
with small spins dominate.
