The Gaia mission has provided the largest ever astrometric chart of the Milky Way. Using it to map
the Galactic halo is helpful for disentangling its merger history. The identification of halo stars
in Gaia DR2 with reliable distance estimates requires special methods because such stars are typically
farther away and scarce. We apply the reduced proper motion (RPM) method to identify halo main sequence
stars on the basis of Gaia photometry and proper motions. Using the colour-absolute-magnitude
relation for this type of stars, we calculate photometric distances. Our selection results in a
set of $\sim10^7$ tentative main sequence halo stars with typical distance uncertainties of $7\%$
and with median velocity errors of 20 km/s. The median distance of our sample is $\sim 4.4$ kpc, with
the faintest stars located at $\sim 16$ kpc. The spatial distribution of the stars in our sample is
centrally concentrated. Visual inspection of the mean velocities of stars on the sky reveals large-scale
patterns as well as clear imprints of the GD-1 stream and tentative hints of the Jhelum and Leiptr
streams. Incompleteness and selection effects limit our ability to interpret the patterns reliably
as well as to identify new substructures. We define a pseudo-velocity space by setting to zero the
line-of-sight velocities of our sample stars. In this space, we recover several known structures
such as the footprint of Gaia-Enceladus (i.e. the Gaia-Sausage) as well as the Helmi streams and
some other retrograde substructures (Sequoia, Thamnos). We show that the two-point velocity correlation
function reveals significant clustering on scales smaller than 100 km/s, of similar amplitude
as found for the 6D Gaia halo sample. This clustering indicates the presence of nearby streams that
are predominantly phase-mixed.
