Massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars dominate the radiative and mechanical energy budget of galaxies
and probe a critical phase in the evolution of massive stars prior to core-collapse. It is not known
whether core He-burning WR stars (classical WR, cWR) form predominantly through wind-stripping
(w-WR) or binary stripping (b-WR). With spectroscopy of WR binaries so-far largely avoided due
to its complexity, our study focuses on the 44 WR binaries / binary candidates of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC, metallicity Z~0.5 Zsun), identified on the basis of radial velocity variations, composite
spectra, or high X-ray luminosities. Relying on a diverse spectroscopic database, we aim to derive
the physical and orbital parameters of our targets, confronting evolution models of evolved massive
stars at sub-solar metallicity, and constraining the impact of binary interaction in forming them.
Spectroscopy is performed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques.
Disentanglement is performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary
status is interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring
binary interaction and chemically-homogeneous evolution. No obvious dichotomy in the locations
of apparently-single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According
to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently-single WN stars could
not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise,
it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly
underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.
