Atmospheric dust plays an important role on the terrestrial climate, regulating the amount of solar
radiation coming to the surface, affecting the development and the life time of the clouds and providing
fundamental nutrients to the growth of the terrestrial and oceanic biomes. On Mars, the global effect
of dust is even stronger due to the widespread presence of sources and the lack of vegetation and oceans
able to mitigate its contribution. The DREAMS station and the Dust Complex, on board of the ExoMars
2016 and 2020 mission respectively, have been specifically developed for the study of the Martian
airborne dust. During my Phd I joined the team that lead the DREAMS experiment and the MicroMed sensor
of the Dust Complex. As a part of the instruments developing and the acquisition of martian analogous
data, our team has carried out various campaigns in the Sahara desert, to study the environment and
the lifting phenomena that are expected on Mars. We monitored the dust lifting events by acquiring,
for the first time in literature, synchronous measurement of meteorological data, atmospheric
electric field, saltation activity and suspended dust concentration. Currently, this is the most
complete data set available for the study of the dust lifting processes. We worked on the development
of proper detection algorithms to individuate the dust events acquired in the surveys, applicable
also to the future martian missions. We studied the characteristic of the observed dust storm and
dust devils activity, focusing on their electric proprieties. In particular, we obtained the first
experimental indications of how the induced electric field is related to the amount of suspended
grains and meteorological characteristics of the events. We compared the terrestrial results
with the currently available martian data, in order to prepare the analysis of the next ExoMars measurements.
