Robust evidence of an ice giant planet shedding its atmosphere around the white dwarf WD J0914+1914
represents a milestone in exoplanetary science, allowing us to finally supplement our knowledge
of white dwarf metal pollution, debris discs and minor planets with the presence of a major planet.
Here, we discuss the possible dynamical origins of this planet, WD J0914+1914 b. The very young cooling
age of the host white dwarf (13 Myr) combined with the currently estimated planet-star separation
of about 0.07 au imposes particularly intriguing and restrictive coupled constraints on its current
orbit and its tidal dissipation characteristics. The planet must have been scattered from a distance
of at least a few au to its current location, requiring the current or former presence of at least one
more major planet in the system in the absence of a hidden binary companion. We show that WD J0914+1914
b could not have subsequently shrunk its orbit through chaotic f-mode tidal excitation (characteristic
of such highly eccentric orbits) unless the planet was or is highly inflated and possibly had partially
thermally self-disrupted from mode-based energy release. We also demonstrate that if the planet
is currently assumed to reside on a near-circular orbit at 0.07 au, then non-chaotic equilibrium
tides impose unrealistic values for the planet's tidal quality factor. We conclude that WD~J0914+1914~b
either (i) actually resides interior to 0.07 au, (ii) resembles a disrupted "Super-Puff" whose
remains reside on a circular orbit, or (iii) resembles a larger or denser ice giant on a currently
eccentric orbit. Distinguishing these three possibilities strongly motivates follow-up observations.
