We calculate the hydrogen and helium-ionizing radiation escaping star-forming molecular clouds,
as a function of the star cluster mass and compactness, using a set of high-resolution radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations of star formation in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds. In these simulations,
presented in He, Ricotti and Geen (2019), the formation of individual massive stars are well resolved,
and their UV radiation feedback and lifetime on the main sequence are modeled self-consistently.
We find that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from molecular clouds, $\langle f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle
\rm MC}\rangle$, decreases with increasing mass of the star cluster and with decreasing compactness.
Molecular clouds with densities typically found in the local Universe have negligible $\langle
f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle \rm MC}\rangle$, ranging between $0.5\%$ to $5\%$. Ten times
denser molecular clouds have $\langle f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle \rm MC}\rangle \approx
10\%-20\%$, while $100\times$ denser clouds, which produce globular cluster progenitors, have
$\langle f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle \rm MC}\rangle \approx 20\%-60\%$. We find that $\langle
f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle \rm MC}\rangle$ increases with decreasing gas metallicity,
even when ignoring dust extinction, due to stronger radiation feedback. However, the total number
of escaping ionizing photons decreases with decreasing metallicity because the star formation
efficiency is reduced. We conclude that the sources of reionization at $z>6$ must have been very
compact star clusters forming in molecular clouds about $100\times$ denser than in today's Universe,
which leads to a significant production of old globular clusters progenitors.
