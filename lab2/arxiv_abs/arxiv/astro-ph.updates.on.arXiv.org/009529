We present the results of extensive modeling of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the
closest blazar (z=0.031) Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) during a giant outburst in February 2010. The source
underwent rapid flux variations in both X-rays and very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays as it evolved
from a low-flux state on 2010 February 13-15 to a high-flux state on 2010 February 17. During this
period, the source exhibited significant spectral hardening from X-rays to VHE gamma-rays while
exhibiting a "harder when brighter" behavior in these energy bands. We reproduce the broadband
SED using a time-dependent multi-zone leptonic jet model with radiation feedback. We find that
an injection of the leptonic particle population with a single power-law energy distribution at
shock fronts followed by energy losses in an inhomogeneous emission region is suitable for explaining
the evolution of Mrk 421 from low- to high-flux state in February 2010. The spectral states are successfully
reproduced by a combination of a few key physical parameters, such as the maximum $\&$ minimum cutoffs
and power-law slope of the electron injection energies, magnetic field strength, and bulk Lorentz
factor of the emission region. The simulated light curves and spectral evolution of Mrk 421 during
this period imply an almost linear correlation between X-ray flux at 1-10 keV energies and VHE gamma-ray
flux above 200 GeV, as has been previously exhibited by this source. Through this study, a general
trend that has emerged for the role of physical parameters is that, as the flare evolves from a low-
to a high-flux state, higher bulk kinetic energy is injected into the system with a harder particle
population and a lower magnetic field strength.
