We observed a C-class flare at the outer boundary of the super-penumbra of a sunspot. The flare was
triggered by an emerging magnetic bipolar region that was obliquely oriented with respect to the
super-penumbral fibrils. The flare started due to the low height magnetic reconnection of emerging
magnetic flux with super-penumbral field resulting hot multi-temperature plasma flows in the
inverse Evershed flow channel and its overlying atmosphere. The inverse Evershed flows in the chromosphere
start from super penumbra towards sunspot that end at the outer boundary of the penumbra. The hot
plasma flow towards the sunspot in the inverse Evershed channels show about 10 km s$^{-1}$ higher
velocity in H$\alpha$ wavelengths compared to the plasma emissions at various temperatures as
seen in different AIA filters. Even though these velocities are about seven times higher than the
typical inverse-Evershed flow speeds, the flow is diminished at the outer boundary of the sunspot's
penumbra. This suggests that the super-penumbral field lines that carry the inverse Evershed flows,
are discontinued at the boundary where the penumbral field lines dive into the sun and these two sets
of field lines are completely distinct. The discontinuity in the typical magnetic field and plasma
properties at the adjoining of these two sets of field lines further leads the discontinuity in the
characteristic magnetoacoustic and Alfv\'en speeds, therefore, stopping the plasma flows further
on. The multi-temperature plasma in the inverse Evershed channels exhibits \textbf{possible}
longitudinal oscillations initially during the onset of the flare, and later flows towards the
sunspot. In the multi-temperature view, the different layers above the flare region have the mixture
of supersonic as well as subsonic flows.
