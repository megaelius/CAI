The new data delivered by NASA's Juno spacecraft significantly increase our understanding of Jupiter's
internal dynamics. The gravity data constrain the depth of the zonal flows observed at cloud level
and suggest that they slow down considerably at a depth of about $0.96\,r_J$, where $r_J$ is the mean
radius at the one bar level. Juno's magnetometer reveals the planet's internal magnetic field.
We combine the new zonal flow and magnetic field models with an updated electrical conductivity
profile to assess the zonal wind induced dynamo action, concentrating on the outer part of Jupiter's
molecular hydrogen region where the conductivity increases very rapidly with depth. Dynamo action
remains quasi-stationary and can thus reasonably be estimated where the magnetic Reynolds number
remains smaller than one, which is roughly the region above $0.96\,r_J$. We calculate that the locally
induced radial magnetic field reaches rms values of about $10^{-6}\,$T in this region and may just
be detectable by the Juno mission. Very localized dynamo action and a distinct pattern that reflects
the zonal wind system increases the chance to disentangle this locally induced field from the background
field. The estimates of the locally induced currents also allow calculating the zonal flow related
Ohmic heating and associated entropy production. The respective quantities remain below new revised
predictions for the total dissipative heating and total entropy production in Jupiter for any of
the explored model combinations. Thus neither Ohmic heating nor entropy production offer additional
constraints on the depth of the zonal winds.
