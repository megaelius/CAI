Understanding the complex dynamics and structure of the upper solar atmosphere benefits strongly
from the use of a combination of several diagnostics. Frequently, such diverse diagnostics can
only be obtained from telescopes and/or instrumentation operating at widely different spatial
resolution. To optimize the utilization of such data, we propose a new method for the global inversion
of data acquired at different spatial resolution. The method has its roots in the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm but involves the use of linear operators to transform and degrade the synthetic spectra
of a highly resolved guess model to account for the the effects of spatial resolution, data sampling,
alignment and image rotation of each of the data sets. We have carried out a list of numerical experiments
to show that our method allows extracting spatial information from two simulated datasets that
have gone through two different telescope apertures and that are sampled in different spatial grids.
Our results show that each dataset contributes in the inversion by constraining information at
the spatial scales that are present in each of the datasets, without any negative effects derived
from the combination of multiple resolution data. This method is especially relevant for chromospheric
studies that attempt at combining datasets acquired with different telescopes and/or datasets
acquired at different wavelengths, both limiting factors in the resolution of solar instrumentation.
The techniques described in the present study will also help addressing the ever increasing resolution
gap between space-borne missions and forthcoming ground-based facilities.
