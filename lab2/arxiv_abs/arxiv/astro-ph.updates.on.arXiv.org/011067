We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic
star-formation rate between $z\sim 2$ and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation
is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations
due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in
the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density
of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing
the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic
absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, thanks to
the large redshift path surveyed ($\Delta z=182$), we provide constraints on the molecular column
density distribution function beyond $z\sim 0$. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H$_2$)
> 10$^{16}$ atoms~cm$^{-2}$, five orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of $\rho ({\rm
H}_2)\lesssim 10^{8.3} \text{M}_{\odot} \text{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $0 < z \leq 1.7$ already provide
new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These
results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies.
The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star-formation rate
history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to $z\sim
2$.
