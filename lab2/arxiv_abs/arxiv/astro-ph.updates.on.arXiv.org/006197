The low surface brightness Universe holds clues to the first formation of galaxies. Specifically,
the shape and morphology of local stellar haloes have encoded in them the early formation history
of their parent galaxies. Early progenitor galaxies were absorbed by the dark halo and scattered
their stars in a diffuse halo around the main galaxy. If the accretion event was relatively recent,
it may show as a coherent stream of stars within the halo. in addition, the low-mass, low-surface
brightness satellite galaxies, perhaps the ultradiffuse galaxies recently reported would help
solve the "Missing Dwarf Problem", the apparent over-prediction of $\Lambda$CDM models of the
number of satellite galaxies around a Milky Way Halo. However low surface brightness is not what
most telescopes are optimized for, most are best for resolving point sources and not sensitivity
for large-scale low-light. To be sensitive to the low surface brightness Universe, a telescope
needs a simple, unobstructed light path (disfavoring mirrors), fast optics (low f/D), and relatively
coarse sampling (big pixels). Exceptions are the superb Dragonfly and Huntsman telescopes which
are purposely designed to be sensitive to low surface brighnesses. Similarly designed, if not with
low surface brightness in mind is the successfully launched TESS satellite. We show in this Research
Note that the envisaged total exposure times and optical setup are near-ideal for low surface brightness
work in the local Universe. With combined TESS imaging, one can model the stellar halo surrounding
a galaxy. Technical challenges include the image quality, zodiacal and Galactic cirrus background
light, PSF characterization and subtraction. Once accounted for with a processing pipeline, one
can model the stellar halo for all nearby galaxies and to search for substructure in these haloes.
