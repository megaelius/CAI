One-opposition near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are growing in number, and they must be recovered to
prevent loss and mismatch risk, and to improve their orbits, as they are likely to be too faint for
detection in shallow surveys at future apparitions. We aimed to recover more than half of the one-opposition
NEAs recommended for observations by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) using the Isaac Newton Telescope
(INT) in soft-override mode and some fractions of available D-nights. During about 130 hours in
total between 2013 and 2016, we targeted 368 NEAs, among which 56 potentially hazardous asteroids
(PHAs), observing 437 INT Wide Field Camera (WFC) fields and recovering 280 NEAs (76% of all targets).
Engaging a core team of about ten students and amateurs, we used the THELI, Astrometrica, and the
Find_Orb software to identify all moving objects using the blink and track-and-stack method for
the faintest targets and plotting the positional uncertainty ellipse from NEODyS. Most targets
and recovered objects had apparent magnitudes centered around V~22.8 mag, with some becoming as
faint as V~24 mag. One hundred and three objects (representing 28% of all targets) were recovered
by EURONEAR alone by Aug 2017. Orbital arcs were prolonged typically from a few weeks to a few years;
our oldest recoveries reach 16 years. The O-C residuals for our 1,854 NEA astrometric positions
show that most measurements cluster closely around the origin. In addition to the recovered NEAs,
22,000 positions of about 3,500 known minor planets and another 10,000 observations of about 1,500
unknown objects (mostly main-belt objects) were promptly reported to the MPC by our team. Four new
NEAs were discovered serendipitously in the analyzed fields, increasing the counting to nine NEAs
discovered by the EURONEAR in 2014 and 2015.
