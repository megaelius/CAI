We describe an algorithm for identifying ellipsoidal haloes in numerical simulations, and quantify
how the resulting estimates of halo mass and shape differ with respect to spherical halo finders.
Haloes become more prolate when fit with ellipsoids, the difference being most pronounced for the
more aspherical objects. Although the ellipsoidal mass is systematically larger, this is less
than 10% for most of the haloes. However, even this small difference in mass corresponds to a significant
difference in shape. We quantify these effects also on the initial mass and deformation tensors,
on which most models of triaxial collapse are based. By studying the properties of protohaloes in
the initial conditions, we find that models in which protohaloes are identified in Lagrangian space
by three positive eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are tenable only at the masses well-above
$M_*$. The overdensity $\delta$ within almost any protohalo is larger than the critical value associated
with spherical collapse (increasing as mass decreases); this is in good qualitative agreement
with models which identify haloes requiring that collapse have occured along all three principal
axes, each axis having turned around from the universal expansion at a different time. The distributions
of initial values are in agreement with the simplest predictions associated with ellipsoidal collapse,
assuming initially spherical protohaloes, collapsed around random positions which were sufficiently
overdense. However, most protohaloes are not spherical and departures from sphericity increase
as protohalo mass decreases. [Abridged]
