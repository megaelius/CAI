The relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen is a potent tracer of planet formation and evolution.
Jupiter and Saturn have protosolar atmospheric D/H ratios, a relic of substantial gas accretion
from the nebula, while the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus are enhanced in D by accretion of ices
into their envelopes. For terrestrial planets, D/H ratios are used to determine the mechanisms
of volatile delivery and subsequent atmosphere loss over the lifetime of the planet. Planets and
brown dwarfs more massive than 13 M_J quickly fuse their initial D reservoir. Here, we simulate spectra
for giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs (2 M_Neptune to ~10 M_Jupiter) from Teff=200--1800 K including
both CH3D and HDO to determine the observability of these dominant deuterium isotopologues in mid-infrared
thermal emission spectra. Colder objects have stronger molecular features in their spectra, due
to the temperature-dependence of molecular cross sections. CH3D is easier to observe than HDO at
all temperatures considered, due to the strength of its absorption bands and locations of features
at wavelengths with few other strong absorption features. We predict that for nearby cool brown
dwarfs, the CH3D abundance can be measured at high signal-to-noise with the James Webb Space Telescope;
for objects from 200--800 K closer than 10 pc, a protosolar D/H ratio would be readily observable
in 2.5 hours. Moderately young Jupiter-mass planets (100--300 Myr) and young Neptunes (10 Myr)
may be discovered with JWST and provide the best targets for detecting deuterium on an exoplanet
in the coming decade. Future telescope designs should consider the importance of isotopes for understanding
the formation and evolution of planetary atmospheres.
