A sample of isolated Earth-impacting ICMEs that occurred in the period January 2008 to August 2014
is analysed in order to study in detail the ICME in situ signatures with respect to the type of filament
eruption related to the corresponding CME. For Earth-directed CMEs, a kinematical study was performed
using the STEREO-A, B COR1 and COR2 coronagraphs and the Heliospheric Imagers HI1. Based on the extrapolated
CME kinematics, we identified interacting CMEs, which were excluded from further analysis. Applying
this approach, a set of 31 isolated Earth-impacting CMEs was unambiguously identified and related
to the in situ measurements recorded by the Wind spacecraft. We classified the events into subsets
with respect to the CME source location as well as with respect to the type of the associated filament
eruption. Hence, the events are divided into three subsamples: active region (AR) CMEs, disappearing
filament (DSF) CMEs, and stealthy CMEs. The related three groups of ICMEs were further divided into
two subsets: magnetic obstacle (MO) events (out of which four were stealthy), covering ICMEs that
at least partly expose characteristics of flux ropes, and ejecta (EJ) events, not showing such characteristics.
In the next step, MO-events were analysed in more detail, considering the magnetic field strengths
and the plasma characteristics in three different segments of the ICMEs, defined as the turbulent
sheath (TS), the frontal region (FR), and the MO itself. The analysis revealed various well-defined
correlations for AR, DSF, and stealthy ICMEs, which we interpreted considering basic physical
concepts. Our results support the hypothesis that ICMEs show different signatures depending on
the in situ spacecraft trajectory, in terms of apex versus flank hits.
