The amount of cold, molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies is typically inferred from proxies
of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$), such as carbon monoxide (CO) or neutral atomic carbon ([CI]) and
molecular gas mass conversion factors. The use of these proxies, however, relies on modeling and
observations that have not been directly measured outside the local universe. Here, we use recent
samples of high-redshift gamma-ray burst (GRB) and quasar molecular gas absorbers to determine
this conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ from the column density of H$_2$, which gives us the
mass per unit column, and the [CI]($J=1$) column density, which provides the luminosity per unit
column. This technique allows us to make direct measurements of the relative abundances in high-redshift
absorption-selected galaxies. Our sample spans redshifts of z=1.9-3.4 and covers two orders of
magnitude in gas-phase metallicity. We find that $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ scales linearly with the
metallicity: $\log \alpha_{\rm [CI]} = -1.13\times \log(Z/Z_{\odot}) + 1.33$, with a scatter
of $\sigma_{\alpha_{\rm [CI]}} = 0.2$ dex. Using a sample of emission-selected galaxies at z~0-5,
with both [CI] and CO line detections, we apply the $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ conversion to derive independent
estimates of the molecular gas mass and $\alpha_{\rm CO}$. We find a remarkable agreement between
the molecular gas masses inferred from the absorption-derived $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ compared to
typical $\alpha_{\rm CO}$-based estimates, and an inferred metallicity evolution of $\alpha_{\rm
CO}$ that is consistent with $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ and previous estimates from the literature. These
results thus support the use of the absorption-derived $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ conversion factor
for emission-selected star-forming galaxies and demonstrate that both methods probe the same
universal properties of molecular gas in the local and high-redshift universe.
