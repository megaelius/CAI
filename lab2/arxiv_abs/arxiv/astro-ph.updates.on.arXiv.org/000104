We present the survey design, data reduction, and spectral fitting pipeline for the VIRUS-P Exploration
of Nearby Galaxies (VENGA). VENGA is an integral field spectroscopic survey, which maps the disks
of 30 nearby spiral galaxies. Targets span a wide range in Hubble type, star formation activity,
morphology, and inclination. The VENGA data-cubes have 5.6'' FWHM spatial resolution, ~5A FWHM
spectral resolution, sample the 3600A-6800A range, and cover large areas typically sampling galaxies
out to ~0.7 R_25. These data-cubes can be used to produce 2D maps of the star formation rate, dust extinction,
electron density, stellar population parameters, the kinematics and chemical abundances of both
stars and ionized gas, and other physical quantities derived from the fitting of the stellar spectrum
and the measurement of nebular emission lines. To exemplify our methods and the quality of the data,
we present the VENGA data-cube on the face-on Sc galaxy NGC 628 (a.k.a. M 74). The VENGA observations
of NGC 628 are described, as well as the construction of the data-cube, our spectral fitting method,
and the fitting of the stellar and ionized gas velocity fields. We also propose a new method to measure
the inclination of nearly face-on systems based on the matching of the stellar and gas rotation curves
using asymmetric drift corrections. VENGA will measure relevant physical parameters across different
environments within these galaxies, allowing a series of studies on star formation, structure
assembly, stellar populations, chemical evolution, galactic feedback, nuclear activity, and
the properties of the interstellar medium in massive disk galaxies.
