We present constraints on the massive star and ionized gas properties for a sample of 62 star-forming
galaxies at $z\sim2.3$. Using BPASS stellar population models, we fit the rest-UV spectra of galaxies
in our sample to estimate age and stellar metallicity which, in turn, determine the ionizing spectrum.
In addition to the median properties of well-defined subsets of our sample, we derive the ages and
stellar metallicities for 30 high-SNR individual galaxies -- the largest sample of individual
galaxies at high redshift with such measurements. Most galaxies in this high-SNR subsample have
stellar metallicities of $0.001<Z_*<0.004$. We then use Cloudy+BPASS photoionization models
to match observed rest-optical line ratios and infer nebular properties. Our high-SNR subsample
is characterized by a median ionization parameter and oxygen abundance, respectively, of $\log(U)_{\textrm{med}}=-2.98\pm0.25$
and $12+\log(\textrm{O/H})_{\textrm{med}}=8.48\pm0.11$. Accordingly, we find that all galaxies
in our sample show evidence for $\alpha$-enhancement. In addition, based on inferred $\log(U)$
and $12+\log(\textrm{O/H})$ values, we find that the local relationship between ionization parameter
and metallicity applies at $z\sim2$. Finally, we find that the high-redshift galaxies most offset
from the local excitation sequence in the BPT diagram are the most $\alpha$-enhanced. This trend
suggests that $\alpha$-enhancement resulting in a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed oxygen abundance
is a significant driver of the high-redshift galaxy offset on the BPT diagram relative to local systems.
The ubiquity of $\alpha$-enhancement among $z\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies indicates important
differences between high-redshift and local galaxies that must be accounted for in order to derive
physical properties at high redshift.
