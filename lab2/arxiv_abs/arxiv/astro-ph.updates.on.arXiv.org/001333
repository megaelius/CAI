We investigated the space velocity components of 6610 red clump (RC) stars in terms of vertical distance,
Galactocentric radial distance and Galactic longitude. Stellar velocity vectors are corrected
for differential rotation of the Galaxy which is taken into account using photometric distances
of RC stars. The space velocity components estimated for the sample stars above and below the Galactic
plane are compatible only for the space velocity component in the direction to the Galactic rotation
of the thin disc stars. The space velocity component in the direction to the Galactic rotation (V)
shows a smooth variation relative to the mean Galactocentric radial distance (Rm), while it attains
its maximum at the Galactic plane. The space velocity components in the Galactic centre (U) and in
the vertical direction (W) show almost flat distributions relative to Rm with small changes in their
trends at Rm=7.5 kpc. U values estimated for the RC stars in quadrant 180<l<=270 are larger
than the ones in quadrants 0<l<=90 and 270<l<=360. The smooth distribution of the
space velocity dispersions reveals that the thin and thick discs are kinematically continuous
components of the Galaxy. Based on the W space velocity components estimated in the quadrants 0<l<=90
and 270<l<=360, in the inward direction relative to the Sun, we showed that RC stars above
the Galactic plane move towards the North Galactic Pole, whereas those below the Galactic plane
move in the opposite direction. In the case of quadrant 180<l<=270, their behaviour is different,
i.e. the RC stars above and below the Galactic plane move towards the Galactic plane. We stated that
the Galactic long bar is the probable origin of many, but not all, of the detected features.
