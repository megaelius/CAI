We follow the longterm evolution of the dynamic ejecta of neutron star mergers for up to 100 years
and over a density range of roughly 40 orders of magnitude. We include the nuclear energy input from
the freshly synthesized, radioactively decaying nuclei in our simulations and study its effects
on the remnant dynamics. Although the nuclear heating substantially alters the longterm evolution,
we find that running nuclear networks over purely hydrodynamic simulations (i.e. without heating)
yields actually acceptable nucleosynthesis results. The main dynamic effect of the radioactive
heating is to quickly smooth out inhomogeneities in the initial mass distribution, subsequently
the evolution proceeds self-similarly and after 100 years the remnant still carries the memory
of the initial binary mass ratio. We also explore the nucleosynthetic yields for two mass ejection
channels. The dynamic ejecta very robustly produce "strong" r-process elements with $A > 130$
with a pattern that is essentially independent of the details of the merging system. From a simple
model we find that neutrino-driven winds yield "weak" r-process contributions with $50 < A <
130$ whose abundance patterns vary substantially between different merger cases. This is because
their electron fraction, set by the ratio of neutrino luminosities, varies considerably from case
to case. Such winds do not produce any $^{56}{\rm Ni}$, but a range of radioactive isotopes that are
long-lived enough to produce a second, radioactively powered electromagnetic transient in addition
to the "macronova" from the dynamic ejecta. While our wind model is very simple, it nevertheless
demonstrates the potential of such neutrino-driven winds for electromagnetic transients and
it motivates further, more detailed neutrino-hydrodynamic studies. The properties of the mentioned
transients are discussed in more detail in a companion paper.
