Accreting neutron stars can power a wide range of astrophysical phenomena including short- and
long-duration gamma-ray bursts, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, and X-ray binaries. Numerical
simulations are a valuable tool for studying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction
that is central to these problems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond
pulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating accretion,
have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while force-free methods, suitable
for such regions, cannot include the accreting gas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve
essentially force-free, highly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic
simulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric general-relativistic
MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the interaction of a turbulent accretion flow
with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind can lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting
state. This transition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power can greatly
exceed the power of the isolated pulsar's wind. If the accretion rate is below a critical value, the
pulsar instead expels the accretion stream. More generally, our simulations produce for the first
time the four possible accretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed
magnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto the stellar poles;
(c) the propeller state, where material enters through the light cylinder but is prevented from
accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d) almost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the
light cylinder by the pulsar wind.
