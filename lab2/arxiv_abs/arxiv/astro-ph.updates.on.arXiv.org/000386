We study the evolution of the observed photospheric magnetic field and the modeled global coronal
magnetic field during the past 3 1/2 solar activity cycles observed since the mid-1970s. We use synoptic
magnetograms and extrapolated potential-field models based on longitudinal full-disk photospheric
magnetograms from the NSO's three magnetographs at Kitt Peak, the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations
of the Sun (SOLIS) vector spectro-magnetograph (VSM), the spectro-magnetograph and the 512-channel
magnetograph instruments, and from the U. Stanford's Wilcox Solar Observatory. The associated
multipole field components are used to study the dominant length scales and symmetries of the coronal
field. Polar field changes are found to be well correlated with active fields over most of the period
studied, except between 2003-6 when the active fields did not produce significant polar field changes.
Of the axisymmetric multipoles, only the dipole and octupole follow the poles whereas the higher
orders follow the activity cycle. All non-axisymmetric multipole strengths are well correlated
with the activity cycle. The tilt of the solar dipole is therefore almost entirely due to active-region
fields. The axial dipole and octupole are the largest contributors to the global field except while
the polar fields are reversing. This influence of the polar fields extends to modulating eruption
rates. According to the Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus), Solar Eruptive Event Detection System
(SEEDS), and Nobeyama radioheliograph prominence eruption catalogs, the rate of solar eruptions
is found to be systematically higher for active years between 2003-2012 than for those between 1997-2002.
This behavior appears to be connected with the weakness of the late-cycle 23 polar fields as suggested
by Luhmann. We see evidence that the process of cycle 24 field reversal is well advanced at both poles.
