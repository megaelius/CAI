The physics of magnetic hot stars and how a large-scale magnetic field affects their interior properties
is largely unknown. Few studies have combined high-quality observations and modelling of magnetic
pulsating stars, known as magneto-asteroseismology, primarily because of the dearth of detected
pulsations in stars with a confirmed and well-characterised large-scale magnetic field. We aim
to characterise observational signatures of rotation and pulsation in chemically peculiar candidate
magnetic stars using photometry from the K2 space mission. Thus, we identify the best candidate
targets for ground-based, optical spectropolarimetric follow-up observations to confirm the
presence of a large-scale magnetic field. We employed customised reduction and detrending tools
to process the K2 photometry into optimised light curves for a variability analysis. We searched
for the periodic photometric signatures of rotational modulation caused by surface abundance
inhomogeneities in 56 chemically peculiar A and B stars. Furthermore, we searched for intrinsic
variability caused by pulsations (coherent or otherwise) in the amplitude spectra of these stars.
The rotation periods of 38 chemically peculiar stars are determined, 16 of which are the first determination
of the rotation period in the literature. We confirm the discovery of high-overtone roAp pulsation
modes in HD 177765 and find an additional 3 Ap and Bp stars that show evidence of high-overtone pressure
modes found in roAp stars in the form of possible Nyquist alias frequencies in their amplitude spectra.
Furthermore, we find 6 chemically peculiar stars that show evidence of intrinsic variability caused
by gravity or pressure pulsation modes. The discovery of pulsations in a non-negligible fraction
of chemically peculiar stars make these stars high-priority targets for spectropolarimetric
campaigns.
