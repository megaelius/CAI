Growing observational evidence has suggested active meteorology in atmospheres of brown dwarfs
(BDs) and directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs). In particular, a number of surveys have
shown that near-IR brightness variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings
of atmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous studies, the detailed
mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism.
Clouds are important in shaping the thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres
via large opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this work, using
a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a self-consistent coupling between
the thermal structure, convective mixing, cloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation
of clouds, we show that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability
in both temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and directly imaged EGPs.
The typical periods of variability are one to tens of hours with typical amplitude of the variability
up to hundreds of Kelvins in effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over
a wide range of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to model
parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important implications for the observed
flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs, especially those evolve in short timescales.
It is also a promising mechanism for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L/T transition
of brown dwarfs.
