The most direct and strongest evidence for the presence of dark energy is provided by the measurement
of galaxy distances using type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This result is based on the assumption that
the corrected brightness of SN Ia through the empirical standardization would not evolve with look-back
time. Recent studies have shown, however, that the standardized brightness of SN Ia is correlated
with host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate, suggesting a possible correlation
with stellar population property. In order to understand the origin of these correlations, we have
continued our spectroscopic observations to cover most of the reported nearby early-type host
galaxies. From high-quality (signal-to-noise ratio ~175) spectra, we obtained the most direct
and reliable estimates of population age and metallicity for these host galaxies. We find a significant
correlation between SN luminosity (after the standardization) and stellar population age at a
99.5% confidence level. As such, this is the most direct and stringent test ever made for the luminosity
evolution of SN Ia. Based on this result, we further show that the previously reported correlations
with host morphology, host mass, and local star formation rate are most likely originated from the
difference in population age. This indicates that the light-curve fitters used by the SNe Ia community
are not quite capable of correcting for the population age effect, which would inevitably cause
a serious systematic bias with look-back time. Notably, taken at face values, a significant fraction
of the Hubble residual used in the discovery of the dark energy appears to be affected by the luminosity
evolution. We argue, therefore, that this systematic bias must be considered in detail in SN cosmology
before proceeding to the details of the dark energy.
