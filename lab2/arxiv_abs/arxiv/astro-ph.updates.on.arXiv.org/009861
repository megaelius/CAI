We present a multi-wavelength study of the Planck cold clump G181.84+0.31, which is located at the
northern end of the extended filamentary structure S242. We have extracted 9 compact dense cores
from the SCUBA-2 850 um map, and we have identified 18 young stellar objects (YSOs, 4 Class I and 14
Class II) based on their Spitzer, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Two-Micron All-Sky
Survey (2MASS) near- and mid-infrared colours. The dense cores and YSOs are mainly distributed
along the filamentary structures of G181.84 and are well traced by HCO$^{+}$(1-0) and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(1-0)
spectral-line emission. We find signatures of sequential star formation activities in G181.84:
dense cores and YSOs located in the northern and southern sub-structures are younger than those
in the central region. We also detect global velocity gradients of about 0.8$\pm$0.05 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$
and 1.0$\pm$0.05 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ along the northern and southern sub-structures, respectively,
and local velocity gradients of 1.2$\pm$0.1 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ in the central substructure.
These results may be due to the fact that the global collapse of the extended filamentary structure
S242 is driven by an edge effect, for which the filament edges collapse first and then further trigger
star formation activities inward. We identify three substructures in G181.84 and estimate their
critical masses per unit length, which are $\sim$ 101$\pm$15 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$, 56$\pm$8
M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$ and 28$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$, respectively. These values are all
lower than the observed values ($\sim$ 200 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$), suggesting that these sub-structures
are gravitationally unstable.
