A comparative analysis of the astrophysical S factor and the reaction rate for the direct $ \alpha(d,\gamma)^{6}{\rm
Li}$ capture reaction, and the primordial abundance of the $^6$Li element, resulting from two-body,
three-body and combined cluster models is presented. It is shown that the two-body model, based
on the exact-mass prescription, can not correctly describe the dependence of the isospin-forbidden
E1 S factor on energy and does not reproduce the temperature dependence of the reaction rate from
the direct LUNA data. It is demonstrated that the isospin-forbidden E1 astrophysical S factor is
very sensitive to the orthogonalization procedure of Pauli-forbidden states within the three-body
model. On the other hand, the E2 S factor does not depend on the orthogonalization method. This insures
that the orthogonolizing pseudopotentials method yields a very good description of the LUNA collaboration's
low-energy direct data. At the same time, the SUSY transformation significantly underestimates
the data from the LUNA collaboration. On the other hand, the energy dependence of the E1 S factor are
the same in both methods. The best description of the LUNA data for the astrophysical S factor and
the reaction rates is obtained within the combined E1(three-body OPP)+E2(two-body) model. It
yields a value of $(0.72 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-14}$ for the $^6$Li/H primordial abundance ratio,
consistent with the estimation $(0.80 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-14}$ of the LUNA collaboration. For
the $^6{\rm Li}/^7{\rm Li}$ abundance ratio an estimation $(1.40\pm 0.12)\times 10^{-5}$ is obtained
in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction.
