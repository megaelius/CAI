Spectroscopic Eclipsing Binaries (SEBs) are fundamental benchmarks in stellar astrophysics
and today are observed in breathtaking detail by missions like TESS, Kepler, and APOGEE. We develop
a methodology for simultaneous analysis of high precision Kepler light curves and high resolution
near-IR spectra from APOGEE and present orbital solutions and evolutionary histories for a subset
of SEBs within this overlap. Radial velocities extracted from APOGEE spectra using the Broadening
Function technique are combined with Kepler light curves and to yield binary orbital solutions.
The Broadening Function approach yields more precise radial velocities than the standard Cross-Correlation
Function, which in turn yields more precise orbital parameters and enables the identification
of tertiary stars. The orbital periods of these seven SEBs range from 4 to 40 days. Four of the systems
(KIC 5285607, KIC 6864859, KIC 6778289, and KIC 4285087) are well-detached binaries. The remaining
three systems have apparent tertiary companions, but each exhibits two eclipses along with at least
one spectroscopically varying component (KIC 6449358, KIC 6131659, and KIC 6781535). Gaia distances
are available for four targets which we use to estimate temperatures of both members of these SEBs.
We explore evolutionary histories in H-R diagram space and estimate ages for this subset of our sample.
Finally, we consider the implications for the formation pathways of close binary systems via interactions
with tertiary companions. Our methodology combined with the era of big data and observation overlap
opens up the possibility of discovering and analyzing large numbers of diverse SEBs, including
those with high flux ratios and those in triple systems.
