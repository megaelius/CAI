Resolved debris disk features (e.g., warps, offsets, edges and gaps, azimuthal asymmetries, radially
thickened rings, scale heights) contain valuable information about the underlying planetary
systems, such as the posited planet's mass, semi-major axis, and other orbital parameters. Most
existing models assume a single planet is sculpting the disk feature, but recent observations of
mature planetary systems (e.g., by radial velocity surveys or \textit{Kepler}) have revealed
that many planets reside in multi-planet systems. Here we investigate if/how planet properties
inferred from single-planet models are compromised when multiple planets reside in the system.
For each disk feature, we build a two-planet model that includes a planet b with fixed parameters
and a planet c with a full range of possible parameters. We investigate these two-planet systems
and summarize the configurations for which assuming a single planet (i.e., planet b) leads to significantly
flawed inferences of that planet's properties. We find that although disk features are usually
primarily dominated by a single planet, when using single-planet models we are at risk of misinterpreting
planet properties by orders of magnitude in extreme cases. Specifically, we are at high risk of misinterpreting
planet properties from disk warps; at moderate risk from disk edges and gaps, radially thickened
rings, and scale height features; and at low risk from host star-disk center offsets and azimuthal
asymmetries. We summarize situations where we can infer the need to use a multi-planet model instead
of a single-planet one from disk morphology dissimilarities.
