The properties of carbon stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and their total dust production rates
are predicted by fitting their spectral energy distributions (SED) over pre-computed grids of
spectra reprocessed by dust. The grids are calculated as a function of the stellar parameters by
consistently following the growth for several dust species in their circumstellar envelopes,
coupled with a stationary wind. Dust radiative transfer is computed taking as input the results
of the dust growth calculations. The optical constants for amorphous carbon are selected in order
to reproduce different observations in the infrared and optical bands of \textit{Gaia} Data Release
2. We find a tail of extreme mass-losing carbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with low
gas-to-dust ratios that is not present in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Typical gas-to-dust
ratios are around $700$ for the extreme stars, but they can be down to $\sim160$--$200$ and $\sim100$
for a few sources in the SMC and in the LMC, respectively. The total dust production rate for the carbon
star population is $\sim 1.77\pm 0.45\times10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, for the LMC, and $\sim
2.52\pm 0.96 \times 10^{-6}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, for the SMC. The extreme carbon stars observed
with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array and their wind speed are studied in detail. For the most dust-obscured
star in this sample the estimated mass-loss rate is $\sim 6.3 \times 10^{-5}$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$.
