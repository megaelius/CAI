Planetesimal formation is one of the most important unsolved problems in planet formation theory.
In particular, rocky planetesimal formation is difficult because silicate dust grains are easily
broken when they collide. Recently, it has been proposed that they can grow as porous aggregates
when their monomer radius is smaller than $\sim$ 10 nm, which can also avoid the radial drift toward
the central star. However, the stability of a layer composed of such porous silicate dust aggregates
has not been investigated. Therefore, we investigate the gravitational instability of this dust
layer. To evaluate the disk stability, we calculate Toomre's stability parameter $Q$, for which
we need to evaluate the equilibrium random velocity of dust aggregates. We calculate the equilibrium
random velocity considering gravitational scattering and collisions between dust aggregates,
drag by mean flow of gas, stirring by gas turbulence, and gravitational scattering by gas density
fluctuation due to turbulence. We derive the condition of the gravitational instability using
the disk mass, dust-to-gas ratio, turbulent strength, orbital radius, and dust monomer radius.
We find that, for the minimum mass solar nebula model at 1 au, the dust layer becomes gravitationally
unstable when the turbulent strength $\alpha\lesssim10^{-5}$. If the dust-to-gas ratio is increased
twice, the gravitational instability occurs for $\alpha\lesssim10^{-4}$. We also find that the
dust layer is more unstable in disks with larger mass, higher dust-to-gas ratio, and weaker turbulent
strength, at larger orbital radius, and with a larger monomer radius.
