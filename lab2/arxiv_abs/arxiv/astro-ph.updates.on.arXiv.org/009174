Small rocky planets seem to be very abundant around low-mass M-type stars. Their actual planetary
population is however not yet precisely understood. Currently several surveys aim to expand the
statistics with intensive detection campaigns, both photometric and spectroscopic. We analyse
106 spectroscopic HARPS-N observations of the active M0-type star GJ 685 taken over the past five
years. We combine these data with photometric measurements from different observatories to accurately
model the stellar rotation and disentangle its signals from genuine Doppler planetary signals
in the RV data. We run an MCMC analysis on the RV and activity indexes time series to model the planetary
and stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian Process regression technique to deal
with the stellar activity signals. We identify three periodic signals in the RV time series, with
periods of 9, 24, and 18 d. Combining the analyses of the photometry of the star with the activity indexes
derived from the HARPS-N spectra, we identify the 18 d and 9 d signals as activity-related, corresponding
to the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic respectively. The 24 d signals shows no relations
with any activity proxy, so we identify it as a genuine planetary signal. We find the best-fit model
describing the Doppler signal of the newly-found planet, GJ 685\,b, corresponding to an orbital
period $P_b = 24.160^{+0.061}_{-0.047}$ d and a minimum mass $M_P \sin i = 9.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ M$_\oplus$.
We also study a sample of 70 RV-detected M-dwarf planets, and present new statistical evidence of
a difference in mass distribution between the populations of single- and multi-planet systems,
which can shed new light on the formation mechanisms of low-mass planets around late-type stars.
