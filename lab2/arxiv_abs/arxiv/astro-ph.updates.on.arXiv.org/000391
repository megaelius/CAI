We use the super Earth 55 Cnc e as a case study to address an observable effect of tidal heating. We investigate
whether planet-planet interactions can force the eccentricity of this planet to a level affecting
the eclipse depth observed with Spitzer. Using the constant time lag tidal model, we first calculate
the observed planet flux as a function of albedo and eccentricity, for different tidal dissipation
constants and for two extreme cases: a planet with no heat redistribution and a planet with full heat
redistribution. We derive the values of albedo and eccentricity that match the observed transit
depth. We then perform N-body simulations of the planetary system including tides and General Relativity
to follow the evolution of the eccentricity of planet e. We compare the range of eccentricities given
by the simulations with the eccentricities required to alter the eclipse depth. We find that the
eccentricity of planet e can be large enough to contribute at a measurable level to the thermal emission
measured with Spitzer. This affects the constraints on the albedo of the planet, which can be as high
as 0.9 (instead of 0.55 when ignoring tidal heating). We also derive a maximum value for the eccentricity
of planet e directly from the eclipse depth: e<0.015 assuming Earth's dissipation constant.
Transiting exoplanets in multiple planet systems are exceptional targets for testing tidal models
because their tidal luminosity may be observable. Future multi-wavelengths observations of eclipse
depth and phase curves (for instance with EChO and JWST) should allow us to better resolve the temperature
map of these planets and break the degeneracy between albedo and tidal heating that remains for single
band observations. In addition, an accurate determination of the eccentricity will make it possible
to constrain the dissipation rate of the planet and to probe its internal structure.
