The neutral hydrogen~(HI) gas is an important barometer of recent star formation and metal enrichment
activities in galaxies. I develop a novel statistical method for predicting the HI-to-stellar
mass ratio $f_{gas}$ of galaxies from their stellar mass and optical colour, and apply it to a volume-limited
galaxy sample jointly observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey.
I eliminate the impact of the Malmquist bias against HI-deficient systems on the $f_{gas}$ predictor
by properly accounting for the HI detection probability of each galaxy in the analysis. The best-fitting
$f_{gas}$ predictor, with an estimated scatter of $0.272$ dex, provides excellent description
to the observed HI mass function. After defining an HI excess parameter as the deviation of the observed
$f_{gas}$ from the expected value, I confirm that there exists a strong secondary dependence of
the mass-metallicity relation on HI excess. By further examining the 2D metallicity distribution
on the specific star formation rate vs. HI excess plane, I show that the metallicity dependence on
HI is likely more fundamental than that on specific star formation rate. In addition, I find that
the environmental dependence of HI in the local Universe can be effectively described by the cross-correlation
coefficient between HI excess and the red galaxy overdensity $\rho_{cc}{=}-0.18$. This weak anti-correlation
also successfully explains the observed dependence of HI clustering on $f_{gas}$. My method provides
a useful framework for learning HI gas evolution from the synergy between future HI and optical galaxy
surveys.
