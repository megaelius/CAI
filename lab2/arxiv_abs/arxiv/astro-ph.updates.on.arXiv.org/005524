The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) has been conducted over a five-year
period at the CFHT with the MegaCam instrument, totaling 450 nights of observations. The Wide Synoptic
Survey is one component of the CFHTLS, covering 155 square degrees in four patches of 23 to 65 square
degrees through the whole MegaCam filter set (u*, g', r', i', z') down to i'$_{AB}$ = 24.5. With the
motivation of searching for high-redshift quasars at redshifts above 6.5, we extend the multi-wavelength
CFHTLS-Wide data in the Y-band down to magnitudes of $\sim$ 22.5 for point sources (5$\sigma$).
We observed the four CFHTLS-Wide fields (except one quarter of the W3 field) in the Y-band with the
WIRCam instrument at the CFHT. Each field was visited twice, at least three weeks apart. Each visit
consisted of two dithered exposures. The images are reduced with the Elixir software used for the
CFHTLS and modified to account for the properties of near-InfraRed (IR) data. Two series of image
stacks are subsequently produced: four-image stacks for each WIRCam pointing, and one-square-degree
tiles matched to the format of the CFHTLS data release. Photometric calibration is performed on
stars by fitting stellar spectra to their CFHTLS photometric data and extrapolating their Y-band
magnitudes. We measure a limiting magnitude of Y$_{AB} \simeq 22.4$ for point sources (5$\sigma$)
in an aperture diameter of 0.93", over 130 square degrees. We produce a multi-wavelength catalogue
combining the CFHTLS-Wide optical data with our CFHQSIR (Canada-France High-z quasar survey in
the near-InfraRed) Y-band data. We derive the Y-band number counts and compare them to the VIDEO
survey. We find that the addition of the CFHQSIR Y-band data to the CFHTLS optical data increases
the accuracy of photometric redshifts and reduces the outlier rate from 13.8% to 8.8% in the redshift
range 1.05 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 1.2.
