The Triangulum--Andromeda (TriAnd) overdensity is a distant structure of the Milky Way located
in the second Galactic quadrant well below the Galactic plane. Since its discovery, its nature has
been under discussion, whether it could be old perturbations of the Galactic disk or the remains
of a disrupted former dwarf galaxy. In this study, we investigate the kinematics and chemical composition
in 13 stars selected as TriAnd candidates from 2MASS photometry. The sample was observed using the
GRACES high-resolution spectrograph attached to the Gemini North telescope. Based on radial velocities
obtained from the spectra and the astrometric data from GAIA, three different kinematic criteria
were used to classify our sample stars as belonging to the TriAnd overdensity. The TriAnd confirmed
members in our sample span a range in metallicities, including two metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $\sim$
-1.3 dex). We show that the adopted kinematical classification also chemically segregates TriAnd
and non-TriAnd members of our sample, indicating a unique chemical pattern of the TriAnd stars.
Our results indicate different chemical patterns for the [Na/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]
ratios in the TriAnd stars when compared to the chemical pattern of the local disk; the paucity of
studies chemically characterizing the outer disk population of the Milky Way is the main obstacle
in establishing that the TriAnd population is chemically similar to field stars in the outer disk.
But TriAnd chemical pattern is reminiscent of that found in outer disk open clusters, although the
latter are significantly more metal-rich than TriAnd.
