The 30 Doradus (30 Dor) nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the brightest HII region in the
Local Group and a prototype starburst similar to those found in high redshift galaxies. It is thus
a stepping stone to understand the complex formation processes of stars in starburst regions across
the Universe. Here, we have studied the formation history of massive stars in 30 Dor using masses
and ages derived for 452 mainly OB stars from the spectroscopic VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS).
We find that stars of all ages and masses are scattered throughout 30 Dor. This is remarkable because
it implies that massive stars either moved large distances or formed independently over the whole
field of view in relative isolation. We find that both channels contribute to the 30 Dor massive star
population. Massive star formation rapidly accelerated about 8 Myr ago, first forming stars in
the field before giving birth to the stellar populations in NGC 2060 and NGC 2070. The R136 star cluster
in NGC 2070 formed last and, since then, about 1 Myr ago, star formation seems to be diminished with
some continuing in the surroundings of R136. Massive stars within a projected distance of 8 pc of
R136 are not coeval but show an age range of up to 6 Myr. Our mass distributions are well populated up
to $200\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The inferred IMF is shallower than a Salpeter-like IMF and appears
to be the same across 30 Dor. By comparing our sample of stars to stellar models in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, we find evidence for missing physics in the models above $\log L/\mathrm{L}_\odot=6$
that is likely connected to enhanced wind mass loss for stars approaching the Eddington limit. [abridged]
