The rate of magnetic field diffusion plays an essential role in several astrophysical plasma processes.
It has been demonstrated that the omnipresent turbulence in astrophysical media induces fast magnetic
reconnection, which consequently leads to large-scale magnetic flux diffusion at a rate independent
of the plasma microphysics. This process is called "reconnection diffusion" (RD) and allows for
the diffusion of fields which are dynamically important. The current theory describing RD is based
on incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. In this work, we have tested quantitatively
the predictions of the RD theory when magnetic forces are dominant in the turbulence dynamics (Alfv\'{e}nic
Mach number $M_A < 1$). We employed the \textsc{Pencil Code} to perform numerical simulations of
forced MHD turbulence, extracting the values of the diffusion coefficient $\eta_{RD}$ using the
Test-Field method. Our results are consistent with the RD theory ($\eta_{RD} \sim M_A^{3}$ for
$M_A < 1$) when turbulence approaches the incompressible limit (sonic Mach number $M_S \lesssim
0.02$), while for larger $M_S$ the diffusion is faster ($\eta_{RD} \sim M_A^{2}$).This work shows
for the first time simulations of compressible MHD turbulence with the suppression of the cascade
in the direction parallel to the mean magnetic field, which is consistent with incompressible weak
turbulence theory. We also verified that in our simulations the energy cascading time does not follow
the scaling with $M_A$ predicted for the weak regime, in contradiction with the RD theory assumption.
Our results generally support and expand the RD theory predictions.
