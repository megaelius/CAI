Using parametric equations of state (relativistic polytropes and a simple quark bag model) to model
dense-matter phase transitions, we study global, measurable astrophysical parameters of compact
stars such as their allowed radii and tidal deformabilities. We also investigate the influence
of stiffness of matter before the onset of the phase transitions on the parameters of the possible
exotic dense phase. The aim of our study is to compare the parameter space of the dense matter equation
of state permitting phase transitions to a sub-space compatible with current observational constraints
such as the maximum observable mass, tidal deformabilities of neutron star mergers, radii of configurations
before the onset of the phase transition, and to give predictions for future observations. We studied
solutions of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a flexible set of parametric equations
of state. We compare tidal deformabilities of stars with weak and strong phase transitions with
the results of the GW170817 neutron star merger. Specifically, we study characteristic phase transition
features in the $\Lambda_1-\Lambda_2$ relation, and estimate the deviations of our results from
the approximate formul{\ae} for $\tilde{\Lambda}-R(M_1)$ and $\Lambda$-compactness proposed
in the literature. We find constraints on the hybrid equations of state to produce stable neutron
stars on the twin branch. For the exemplary equations of state most of the high-mass twins occur for
the minimum values of the density jump $\lambda = 1.33-1.54$; corresponding values of the square
of the speed of sound are $\alpha = 0.7-0.37$. We compare results with observations of gravitational
waves and with the theoretical causal limit and find that the minimum radius of a twin branch is 9.5
- 10.5 km. For these solutions, the phase transition occurs below 0.56 [fm$^{-3}$].
