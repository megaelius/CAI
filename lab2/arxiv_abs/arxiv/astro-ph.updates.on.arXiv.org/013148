Fewer than 1% of all exoplanets detected to date have been characterized on the basis of spectroscopic
observations of their atmosphere. Unlike indirect methods, high-contrast imaging offers access
to atmospheric signatures by separating the light of a faint off-axis source from that of its parent
star. Forthcoming space facilities, such as WFIRST/LUVOIR/HabEX, are expected to use coronagraphic
instruments capable of imaging and spectroscopy in order to understand the physical properties
of remote worlds. The primary technological challenge that drives the design of these instruments
involves the precision control of wavefront phase and amplitude errors. Several FPWS and control
techniques have been proposed and demonstrated in laboratory to achieve the required accuracy.
However, these techniques have never been tested and compared under the same laboratory conditions.
This paper compares two of these techniques in a closed loop in visible light: the pair-wise (PW)
associated with electric field conjugation (EFC) and self-coherent camera (SCC). We first ran
numerical simulations to optimize PW wavefront sensing and to predict the performance of a coronagraphic
instrument with PW associated to EFC wavefront control, assuming modeling errors for both PW and
EFC. Then we implemented the techniques on a laboratory testbed. We introduced known aberrations
into the system and compared the wavefront sensing using both PW and SCC. The speckle intensity in
the coronagraphic image was then minimized using PW+EFC and SCC independently. We demonstrate
that both SCC and PW+EFC can generate a dark hole in space-like conditions in a few iterations. Both
techniques reach the current limitation of our laboratory bench and provide coronagraphic contrast
levels of 5e-9 in a narrow spectral band (<0.25% bandwidth)
