In order to examine how the terrestrial life emerged, a number of laboratory experiments have been
conducted since the 1950s. Methane has been one of the key molecules in these studies. In earlier
studies, strongly reducing gas mixtures containing methane and ammonia were mainly used to simulate
possible reactions in primitive Earth atmosphere, and amino acids and other organic compounds
were detected. Since the primitive Earth atmosphere was estimated to be less reducing, contribution
of extraterrestrial organics to the origin of life is considered quite important. Extraterrestrial
organic chemistry has been experimentally and theoretically studied intensively, including
laboratory experiments simulating interstellar molecular reactions. Endogenous and exogenous
organics should have been supplied to the primitive ocean. Now submarine hydrothermal systems
are considered one of the plausible sites of generation of life. Experiments simulating submarine
hydrothermal systems where methane played an important role are now intensively being conducted.
We have recognized the importance of such studies on possible reactions in other solar system bodies
to understand the origins of life. Titan and other icy bodies, where methane plays significant roles,
are especially good targets to be studied. In the case of Titan, not only methane-containing atmospheres
but also liquidospheres composed of methane and other hydrocarbons have been used in simulation
experiments. This paper summarizes experiments simulating various terrestrial and extraterrestrial
environments, and possible roles of methane in chemical evolution are discussed.
