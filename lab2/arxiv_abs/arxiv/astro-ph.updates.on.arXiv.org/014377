We present the results of 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection
(RMR) in electron-positron plasma, including the dynamical influence of the synchrotron radiation
process, and integrating the observable emission signatures. The simulations are initiated with
a single Harris current layer with a central gap that triggers the RMR process. We achieve a steady-state
reconnection with unrestricted outflows by means of open boundary conditions. The radiative cooling
efficiency is regulated by the choice of initial plasma temperature Theta. We explore different
values of Theta and of the background magnetisation sigma_0. Throughout the simulations, plasmoids
are generated in the central region of the layer, and they evolve at different rates, achieving a
wide range of sizes. The gaps between plasmoids are filled by smooth relativistic outflows called
minijets, whose contribution to the observed radiation is very limited due to their low particle
densities. Small-sized plasmoids are rapidly accelerated, however, they have lower contributions
to the observed emission, despite stronger relativistic beaming. Large-sized plasmoids are slow,
but produce most of the observed synchrotron emission, with major part of their radiation produced
within the central cores, the density of which is enhanced by radiative cooling. Synchrotron lightcurves
show rapid bright flares that can be identified as originating from mergers between small/fast
plasmoids and large/slow targets moving in the same direction. In the high-magnetisation case,
the accelerated particles form a broken power-law energy distribution with a soft tail produced
by particles accelerated in the minijets.
