The formation of globular clusters (GC) remains an open debate. Dwarf starburst galaxies are efficient
at forming young massive clusters with similar masses as GCs and may hold the key to understanding
their formation. We study star cluster formation in a tidal debris - including the vicinity of three
tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) - in a massive gas dominated collisional ring around NGC 5291. These
dwarfs have physical parameters which differ significantly from local starbursting dwarfs. They
are gas-rich, highly turbulent, have a gas metallicity already enriched up to half-solar, and are
expected to be free of dark matter. The aim is to study massive star cluster formation in this as yet
unexplored type of environment. We use imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope using broadband
filters covering the wavelength range from the near-UV to the near-IR. We determine the masses and
ages of the cluster candidates by using the spectral energy distribution (SED)-fitting code CIGALE,
carefully considering age-extinction degeneracy effects on the estimation of the physical parameters.
We find that the TDGs present a high cluster formation efficiency, above 40\%, a factor of two to three
higher than expected from current models. We also find massive star clusters for which the photometry
suggests that they were formed at the very birth of the TDGs and have survived for several hundred
million years. Therefore our study shows that extended TDGs and compact clusters may be formed simultaneously.
In the specific case observed here, the young star clusters are not massive enough to survive for
a Hubble time. However one may speculate that similar objects at higher redshift, with higher star
formation rate, might form some of the long lived GCs.
