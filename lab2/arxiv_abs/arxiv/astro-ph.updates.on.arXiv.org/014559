Scattering of re-emitted flux is considered to be at least partially responsible for the observed
polarisation in the (sub-)millimetre wavelength range of several protoplanetary disks. Although
the degree of polarisation produced by scattering is highly dependent on the dust model, early studies
investigating this mechanism relied on the assumption of single grain sizes and simple density
distribution of the dust. However, in the dense inner regions where this mechanism is usually most
efficient, the existence of dust grains with sizes ranging from nanometres to millimetres has been
confirmed. Additionally, the presence of gas forces larger grains to migrate vertically towards
the disk midplane, introducing a dust segregation in the vertical direction. Using polarisation
radiative transfer simulations, we analyse the dependence of the resulting scattered light polarisation
at 350 $\mu$m, 850 $\mu$m, 1.3 mm, and 2 mm on various parameters describing protoplanetary disks,
including the effect of dust grain settling. We find that the different disk parameters change the
degree of polarisation mostly by affecting the anisotropy of the radiation field, the optical depth,
or both. It is therefore very challenging to deduce certain disk parameter values directly from
polarisation measurements alone. However, assuming a high dust albedo, it is possible to trace
the transition from optically thick to optically thin disk regions. The degree of polarisation
in most of the considered disk configurations is lower than what is found observationally, implying
the necessity to revisit models that describe the dust properties and disk structure.
