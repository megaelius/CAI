We present the results of the first strong lens time delay challenge. The motivation, experimental
design, and entry level challenge are described in a companion paper. This paper presents the main
challenge, TDC1, which consisted in analyzing thousands of simulated light curves blindly. The
observational properties of the light curves cover the range in quality obtained for current targeted
efforts (e.g. COSMOGRAIL) and expected from future synoptic surveys (e.g. LSST), and include "evilness"
in the form of simulated systematic errors. 7 teams participated in TDC1, submitting results from
78 different method variants. After a describing each method, we compute and analyze basic statistics
measuring accuracy (or bias) $A$, goodness of fit $\chi^2$, precision $P$, and success rate $f$.
For some methods we identify outliers as an important issue. Other methods show that outliers can
be controlled via visual inspection or conservative quality control. Several methods are competitive,
i.e. give $|A|<0.03$, $P<0.03$, and $\chi^2<1.5$, with some of the methods already reaching
sub-percent accuracy. The fraction of light curves yielding a time delay measurement is typically
in the range $f = $20--40%. It depends strongly on the quality of the data: COSMOGRAIL-quality cadence
and light curve lengths yield significantly higher $f$ than does sparser sampling. We estimate
that LSST should provide around 400 robust time-delay measurements, each with $P<0.03$ and
$|A|<0.01$, comparable to current lens modeling uncertainties. In terms of observing strategies,
we find that $A$ and $f$ depend mostly on season length, while P depends mostly on cadence and campaign
duration.
