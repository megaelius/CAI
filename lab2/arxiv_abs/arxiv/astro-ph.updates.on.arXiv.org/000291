On the arcminute angular scales probed by Planck, the CMB anisotropies are gently perturbed by gravitational
lensing. Here we present a detailed study of this effect, detecting lensing independently in the
100, 143, and 217GHz frequency bands with an overall significance of greater than 25sigma. We use
the temperature-gradient correlations induced by lensing to reconstruct a (noisy) map of the CMB
lensing potential, which provides an integrated measure of the mass distribution back to the CMB
last-scattering surface. Our lensing potential map is significantly correlated with other tracers
of mass, a fact which we demonstrate using several representative tracers of large-scale structure.
We estimate the power spectrum of the lensing potential, finding generally good agreement with
expectations from the best-fitting LCDM model for the Planck temperature power spectrum, showing
that this measurement at z=1100 correctly predicts the properties of the lower-redshift, later-time
structures which source the lensing potential. When combined with the temperature power spectrum,
our measurement provides degeneracy-breaking power for parameter constraints; it improves CMB-alone
constraints on curvature by a factor of two and also partly breaks the degeneracy between the amplitude
of the primordial perturbation power spectrum and the optical depth to reionization, allowing
a measurement of the optical depth to reionization which is independent of large-scale polarization
data. Discarding scale information, our measurement corresponds to a 4% constraint on the amplitude
of the lensing potential power spectrum, or a 2% constraint on the RMS amplitude of matter fluctuations
at z~2.
