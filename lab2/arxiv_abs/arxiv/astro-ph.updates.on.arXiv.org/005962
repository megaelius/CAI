Black-hole driven relativistic astrophysical jets, such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),
are powerful sources of electromagnetic radiation. Their emission is powered by some energy dissipation
and particle acceleration mechanism operating in-situ at large distances from the black hole.
We propose that the formation of the dissipative structures in the jet is controlled by the time variability
of the accretion disc. We argue that the open magnetic field lines through the black hole, which drive
a strongly magnetized jet, may have their polarity reversing over time-scales related to the growth
of the magneto-rotational dynamo in the disc. Consequently, the jet is characterized by an alternating
toroidal field polarity along its propagation axis, i.e., it is a "striped jet". Magnetic reconnection
in the current sheets that form between the stripes dissipates the alternating-field energy and
thus powers further jet acceleration. Here, we consider a jet with a broad distribution of stripe
widths $l>l_{\rm min}$, above a dominant scale $l_{\rm min}$. We find that the bulk acceleration
of the jet, driven by the annihilation of the stripes, is very gradual. The dissipation rate peaks
at a distance $z_{\rm peak}\sim 10^6 R_g\, (\Gamma_\infty/30)^2\, (l_{\rm min}/1000R_g)$, where
$R_{g}$ is the black-hole's gravititional radius and $\Gamma_{\infty}$ the jet's asymptotic
Lorentz factor, and exhibits a very broad plateau extending by $\sim 4-5$ orders of magnitude in
distance. The prolonged energy dissipation accounts for the flat-to-inverted long-wavelength
spectra commonly observed in jets. The model can also account for the broad range of flaring timescales
of blazars and the fact that their bulk acceleration appears to continue out to ~100 pc scales. In
GRB jets, the model predicts comparable power for the photopsheric and Thomson-thin emission components.
