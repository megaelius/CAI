We present deep CMDs for two Subaru Suprime-Cam fields in the Virgo Stellar Stream(VSS)/Virgo Overdensity(VOD)
and compare them to a field centred on the highest concentration of Sagittarius (Sgr) Tidal Stream
stars in the leading arm, Branch A of the bifurcation. A prominent population of MS stars is detected
in all three fields and can be traced as faint as g~24 mag. Using theoretical isochrone fitting we
derive an age of 9.1(+1.0;-1.1)Gyr, a median abundance of [Fe/H]=-0.70 (+0.15; -0.20)dex and d_helio
of 30.9+-3.0kpc for the MS of the Sgr Stream Branch A. The dominant main sequence populations in the
two VSS/VOD fields (Lsun ~265 deg, Bsun ~13 deg) are located at a mean distance of 23.3+-1.6kpc and
have an age ~8.2Gyr and an abundance [Fe/H]=-0.67(+0.16;-0.12)dex similar to the Sgr Stream stars.
These parameters are also in good agreement with the age of the main population in the Sagittarius
dwarf (8.0+-1.5Gyr). They also agree with the peak in the metallicity distribution of 2-3Gyr old
M-giants, [Fe/H] ~ -0.6dex, in the Sgr leading arm north. We then compare the results from the VSS/VOD
fields with the Sgr Tidal Stream model by Law & Majewski based on a triaxial Galactic halo that
is calibrated with SDSS Sgr A-branch and 2MASS M-giant stars. We find that the most prominent feature
in the CMDs, the MS population at 23kpc, is not explained by the model. Instead the model predicts
in these directions a low density filamentary structure of Sgr debris stars at ~9kpc and a slightly
higher concentration of Sgr stars spread from 42-53kpc. At best there is only marginal evidence
for the presence of these populations in our data. Our findings then suggest that while there are
probably some Sgr debris stars present, the dominant stellar population in the VOD originates from
a different halo structure that has almost identical age and metallicity as some sections of the
Sgr tidal stream.
