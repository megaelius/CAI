A number of scenarios for the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) predict
that second generation (2G) stars form in a compact and dense subsystem embedded in a more extended
first-generation (1G) system. If these scenarios are accurate, a consequence of the denser 2G formation
environment is that 2G binaries should be more significantly affected by stellar interactions
and disrupted at a larger rate than 1G binaries. The fractions and properties of binary stars can
thus provide a dynamical fingerprint of the formation epoch of multiple-population GCs and their
subsequent dynamical evolution. We investigate the connection between binaries and multiple
populations in five GCs, NGC 288, NGC 6121 (M 4), NGC 6352, NGC 6362, and NGC 6838 (M 71). To do this,
we introduce a new method based on the comparison of Hubble Space Telescope observations of binaries
in the F275W, F336W, F438W, F606W and F814W filters with a large number of simulated binaries. In
the inner regions probed by our data we do not find large differences between the local 1G and the 2G
binary incidences in four of the studied clusters, the only exception being M 4 where the 1G binary
incidence is about three times larger than the 2G incidence. The results found are in general agreement
with the results of simulations predicting significant differences in the global 1G and 2G incidences
and in the local values in the clusters' outer regions but similar incidences in the inner regions.
The significant difference found in M 4 is consistent with simulations with a larger fraction of
wider binaries. Our analysis also provides the first evidence of mixed (1G-2G) binaries, a population
predicted by numerical simulations to form in a cluster's inner regions as a result of stellar encounters
during which one component of a binary is replaced by a star of a different population.
