Observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the WISE satellite have revealed a prominent
arc-like structure at 50" ($\simeq0.1$ pc) from the O9.5V/B0.5V system $\sigma$ Ori AB. We attribute
this dust structure to the interaction of radiation pressure from the star with dust carried along
by the IC 434 photo-evaporative flow of ionized gas from the dark cloud L1630. We have developed a
quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow with nearby (massive) stars where
radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at an appreciable distance (> 0.1 pc), and force
it to flow around the star. The model demonstrates that for the conditions in IC 434, the gas will decouple
from the dust and will keep its original flow lines. We argue that this dust structure is the first
example of a dust wave created by a massive star moving through the interstellar medium. Dust waves
(and bow waves) stratify dust grains according to their radiation pressure opacity, which reflects
the size distribution and composition of the grain material. Comparison of our model with observations
implies that dust-gas coupling through Coulomb interaction is less important than previously
thought, challenging our understanding of grain dynamics in hot, ionized regions of space. We describe
the difference between dust (and bow) waves and classical bow shocks. We conclude that dust waves
and bow waves should be common around stars showing the weak-wind phenomenon and that these structures
are best observed at mid-IR to FIR wavelengths. In particular, dust waves and bow waves are most efficiently
formed around weak-wind stars moving through a high density medium. Moreover, they provide a unique
opportunity to study the direct interaction between a (massive) star and its immediate surroundings.
