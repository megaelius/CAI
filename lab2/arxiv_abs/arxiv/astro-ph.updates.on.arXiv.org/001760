Aims. We present an 8-band (u*, g', r', i', z', Y, J, Ks) optical to NIR deep photometric catalog based
on the observations made with MegaCam and WIRCam at CFHT, and compute photometric redshifts, zp
in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) region. Our catalog provides us to identify the counterparts, and
zp for AKARI NIR/MIR sources. Results. The estimated 4sigma detection limits within an 1" aperture
radius are 26.7, 25.9, 25.1, and 24.1 mag [AB] for g', r', i', and z'-bands and 23.4, 23.0, and 22.7
mag for Y, J, and Ks-bands, respectively. There are a total of 85797 sources in the band-merged catalog.
An astrometric accuracy of this catalog determined by examining coordinate offsets with regard
to 2MASS is 0.013" with a root mean square offset of 0.32". We distinguish 5441 secure stars from extended
sources using u*-J vs. g'-Ks colors, combined with the SExtractor stellarity index of the images.
Comparing with galaxy spectroscopic redshifts, we find a photometric redshift dispersion, sigma_(dz/(1+z)),
of 0.032 and catastrophic failure rate, dz/(1+z)>0.15, of 5.8% at z<1, while a dispersion
of 0.117 and a catastrophic failures rate of 16.6% at z>1. We extend estimate of the zp uncertainty
over the full magnitude/redshift space with a redshift probability distribution function and
find that our redshift are highly accurate with z'<22 at zp<2.5 and for fainter sources with
z'<24 at z<1. From the investigation of photometric properties of AKARI infrared sources
(23354 sources) using the g'z'Ks diagram, <5% of AKARI sources with optical counterparts are
classified as high-z (1.4<z<2.5) star-forming galaxies. Among the high-z star-forming
galaxies, AKARI MIR detected sources seem to be affected by stronger dust extinction compared with
sources with non-detections in the AKARI MIR bands. The full, electronic version of our catalog
with zp will be available at the CDS.
