(Abridged) Inspired by the Kepler planet discoveries, we consider the thermal contraction of planets
close to their parent star, under the influence of evaporation. The mass-loss rates are based on
hydrodynamic models of evaporation that include both X-ray and EUV irradiation. We find that only
low-mass planets with hydrogen envelopes are significantly affected by evaporation, with evaporation
being able to remove massive hydrogen envelopes inward of 0.1 AU for Neptune-mass objects. We construct
a theoretical population of planets with varying core masses, envelope masses, orbital separations,
and stellar spectral types, and compare these against the sizes and densities measured for low-mass
planets, both in the Kepler mission and from radial velocity surveys. This exercise leads us to conclude
that evaporation is the driving force of evolution for close-in Kepler planets. In fact, some 50%
of the Kepler planet candidates may have been significantly eroded. Evaporation explains two striking
correlations observed in these objects: a lack of large radius/low density planets close to the
stars, and a bimodal distribution in planet sizes with a deficit of planets around 2R_E. Planets
that have experienced high X-ray exposures are generally smaller than this size, and those with
lower X-ray exposures are typically larger. The bimodal distribution is uniquely and naturally
explained by evaporation model, where, depending on their X-ray exposure, close-in planets can
either hold on to hydrogen envelopes 1% in mass, or be stripped entirely. To quantitatively reproduce
the observed features, we argue that not only do low-mass Kepler planets need to be made of rocky cores
overlaid with hydrogen envelopes, but few of them should have initial masses above 20 M_E, and the
majority of them should have core masses of a few Earth masses.
