A recent publication by Clark et.al (2019, CX19) uses both GALFA-HI observational data and numerical
simulations to address the nature of intensity fluctuations in Position-Position-Velocity (PPV)
space. The study questions the validity and applicability of the statistical theory of PPV space
fluctuations formulated in Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000, LP00) to HI gas and concludes that $"${\it
a significant reassessment of many observational and theoretical studies of turbulence in HI}$"$.
This implies that dozens of papers that used LP00 theory to explore interstellar turbulence as well
as the ongoing research based on LP00 theory are in error. This situation motivates the urgency of
our public response. In our Comment we explain why we believe the criticism in CX19 is based on the
incorrect understanding of the LP00 theory. In particular, we illustrate that the correlation
between PPV slices and dust emissions in CX19 does not properly reveal the relative importance of
velocity and density fluctuations in velocity channel maps. While CX19 provides an explanation
of the change of the spectral index with respect to the thickness of PPV slice based on the two-phase
nature of H1 gas, we failed to see any observational support for this idea. On the contrary, we show
that the observations both in two-phase HI and one phase CO show similar results. Moreover, the observed
change is in good agreement with LP00 predictions and spectral indexes of velocity and density spectra
that are obtained following LP00 procedures are in good agreement with the numerically confirmed
expectations of compressible MHD turbulence theory. In short, we could not find any justification
of the criticism of LP00 theory that is provided in CX19. On the contrary, our analysis testifies
that both available observational and numerical data agree well with the predictions of LP00 theory.
