Context. The prototype of Polar Ring Galaxies NGC 4650A contains two main structural components,
a central spheroid, which is the host galaxy, and an extended polar disk. Both photometric and kinematic
studies revealed that these two components co-exist on two different planes within the central
regions of the galaxy. Aims. The aim of this work is to study the spectroscopic and kinematic properties
of the host galaxy and the polar disk in the central regions of NGC 4650A by disentangling their contributions
to the observed galaxy spectrum. Methods. We applied the spectral decomposition technique introduced
in previous works to long-slit spectroscopic observations in the CaII triplet region. We focused
the analysis along the PA = 152 that corresponds to the photometric minor axis of the host galaxy,
where the superimposition of the two components is more relevant and the spectral decomposition
is necessary. We aim to disentangle the stars that move in the equatorial plane of the host galaxy
from those that move in the meridan plane, which is along the polar disk. Results. We successfully
disentangled the spectra of the two structural components of NGC 4650A and measured their line-of-sight
velocity and velocity dispersion profiles, and the stellar content along PA = 152. The host galaxy
shows significant rotation along its photometric minor axis, indicating that the gravitational
potential is not axisymmetric. The polar disk shows a kinematic decoupling: the inner regions counter-rotating
with respect the outer-regions and the host spheroid. This suggests a complex formation history
for the polar disk, characterised by mass accretion with decoupled angular momenta.
