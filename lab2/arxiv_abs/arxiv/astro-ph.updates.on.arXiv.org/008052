We have created a new, clean catalogue of extragalactic non-nuclear X-ray sources by correlating
the 3XMM-DR4 data release of the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue with the Third Reference
Catalogue of Bright Galaxies and the Catalogue of Neighbouring Galaxies, using an improved version
of the method presented in Walton et al. (2011). Our catalogue contains 1,314 sources, of which 384
are candidate ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The resulting catalogue improves upon previous
catalogues in its handling of spurious detections by taking into account XMM-Newton quality flags.
We estimate the contamination of ULXs by background sources to be 24 per cent. We define a 'complete'
subsample as those ULXs in galaxies for which the sensitivity limit is below $10^{39}$ erg/s and
use it to examine the hardness ratio properties between ULX and non-ULX sources, and ULXs in different
classes of host galaxy. We find that ULXs have a similar hardness ratio distribution to lower-luminosity
sources, consistent with previous studies. We also find that ULXs in spiral and elliptical host
galaxies have similar distributions to each other independent of host galaxy morphology, however
our results do support previous indications that the population of ULXs is more luminous in star-forming
host galaxies than in non-star-forming galaxies. Our catalogue contains further interesting
subpopulations for future study, including Eddington Threshold sources and highly variable ULXs.
We also examine the highest-luminosity (L$_X$ > $5 \times 10^{40}$ erg/s) ULXs in our catalogue
in search of intermediate-mass black hole candidates, and find nine new possible candidates.
