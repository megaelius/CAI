The BL Lac object 3C66A is one of the most luminous extragalactic sources at TeV $\gamma$-rays (VHE,
i.e. $E >100$ GeV). Since TeV $\gamma$-ray radiation is absorbed by the extragalactic background
light (EBL), it is crucial to know the redshift of the source in order to reconstruct its original
spectral energy distribution, as well as to constrain EBL models. However, the optical spectrum
of this BL\,Lac is almost featureless, so a direct measurement of $z$ is very difficult; in fact,
the published redshift value for this source ($z=0.444$) has been strongly questioned. Based on
EBL absorption arguments, several constraints to its redshift, in the range $0.096 < z < 0.5$, were
proposed. Since these AGNs are hosted, typically, in early type galaxies that are members of groups
or clusters, we have analysed spectro-photometrically the environment of 3C66A, with the goal
of finding the galaxy group hosting this blazar. This study was made using optical images of a $5.5
\times 5.5$\,arcmin$^{2}$ field centred on the blazar, and spectra of 24 sources obtained with
Gemini/GMOS-N multi-object spectroscopy. We found spectroscopic evidence of two galaxy groups
along the blazar's line of sight: one at $z \simeq 0.020$ and a second one at $z \simeq 0.340$. The first
one is consistent with a known foreground structure, while the second group here presented has six
spectroscopically confirmed members. Their location along a red sequence in the colour-magnitude
diagram allows us to identify 34 additional candidate members of the more distant group. The blazar's
spectrum shows broad absorption features that we identify as arising in the intergalactic medium,
thus allowing us to tentatively set a redshift lower limit at $z_{3C66A} \ge 0.33$. As a consequence,
we propose that 3C66A is hosted in a galaxy that belongs to a cluster at $z=0.340$.
