Using 3D AMR simulations, linking the 50 kpc to the sub-pc scales over the course of 40 Myr, we systematically
relax the classic Bondi assumptions in a typical galaxy hosting a SMBH. In the realistic scenario,
where the hot gas is cooling, while heated and stirred on large scales, the accretion rate is boosted
up to two orders of magnitude compared with the Bondi prediction. The cause is the nonlinear growth
of thermal instabilities, leading to the condensation of cold clouds and filaments when t_cool/t_ff
< 10. Subsonic turbulence of just over 100 km/s (M > 0.2) induces the formation of thermal instabilities,
even in the absence of heating, while in the transonic regime turbulent dissipation inhibits their
growth (t_turb/t_cool < 1). When heating restores global thermodynamic balance, the formation
of the multiphase medium is violent, and the mode of accretion is fully cold and chaotic. The recurrent
collisions and tidal forces between clouds, filaments and the central clumpy torus promote angular
momentum cancellation, hence boosting accretion. On sub-pc scales the clouds are channelled to
the very centre via a funnel. A good approximation to the accretion rate is the cooling rate, which
can be used as subgrid model, physically reproducing the boost factor of 100 required by cosmological
simulations, while accounting for fluctuations. Chaotic cold accretion may be common in many systems,
such as hot galactic halos, groups, and clusters, generating high-velocity clouds and strong variations
of the AGN luminosity and jet orientation. In this mode, the black hole can quickly react to the state
of the entire host galaxy, leading to efficient self-regulated AGN feedback and the symbiotic Magorrian
relation. During phases of overheating, the hot mode becomes the single channel of accretion (with
a different cuspy temperature profile), though strongly suppressed by turbulence.
