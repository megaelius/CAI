The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the largest ground-based observatory operating in
the very-high-energy gamma-ray (20 GeV - 300 TeV) range. It will be based on more than one hundred
telescopes, located at two sites (northern and southern hemispheres). The energy coverage, in
the southern CTA array, will extend up to hundreds of TeV thanks to 70 small size telescopes (SST),
with primary mirrors of about 4 meters in diameter and large field of view of the order of 9 degrees.
It is proposed that one of the first sets of precursors for the CTA SSTs array will be represented by
nine ASTRI telescopes. Their prototype, named ASTRI SST-2M, is installed in Italy. It is currently
completing the overall commissioning before entering the science verification phase that will
performed observing bright TeV sources as Crab Nebula, Mrk421 and Mrk 501 cross-checking the prototype
performance with the Monte Carlo predictions. ASTRI telescopes are characterized by a dual-mirror
optical design based on the Schwarzschild- Couder (SC) configuration. The focal-plane camera
is curved in order to fit the ideal prescription for the SC design and the sensors are small size silicon
photomultipliers read-out by a fast front-end electronics. The telescope prototype installed
in Italy, has been developed by the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics, INAF, following
an end-to-end approach that comprises all aspects from the design, construction and implementation
of the entire hardware and software system to the final scientific products. All parts of the system
have been designed to comply with the CTA requirements. A collaborative effort, addressed to the
implementation of the first ASTRI telescopes for the CTA southern site, is now on-going led by INAF
with the Universidade de Sao Paulo (Brazil), the North-West University (South Africa) and the Italian
National Institute for Nuclear Physics.
