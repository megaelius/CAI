Context. The role of magnetic fields during the formation of high-mass stars is not yet fully understood,
and the processes related to the early fragmentation and collapse are largely unexplored today.
The high-mass star forming region G9.62+0.19 is a well known source, presenting several cores at
different evolutionary stages. Aims. We determine the magnetic field morphology and strength
in the high-mass star forming region G9.62+0.19, to investigate its relation to the evolutionary
sequence of the cores. Methods. We use Band 7 ALMA observations in full polarisation mode and we analyse
the polarised dust emission. We estimate the magnetic field strength via the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
and the Structure Function methods. Results. We resolve several protostellar cores embedded in
a bright and dusty filamentary structure. The polarised emission is clearly detected in six regions.
Moreover the magnetic field is oriented along the filament and appears perpendicular to the direction
of the outflows. We suggest an evolutionary sequence of the magnetic field, and the less evolved
hot core exhibits a magnetic field stronger than the more evolved one. We detect linear polarisation
from thermal line emission and we tentatively compared linear polarisation vectors from our observations
with previous linearly polarised OH masers observations. We also compute the spectral index, the
column density and the mass for some of the cores. Conclusions. The high magnetic field strength
and the smooth polarised emission indicate that the magnetic field could play an important role
for the fragmentation and the collapse process in the star forming region G9.62+019 and that the
evolution of the cores can be magnetically regulated. On average, the magnetic field derived by
the linear polarised emission from dust, thermal lines and masers is pointing in the same direction
and has consistent strength.
