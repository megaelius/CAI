It is well-known that fitting the Color Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) to the theoretical isochrones
is the main method to determine star cluster ages. However, when the CMDs are not available, the Spectral
Energy Distribution (SED)-fitting technique is the only other approach, although it suffers the
age-metallicity-reddening degeneracy. In this work, we gather the ages, metallicities and masses
of dozens of M31 star clusters from the CMD-fitting with HST images from the literatures for comparison.
We check the reliability of the SED-fitting results with different models, i.e., Bruzual \& Charlot
2003 model (BC03), Galaxy Evolutionary Synthesis Models ({\sl GALEV}) and Advanced Stellar Population
Synthesis (ASPS) for the simple stellar populations (SSPs) with single stars (ss)-SSP/binary
star (bs)-SSPs models. The photometry bands includes the Galaxy Evolution Explorer {\sl GALEX}
FUV/NUV bands, optical/near-infrared $UBVRIJHK$ bands, as well as the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer ({\sl WISE}) $W1$/$W2$ bands. The comparisons show that the SED-fitting ages agree well
with the CMD-fitting ages, either with the fixed metallicity or with the free metallicity for both
the BC03 and the {\sl GALEV} model. However, for the ASPS models, it seems that SED-fitting results
are systematic older than the CMD ages, especially for the ages log t <9.0 (yr). The fitting also shows
that the {\sl GALEX} FUV/NUV-band are more important than the {\sl WISE} $W1$/$W2$ for constraining
the ages, which confirms the previous findings. We also derived the masses of our sample star clusters
from the BC03 and {\sl GALEV} models and it is found that the values agree well with that in the literature.
