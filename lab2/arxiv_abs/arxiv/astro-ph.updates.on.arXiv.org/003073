The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data
analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large datasets. Gaussian Processes are
a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general,
as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small datasets. In
this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational
requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying
it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples
of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra,
and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance
function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations
or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven
damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this
choice -- but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present
a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods.
The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical
data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations
of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.
