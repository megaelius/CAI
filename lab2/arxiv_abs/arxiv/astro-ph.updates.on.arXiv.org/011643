Symmetron field is one of the promising candidates of dark energy scalar fields. In all viable candidate
field theories, a screening mechanism is implemented to be consistent with existing tests of general
relativity. The screening effect in the symmetron theory manifests its influence only to the thin
outer layer of a bulk object, where inside a dense material the symmetry of the field is restored and
no force exists. For pointlike particles such as atoms, the depth of screening is larger than the
size of the particle, such that the screening mechanism is ineffective and the symmetron force is
fully expressed on the atomic test particles. Extra force measurements using atom interferometry
are thus much more sensitive than bulk mass based measurements, and indeed have placed the most stringent
constraints on the parameters characterizing symmetron field in certain region. There is however
no clear direct connection between the laboratory measurements and astrophysical observations,
where the constraints are far separated by 10 orders of magnitude in the parameter space. In this
paper, we present a closed-form expression for the symmetron acceleration of realistic atomic
experiments. The expression is validated through numerical simulations for a terrestrial fifth-force
experiment using atom interferometry. As a result, we show the connection of the atomic measurement
constraints to the astrophysical ones. We also estimate the attainable symmetron constraints
from a previously proposed experiment in space intended for test of chameleon theory. The atomic
constraints on the symmetron theory will be further improved by orders of magnitude.
