Linking a coronagraph instrument to a spectrograph via a single mode optical fiber is a pathway towards
detailed characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with current and future ground- and space-based
telescopes. However, given the extreme brightness ratio and small angular separation between
planets and their host stars, the planet signal-to-noise ratio will likely be limited by the unwanted
coupling of starlight into the fiber. To address this issue, we utilize a wavefront control loop
and a deformable mirror to systematically reject starlight from the fiber by measuring what is transmitted
through the fiber. The wavefront control algorithm is based on the formalism of electric field conjugation
(EFC), which in our case accounts for the spatial mode selectivity of the fiber. This is achieved
by using a control output that is the overlap integral of the electric field with the fundamental
mode of a single mode fiber. This quantity can be estimated by pair-wise image plane probes injected
using a deformable mirror. We present simulation and laboratory results that demonstrate our approach
offers a significant improvement in starlight suppression through the fiber relative to a conventional
EFC controller. With our experimental setup, which provides an initial normalized intensity of
$3\times10^{-4}$ in the fiber at an angular separation of $4\lambda/D$, we obtain a final normalized
intensity of $3\times 10^{-6}$ in monochromatic light at $\lambda=635$~nm through the fiber (100x
suppression factor) and $2\times 10^{-5}$ in $\Delta\lambda/\lambda=8\%$ broadband light about
$\lambda=625$~nm (10x suppression factor). The fiber-based approach improves the sensitivity
of spectral measurements at high contrast and may serve as an integral part of future space-based
exoplanet imaging missions as well as ground-based instruments.
