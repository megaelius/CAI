The Chernekov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the most advanced facility designed for Cherenkov
Astronomy. ASTRI SST-2M has been developed as a demonstrator for the Small Size Telescope in the
context of the upcoming CTA. Its main innovation consists in the optical layout which implements
the Schwarzschild-Couder configuration and is fully validated for the first time. The ASTRI SST-2M
optical system represents the first qualified example for two mirrors telescope for Cherenkov
Astronomy. This configuration permits to (i) maintain a high optical quality across a large FoV
(ii) de-magnify the plate scale, (iii) exploit new technological solutions for focal plane sensors.
The goal of the paper is to present the optical qualification of the ASTRI SST-2M telescope. The qualification
has been obtained measuring the PSF sizes generated in the focal plane at various distance from the
optical axis. These values have been compared with the performances expected by design. After an
introduction on the Gamma Astronomy from the ground, the optical design and how it has been implemented
for ASTRI SST-2M is discussed. Moreover the description of the setup used to qualify the telescope
over the full field of view is shown. We report the results of the first--light optical qualification.
The required specification of a flat PSF of $\sim 10$ arcmin in a large field of view ~10 deg has been
demonstrated. These results validate the design specifications, opening a new scenario for Cherenkov
Gamma ray Astronomy and, in particular, for the detection of high energy (5 - 300 TeV) gamma rays and
wide-field observations with CTA.
