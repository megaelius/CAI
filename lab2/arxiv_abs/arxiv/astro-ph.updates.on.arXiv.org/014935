We use the latest multi-redshift ($z=6.5-8.7$) upper limits on the 21-cm signal from the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA) to explore astrophysical models which are inconsistent with the data. These
upper limits are achieved using 298 h of carefully excised data over four observing seasons. To explore
these upper limits in the context of reionisation astrophysics, we use 21CMMC. We then connect the
disfavoured regions of parameter space to existing observational constraints on reionisation
such as high-$z$ galaxy ultra-violet (UV) luminosity functions, background UV photoionisation
rate, intergalactic medium (IGM) neutral fraction, the electron scattering optical depth and
the soft-band X-ray emissivity. We find the vast majority of models disfavoured by the MWA limits
are already inconsistent with existing observational constraints. These inconsistent models
arise from two classes of models: (i) `cold' reionisation and (ii) pure matter density fluctuations
(i.e. no reionisation). However, a small subsample of models are consistent implying the existing
MWA limits provide unique information in disfavouring models of reionisation, albeit extremely
weakly. We also provide the first limits on the soft-band X-ray emissivity from galaxies at high
redshifts, finding $1\sigma$ lower limits of $\epsilon_{{\rm X},0.5-2~{\rm keV}}\gtrsim10^{34.5}$
erg s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Finally, we recover 95 per cent disfavoured limits on the IGM spin temperature
of $\bar{T}_{\rm S}\lesssim$ 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, 2.4 K at $z=6.5, 6.8, 7.1, 7.8, 8.2, 8.7$. With
this we infer the IGM must have undergone, at the very least, a small amount of X-ray heating. Note,
the limits on $\epsilon_{{\rm X},0.5-2~{\rm keV}}$ and $\bar{T}_{\rm S}$ are conditional on the
IGM neutral fraction.
