Since more than two years, the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) is operating successfully
at the Canary Island of La Palma. Apart from its purpose to serve as a monitoring facility for the brightest
TeV blazars, it was built as a major step to establish solid state photon counters as detectors in
Cherenkov astronomy. The camera of the First G-APD Cherenkov Telesope comprises 1440 Geiger-mode
avalanche photo diodes (G-APD aka. MPPC or SiPM) for photon detection. Since properties as the gain
of G-APDs depend on temperature and the applied voltage, a real-time feedback system has been developed
and implemented. To correct for the change introduced by temperature, several sensors have been
placed close to the photon detectors. Their read out is used to calculate a corresponding voltage
offset. In addition to temperature changes, changing current introduces a voltage drop in the supporting
resistor network. To correct changes in the voltage drop introduced by varying photon flux from
the night-sky background, the current is measured and the voltage drop calculated. To check the
stability of the G-APD properties, dark count spectra with high statistics have been taken under
different environmental conditions and been evaluated. The maximum data rate delivered by the
camera is about 240 MB/s. The recorded data, which can exceed 1 TB in a moonless night, is compressed
in real-time with a proprietary loss-less algorithm. The performance is better than gzip by almost
a factor of two in compression ratio and speed. In total, two to three CPU cores are needed for data
taking. In parallel, a quick-look analysis of the recently recorded data is executed on a second
machine. Its result is publicly available within a few minutes after the data were taken. [...]
