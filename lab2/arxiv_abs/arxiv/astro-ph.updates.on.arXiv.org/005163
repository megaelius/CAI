Turbulence is a fundamental parameter in models of grain growth during the early stages of planet
formation. As such, observational constraints on its magnitude are crucial. Here we self-consistently
analyze ALMA CO(2-1), SMA CO(3-2), and SMA CO(6-5) observations of the disk around TW Hya and find
an upper limit on the turbulent broadening of $<$0.08c$_s$ ($\alpha<$0.007 for $\alpha$ defined
only within 2-3 pressure scale heights above the midplane), lower than the tentative detection
previously found from an analysis of the CO(2-1) data. We examine in detail the challenges of image
plane fitting vs directly fitting the visibilities, while also considering the role of the vertical
temperature gradient, systematic uncertainty in the amplitude calibration, and assumptions
about the CO abundance, as potential sources of the discrepancy in the turbulence measurements.
These tests result in variations of the turbulence limit between $<$0.04c$_s$ and $<$0.13c$_s$,
consistently lower than the 0.2-0.4c$_s$ found previously. Having ruled out numerous factors,
we restrict the source of the discrepancy to our assumed coupling between temperature and density
through hydrostatic equilibrium in the presence of a vertical temperature gradient and/or the
confinement of CO to a thin molecular layer above the midplane, although further work is needed to
quantify the influence of these prescriptions. Assumptions about hydrostatic equilibrium and
the CO distribution are physically motivated, and may have a small influence on measuring the kinematics
of the gas, but they become important when constraining small effects such as the strength of the
turbulence within a protoplanetary disk.
