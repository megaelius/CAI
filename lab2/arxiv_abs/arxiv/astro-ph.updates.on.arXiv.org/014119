In this work, we compute rates of merging neutron stars (MNS) in galaxies of different morphological
type, as well as the cosmic MNS rate in a unitary volume of the Universe adopting different cosmological
scenarios. Our aim is to provide predictions of kilonova rates for future observations both at low
and high redshift. In the adopted galaxy models, we take into account the production of r-process
elements either by MNS or core-collapse supernovae. In computing the MNS rates we adopt either a
constant total time delay for merging (10 Myr) or a distribution function of such delays. Our main
conclusions are: i) the observed present time MNS rate in our Galaxy is well reproduced either with
a constant time delay or a distribution function $\propto t^{-1}$. The [Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation
in the Milky Way can be well reproduced with only MNS, if the time delay is short and constant. If the
distribution function of delays is adopted, core-collapse supernovae as are also required. ii)
The present time cosmic MNS rate can be well reproduced in any cosmological scenario, either pure
luminosity evolution or a typical hierarchical one, and spirals are the main contributors to it.
iii) The spirals are the major contributors to the cosmic MNS at all redshifts in hierarchical scenarios.
In the pure luminosity evolution scenario, the spirals are the major contributors locally, whereas
at high redshift ellipticals dominate. iv) The predicted cosmic MNS rate well agrees with the cosmic
rate of short Gamma Ray Bursts if the distribution function of delays is adopted, in a cosmological
hierarchical scenario observationally derived. v) Future observations of Kilonovae in ellipticals
will allow to disentangle among constant or a distribution of time delays as well as among different
cosmological scenarios.
