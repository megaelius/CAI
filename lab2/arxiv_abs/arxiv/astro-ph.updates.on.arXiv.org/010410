Eccentricity tides generate a torque that can drive an ocean planet towards asynchronous rotation
states of equilibrium when enhanced by resonances associated with the oceanic tidal modes. We investigate
the impact of eccentricity tides on the rotation of rocky planets hosting a thin uniform ocean and
orbiting cool dwarf stars such as TRAPPIST-1, with orbital periods ~1-10 days. Combining the linear
theory of oceanic tides in the shallow water approximation with the Andrade model for the solid part
of the planet, we develop a global model including the coupling effects of ocean loading, self-attraction,
and deformation of the solid regions. We derive from this model analytic solutions for the tidal
Love numbers and torque exerted on the planet. These solutions are used with realistic values of
parameters provided by advanced models of the internal structure and tidal oscillations of solid
bodies to explore the parameter space both analytically and numerically. Our model allows us to
fully characterise the frequency-resonant tidal response of the planet, and particularly the
features of resonances associated with the oceanic tidal modes (eigenfrequencies, resulting
maxima of the tidal torque and Love numbers) as functions of the planet parameters (mass, radius,
Andrade parameters, ocean depth and Rayleigh drag frequency). Resonances associated with the
oceanic tide decrease the critical eccentricity beyond which asynchronous rotation states distinct
from the usual spin-orbit resonances can exist. We provide an estimation and scaling laws for this
critical eccentricity, which is found to be lowered by roughly one order of magnitude, switching
from ~0.3 to ~0.06 in typical cases and to ~0.01 in extremal ones.
