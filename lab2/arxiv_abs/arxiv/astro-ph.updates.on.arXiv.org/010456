We present MINESweeper, a tool to measure stellar parameters by jointly fitting observed spectra
and broadband photometry to model isochrones and spectral libraries. This approach enables the
measurement of spectrophotometric distances, in addition to stellar parameters such as Teff,
log(g), [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and radial velocity. MINESweeper employs a Bayesian framework and
can easily incorporate a variety of priors, including Gaia parallaxes. Mock data are fit in order
to demonstrate how the precision of derived parameters depends on evolutionary phase and SNR. We
then fit a selection of data in order to validate the model outputs. Fits to the benchmark stars Procyon,
Arcturus, and the Sun result in derived stellar parameters that are in excellent agreement with
the literature, except for the surface gravity of Arcturus, where our value (1.35) is notably lower
than the literature (1.66). We then fit combined spectra and photometry of stars in the open and globular
clusters M92, M13, M3, M107, M71, and M67. Derived distances, [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and log(g)-Teff,
relations are in overall good agreement with literature values, although there are trends between
metallicity and log(g), within clusters that point to systematic uncertainties at the ~0.1 dex
level. Finally, we fit a large sample of stars from the H3 Spectroscopic Survey in which high quality
Gaia parallaxes are also available. These stars are fit without the Gaia parallaxes so that the geometric
parallaxes can serve as an independent test of the spectrophotometric distances. Comparison between
the two reveals excellent agreement within their formal uncertainties after accounting for the
Gaia zero point uncertainties.
