The observed tightness of the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation (MDAR) poses a fine-tuning
challenge to current models of galaxy formation. We propose that this relation could arise from
collisional interactions between baryons and dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for
modification of gravity or ad hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy
the following three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is comparable to the dynamical
time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy with baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the
product between the baryon-DM cross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely
proportional to the DM number density. We present an example of a particle physics model that gives
a DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and velocity dependence. Direct detection constraints
require our DM particles to be either very light ($m << m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding
respectively to heating and cooling of DM by baryons. In both cases, our mechanism applies and an
equilibrium configuration can in principle be reached. Here, we focus on the heavy DM/cooling case
as it is technically simpler. Under these assumptions, we find that rotationally-supported disk
galaxies could naturally settle to equilibrium configurations satisfying a MDAR at all radii without
invoking finely tuned feedback processes. We also discuss issues related to the small scale clumpiness
of baryons, as well as predictions for pressure-supported systems. We argue in particular that
galaxy clusters do not follow the MDAR despite being DM-dominated because they have not reached
their equilibrium configuration. Finally, we revisit existing phenomenological, astrophysical
and cosmological constraints on baryon-DM interactions in light of the unusual density dependence
of the cross section.
