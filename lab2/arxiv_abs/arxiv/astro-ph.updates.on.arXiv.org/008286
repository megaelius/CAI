The diffuse and translucent molecular clouds traced in absorption along the line of sight to strong
background sources have so far been investigated mainly in the spectral domain because of limited
angular resolution or small sizes of the background sources. We aim to resolve and investigate the
spatial structure of molecular clouds traced by several molecules detected in absorption along
the line of sight to SgrB2(N). We have used spectral line data from the EMoCA survey performed with
ALMA, taking advantage of the high sensitivity and angular resolution. We identify, on the basis
of the spectral analysis of c-C3H2 across the field of view, 15 main velocity components along the
line of sight to SgrB2(N) and several components in the envelope of SgrB2. The c-C3H2 column densities
reveal two categories of clouds. Clouds in Category I (3 kpc arm, 4 kpc arm, and some GC clouds) have
smaller c-C3H2 column densities, smaller linewidths, and smaller widths of their column density
PDFs than clouds in Category II (Scutum arm, Sgr arm, and other GC clouds). To investigate the spatial
structure we derive opacity maps for the following molecules: c-C3H2, H13CO+, 13CO, HNC, HN13C,
HC15N, CS, C34S, 13CS, SiO, SO, and CH3OH. These maps reveal that most molecules trace relatively
homogeneous structures that are more extended than the field of view defined by the background continuum
emission (about 15", that is 0.08-0.6pc depending on the distance). SO and SiO show more complex
structures with smaller clumps of size ~5-8". Our analysis suggests that the driving of the turbulence
is mainly solenoidal in the investigated clouds. On the basis of HCO+, we conclude that most line-of-sight
clouds towards SgrB2 are translucent, including all clouds where complex organic molecules were
recently detected. We also conclude that CCH and CH are good probes of H2 in both diffuse and translucent
clouds.
