Hot stellar systems (HSS) are a collection of stars bound together by gravitational attraction.
These systems hold clues to many mysteries of outer space so understanding their origin, evolution
and physical properties is important but remains a huge challenge. We used multivariate $t$-mixtures
model-based clustering to analyze 13456 hot stellar systems from Misgeld & Hilker (2011) that included
12763 candidate globular clusters and found eight homogeneous groups using the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC). A nonparametric bootstrap procedure was used to estimate the confidence of each
of our clustering assignments. The eight obtained groups can be characterized in terms of the correlation,
mass, effective radius and surface density. Using conventional correlation-mass-effective
radius-surface density notation, the largest group, Group 1, can be described as having positive-low-low-moderate
characteristics. The other groups, numbered in decreasing sizes are similarly characterised,
with Group 2 having positive-low-low-high characteristics, Group 3 displaying positive-low-low-moderate
characteristics, Group 4 having positive-low-low-high characteristic, Group 5 displaying positive-low-moderate-moderate
characteristic and Group 6 showing positive-moderate-low-high characteristic. The smallest
group (Group 8) shows negative-low-moderate-moderate characteristic. Group 7 has no candidate
clusters and so cannot be similarly labeled but the mass, effective radius correlation for these
non-candidates indicates that they zare larger than typical globular clusters. Assertions drawn
for each group are ambiguous for a few HSS having low confidence in classification. Our analysis
identifies distinct kinds of HSS with varying confidence and provides novel insight into their
physical and evolutionary properties.
