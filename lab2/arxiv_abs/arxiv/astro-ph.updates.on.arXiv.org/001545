We present a large-scale, interferometric survey of ammonia (1,1) and (2,2) toward the Galactic
Center observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The survey covers Delta l ~1degree
(~150pc) at an assumed distance of 8.5 kpc) and Delta b ~0.2degree (~30pc) which spans the region
between the supermassive black hole SgrA* and the massive star forming region SgrB2. The resolution
is ~20'' (~0.8pc) and emission at scales >~2' (>~3.2pc) is filtered out due to missing interferometric
short spacings. Consequently, the data represent the denser, compact clouds and disregards the
large scale, diffuse gas. Many of the clumps align with the 100 pc dust ring and mostly anti-correlate
with 1.2cm continuum emission. We present a kinetic temperature map of the dense gas. The temperature
distribution peaks at ~38K with a width at half maximum between 18K and 61K (measurements sensitive
within Tkin~10-80K). Larger clumps are on average warmer than smaller clumps which suggests internal
heating sources. Our observations indicate that the circumnuclear disk ~1.5 pc around SgrA* is
supplied with gas by the 20km/s molecular cloud. This gas is substantially cooler than gas ~3-15pc
away from SgrA*. We find a strong temperature gradient across SgrB2. Ammonia column densities correlate
well with SCUBA 850um fluxes, but the relation is shifted from the origin, which may indicate a requirement
for a minimum amount of dust to form and shield ammonia. Around the Arches and Quintuplet clusters
we find shell morphologies with UV-influenced gas in their centers, followed by ammonia and radio
continuum layers.
