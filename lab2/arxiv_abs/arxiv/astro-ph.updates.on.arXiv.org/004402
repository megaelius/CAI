The complete characterization of the pressure profile of high-redshift galaxy clusters, from
their core to their outskirts, is a major issue for the study of the formation of large-scale structures.
It is essential to constrain a potential redshift evolution of both the slope and scatter of the mass-observable
scaling relations used in cosmology studies based on cluster statistics. In this paper, we present
the first thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) mapping of a cluster from the sample of the NIKA2 SZ large
program that aims at constraining the redshift evolution of cluster pressure profiles and the tSZ-mass
scaling relation. We have observed the galaxy cluster PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 at redshift $z=0.58$
with the NIKA2 camera, a dual-band (150 and 260 GHz) instrument operated at the IRAM 30-meter telescope.
We identify a thermal pressure excess in the south-west region of PSZ2 G144.83+25.11 and a high redshift
sub-millimeter point source that affect the intracluster medium (ICM) morphology of the cluster.
The NIKA2 data are used jointly with tSZ data acquired by the MUSTANG, Bolocam and $Planck$ experiments
in order to non-parametrically set the best constraints on the electronic pressure distribution
from the cluster core ($\rm{R} \sim 0.02 \rm{R_{500}}$) to its outskirts ($\rm{R} \sim 3 \rm{R_{500}}
$). We investigate the impact of the over-pressure region on the shape of the pressure profile and
on the constraints on the integrated Compton parameter $\rm{Y_{500}}$. A hydrostatic mass analysis
is also performed by combining the tSZ-constrained pressure profile with the deprojected electronic
density profile from XMM-$Newton$. This allows us to conclude that the estimates of $\rm{Y_{500}}$
and $\rm{M_{500}}$ obtained from the analysis with and without masking the disturbed ICM region
differ by 65 and 79% respectively. (abridged)
