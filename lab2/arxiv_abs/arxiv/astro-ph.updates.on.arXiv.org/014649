We study the evolution of the observed correlation between central stellar velocity dispersion
$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ and stellar mass $M_*$ of massive ($M_*\gtrsim 3\times 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$)
early-type galaxies (ETGs) out to redshift $z\approx 2.5$, exploiting a Bayesian hierarchical
inference formalism. Collecting ETGs from state-of-the-art literature samples, we build a $fiducial$
sample ($0\lesssim z\lesssim 1$), which is obtained with homogeneous selection criteria, but
also a less homogeneous $extended$ sample ($0\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$). Based on the fiducial sample,
we find that the $M_*$-$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ relation is well represented by $\sigma_\mathrm{e}\propto
M_*^{\beta}(1+z)^{\zeta}$, with $\beta\simeq 0.18$ independent of redshift and $\zeta\simeq
0.4$ (at given $M_*$, $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ decreases for decreasing $z$, for instance by a factor
of $\approx1.3$ from $z=1$ to $z=0$). When the slope $\beta$ is allowed to evolve, we find it increasing
with redshift: $\beta(z)\simeq 0.16+0.26\log(1+z)$ describes the data as well as constant $\beta\simeq
0.18$. The intrinsic scatter of the $M_*$-$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ relation is $\simeq0.08$ dex in
$\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ at given $M_*$, independent of redshift. Our results suggest that, on average,
the velocity dispersion of $individual$ massive ($M_*\gtrsim 3\times 10^{11}\,M_\odot$) ETGs
decreases with time while they evolve from $z\approx 1$ to $z\approx 0$. The analysis of the extended
sample leads to results similar to that of the fiducial sample, with slightly stronger redshift
dependence of the normalisation ($\zeta\simeq 0.5$) and weaker redshift dependence of the slope
(${\rm d} \beta/{\rm d} \log (1+z)\simeq 0.18$) when $\beta$ varies with time. At $z=2$ ETGs with
$M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ have, on average, $\approx1.7$ higher $\sigma_\mathrm{e}$ than
ETGs of similar stellar mass at $z=0$.
