We present the strongest robust constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) from currently
available galaxy surveys, combining large-scale clustering measurements and their cross-correlations
with the cosmic microwave background. We update the data sets used by Giannantonio et al. (2012),
and broaden that analysis to include the full set of two-point correlation functions between all
surveys. In order to obtain the most reliable constraints on PNG, we advocate the use of the cross-correlations
between the catalogs as a robust estimator and we perform an extended analysis of the possible systematics
to reduce their impact on the results. To minimize the impact of stellar contamination in our luminous
red galaxy (LRG) sample, we use the recent Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey catalog of
Ross et al. (2011). We also find evidence for a new systematic in the NVSS radio galaxy survey similar
to, but smaller than, the known declination-dependent issue; this is difficult to remove without
affecting the inferred PNG signal, and thus we do not include the NVSS auto-correlation function
in our analyses. We find no evidence of primordial non-Gaussianity; for the local-type configuration
we obtain for the skewness parameter $ -36 < f_{\mathrm{NL}} < 45 $ at 95 % c.l. ($5 \pm 21$ at
$1\sigma$) when using the most conservative part of our data set, improving previous results; we
also find no evidence for significant kurtosis, parameterized by $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. In addition
to PNG, we simultaneously constrain dark energy and find that it is required with a form consistent
with a cosmological constant.
