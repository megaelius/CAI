We consider the evolution of stellar hierarchical quadruple systems in the 2+2 (two binaries orbiting
each other's barycentre) and 3+1 (triple orbited by a fourth star) configurations. In our simulations,
we take into account the effects of secular dynamical evolution, stellar evolution, tidal evolution
and encounters with passing stars. We focus on type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) driven by collisions of
carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs). Such collisions can arise from several channels: (1) collisions
due to extremely high eccentricities induced by secular evolution, (2) collisions following a
dynamical instability of the system, and (3) collisions driven by semisecular evolution. The systems
considered here have initially wide inner orbits, with initial semilatus recti larger than 12 AU,
implying no interaction if the orbits were isolated. However, taking into account dynamical evolution,
we find that $\approx 0.4$ ($\approx 0.6$) of 2+2 (3+1) systems interact. In particular, Roche Lobe
overflow can be triggered possibly in highly eccentric orbits, dynamical instability can ensue
due to mass-loss-driven orbital expansion or secular evolution, or a semisecular regime can be
entered. We compute the delay-time distributions (DTDs) of collision-induced SNe Ia, and find
that they are flatter compared to the observed DTD. Moreover, our combined SNe Ia rates are $(3.7\pm0.7)
\times 10^{-6} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot^{-1}$ and $(1.3\pm0.2) \times 10^{-6} \,\mathrm{M}_\odot^{-1}$
for 2+2 and 3+1 systems, respectively, three orders of magnitude lower compared to the observed
rate, of order $10^{-3} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot^{-1}$. The low rates can be ascribed to interactions
before the stars evolve to CO WDs. However, our results are lower limits given that we considered
a subset of quadruple systems.
