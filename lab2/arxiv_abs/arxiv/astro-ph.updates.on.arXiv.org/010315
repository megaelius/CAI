Coronal holes are regions of open magnetic field in the solar corona and can be observed as dark structures
in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray spectrum. Deriving reliably the coronal hole boundary is of
high interest, as its area, underlying magnetic field, and other properties give important hints
towards high speed solar wind acceleration processes and on compression regions arriving at Earth.
In this study we present a newly improved threshold based extraction method that incorporates the
intensity gradient along the coronal hole boundary, which is implemented as a user-friendly SSWIDL
GUI. The Collection of Analysis Tools for Coronal Holes (CATCH) enables the user to download data,
perform guided coronal hole extraction and analyze the underlying photospheric magnetic field.
We use CATCH to analyze non-polar coronal holes during the SDO-era, based on 193 {\AA} filtergrams
taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and magnetograms taken by the Heliospheric and
Magnetic Imager (HMI), both on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Between 2010 and 2019
we investigate 734 coronal holes that are located close to the central meridian. We find coronal
holes distributed across latitudes of about 60{\deg} for which we derive sizes between 1.6 x 10^9
to 1.7 x 10^11 km^2. The absolute value of the mean signed magnetic field strength tends towards an
average of 2.8 +/- 1.9 G. As far as the abundance and size of coronal holes is concerned, we find no distinct
trend towards the northern or southern hemisphere. We find that variations in local and global conditions
may significantly change the threshold needed for reliable coronal hole extraction and thus, we
can highlight the importance of individually assessing and extracting coronal holes.
