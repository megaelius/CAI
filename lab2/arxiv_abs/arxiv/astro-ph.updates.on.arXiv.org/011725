Unambiguously identifying molecules in spectra is of fundamental importance for a variety of scientific
and industrial uses. Interpreting atmospheric spectra for the remote detection of volatile compounds
requires information about the spectrum of each relevant molecule. However, spectral data currently
exist for a few hundred molecules and only a fraction of those have complete spectra (e.g. H$_2$O,
NH$_3$). Consequently, molecular detections in atmospheric spectra remain vulnerable to false
positives, false negatives, and missassignments. There is a key need for spectral data for a broad
range of molecules. Given how challenging it is to obtain high-resolution molecular spectra, there
is great value in creating intermediate approximate spectra that can provide a starting point for
the analysis of atmospheric spectra. Using a combination of experimental measurements, organic
chemistry, and quantum mechanics, RASCALL (Rapid Approximate Spectral Calculations for ALL)
is a computational approach that provides approximate spectral data for any given molecule, including
thousands of potential atmospheric gases, in seconds. RASCALL 1.0 simulates molecular spectra
by interpreting functional group data from experimental and theoretical sources to estimate the
position and strength of molecular bands. The RASCALL 1.0 spectra consist of approximate band centers
and qualitative intensities. RASCALL can also be used to study spectral patterns between molecules,
and to highlight ambiguities in molecular detections. The RASCALL catalogue, and its preliminary
version RASCALL 1.0, contains spectral data for more molecules than any other publicly available
database, with applications in all fields interested in the detection of molecules in the gas phase.
The preliminary catalogue of molecular data and associated documentation are freely available
online and will be routinely updated.
