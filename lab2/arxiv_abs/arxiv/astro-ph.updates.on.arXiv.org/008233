Various models of structure formation can account for various aspects of the galaxy formation process
on different scales, as well as for various observational features of structures. Thus, the investigation
of galaxies orientation constitute a standard test of galaxies formation scenarios since observed
variations in angular momentum represent fundamental constraints for any model of galaxy formation.
We have improved the method of analysis of the alignment of galaxies in clusters. Now, the method
allowed analysis both position angles of galaxy major axes and two angles describing the spatial
orientation of galaxies. The distributions of analyzed angles were tested for isotropy by applying
different statistical tests. For sample of analyzed clusters we have computed the mean values of
analyzed statistics, checking whether they are the same as expected ones in the case of random distribution
of analyzed angles. The detailed discussion of this method has been performed. We have shown how
to proceed in many particular cases in order to improve the statistical reasoning when analyzing
the distribution of the angles in the observational data. Separately, we have compared these new
results with those obtained from numerical simulations. We show the powerful of our method on the
example of galaxy orientation analysis in 247 Abell rich galaxy clusters. We have found that the
orientations of galaxies in analyzed clusters are not random. It means that we genuinely confirmed
an existence of the alignment of galaxies in rich Abells' galaxy clusters. This result is independent
from the clusters of Bautz-Morgan types.
