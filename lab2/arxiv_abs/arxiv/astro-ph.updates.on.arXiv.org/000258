We simulate the evolution of a 10^9 Msun dark matter halo in a cosmological setting with an adaptive-mesh
refinement code as an analogue to local low luminosity dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
The primary goal of our study is to investigate the roles of reionization and supernova feedback
in determining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. We include a wide range of
physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogen formation and cooling, photoionization
and photodissociation from a metagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding,
star formation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback. We carry out simulations
excluding each major effect in turn. We find that reionization is primarily responsible for expelling
most of the gas in our simulations, but that supernova feedback is required to disperse the dense,
cold gas in the core of the halo. Moreover, we show that the timing of reionization can produce an order
of magnitude difference in the final stellar mass of the system. For our full physics run with reionization
at z=9, we find a stellar mass of about 10^5 Msun at z=0, and a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light
radius of approximately 130 Msun/Lsun, consistent with observed low-luminosity dwarfs. However,
the resulting median stellar metallicity is 0.06 Zsun, considerably larger than observed systems.
In addition, we find star formation is truncated between redshifts 4 and 7, at odds with the observed
late time star formation in isolated dwarf systems but in agreement with Milky Way ultrafaint dwarf
spheroidals. We investigate the efficacy of energetic feedback in our simple thermal-energy driven
feedback scheme, and suggest that it may still suffer from excessive radiative losses, despite
reaching stellar particle masses of about 100 Msun, and a comoving spatial resolution of 11 pc.
