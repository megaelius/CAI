Percolation analysis has long been used to quantify the connectivity of the cosmic web. Most of the
previous work is based on density fields on grids. By smoothing into fields, we lose information
about galaxy properties like shape or luminosity. Lack of mathematical model also limits our understanding
of percolation analysis. In order to overcome these difficulties, we have studied percolation
analysis based on discrete points. Using a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm, we generate the
S-bb relation, between the fractional mass of the largest connected group (S) and the FoF linking
length (bb). We propose a new model, the Probability Cloud Cluster Expansion Theory (PCCET) to relate
the S-bb relation with correlation functions. We show that the S-bb relation reflects a combination
of all orders of correlation functions. Using N-body simulation, we find that the S-bb relation
is robust against redshift distortion and incompleteness in observation. From the Bolshoi simulation,
with Halo Abundance Matching (HAM), we have generated a mock galaxy catalogue. Good matching of
the projected two-point correlation function with observation is confirmed. However, comparing
the mock catalogue with the latest galaxy catalogue from SDSS DR12, we have found significant differences
in their S-bb relations. This indicates that the mock galaxy catalogue cannot accurately retain
higher order correlation functions than the two-point correlation function, which reveals the
limit of HAM method. As a new measurement, S-bb relation is applicable to a wide range of data types,
fast to compute, robust against redshift distortion and incompleteness, and it contains information
of all orders of correlation function.
