Deep learning with artificial neural networks is increasingly gaining attention, because of its
potential for data-driven astronomy. However, this methodology usually does not provide uncertainties
and does not deal with incompleteness and noise in the training data. In this work, we design a neural
network for high-resolution spectroscopic analysis using APOGEE data that mimics the methodology
of standard spectroscopic analyses: stellar parameters are determined using the full wavelength
range, but individual element abundances use censored portions of the spectrum. We train this network
with a customized objective function that deals with incomplete and noisy training data and apply
dropout variational inference to derive uncertainties on our predictions. We determine parameters
and abundances for 18 individual elements at the $\approx 0.03$ dex level, even at low signal-to-noise
ratio. We demonstrate that the uncertainties returned by our method are a realistic estimate of
the precision and they automatically blow up when inputs or outputs outside of the training set are
encountered, thus shielding users from unwanted extrapolation. By using standard deep-learning
tools for GPU acceleration, our method is extremely fast, allowing analysis of the entire APOGEE
data set of $\approx250,000$ spectra in ten minutes on a single, low-cost GPU. We release the stellar
parameters and 18 individual-element abundances with associated uncertainty for the entire APOGEE
DR14 dataset. Simultaneously, we release astroNN, a well-tested, open-source python package
developed for this work, but that is also designed to be a general package for deep learning in astronomy.
