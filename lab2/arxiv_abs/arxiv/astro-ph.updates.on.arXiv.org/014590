Some systems of close-in "super-Earths" contain five or more planets on non-resonant but compact
and nearly coplanar orbits. The Kepler-11 system is an iconic representative of this class of system.
It is challenging to explain their origins given that planet-disk interactions are thought to be
essential to maintain such a high degree of coplanarity, yet these same interactions invariably
cause planets to migrate into chains of mean motion resonances. Here we mine a large dataset of dynamical
simulations of super-Earth formation by migration. These simulations match the observed period
ratio distribution as long as the vast majority of planet pairs in resonance become dynamically
unstable. When instabilities take place resonances are broken during a late phase of giant impacts,
and typical surviving systems have planet pairs with significant mutual orbital inclinations.
However, a subset of our unstable simulations matches the Kepler-11 system in terms of coplanarity,
compactness, planet-multiplicity and non-resonant state. This subset have dynamical instability
phases typically much shorter than ordinary systems. Unstable systems may keep a high degree of
coplanarity post-instability if planets collide at very low orbital inclinations ($\lesssim1^\circ$)
or if collisions promote efficient damping of orbital inclinations. If planetary scattering during
the instability takes place at low orbital inclinations ($\text{i}\lesssim1^\circ$), orbital
inclinations are barely increased by encounters before planets collide.When planetary scattering
pumps orbital inclinations to higher values ($\gtrsim 1^\circ$) planets tend to collide at higher
mutual orbital inclinations, but depending on the geometry of collisions mergers' orbital inclinations
may be efficiently damped. Each of these formation pathways can produce analogues to the Kepler-11
system.
