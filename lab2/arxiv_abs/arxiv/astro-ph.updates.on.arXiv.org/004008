We perform a combined analysis of cosmic shear tomography, galaxy-galaxy lensing tomography,
and redshift-space multipole power spectra (monopole and quadrupole) using 450 deg$^2$ of imaging
data by the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) overlapping with two spectroscopic surveys: the 2-degree
Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS) and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We restrict
the galaxy-galaxy lensing and multipole power spectrum measurements to the overlapping regions
with KiDS, and self-consistently compute the full covariance between the different observables
using a large suite of $N$-body simulations. We methodically analyze different combinations of
the observables, finding that galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements are particularly useful in
improving the constraint on the intrinsic alignment amplitude (by 30%, positive at $3.5\sigma$
in the fiducial data analysis), while the multipole power spectra are useful in tightening the constraints
along the lensing degeneracy direction (e.g. factor of two stronger matter density constraint
in the fiducial analysis). The fully combined constraint on $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3} = 0.742 \pm 0.035$, which is an improvement by 20% compared to KiDS alone, corresponds to
a $2.6\sigma$ discordance with Planck, and is not significantly affected by fitting to a more conservative
set of scales. Given the tightening of the parameter space, we are unable to resolve the discordance
with an extended cosmology that is simultaneously favored in a model selection sense, including
the sum of neutrino masses, curvature, evolving dark energy, and modified gravity. The complementarity
of our observables allows for constraints on modified gravity degrees of freedom that are not simultaneously
bounded with either probe alone, and up to a factor of three improvement in the $S_8$ constraint in
the extended cosmology compared to KiDS alone.
