The apparent size of stars is a crucial benchmark for fundamental stellar properties such as effective
temperatures, radii and surface gravities. While interferometric measurements of stellar angular
diameters are the most direct method to gauge these, they are still limited to relatively nearby
and bright stars, which are saturated in most of the modern photometric surveys. This dichotomy
prevents us from safely extending well calibrated relations to the faint stars targeted in large
spectroscopic and photometric surveys. Here, we alleviate this obstacle by presenting SAAO near-infrared
JHK observations of 55 stars: 16 of them have interferometric angular diameters, and the rest are
in common with the 2MASS (unsaturated) dataset, allowing us to tie the effective temperatures and
angular diameters derived via the Infrared Flux Method to the interferometric scale. We extend
the test to recent interferometric measurements of unsaturated 2MASS stars, including giants,
and the metal-poor benchmark target HD122563. With a critical evaluation of the systematics involved,
we conclude that a 1% accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters is usually within reach. Caution,
however, must be used when indirectly testing a temperature scale via colour relations, as well
as when assessing the reliability of interferometric measurements, especially at sub-milliarcsec
level. As a result, rather different effective temperature scales can be compatible with a given
subset of interferometric data. We highlight some caveats to be aware of in such a quest, and suggest
a simple method to check against systematics in fundamental measurements. A new diagnostic combination
seismic radii with astrometric distances is also presented.
