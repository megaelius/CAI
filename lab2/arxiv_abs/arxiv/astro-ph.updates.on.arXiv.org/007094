As large-scale international collaborations become the standard for astronomy research, a wealth
of opportunities have emerged to create innovative education and public outreach (EPO) programming.
In the past two decades, large collaborations have focused EPO strategies around published data
products. Newer collaborations have begun to explore other avenues of public engagement before
and after data are made available. We present a case study of the online EPO program of The Dark Energy
Survey, currently one of the largest international astronomy collaborations actively taking
data. DES EPO is unique at this scale in astronomy, as far as we are aware, as it evolved organically
from scientists' passion for EPO and is entirely organized and implemented by the volunteer efforts
of collaboration scientists. We summarize the strategy and implementation of eight EPO initiatives.
For content distributed via social media, we present reach and user statistics over the 2016 calendar
year. DES EPO online products reached ~2,500 users per post, and 94% of these users indicate a predisposition
to science-related interests. We find no obvious correlation between post type and post reach,
with the most popular posts featuring the intersections of science and art and/or popular culture.
We conclude that one key issue of the online DES EPO program was designing material which would inspire
new interest in science. The greatest difficulty of the online DES EPO program was sustaining scientist
participation and collaboration support; the most successful programs are those which capitalized
on the hobbies of participating scientists. We present statistics and recommendations, along
with observations from individual experience, as a potentially instructive resource for scientists
or EPO professionals interested in organizing EPO programs and partnerships for large science
collaborations or organizations.
