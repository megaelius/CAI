We aim to study the main properties of a volume-limited unbiased sample of well characterized semi-regular
variables (SRs) in order to clarify important issues, such as the formation of axially symmetric
planetary nebulae (PNe) from spherical circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) that takes place during
the mass loss process along the AGB phase. We present new high S/N IRAM 30m observations of the 12CO
J=2-1, J=1-0, and 13CO J=1-0 lines, in a volume-limited sample of SRs. We analyzed the data by characterizing
the main properties of the CSEs. The 12CO J=2-1 data have been used to study the profiles, while the
12CO J=1-0 data have been used to estimate mass-loss rates for the complete sample. We have classified
the sources into four groups according to the different profiles and final gas expansion velocities.
Type 1 and 2 profiles are broad and narrow symmetric lines, respectively. Type 3 profiles, on the
contrary, are strange profiles with very pronounced asymmetries. Type 4 profiles, finally, are
those which show two different components: a narrow line profile superimposed on a broad pedestal
component. Interestingly, we report a moderate correlation between mass-loss rates and 12CO J=1-0/J=2-1
line intensity ratios for O-rich SRs, suggesting a different behaviour between C- and O-rich SRs.
By using SHAPE+shapemol, we find a unified simple model based on an oblate spheroid, placed in different
orientations, that may explain all the 12CO profiles in the sample, indicating that the gas expansion
is, in general, predominantly equatorial. Moreover, in order to explain the type 4 profiles, we
define an extra component which may somehow be a biconical structure or similar. Type 1 and 2 profiles,
curiously, may also be explained by standard spherically symmetric envelopes. We conclude that
most circumstellar shells around SRs show axial, strongly non-spherical symmetry.
