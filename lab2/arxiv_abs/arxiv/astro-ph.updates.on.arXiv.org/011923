We present new observations of the planet beta Pictoris b from 2018 with GPI, the first GPI observations
following conjunction. Based on these new measurements, we perform a joint orbit fit to the available
relative astrometry from ground-based imaging, the Hipparcos Intermediate Astrometric Data
(IAD), and the Gaia DR2 position, and demonstrate how to incorporate the IAD into direct imaging
orbit fits. We find a mass consistent with predictions of hot-start evolutionary models and previous
works following similar methods, though with larger uncertainties: 12.8 [+5.3, -3.2] M_Jup. Our
eccentricity determination of 0.12 [+0.04, -0.03] disfavors circular orbits. We consider orbit
fits to several different imaging datasets, and find generally similar posteriors on the mass for
each combination of imaging data. Our analysis underscores the importance of performing joint
fits to the absolute and relative astrometry simultaneously, given the strong covariance between
orbital elements. Time of conjunction is well constrained within 2.8 days of 2017 September 13,
with the star behind the planet's Hill sphere between 2017 April 11 and 2018 February 16 (+/- 18 days).
Following the recent radial velocity detection of a second planet in the system, beta Pic c, we perform
additional two-planet fits combining relative astrometry, absolute astrometry, and stellar
radial velocities. These joint fits find a significantly smaller mass for the imaged planet beta
Pic b, of 8.0 +/- 2.6 M_Jup, in a somewhat more circular orbit. We expect future ground-based observations
to further constrain the visual orbit and mass of the planet in advance of the release of Gaia DR4.
