ALMA [CII] line and continuum observations of five redshift z>6 quasars are presented. This sample
was selected to probe lower black hole mass quasars than most previous studies. We find a wide dispersion
in properties with CFHQS J0216-0455, a low-luminosity quasar with absolute magnitude M_1450=-22.2,
remaining undetected implying a limit on the star formation rate in the host galaxy of <10 solar masses
per year, whereas other host galaxies have star formation rates up to hundreds of solar masses per
year. Two other quasars have particularly interesting properties. VIMOS2911 is one of the least
luminous z>6 quasars known with M_1450=-23.1, yet its host galaxy is experiencing a very powerful
starburst. PSO J167-13 has a broad and luminous [CII] line and a neighbouring galaxy a projected
distance of 5kpc away that is also detected in the [CII] line and continuum. Combining with similar
observations from the literature, we study the ratio of [CII] line to far-infrared luminosity finding
this ratio increases at high-redshift at a fixed far-infrared luminosity, likely due to lower dust
content, lower metallicity and/or higher gas masses. We compile a sample of 21 high-redshift quasars
with dynamical masses and investigate the relationship between black hole mass and dynamical mass.
The new observations presented here reveal dynamical masses consistent with the relationship
defined by local galaxies. However, the full sample shows a very wide scatter across the black hole
mass - dynamical mass plane, whereas both the local relationship and simulations of high-redshift
quasars show a much lower dispersion in dynamical mass.
