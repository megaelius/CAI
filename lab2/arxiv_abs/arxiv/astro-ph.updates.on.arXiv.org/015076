Hot subdwarfs are core-helium burning stars that show lower masses and higher temperatures than
canonical horizontal branch stars. They are believed to be formed when a red giant suffers an extreme
mass-loss episode. Binary interaction is suggested to be the main formation channel, but the high
fraction of apparently single hot subdwarfs (up to 30%) has prompted single star formation scenarios
to be proposed. If such formation scenarios without interaction were possible, that would also
imply the existence of hot subdwarfs in wide binaries that have undergone no interaction. We probe
the existence of these systems by analysing light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS) for all known hot subdwarfs with a main sequence wide binary companion, and by searching for
common proper motion pairs to spectroscopically confirmed hot subdwarfs. We find that (i) the companions
in composite hot subdwarfs show short rotation periods when compared to field main sequence stars.
They display a triangular-shaped distribution with a peak around 2.5 days, similar to what is observed
for young open clusters. This observed distribution of rotation rates for the companions in known
wide hot subdwarf binaries provides evidence of previous interaction causing spin-up. We also
report (ii) a shortage of hot subdwarfs with candidate common proper motion companions, considering
the frequency of such systems among progenitors. We identify only 16 candidates after probing 2938
hot subdwarfs with good astrometry. Out of those, at least six seem to be hierarchical triple systems,
in which the hot subdwarf is part of an inner binary. These results suggest that binary interaction
is always required for the formation of hot subdwarfs.
