One of the most powerful methods used to estimate sky-projected spin-orbit angles of exoplanetary
systems is through a spectroscopic transit observation known as the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)
effect. So far mostly single RM observations have been used to estimate the spin-orbit angle, and
thus there have been no studies regarding the variation of estimated spin-orbit angle from transit
to transit. Stellar activity can alter the shape of photometric transit light curves and in a similar
way they can deform the RM signal. In this paper we discuss several RM observations, obtained using
the HARPS spectrograph, of known transiting planets that all transit extremely active stars, and
by analyzing them individually we assess the variation in the estimated spin-orbit angle. Our results
reveal that the estimated spin-orbit angle can vary significantly (up to 42 degrees) from transit
to transit, due to variation in the configuration of stellar active regions over different nights.
This finding is almost two times larger than the expected variation predicted from simulations.
We could not identify any meaningful correlation between the variation of estimated spin-orbit
angles and the stellar magnetic activity indicators. We also investigated two possible approaches
to mitigate the stellar activity influence on RM observations. The first strategy was based on obtaining
several RM observations and folding them to reduce the stellar activity noise. Our results demonstrated
that this is a feasible and robust way to overcome this issue. The second approach is based on acquiring
simultaneous high-precision short-cadence photometric transit light curves using TRAPPIST/SPECULOOS
telescopes, which provide more information about the stellar active region's properties and allow
a better RM modeling.
