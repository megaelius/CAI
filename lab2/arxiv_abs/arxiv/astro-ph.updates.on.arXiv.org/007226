Prevalent around luminous accreting black holes, thin discs are challenging to resolve in numerical
simulations. When the disc and black hole angular momentum vectors are misaligned, the challenge
becomes extreme, requiring adaptive meshes to follow the disc proper as it moves through the computational
grid. With our new high-performance general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code H-AMR
we have simulated the thinnest accretion disc to date, of aspect ratio $H/R\approx0.03\approx1.7^\circ$
, around a rapidly spinning ($a=0.9375$) black hole, using a cooling function. Initially tilted
at $10^\circ$, the disc warps inside $\sim 5r_g$ into alignment with the black hole, where $r_g$
is the gravitational radius. This is the first demonstration of Bardeen-Petterson alignment in
MHD with viscosity self-consistently generated by magnetized turbulence. The disc develops a
low-density high-viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm eff}\sim1.0$) magnetic-pressure--dominated inner
region at $r\lesssim25r_g$ that rapidly empties itself into the black hole. This inner region may
in reality, due to thermal decoupling of ions and electrons, evaporate into a radiatively inefficient
accretion flow if, as we propose, the cooling time exceeds the accretion time set by the order unity
effective viscosity. We furthermore find the unexpected result that even our very thin disc can
sustain large-scale vertical magnetic flux on the black hole, which launches powerful relativistic
jets that carry $20{-}50\%$ of the accretion power along the angular momentum vector of the outer
tilted disc, providing a potential explanation for the origin of jets in radio-loud quasars.
