Circumstellar disc evolution is paramount for the understanding of planet formation. The GASPS
program aims at determining the circumstellar gas and solid mass around ~250 pre-main-sequence
Herbig Ae and TTauri stars. We aim to understand the origin and nature of the circumstellar matter
orbiting 51 Oph, a young (<1 Myr) luminous B9.5 star. We obtained continuum and line observations
with the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory and continuum data at 1.2 mm with
the IRAM 30m telescope. The SED and line fluxes were modelled using the physico-chemo radiative
transfer code ProDiMo. We detected a strong emission by OI at 63 microns using the Herschel Space
Observatory. The [OI] emission at 145 microns, the [CII] emission at 158 microns, the high-J CO emissions,
and the warm water emissions were not detected. Continuum emission was detected at 1.2 mm. The continuum
from the near- to the far-infrared and the [OI] emission are well explained by the emission from a
compact hydrostatic disc model with a gas mass of 5E-6 MSun, 100 times that of the solid mass. However,
this model fails to match the continuum millimeter flux, which hints at a cold outer disc with a mass
in solids of 1E-6 MSun or free-free emission from a photoevaporative disc wind. This outer disc can
either be devoid of gas and/or is to cold to emit in the [OI] line. A very flat extended disc model (Rout=400
AU) with a fixed vertical structure and dust settling matches all photometric points and most of
the [O I] flux. The observations can be explained by an extended flat disc where dust grains have settled.
However, a flat gas disc cannot be reproduced by hydrostatic disc models. The low mass of the 51 Oph
inner disc in gas and dust may be explained either by the fast dissipation of an initial massive disc
or by a very small initial disc mass.
