High-energy neutrinos from decays of mesons, produced in collisions of cosmic ray particles with
air nuclei, form unavoidable background for detection of astrophysical neutrinos. More precise
calculations of the high-energy neutrino spectrum are required since measurements in the IceCube
experiment reach the intriguing energy region where a contribution of the prompt neutrinos and/or
astrophysical ones should be discovered. Basing on the referent hadronic models QGSJET II-03,
SIBYLL 2.1, we calculate high-energy spectra, both of the muon and electron atmospheric neutrinos,
averaged over zenith-angles. The computation is made using three parameterizations of cosmic
ray spectra which include the knee region. All calculations are compared with the atmospheric neutrino
measurements by Frejus and IceCube. The prompt neutrino flux predictions obtained with thequark-gluon
string model (QGSM) for the charm production by Kaidalov & Piskunova do not contradict to the
IceCube measurements and upper limit on the astrophysical muon neutrino flux. Neutrino flavor
ratio, $\phi_{\nu_ mu}/\phi_{\nu_e}$, extracted from IceCube data decreases in the energy range
$0.1 - 5$ TeV energy contrary to that one might expect from the conventional neutrino flux. Presumable
reasons of such behavior are: i) early arising contribution from decays of charmed particle, differing
from predictions of present models, ii) revealed diffuse flux of astrophysical electron neutrinos.
The likely diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos related to the PeV neutrino events, detected
in the IceCube experiment, leads to a decrease of the flavor ratio at the energy below 10 TeV, that
is in qualitative agreement with a rough approximation for theflavor ratio obtained from the IceCube
data.
