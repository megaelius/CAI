We present the results of a visual search for galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in nearly 7 square
degrees of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The dataset comprises the whole imaging data ever
taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the filter F814W (I-band) up to August 31st, 2011,
i.e. 6.03 square degrees excluding the field of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) which has been
the subject of a separate visual search. In addition, we have searched for lenses in the whole Wide
Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR imaging dataset in all filters (1.01 square degrees) up to the same
date. Our primary goal is to provide a sample of lenses with a broad range of different morphologies
and lens-source brightness contrast in order estimate a lower limit to the number of galaxy-scale
strong lenses in the future Euclid survey in its VIS band. Our criteria to select lenses are purely
morphological as we do not use any colour or redshift information.The final candidate selection
is very conservative hence leading to a nearly pure but incomplete sample. We find 49 new lens candidates:
40 in the ACS images and 9 in the WFC3 images. Out of these, 16 candidates are secure lenses owing to
their striking morphology, 21 more are very good candidates, and 12 more have morphologies compatible
with gravitational lensing but also compatible with other astrophysical objects. It is therefore
insensitive to cosmic variance and allows to estimate the number of galaxy-scale strong lenses
on the sky for a putative survey depth, which is the main result of the present work. Because of the
incompleteness of the sample, the estimated lensing rates should be taken as lower limits. Using
these, we anticipate that a 15 000 square degrees space survey such as Euclid will find at least 60
000 galaxy-scale strong lenses down to a limiting AB magnitude of I = 24.5 (10-sigma) or I = 25.8 (3-sigma).
