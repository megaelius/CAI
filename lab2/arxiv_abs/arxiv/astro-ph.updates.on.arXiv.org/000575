We present the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies from observations
of 10 rich clusters in the Gemini Cluster Astrophysics Spectroscopic Survey (GCLASS) in the redshift
range 0.86<z<1.34. We compare our results with field measurements at similar redshifts
using data from a Ks-band selected catalogue of the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. We construct a Ks-band
selected multi-colour catalogue for the clusters in 10 photometric bands covering u-8um, and estimate
photometric redshifts and stellar masses using SED fitting techniques. To correct for interlopers
in our cluster sample, we use the deep spectroscopic component of GCLASS, which contains spectra
for 1282 identified cluster and field galaxies taken with Gemini/GMOS. Both the photometric and
spectroscopic samples are sufficiently deep that we can probe the SMF down to masses of 10^10 Msun.
We distinguish between star-forming and quiescent galaxies using the rest-frame U-V versus V-J
diagram, and find that the best-fitting Schechter parameters alpha and M* are similar within the
uncertainties for these galaxy types within the different environments. However, there is a significant
difference in the shape and normalisation of the total SMF between the clusters and the field sample.
This difference in the total SMF is primarily a reflection of the increased fraction of quiescent
galaxies in high-density environments. We apply a simple quenching model that includes components
of mass- and environment-driven quenching, and find that in this picture 44% of the star-forming
galaxies, which normally would be forming stars in the field, are quenched by the cluster. If galaxies
in clusters and the field quench their star formation via different mechanisms, these processes
have to conspire in such a way that the shapes of the quiescent and star-forming SMF remain similar
in these different environments.
