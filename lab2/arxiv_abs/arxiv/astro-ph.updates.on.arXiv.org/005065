We explore the kinematics of ionized gas via the [O III] $\lambda$5007 emission lines in active galactic
nuclei (AGN) selected on the basis of their mid-infrared (IR) emission, and split into obscured
and unobscured populations based on their optical-IR colors. After correcting for differences
in redshift distributions, we provide composite spectra of spectroscopically and photometrically
defined obscured/Type 2 and unobscured/Type 1 AGN from 3500 to 7000 \AA. The IR-selected obscured
sources contain a mixture of narrow-lined Type 2 AGN and intermediate sources that have broad H$\alpha$
emission and significantly narrower H$\beta$. Using both [OIII] luminosities and AGN luminosities
derived from optical-IR spectral energy distribution fitting, we find evidence for enhanced large-scale
obscuration in the obscured sources. In matched bins of luminosity we find that the obscured population
typically has broader, more blueshifted \OIII\ emission than in the unobscured sample, suggestive
of more powerful AGN-driven outflows. This trend is not seen in spectroscopically classified samples,
and is unlikely to be entirely explained by orientation effects. In addition, outflow velocities
increase from small to moderate AGN $E(B-V)$ values, before flattening out (as traced by FWHM) and
even decreasing (as traced by blueshift). While difficult to fully interpret in a single physical
model, due to both the averaging over populations and the spatially-averaged spectra, these results
agree with previous findings that simple geometric unification models are insufficient for the
IR-selected AGN population, and may fit into an evolutionary model for obscured and unobscured
AGN.
