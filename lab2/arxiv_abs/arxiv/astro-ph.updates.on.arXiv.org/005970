Mass and specific angular momentum are two fundamental physical parameters of galaxies. We present
measurements of the baryonic mass and specific angular momentum of 11 void dwarf galaxies derived
from neutral hydrogen (H{\sc i}) synthesis data. Rotation curves were measured using 3D and 2D tilted
ring fitting routines, and the derived curves generally overlap within the error bars, except in
the central regions where, as expected, the 3D routines give steeper curves. The specific angular
momentum of void dwarfs is found to be high compared to an extrapolation of the trends seen for higher
mass bulge-less spirals, but comparable to that of other dwarf irregular galaxies that lie outside
of voids. As such, our data show no evidence for a dependence of the specific angular momentum on the
large scale environment. Combining our data with the data from the literature, we find a baryonic
threshold of $\sim 10^{9.1}~M_{\odot}$ for this increase in specific angular momentum. Interestingly,
this threshold is very similar to the mass threshold below which the galaxy discs start to become
systematically thicker. This provides qualitative support to the suggestion that the thickening
of the discs, as well as the increase in specific angular momentum, are both results of a common physical
mechanism, such as feedback from star formation. Quantitatively, however, the amount of star formation
observed in our dwarfs appears insufficient to produce the observed increase in specific angular
momentum. It is hence likely that other processes, such as cold accretion of high angular momentum
gas, also play a role in increasing the specific angular momentum.
