We investigate a conceptual modification of the halo occupation distribution approach, using
the halos' present-day maximal circular velocity, $\vmax$, as an alternative to halo mass. In particular,
using a semi-analytic galaxy formation model applied to the Millennium WMAP7 simulation, we explore
the extent that switching to $\vmax$ as the primary halo property incorporates the effects of assembly
bias into the formalism. We consider fixed number density galaxy samples ranked by stellar mass
and examine the variations in the halo occupation functions with either halo concentration or formation
time. We find that using $\vmax$ results in a significant reduction in the occupancy variation of
the central galaxies, particularly for concentration. The satellites occupancy variation on
the other hand increases in all cases. We find effectively no change in the halo clustering dependence
on concentration, for fixed bins of $\vmax$ compared to fixed halo mass. Most crucially, we calculate
the impact of assembly bias on galaxy clustering by comparing the amplitude of clustering to that
of a shuffled galaxy sample, finding that the level of galaxy assembly bias remains largely unchanged.
Our results suggest that while using $\vmax$ as a proxy for halo mass diminishes some of occupancy
variations exhibited in the galaxy-halo relation, it is not able to encapsulate the effects of assembly
bias potentially present in galaxy clustering. The use of other more complex halo properties, such
as $\vpeak$, the peak value of $\vmax$ over the assembly history, provides some improvement and
warrants further investigation.
