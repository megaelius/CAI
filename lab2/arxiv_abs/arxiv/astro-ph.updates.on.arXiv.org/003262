In the coming years, it is likely that the first potentially Earth-like planets will be discovered
orbiting other stars. Once found, the characterisation of those planets will play a vital role in
determining which will be chosen as the first targets for the search for life beyond the Solar System.
We must thus be able to gauge the relative importance of the various factors proposed to influence
potential planetary habitability, in order to best focus that search. One of the plethora of factors
to be considered in that process is the climatic variability of the exo-Earths in question. In the
Solar System, the Earth's long-term climate is driven by several factors, including the modifying
influence of life on our atmosphere, and the temporal evolution of solar luminosity. The gravitational
influence of the other planets in the Solar System adds an extra complication, driving the Milankovitch
cycles that are thought to have caused the on-going series of glacial and interglacial periods that
have dominated Earth's climate for the past few million years. Here we present preliminary results
of three suites of integrations that together examine the influence of Solar System architecture
on the Earth's Milankovitch cycles. We consider separately the influence of the planets Jupiter,
Mars and Venus, each of which contributes to the forcing of Earth's orbital evolution. Our results
illustrate how small changes to the architecture of a given planetary system can result in marked
changes in the potential habitability of the planets therein, and are an important first step in
developing a means by which the nature of climate variability on planets beyond our Solar System
can be characterised.
