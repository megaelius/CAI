We perform full spectrum fitting stellar population analysis and Jeans Anisotropic modelling
(JAM) of the stellar kinematics for about 2000 early-type galaxies (ETGs) and spiral galaxies from
the MaNGA DR14 sample. Galaxies with different morphologies are found to be located on a remarkably
tight mass plane which is close to the prediction of the virial theorem, extending previous results
for ETGs. By examining an inclined projection (`the mass-size' plane), we find that spiral and early-type
galaxies occupy different regions on the plane, and their stellar population properties (i.e.
age, metallicity and stellar mass-to-light ratio) vary systematically along roughly the direction
of velocity dispersion, which is a proxy for the bulge fraction. Galaxies with higher velocity dispersions
have typically older ages, larger stellar mass-to-light ratios and are more metal rich, which indicates
that galaxies increase their bulge fractions as their stellar populations age and become enriched
chemically. The age and stellar mass-to-light ratio gradients for low-mass galaxies in our sample
tend to be positive ($\rm centre<outer$), while the gradients for most massive galaxies are negative.
The metallicity gradients show a clear peak around velocity dispersion $\log_{10} \sigma_{\rm
e}\approx 2.0$, which corresponds to the critical mass $\sim 3\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$ of the
break in the mass-size relation. Spiral galaxies with large mass and size have the steepest gradients,
while the most massive ETGs, especially above the critical mass $M_{\rm crit}\ge 2\times 10^{11}
M_{\odot}$, where slow rotator ETGs start dominating, have much flatter gradients. This may be
due to differences in their evolution histories, e.g. mergers.
