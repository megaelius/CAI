The lower solar atmosphere is an intrinsically multi-component and collisional environment with
electron and proton collision frequencies in the range $10^{8}-10^{10}$ Hz, which may be considerably
higher than the gyro-frequencies for both species. We aim to provide a reliable quantitative set
of data for collision frequencies, magnetization, viscosity, and thermal conductivity for the
most important species in the lower solar atmosphere. Having such data at hand is essential for any
modeling that is aimed at describing realistic properties of the considered environment. We describe
the altitude dependence of the parameters and the different physics of collisions between charged
species, and between charged and neutrals species. Regions of dominance of each type of collisions
are clearly identified. We determine the layers within which either electrons or ions or both are
unmagnetized. Protons are shown to be un-magnetized in the lower atmosphere in a layer that is at
least 1000 km thick even for a kilo-Gauss magnetic field that decreases exponentially with altitude.
In these layers the dynamics of charged species cannot be affected by the magnetic field, and this
fact is used in our modeling. Viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients are calculated for
layers where ions are unmagnetized. We compare viscosity and friction and determine the regions
of dominance of each of the phenomena. We provide the most reliable quantitative values for most
important parameters in the lower solar atmosphere to be used in analytical modeling and numerical
simulations of various phenomena such as waves, transport and magnetization of particles, and
the triggering mechanism of coronal mass ejections.
