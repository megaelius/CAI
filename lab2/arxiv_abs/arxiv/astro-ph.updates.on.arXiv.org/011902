The orbital eccentricities of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarf companions provide clues
about their formation and dynamical histories. We combine new high-contrast imaging observations
of substellar companions obtained primarily with Keck/NIRC2 together with astrometry from the
literature to test for differences in the population-level eccentricity distributions of 27 long-period
giant planets and brown dwarf companions between 5-100 AU using hierarchical Bayesian modeling.
Orbit fits are performed in a uniform manner for companions with short orbital arcs; this typically
results in broad constraints for individual eccentricity distributions, but together as an ensemble
these systems provide valuable insight into their collective underlying orbital patterns. The
shape of the eccentricity distribution function for our full sample of substellar companions is
approximately flat from e=0-1. When subdivided by companion mass and mass ratio, the underlying
distributions for giant planets and brown dwarfs show significant differences. Low mass ratio
companions preferentially have low eccentricities, similar to the orbital properties of warm
Jupiters found with radial velocities and transits. We interpret this as evidence for in situ formation
on largely undisturbed orbits within massive, extended disks. Brown dwarf companions exhibit
a broad peak at e $\approx$ 0.6-0.9 with evidence for a dependence on orbital period. This closely
resembles the orbital properties and period-eccentricity trends of wide (1-200 AU) stellar binaries,
suggesting that brown dwarfs in this separation range predominantly form in a similar fashion.
We also report evidence that the "eccentricity dichotomy" observed at small separations extends
to planets on wide orbits: the mean eccentricity for the multi-planet system HR 8799 is lower than
for systems with single planets. (Abridged)
