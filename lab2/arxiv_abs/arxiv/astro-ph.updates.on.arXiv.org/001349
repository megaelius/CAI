We present a multi-wavelength study of the interstellar medium in eight nearby, X-ray and optically
bright, giant elliptical galaxies. Using Herschel PACS, we map the cold gas in the lines of [CII],
[OI], and [OIb]. Additionally, we present Ha+[NII] imaging of warm ionized gas with the SOAR telescope,
and a study of the hot X-ray emitting plasma with Chandra. All systems with extended Ha emission in
our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [CII] line emission indicating the presence of cold
gas. This emission is co-spatial with the Ha+[NII] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy X-ray
emitting plasma. The entropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, with
the systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropies beyond r~1 kpc than
the cold-gas-poor systems. We show that while the hot atmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies
are thermally stable outside of their innermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems
are prone to cooling instabilities. This result indicates that the cold gas is produced chiefly
by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. We show that cooling instabilities may develop
more easily in rotating systems and discuss an alternative condition for thermal instability for
this case. The hot atmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicating
that the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result in variable power output
of the AGN jets, potentially triggering sporadic, larger outbursts. In the two cold-gas-poor,
X-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies of our sample, NGC 1399 and NGC 4472, powerful AGN outbursts
may have destroyed or removed most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate and
deposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hot galactic atmospheres
and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.
