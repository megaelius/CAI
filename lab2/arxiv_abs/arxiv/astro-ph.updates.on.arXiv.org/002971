In earlier work, we have developed a Kinetic Field Theory (KFT) for cosmological structure formation
and showed that the non-linear density-fluctuation power spectrum known from numerical simulations
can be reproduced quite well even if particle interactions are taken into account to first order
only. Besides approximating gravitational interactions, we had to truncate the initial correlation
hierarchy of particle momenta at the second order. Here, we substantially simplify KFT. We show
that its central object, the free generating functional, can be factorized, taking the full hierarchy
of momentum correlations into account. The factors appearing in the generating functional, which
we identify as non-linearly evolved density-fluctuation power spectra, have a universal form
and can thus be tabulated for fast access in perturbation schemes. In this paper, we focus on a complete
evaluation of the free generating functional of KFT, not including particle interactions yet.
This implies that the non-linearly evolved power spectra contain a damping term which reflects
that structures are being wiped out at late times by free streaming. Once particle interactions
will be taken into account, they will compensate this damping. If we suppress this damping in a way
suggested by the fluctuation-dissipation relations of KFT, our results show that the complete
hierarchy of initial momentum correlations is responsible for a large part of the characteristic
non-linear deformation and the mode transport in the density-fluctuation power spectrum. Without
any adjustable parameters, KFT accurately reproduces the scale at which non-linear evolution
sets in. Finally, we further develop perturbation theory based on the factorization of the generating
functional and propose a diagrammatic scheme for the perturbation terms.
