We propose a new observing method for single-dish millimeter and submillimeter spectroscopy using
a heterodyne receiver equipped with a frequency-modulating local oscillator (FMLO). Unlike conventional
switching methods, which extract astronomical signals by subtracting the reference spectra of
off-sources from those of on-sources, the FMLO method does not need to obtain any off-source spectra;
rather, it estimates them from the on-source spectra themselves. The principle is a high dump-rate
(10 Hz) spectroscopy with radio frequency modulation (FM) achieved by fast sweeping of a local oscillator
(LO) of a heterodyne receiver: Because sky emission (i.e., off-source) fluctuates as $1/f$-type
and is spectrally correlated, it can be estimated and subtracted from time-series spectra (a timestream)
by principal component analysis. Meanwhile astronomical signals remain in the timestream since
they are modulated to a higher time-frequency domain. The FMLO method therefore achieves (1) a remarkably
high observation efficiency, (2) reduced spectral baseline wiggles, and (3) software-based sideband
separation. We developed an FMLO system for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and a data reduction procedure
for it. Frequency modulation was realized by a tunable and programmable first local oscillator.
With observations of Galactic sources, we demonstrate that the observation efficiency of the FMLO
method is dramatically improved compared to conventional switching methods. Specifically, we
find that the time to achieve the same noise level is reduced by a factor of 3.0 in single-pointed observations
and by a factor of 1.2 in mapping observations. The FMLO method can be applied to observations of fainter
($\sim$mK) spectral lines and larger ($\sim$deg$^{2}$) mapping. It would offer much more efficient
and baseline-stable observations compared to conventional switching methods.
