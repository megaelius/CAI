We present a numerical code for radiation hydrodynamics designed as a module for the freely available
PLUTO code. We adopt a gray approximation and include radiative transfer following a two-moment
approach by imposing the M1 closure to the radiation fields. This closure allows for a description
of radiative transport in both the diffusion and free-streaming limits, and is able to describe
highly anisotropic radiation transport as can be expected in the vicinity of an accreting planet
in a protoplanetary disk. To reduce the computational cost caused by the timescale disparity between
radiation and matter fields, we integrate their evolution equations separately in an operator-split
way, using substepping to evolve the radiation equations. We further increase the code's efficiency
by adopting the reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA). Our integration scheme for the evolution
equations of radiation fields relies on implicit-explicit schemes, in which radiation-matter
interaction terms are integrated implicitly while fluxes are integrated via Godunov-type solvers.
The module is suitable for general astrophysical computations in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions in Cartesian,
spherical and cylindrical coordinates, and can be implemented on rotating frames. We demonstrate
the algorithm performance on different numerical benchmarks, paying particular attention to
the applicability of the RSLA for computations of physical processes in protoplanetary disks.
We show 2D simulations of vertical convection in disks and 3D simulations of gas accretion by planetary
cores, which are the first of their kind to be solved with a two-moment approach.
