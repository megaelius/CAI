We consider the impact of stochastic perturbations on otherwise coherent oscillations of classical
pulsators. The resulting dynamics are modelled by a driven damped harmonic oscillator subject
to either an external or an internal forcing and white noise velocity fluctuations. We characterize
the phase and relative amplitude variations using analytical and numerical tools. When the forcing
is internal the phase variation displays a random walk behaviour and a red noise power spectrum with
a ragged erratic appearance. We determine the dependence of the root mean square phase and relative
amplitude variations ($\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ and $\sigma_{\Delta A/A}$, respectively)
on the amplitude of the stochastic perturbations, the damping constant $\eta$, and the total observation
time $t_{\rm obs}$ for this case, under the assumption that the relative amplitude variations remain
small, showing that $\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ increases with $t_{\rm obs}^{1/2}$ becoming much
larger than $\sigma_{\Delta A/A}$ for $t_{\rm obs} \gg \eta^{-1}$. In the case of an external forcing
the phase and relative amplitude variations remain of the same order, independent of the observing
time. In the case of an internal forcing, we find that $\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ does not depend
on $\eta$. Hence, the damping time cannot be inferred from fitting the power of the signal, as done
for solar-like pulsators, but the amplitude of the stochastic perturbations may be constrained
from the observations. Our results imply that, given sufficient time, the variation of the phase
associated to the stochastic perturbations in internally driven classical pulsators will become
sufficiently large to be probed observationally.
