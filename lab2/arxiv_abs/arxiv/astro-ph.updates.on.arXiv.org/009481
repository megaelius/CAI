The electrostatic waves with the frequencies close to the upper-hybrid frequency (the upper-hybrid
band) are important for the generation of solar radio zebras. Considering the plasma composed from
the thermal background plasma and hot and rare plasma component in the form of the Dory-Guest-Harris
distribution, we study the growth rates of the electrostatic waves in the upper-hybrid band. We
use both analytical and numerical methods. Varying the ratio of the electron-plasma and electron-cyclotron
frequencies $\omega_\mathrm{pe}/\omega_\mathrm{ce}$ in the range of 4.0-5.3 and using analytical
expressions we compute the growth rates $\gamma$ and dispersion branches of the electrostatic
waves in the $\omega - k_\perp$ domain. In real plasma, the instabilities of waves with different
dispersion branches can start simultaneously; therefore we define and compute the integrated
growth rate $\Gamma$. For maximal and minimal $\Gamma$ we how locations of the growth rates $\gamma$
and dispersion branches in the $\omega - k_\perp$ domain. We find that $\Gamma$ has a maximum when
the dispersion branches not only cross the region with high growth rates $\gamma$ but when the dispersion
branches in this region are sufficiently long and wide. Around the value of $\omega_\mathrm{pe}/\omega_\mathrm{ce}$
= 4.95, we recognize an exciting interchange of dispersion branches, where it is difficult to distinguish
types of waves. We also analyze the effects of changes in the background plasma and hot component
temperatures. Then in the same range of $\omega_\mathrm{pe}/\omega_\mathrm{ce}$ we compute
the growth rate of the electrostatic waves (which is naturally the integrated growth rate $\Gamma$)
using a 3-dimensional Particle-in-Cell model. Finally, we compare both analytical and numerical
results.
