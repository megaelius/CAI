We have computed models of rotating relativistic stars with a toroidal magnetic field and investigated
the combined effects of magnetic field and rotation on the apparent shape (i.e. the surface deformation),
which could be relevant for the electromagnetic emission, and on the internal matter distribution
(i.e. the quadrupole distortion), which could be relevant for the emission of gravitational waves.
Using a sample of eight different cold nuclear physics equations of state, we have computed models
of maximum field strength, as well as the distortion coefficients for the surface and the quadrupolar
deformations. Surprisingly, we find that non-rotating models admit arbitrary levels of magnetization,
accompanied by a growth of size and quadrupole distortion to which we could not find a limit. Rotating
models, on the other hand, are subject to a mass-shedding limit at frequencies well below the corresponding
ones for unmagnetized stars. Overall, the space of solutions can be split into three distinct classes
for which the surface deformation and the quadrupole distortion are either prolate and prolate,
oblate and prolate, or oblate and oblate, respectively. We also derive a simple formula expressing
the relativistic distortion coefficients, which allows one to compute the surface deformation
and the quadrupole distortion up to significant levels of rotation and magnetization, essentially
covering all known magnetars. Such a formula replaces Newtonian equivalent expressions that overestimate
the magnetic quadrupole distortion by about a factor of 6 and are inadequate for strongly relativistic
objects like neutron stars.
