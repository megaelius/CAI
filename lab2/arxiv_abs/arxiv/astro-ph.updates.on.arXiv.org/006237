We present a multi-wavelength spectral and temporal investigation of OJ 287 emission during its
strong optical-to-X-ray activity between July 2016 - July 2017. The daily $\gamma$-ray fluxes
from \emph{Fermi}-LAT are consistent with no variability. The strong optical-to-X-ray variability
is accompanied by a change in power-law spectral index of the X-ray spectrum from $< 2$ to $>2$, with
variations often associated with changes in optical polarization properties. Cross-correlations
between optical-to-X-ray emission during four continuous segments show simultaneous optical-ultraviolet
(UV) variations while the X-ray and UV/optical are simultaneous only during the middle two segments.
In the first segment, the results suggest X-rays lag the optical/UV, while in the last segment X-rays
lead by $\sim$ 5-6 days. The last segment also shows a systematic trend with variations appearing
first at higher energies followed by lower energy ones. The LAT spectrum before the VHE activity
is similar to preceding quiescent state spectrum while it hardens during VHE activity period and
is consistent with the extrapolated VHE spectrum during the latter. Overall, the broadband spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) during high activity periods are a combination of a typical OJ 287 SED
and an HBL SED, and can be explained in a two-zone leptonic model, with the second zone located at parsec
scales, beyond the broad line region, being responsible for the HBL-like spectrum. The change of
polarization properties from systematic to chaotic and back to systematic, before, during and
after the VHE activity, suggest dynamic roles for magnetic fields and turbulence.
