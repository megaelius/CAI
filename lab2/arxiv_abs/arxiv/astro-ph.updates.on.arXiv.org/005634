We demonstrate that the `smoke' of limited instrumental sensitivity smears out structure in gamma-ray
burst (GRB) pulse light curves, giving each a triple-peaked appearance at moderate signal-to-noise
and a simple monotonic appearance at low signal-to-noise. We avoid this effect by studying six very
bright GRB pulses, discovering surprisingly that each exhibits $\textit{complex time-reversible}$
wavelike residual structures. These `mirrored' wavelike structures can have large amplitudes,
occur on short timescales, and begin/end long before/after the onset of the monotonic pulse component.
We demonstrate that pulse spectra generally evolve from hard to soft, re-hardening at the time of
each structural peak. Among other insights, these observations help explain the existence of negative
pulse spectral lags, and allow us to conclude that GRB pulses are relatively infrequent, more complex,
and have longer durations than previously thought. Because structured emission mechanisms that
can operate forwards and backwards in time seem unlikely, we look to $\textit{kinematic}$ behaviors
to explain the time-reversed light curve structures. We conclude that each GRB pulse involves a
single impactor interacting with an independent medium. Either the material is distributed in
a bilaterally symmetric fashion, the impactor is structured in a bilaterally symmetric fashion,
or the impactor's motion is reversed such that is returns along its original path of motion. The wavelike
structure of the time-reversible component suggests that radiation is being both produced and
absorbed dramatically, periodically, and abruptly from the monotonic component; these characteristics
are consistent with charged particle motion in the polarizing presence of strong magnetic fields.
