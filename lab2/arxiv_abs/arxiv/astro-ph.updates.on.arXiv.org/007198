Submillimeter emission lines of carbon monoxide (CO) in Titan's atmosphere provide excellent
probes of atmospheric temperature due to the molecule's long chemical lifetime and stable, well
constrained volume mixing ratio. Here we present the analysis of 4 datasets obtained with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) from 2012 to 2015 that contain strong CO rotational
transitions. Utilizing ALMA's high spatial resolution in the 2012, 2014, and 2015 observations,
we extract spectra from 3 separate regions on Titan's disk using datasets with beam sizes of ~0.3''.
Temperature profiles retrieved by the NEMESIS radiative transfer code are compared to Cassini
Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) and radio occultation science results from similar latitude
regions. Small seasonal variations in atmospheric temperature are present from 2012 to 2015 in
the stratosphere and mesosphere (~100-500 km) of spatially resolved regions. We measure the stratopause
(320 km) to increase in temperature by 5 K in northern latitudes from 2012-2015, while temperatures
rise throughout the stratosphere at lower latitudes. While retrieved temperature profiles cover
a range of latitudes in these observations, deviations from CIRS nadir maps and radio occultation
measurements convolved with the ALMA beam-footprint are not found to be statistically significant,
and discrepancies are often found to be less than 5 K throughout the atmosphere. ALMA's excellent
sensitivity in the lower stratosphere (60-300 km) provides a highly complementary dataset to contemporary
CIRS and radio science observations. The demonstrated utility of CO emission lines in the submillimeter
as a tracer of Titan's atmospheric temperature lays the groundwork for future studies of other molecular
species, as temperature profiles are found to consistently vary with latitude in all three years
by up to 15 K.
