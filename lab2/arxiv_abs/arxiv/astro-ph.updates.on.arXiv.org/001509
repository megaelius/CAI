FU Orionis stars (FUORS) are eruptive pre-main sequence objects thought to represent quasi-periodic
or recurring stages of enhanced accretion during the low-mass star-forming process. We characterize
the sample of known and candidate FUORS in an homogeneous and consistent way, deriving stellar and
circumstellar parameters for each object. We emphasize the analysis in those parameters that are
supposed to vary during the FUORS stage. We modeled the SEDs of 24 of the 26 currently known FUORS,
using the radiative transfer code of Whitney et al (2003b). We compare our models with those obtained
by Robitaille et al. (2007) for Taurus class II and I sources in quiescence periods, by calculating
the cumulative distribution of the different parameters. FUORS have more massive disks: we find
that $\sim80\%$ of the disks in FUORS are more massive than any Taurus class II and I sources in the
sample. Median values for the disk mass accretion rates are ~ 1.e-7 Msun/yr vs ~ 1.e-5 Msun/yr for
standard YSOs (young stellar objects) and FUORS, respectively. While the distributions of envelope
mass accretion rates for class I FUORS and for standard class I objects are similar, FUORS, on average,
have higher envelope mass accretion rates than standard class II and class I sources. Most FUORS
(~ 70%) have envelope mass accretion rates above 1.e-7 Msun/yr. In contrast, 60% of the classical
YSO sample have accretion rates below this value. Our results support the current scenario in which
changes experimented by the circumstellar disk explain the observed properties of these stars.
However, the increase in the disk mass accretion rate is smaller than theoretically predicte (Frank
et al. 1992; Hartmann & Kenyon 1996), though in good agreement with previous determinations.
