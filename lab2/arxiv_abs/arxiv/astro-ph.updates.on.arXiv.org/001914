Context: We investigated the molecular gas associated with 6.7 GHz methanol masers throughout
the Galaxy using a J=1-0 transition of the CO isotopologues. Methods:Using the 13.7-meter telescope
at the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), we have obtained ^{12}CO and ^{13}CO (1-0) lines for 160
methanol masers sources from the first to the third Galactic quadrants. We made efforts to resolve
the distance ambiguity by careful comparison with the radio continuum and HI 21 cm observations.
Results: First, the maser sources show increased ^{13}CO line widths toward the Galactic center,
suggesting that the molecular gas are more turbulent toward the Galactic center. This trend can
be noticeably traced by the ^{13}CO line width. Second, the ^{12}CO excitation temperature shows
a noticeable correlation with the H_2 column density. A possible explanation consistent with the
collapse model is that the higher surface-density gas is more efficient to the stellar heating and/or
has a higher formation rate of high-mass stars. Third, comparing the IRDCs, the maser sources on
average have significantly lower H_2 column densities, moderately higher temperatures, and similar
line widths. Fourth, in the mapped regions, 51 ^{13}CO cores have been revealed. Only 17 coincide
with the radio continuum emission (F_{cm}>6 mJy), while a larger fraction (30 cores) coincide
with the infrared emissions. The IR-bright and radio-bright sources exhibit significantly higher
$^{12}$CO excitation temperatures than the IR-faint and radio-faint sources, respectively.
Conclusions: The 6.7 GHz masers show a moderately low ionization rate but have a common-existing
stellar heating that generates the IR emissions. The relevant properties can be characterized
by the ^{12}CO and ^{13}CO (1-0) emissions in several aspects as described above.
