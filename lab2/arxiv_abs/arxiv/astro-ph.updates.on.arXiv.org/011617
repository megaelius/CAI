Key to any cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis is the separation of the CMB from foreground
contaminants. In this paper we present a novel implementation of Bayesian CMB component separation.
We sample from the full posterior distribution using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a gradient based
sampling algorithm. Alongside this, we introduce new foreground modelling approaches. We use
the mean-shift algorithm to define regions on the sky, clustering according to naively estimated
foreground spectral parameters. Over these regions we adopt a complete pooling model, where we
assume constant spectral parameters, and a hierarchical model, where we model individual spectral
parameters as being drawn from underlying hyper-distributions. We validate the algorithm against
simulations of the LiteBIRD and C-BASS experiments, with an input tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r=5\times
10^{-3}$. Considering multipoles $32\leq\ell\leq 121$, we are able to recover estimates for $r$.
With LiteBIRD only observations, and using the complete pooling model, we recover $r=(10\pm 0.6)\times
10^{-3}$. For C-BASS and LiteBIRD observations we find $r=(7.0\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-3}$ using the
complete pooling model, and $r=(5.0\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-3}$ using the hierarchical model. By adopting
the hierarchical model we are able to eliminate biases in our cosmological parameter estimation,
and obtain lower uncertainties due to the smaller Galactic emission mask that can be adopted for
power spectrum estimation. Measured by the rate of effective sample generation, NUTS offers performance
improvements of $\sim10^3$ over using Metropolis-Hastings to fit the complete pooling model.
The efficiency of NUTS allows us to fit the more sophisticated hierarchical foreground model, that
would likely be intractable with non-gradient based sampling algorithms.
