Previously, we showed that surface density profiles of the form of a power-law times a Sersic function
satisfy the hydrostatic Jeans equations, a variety of observational constraints, and the condition
of a minimal radial entropy profile in two-dimensional galaxy discs with fixed power-law, halo
potentials. It was assumed that such density profiles are generated by star scattering by clumps,
waves, or other inhomogeneities. Here we generalize these models to self-gravitating discs. The
cylindrically symmetric Poisson equation imposes strong constraints. Scattering processes
favor smoothness, so the smoothest solutions, which minimize entropy gradients, are preferred.
In the case of self-gravitating discs (e.g., inner discs), the gravity, surface density and radial
velocity dispersion in these smoothest models are all of the form 1/r times an exponential. When
vertical balance is included, the vertical velocity dispersion squared has the same form as the
surface density, and the scale height is constant. In combined self-gravitating plus halo gravity
cases, the radial dispersion has an additional power-law term. Nonetheless, the surface density
profile has the same form at all radii, without breaks, satisfying the disc-halo conspiracy. The
azimuthal velocity and velocity dispersions are smooth, though the former can have a distinct peak.
In these models the vertical dispersion increases inwards, and scattering may mediate a transition
to a secular bulge. If halo gravity dominates vertically in the outer disc, it flares. The models
suggest a correlation between disc mass and radial scale length. The combination of smoothness,
simplicity, ability to match generic observational features and physical constraints is unique
to these models.
