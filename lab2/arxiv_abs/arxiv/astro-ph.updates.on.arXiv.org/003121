The main aim of this work is to determine the solar differential rotation by tracing sunspot groups
during the period 1964-2016, using the Kanzelh{\"o}he Observatory for Solar and Environmental
Research (KSO) sunspot drawings and white light images. Two procedures for the determination of
the heliographic positions were applied: an interactive procedure on the KSO sunspot drawings
(1964 - 2008, solar cycles nos. 20 - 23) and an automatic procedure on the KSO white light images (2009
- 2016, solar cycle no. 24). For the determination of the synodic angular rotation velocities two
different methods have been used: a daily shift (DS) method and a robust linear least-squares fit
(rLSQ) method. Afterwards, the rotation velocities had to be converted from synodic to sidereal,
which were then used in the least-squares fitting for the solar differential rotation law. For the
test data from 2014, we found the rLSQ method for calculating rotational velocities to be more reliable
than the DS method. The best fit solar differential rotation profile for the whole time period is
$\omega(b)$ = (14.47 $\pm$ 0.01) - (2.66 $\pm$ 0.10) $\sin^2b$ (deg/day) for the DS method and $\omega(b)$
= (14.50 $\pm$ 0.01) - (2.87 $\pm$ 0.12) $\sin^2b$ (deg/day) for the rLSQ method. A barely noticeable
north - south asymmetry is observed for the whole time period 1964 - 2016 in the present paper. Rotation
profiles, using different data sets (e.g. Debrecen Photoheliographic Data, Greenwich Photoheliographic
Results), presented by other authors for the same time periods and the same tracer types, are in good
agreement with our results. Therefore, the KSO data set is suitable for the investigation of the
long-term variabilities in the solar rotation profile.
