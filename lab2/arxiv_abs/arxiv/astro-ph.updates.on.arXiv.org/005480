Asteroseismic forward modelling techniques are being used to determine fundamental properties
(e.g. mass, radius, and age) of solar-type stars. The need to take into account all possible sources
of error is of paramount importance towards a robust determination of stellar properties. We present
a study of 34 solar-type stars for which high signal-to-noise asteroseismic data is available from
multi-year Kepler photometry. We explore the internal systematics on the stellar properties,
that is, associated with the uncertainty in the input physics used to construct the stellar models.
In particular, we explore the systematics arising from: (i) the inclusion of the diffusion of helium
and heavy elements; and (ii) the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture. We also assess the systematics
arising from (iii) different surface correction methods used in optimisation/fitting procedures.
The systematics arising from comparing results of models with and without diffusion are found to
be 0.5%, 0.8%, 2.1%, and 16% in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. The internal systematics
in age are significantly larger than the statistical uncertainties. We find the internal systematics
resulting from the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture to be 0.7% in mean density, 0.5% in radius,
1.4% in mass, and 6.7% in age. The surface correction method by Sonoi et al. and Ball & Gizon's two-term
correction produce the lowest internal systematics among the different correction methods, namely,
~1%, ~1%, ~2%, and ~8% in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. Stellar masses obtained
using the surface correction methods by Kjeldsen et al. and Ball & Gizon's one-term correction are
systematically higher than those obtained using frequency ratios.
