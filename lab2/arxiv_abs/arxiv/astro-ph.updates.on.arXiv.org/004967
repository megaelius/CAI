Galaxies evolve via a complex interaction of numerous different physical processes, scales and
components. In spite of this, overall trends often appear. Simplified models for galaxy histories
can be used to search for and capture such emergent trends, and thus to interpret and compare results
of galaxy formation models to each other and to nature. Here, two approximations are applied to galaxy
integrated star formation rate histories, drawn from a semi-analytic model grafted onto a dark
matter simulation. Both a lognormal functional form and principal component analysis (PCA) approximate
the integrated star formation rate histories fairly well. Machine learning, based upon simplified
galaxy halo histories, is somewhat successful at recovering both fits. The fits to the histories
give fixed time star formation rates which have notable scatter from their true fixed time rates
at final time, especially for quiescent and "green valley" galaxies, and more so for the PCA fit.
For classifying galaxies into subfamilies sharing similar integrated histories, both approximations
are better than using final stellar mass or specific star formation rate. Several subsamples from
the simulation illustrate how these simple parameterizations can provide points of contact for
comparisons between different galaxy formation samples, or more generally, models. As a side result,
the halo masses of simulated galaxies with early peak star formation rate (according to the lognormal
fit) lie on one of two tracks. The small fraction of galaxies with a lower halo mass at peak star formation
rate appear to stall in their halo growth, even though they are central in their host halos.
