We derive the UV-optical stellar dust attenuation curve of galaxies at z=1.4-2.6 as a function of
gas-phase metallicity. We use a sample of 218 star-forming galaxies, excluding those with very
young or heavily obscured star formation, from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey
with H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, and [NII]$\lambda 6585$ spectroscopic measurements. We constrain
the shape of the attenuation curve by comparing the average flux densities of galaxies sorted into
bins of dust obscuration using Balmer decrements, i.e., H$\alpha$-to-H$\beta$ luminosities.
The average attenuation curve for the high-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H)>8.5, corresponding
to $M_*\gtrsim10^{10.4}\,M_{\odot}$) has a shallow slope, identical to that of the Calzetti local
starburst curve, and a significant UV 2175A extinction bump that is $\sim 0.5\times$ the strength
of the Milky Way bump. On the other hand, the average attenuation curve of the low-metallicity sample
(12+log(O/H) $\sim 8.2-8.5$) has a steeper slope similar to that of the SMC curve, only consistent
with the Calzetti slope at the $3\sigma$ level. The UV bump is not detected in the low-metallicity
curve, indicating the relative lack of the small dust grains causing the bump at low metallicities.
Furthermore, we find that on average the nebular reddening (E(B-V)) is a factor of 2 times larger
than that of the stellar continuum for galaxies with low metallicities, while the nebular and stellar
reddening are similar for galaxies with higher metallicities. The latter is likely due to a high
surface density of dusty clouds embedding the star forming regions but also reddening the continuum
in the high-metallicity galaxies.
