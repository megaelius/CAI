DZ Cha is a weak-lined T Tauri star (WTTS) surrounded by a bright protoplanetary disc with evidence
of inner disc clearing. Its narrow $\Ha$ line and infrared spectral energy distribution suggest
that DZ Cha may be a photoevaporating disc. We aim to analyse the DZ Cha star + disc system to identify
the mechanism driving the evolution of this object. We have analysed three epochs of high resolution
optical spectroscopy, photometry from the UV up to the sub-mm regime, infrared spectroscopy, and
J-band imaging polarimetry observations of DZ Cha. Combining our analysis with previous studies
we find no signatures of accretion in the $\Ha$ line profile in nine epochs covering a time baseline
of $\sim20$ years. The optical spectra are dominated by chromospheric emission lines, but they
also show emission from the forbidden lines [SII] 4068 and [OI] 6300$\,\AA$ that indicate a disc
outflow. The polarized images reveal a dust depleted cavity of $\sim7$ au in radius and two spiral-like
features, and we derive a disc dust mass limit of $M_\mathrm{dust}<3\MEarth$ from the sub-mm photometry.
No stellar ($M_\star > 80 \MJup$) companions are detected down to $0\farcs07$ ($\sim 8$ au, projected).
The negligible accretion rate, small cavity, and forbidden line emission strongly suggests that
DZ Cha is currently at the initial stages of disc clearing by photoevaporation. At this point the
inner disc has drained and the inner wall of the truncated outer disc is directly exposed to the stellar
radiation. We argue that other mechanisms like planet formation or binarity cannot explain the
observed properties of DZ Cha. The scarcity of objects like this one is in line with the dispersal
timescale ($\lesssim 10^5$ yr) predicted by this theory. DZ Cha is therefore an ideal target to study
the initial stages of photoevaporation.
