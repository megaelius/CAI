In previous contributions, we have presented an analytical model describing the evolution of molecular
clouds (MCs) undergoing global and hierarchical collapse. Here, we show that it can be used to estimate
the ages of MCs for which pairs of parameters are known. The model cloud evolution is characterized
by an initial increase in its mass, density, and star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE) as
it contracts gravitationally, followed by a decrease of these quantities as newly formed massive
stars begin to disrupt the cloud. The main controlling parameter of the model is the maximum mass
reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the instantaneous mass and some other
variable completely determines the cloud's evolutionary stage. We apply this capability of the
model to interpret the observed scatter in SFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al. as an evolutionary
effect. The model predicts that, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses,
they are in different evolutionary stages, causing them to have different SFRs and SFEs. Furthermore,
the model predicts that the California cloud will eventually reach a significantly larger total
mass than the Orion A cloud. Next, we apply the model to provide estimated ages of the clouds since
the time when approximately 25\% of their mass had become molecular. We find ages ranging from $\sim
1.5$ to 27 Myr, with the most inactive clouds being the youngest. Another prediction is that clouds
with low SFEs should have massive atomic envelopes that constitute the majority of their gravitational
mass. Finally, we discuss the model prediction that low-mass clouds ($M \sim 10^3-10^4 M_\odot$)
end their lives with a mini-burst of star formation, reaching SFRs $\sim 300-500\, M_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$,
at which time they have contracted to become compact massive star-forming clumps, embedded within
larger GMCs.
