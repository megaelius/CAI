Sand electrification is important for aeolian sediment transportation on terrestrial bodies
with silicate sand as the main sediment composition. However, it has not been thoroughly studied
for icy bodies such as Titan with organic sand as the main dune-forming material. We used the colloidal
probe atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique to study triboelectric charging processes using
Titan and Earth sand analogs. We found that it is easy to generate triboelectric charges between
naphthalene (a simple aromatic hydrocarbon), polystyrene (an aromatic hydrocarbon polymer),
and borosilicate glass (Earth silicate sand analog). Strong electrostatic forces can be measured
after contact and/or tribocharging. In contrast, tholin, a complex organic material, does not
generate any detectable electrostatic forces with contact or tribocharging within the detection
limit of the instrument. If Titan sand behaves more like tholin, this indicates that the tribocharging
capacity of Titan sand is much weaker than Earth silicate sand and much less than previously measured
by Mendez-Harper et al., (2017), where only simple organics were used for Titan sand analogs. Thus,
triboelectrification may not contribute to increasing interparticle forces between sand particles
on Titan as much as on Earth. Interparticle forces generated by other electrostatic processes or
other interparticle forces such as van der Waals and capillary cohesion forces could be the dominant
interparticle forces that govern Titan sand formation and sediment transportation on the surface.
Titan sand is also unlikely to produce large electrical discharge through tribocharging to affect
future missions to Titan's surface.
