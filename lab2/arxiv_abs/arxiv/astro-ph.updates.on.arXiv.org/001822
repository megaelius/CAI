Small planets, 1-4x the size of Earth, are extremely common around Sun-like stars, and surprisingly
so, as they are missing in our solar system. Recent detections have yielded enough information about
this class of exoplanets to begin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities,
and internal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most common, as 26%
of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 R_e planets with orbital periods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2
R_e planets that receive 1-4x the incident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets
are sprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 AU, and probably beyond.
Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 R_e show that the smallest of them, R < 1.5 R_e,
have the density expected for rocky planets. Their densities increase with increasing radius,
likely caused by gravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation:
rho = 2.32 + 3.19 R/R_e [g/cc]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0 R_e, have densities that
decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing amounts of low-density material in an envelope
surrounding a rocky core, befitting the appellation "mini-Neptunes." Planets of ~1.5 R_e have
the highest densities, averaging near 10 g/cc. The gas giant planets occur preferentially around
stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around stars having a range of heavy
element abundances. One explanation is that the fast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary
disks enriched in heavy elements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,
forming giant planets. But models of the formation of 1-4 R_e planets remain uncertain. Defining
habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit of either detections of life elsewhere or an
understanding of life's biochemical origins.
