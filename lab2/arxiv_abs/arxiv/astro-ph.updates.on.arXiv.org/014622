We determined the ages, the kinematic parameters and Galactic orbital parameters of six metal-poor
(-2.4<[Fe/H]<-1 dex) F-type high proper motion (HPM) stars to investigate their HPM nature and
origin. For the kinematical procedure, the astrometric data from the Gaia DR2 was used. High resolution
ELODIE spectra of the six dwarfs were also used to obtain accurate [Fe/H] abundances and up-to-date
[$\alpha$/Fe] abundances. The calculations for stellar ages were based on Bayesian statistics,
with the computed ages falling in the range 9.5-10.1 Gyrs. On the basis of the metallicities and ages,
six HMP stars are members of halo (HD6755, HD84937, BD +42 3607) or members of the low-metallicity
tail of the thick disk (HD 3567, HD 194598, HD 201891). However, Galactic orbital parameters suggest
thin disk (HD 84937, HD 194598), thick disk (HD 3567, HD 201891), and halo (HD 6755, BD +42 3607) population.
The dynamical analysis was also performed for the escape scenario from the candidate GCs. The tidal
disruption of a dwarf galaxy was also considered to be as an alternative origin. HD 6755, HD 194598,
and HD 3567 with their retrograde orbital motions are likely candidate stars for a tidally disrupted
dwarf galaxy origin. However, HD 194598 relationship with NGC 6284 presents an interesting case.
Its encounter velocity is low (16+/-28 km/s) and their ages and metallicities are very nearly consistent
with each other at the 1$\sigma$ level. The rest of the HPM sample stars have a 4% to 18% probability
of encountering with selected GCs for 1.5 tidal radii. This indicates that a globular cluster origin
for the program stars is unlikely.
