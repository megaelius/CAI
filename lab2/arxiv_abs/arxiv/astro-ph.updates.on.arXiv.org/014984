The observation of electromagnetic radiation from radio to $\gamma$-ray wavelengths has provided
a wealth of information about the universe. However, at PeV (10$^{15}$ eV) energies and above, most
of the universe is impenetrable to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed
to explore the most extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and stellar
explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays. The discovery of cosmic
neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on the universe. In this white paper, we present
an overview of a next-generation instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding
of the processes and environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2
is designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV energies; 2) Investigate
cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger observations; 3) Reveal the sources and
propagation of the highest energy particles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with
high-energy neutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic neutrinos
by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect sources five times fainter than its
predecessor. Furthermore, through the addition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the
energy range by several orders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years
and cost about \$350M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033. IceCube-Gen2
will play an essential role in shaping the new era of multi-messenger astronomy, fundamentally
advancing our knowledge of the high-energy universe. This challenging mission can be fully addressed
only in concert with the new survey instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational
wave detectors which will be available in the coming years.
