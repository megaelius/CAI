Context. HD72946 is a bright and nearby solar-type star hosting a low-mass companion at long period
(P~16 yr) detected with the radial velocities (RV) method. The companion has a minimum mass of 60.4+/-2.2
MJ and might be a brown dwarf. Its expected semi-major axis of ~243 mas makes it a suitable target for
further characterization with high-contrast imaging, in particular to measure its inclination,
mass, and spectrum and thus definitely establish its substellar nature. Aims. We aim to further
characterize the orbit, atmosphere, and physical nature of HD72946B. Methods. We present high-contrast
imaging data in the near-infrared with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch
(SPHERE) instrument. We also use proper motion measurements of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia.
Results. The SPHERE data reveal a point source with a contrast of ~9 mag at a projected separation
of ~235 mas. No other point sources are detected in the field of view. By jointly fitting the RV, imaging,
and proper motion data, we constrain all the orbital parameters of HD72946B and assess a dynamical
mass of 72.4+/-1.6 MJ and a semi-major axis of 6.45$^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ au. Empirical comparison
of its IFS spectrum to template dwarfs indicates a spectral type of L5.0+/-1.5. The J-H3 color is
close to the expectations of the DUSTY models and suggests a cloudy atmosphere. Comparison with
atmospheric models of the spectrophotometry suggests an effective temperature of ~1700 K. The
bolometric luminosity (log(L/LS)=-4.11+/-0.10 dex) and dynamical mass of HD72946B are more compatible
with evolutionary models for an age range of ~0.9-3 Gyr. The formation mechanism of the companion
is currently unclear as it appears slightly away from the bulk of model predictions. HD72946B is
currently the closest benchmark brown dwarf companion to a solar-type star with imaging, RV, and
proper motion measurements.
