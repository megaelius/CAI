Many habitable zone exoplanets are expected to form with water mass fractions higher than that of
the Earth. For rocky exoplanets with 10-1000x Earth's H2O but without H2, we model the multi-Gyr
evolution of ocean temperature and chemistry, taking into account C partitioning, high-pressure
ice phases, and atmosphere-lithosphere exchange. Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find
that: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean chemistry; (2)~possible
ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many waterworlds retain habitable surface water
for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to previous claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical
cycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C exchange between the
convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by seafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet
is stuck with the ocean mass and ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history.
In our model, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early water-rock interactions
is - coincidentally - often within an order of magnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean
inorganic C inventory overlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the "sweet spot" (0.2-20 bar)
for which the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as wide as it can be.
Because the width of the HZ in semimajor axis defines (for Sun-like stars) the maximum possible time
span of surface habitability, this effect allows for Gyr of habitability as the star brightens.
We illustrate our findings by using the output of an ensemble of N-body simulations as input to our
waterworld evolution code. Thus (for the first time in an end-to-end calculation) we show that chance
variation of initial conditions, with no need for geochemical cycling, can yield multi-Gyr surface
habitability on waterworlds.
