The baryonic mass composition of ultrahigh energy ($\gtrsim 10^{18}$ eV) cosmic rays (UHECRs)
at injection accompanied by their interactions on universal photon backgrounds during propagation
directly governs the UHECR flux on the Earth. Secondary neutrinos and photons produced in these
interactions serve as crucial astrophysical messengers of UHECR sources. A modeling of the latest
data obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) suggests a mixed element composition of UHECRs
with the sub-ankle spectrum being explained by a different class of sources than the super-ankle
region ($> 10^{18.7}$ eV). In this work, we obtain two kinds of fit to the UHECR spectrum -- one with
a single population of sources comprising of $^1$H and $^2$He, over an energy range commencing at
$\approx 10^{18}$ eV -- another for a mixed composition of representative nuclei $^1$H, $^4$He,
$^{14}$N and $^{28}$Si at injection, for which a fit is obtained from above $\approx 10^{18.7}$
eV. In both cases, we consider the source emissivity evolution to be a simple power-law in redshift.
We test the credibility of H+He composition by varying the source properties over a wide range of
values and compare the results to that obtained for H+He+N+Si composition, using the Monte Carlo
simulation tool CRPropa 3. The secondary electrons and photons are propagated using the cosmic
ray transport code DINT. We place limits on the source spectral index, source evolution index and
cutoff rigidity of the source population in each case by fitting the UHECR spectrum. Cosmogenic
neutrino fluxes can further constrain the abundance fraction and maximum source redshift in case
of light nuclei injection model.
