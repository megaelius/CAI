{\it Fermi}-LAT has detected pulsed gamma-ray emissions with high confidences from more than 40
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Here we study the phase-averaged gamma-ray properties of MSPs by using
revised version of a self-consistent outer gap model. In this model, a strong multipole magnetic
field near the stellar surface for a MSP is assumed and such a field will be close to the surface magnetic
fields ($\sim 10^{11}- 10^{12}$ G) of young ulsars; the outer gap of a MSP is controlled by photon-photon
pair production process, where the effects of magnetic inclination angle ($\alpha$) and magnetic
geometry have been taken into account, therefore the fractional size of the outer gap is a function
of not only pulsar's period and magnetic field strength but also magnetic inclination angle and
radial distance to the neutron star, the inner boundary of the outer gap can be estimated by the pair
production process of the gamma-ray photons which are produced by the back-flowing particles through
the null charge surface; inside the outer gap, a Gaussian distribution of the parallel electric
field along the trans-field thickness is assumed, and the gamma-ray emission is represented by
the emission from the average radial distance along the central field lines of the outer gap. Using
this model, the phase-averaged gamma-ray spectra are calculated and compared with the observed
spectra of 37 MSPs given by the second {\it Fermi}-LAT catalog of gamma-ray pulsars, our results
show that the {\it Fermi}-LAT results can be well explained by this model. The thermal X-ray emission
properties from MSPs are also investigated.
