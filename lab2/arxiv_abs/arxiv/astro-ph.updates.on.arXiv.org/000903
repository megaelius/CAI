We present images and spectra of a ~10 kpc-sized emission-line nebulosity discovered in the prototypical
merger remnant NGC 7252 and dubbed the `[O III] nebula' because of its dominant [O III]_5007 line.
This nebula seems to yield the first sign of episodic AGN activity still occurring in the remnant,
~220 Myr after the coalescence of two gas-rich galaxies. Its location and kinematics suggest it
belongs to a stream of tidal-tail gas falling back into the remnant. Its integrated [O III]_5007
luminosity is 1.4x10^40 erg/s, and its spectrum features some high-excitation lines, including
He II_4686. In diagnostic line- ratio diagrams, the nebula lies in the domain of Seyfert galaxies,
suggesting that it is photoionized by a source with a power-law spectrum. Yet, a search for AGN activity
in NGC 7252 from X-rays to radio wavelengths yields no detection, with the most stringent upper limit
set by X-ray observations. The upper luminosity limit of L_{2-10 keV,0} < 5x10^39 erg/s estimated
for the nucleus is ~10^3 times lower than the minimum ionizing luminosity of >5x10^42 erg/s necessary
to excite the nebula. This large discrepancy suggests that the nebula is a faint ionization echo
excited by a mildly active nucleus that has declined by ~3 orders of magnitude over the past 20,000-200,000
years. In many ways this nebula resembles the prototypical `Hanny's Voorwerp' near IC 2497, but
its size is 3x smaller and its [O III] luminosity ~100x lower. We propose that it be classified as an
extended emission-line region (EELR). The [O III] nebula is then the lowest-luminosity ionization
echo and EELR discovered so far, indicative of recent, probably sputtering AGN activity of Seyfert-like
intensity in NGC 7252.
