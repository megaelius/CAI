The degree of fractal substructure in molecular clouds can be quantified by comparing them with
Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) surfaces or volumes. These fields are self-similar over all length
scales and characterised by a drift exponent $H$, which describes the structural roughness. Given
that the structure of molecular clouds and the initial structure of star clusters are almost certainly
linked, it would be advantageous to also apply this analysis to clusters. Currently, the structure
of star clusters is often quantified by applying $\mathcal{Q}$ analysis. $\mathcal{Q}$ values
from observed targets are interpreted by comparing them with those from artificial clusters. These
are typically generated using a Box-Fractal (BF) or Radial Density Profile (RDP) model. We present
a single cluster model, based on FBM, as an alternative to these models. Here, the structure is parameterised
by $H$, and the standard deviation of the log-surface/volume density $\sigma$. The FBM model is
able to reproduce both centrally concentrated and substructured clusters, and is able to provide
a much better match to observations than the BF model. We show that $\mathcal{Q}$ analysis is unable
to estimate FBM parameters. Therefore, we develop and train a machine learning algorithm which
can estimate values of $H$ and $\sigma$, with uncertainties. This provides us with a powerful method
for quantifying the structure of star clusters in terms which relate to the structure of molecular
clouds. We use the algorithm to estimate the $H$ and $\sigma$ for several young star clusters, some
of which have no measurable BF or RDP analogue.
