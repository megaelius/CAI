The very-high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray sky shows diverse Galactic and extragalactic
source populations. For some sources the astrophysical object class could not be identified so
far. The nature (Galactic or extragalactic) of the VHE gamma-ray source HESS J1943+213 is explored.
We specifically investigate the proposed near-infrared counterpart 2MASS J19435624+2118233
of HESS J1943+213 and investigate the implications of a physical association. We present K-band
imaging from the 3.5 meter CAHA telescope of 2MASS J19435624+2118233. Furthermore, 5 years of Fermi-LAT
data were analyzed to search for a high-energy (HE, 100 MeV <E< 100 GeV) counterpart. The CAHA
observations revealed that the near-infrared counterpart is extended with an intrinsic half light
radius of 2" - 2.5" . These observations also show a smooth, centrally concentrated light profile
that is typical of a galaxy, and thus point toward an extragalactic scenario for the VHE gamma-ray
source, assuming that the near-infrared source is the counterpart of HESS J1943+213. A high-Sersic
index profile provides a better fit than an exponential profile, indicating that the surface brightness
profile of 2MASS J19435624+2118233 follows that of a typical, massive elliptical galaxy more closely
than that of a disk galaxy. With Fermi-LAT a HE counterpart is found with a power law spectrum above
1 GeV. This gamma-ray spectrum shows a rather sharp break between the HE and VHE regimes. The infrared
and HE data strongly favor an extragalactic origin of HESS J1943+213 The source is most likely located
at a redshift between 0.03 and 0.45 according to extension and EBL attenuation arguments.
