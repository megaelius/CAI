The combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) with galaxy clustering is one of the most promising
routes to determining the amplitude of matter clustering at low redshifts. We show that extending
clustering+GGL analyses from the linear regime down to $\sim 0.5 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc scales increases
their constraining power considerably, even after marginalizing over a flexible model of non-linear
galaxy bias. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we construct a Taylor-expansion
emulator that predicts the galaxy autocorrelation $\xi_{\text{gg}}(r)$ and galaxy-matter cross-correlation
$\xi_{\text{gm}}(r)$ as a function of $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, and halo occupation distribution
(HOD) parameters, which are allowed to vary with large scale environment to represent possible
effects of galaxy assembly bias. We present forecasts for a fiducial case that corresponds to BOSS
LOWZ galaxy clustering and SDSS-depth weak lensing (effective source density $\sim 0.3$ arcmin$^{-2}$).
Using tangential shear and projected correlation function measurements over $0.5 \leq r_p \leq
30 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc yields a 1.8% constraint on the parameter combination $\sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.58}$,
a factor of two better than a constraint that excludes non-linear scales ($r_p > 2 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc,
$4 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc for $\gamma_t,w_p$). Much of this improvement comes from the non-linear clustering
information, which breaks degeneracies among HOD parameters that would otherwise degrade the
inference of matter clustering from GGL. Increasing the effective source density to $3$ arcmin$^{-2}$
sharpens the constraint on $\sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.58}$ by a further factor of two. With robust modeling
into the non-linear regime, low-redshift measurements of matter clustering at the 1-percent level
with clustering+GGL alone are well within reach of current data sets such as those provided by the
Dark Energy Survey.
