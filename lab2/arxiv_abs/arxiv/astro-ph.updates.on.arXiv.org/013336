We present X-ray and radio observations of the Fast Blue Optical Transient (FBOT) CRTS-CSS161010
J045834-081803 (CSS161010 hereafter) at t=69-531 days. CSS161010 shows luminous X-ray ($L_x\sim5\times
10^{39}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) and radio ($L_{\nu}\sim10^{29}\,\rm{erg\,s^{-1}Hz^{-1}}$)
emission. The radio emission peaked at ~100 days post transient explosion and rapidly decayed.
We interpret these observations in the context of synchrotron emission from an expanding blastwave.
CSS161010 launched a relativistic outflow with velocity $\Gamma\beta c\ge0.55c$ at ~100 days.
This is faster than the non-relativistic AT2018cow ($\Gamma\beta c\sim0.1c$) and closer to ZTF18abvkwla
($\Gamma\beta c\ge0.3c$ at 63 days). The inferred initial kinetic energy of CSS161010 ($E_k\gtrsim10^{51}$
erg) is comparable to that of long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), but the ejecta mass that is coupled to the
relativistic outflow is significantly larger ($\sim0.01-0.1\,M_{\odot}$). This is consistent
with the lack of observed $\gamma$-rays. The luminous X-rays were produced by a different emission
component to the synchrotron radio emission. CSS161010 is located at ~150 Mpc in a dwarf galaxy with
stellar mass $M_{*}\sim10^{7}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ and specific star formation rate 0.3 $Gyr^{-1}$.
This mass is among the lowest inferred for host-galaxies of explosive transients from massive stars.
Our observations of CSS161010 are consistent with an engine-driven aspherical explosion from
a rare evolutionary path of a H-rich stellar progenitor, but we cannot rule out a stellar tidal disruption
event on a centrally-located intermediate mass black hole. Regardless of the physical mechanism,
CSS161010 establishes the existence of a new class of rare (rate <0.25% the core-collapse supernova
rate at z~0.2) H-rich transients that can launch relativistic outflows.
