The conventional wisdom, dating back to 2012, is that the mass distribution of Galactic double neutron
stars is well-fit by a Gaussian distribution with a mean of $1.33 M_\odot$ and a width of $0.09 M_\odot$.
With the recent discovery of new Galactic double neutron stars and GW170817, the first neutron star
merger event to be observed with gravitational waves, it is timely to revisit this model. In order
to constrain the mass distribution of double neutron stars, we perform Bayesian inference using
a sample of 17 Galactic double neutron stars effectively doubling the sample used in previous studies.
We expand the space of models so that the recycled neutron star need not be drawn from the same distribution
as the non-recycled companion. Moreover, we consider different functional forms including uniform,
single-Gaussian, and two-Gaussian distributions. While there is insufficient data to draw firm
conclusions, we find positive support (a Bayes factor of 9) for the hypothesis that recycled and
non-recycled neutron stars have distinct mass distributions. The most probable model---preferred
with a Bayes factor of 29 over the conventional model---is one in which the recycled neutron star
mass is distributed according to a two-Gaussian distribution and the non-recycled neutron star
mass is distributed uniformly. We show that precise component mass measurements of $\approx 20$
double neutron stars are required in order to determine with high confidence (a Bayes factor of 150)
if recycled and non-recycled neutron stars come from a common distribution. Approximately $60$
are needed in order to establish the detailed shape of the distributions.
