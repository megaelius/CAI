We use the Fisher-matrix formalism to investigate whether the galaxy bispectrum in redshift space,
$B$, contains additional cosmological information with respect to the power spectrum, $P$. We
focus on a $Euclid$-like survey and consider cosmological models dominated by dark energy and cold
dark matter with Gaussian primordial perturbations. After discussing the phenomenology of redshift-space
distortions for the bispectrum, we derive an expression for the cross-covariance between $B$ and
$P$ at leading order in perturbation theory. Our equation generalizes previous results that did
not consider binning in the orientation of wavevector triangles with respect to the line of sight.
By considering Fourier modes with wavenumber $k<0.15 \,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we find that $B$ and $P$ set
similar constraints on the cosmological parameters. Generally, error bars moderately improve
when the two probes are combined together. For instance, the joint 68.3 per cent credible region
for the parameters that describe a dynamical dark-energy equation of state shrinks by a factor of
2.6 with respect to only using the power spectrum. Regrettably, this improvement is cancelled out
when the clustering analysis is combined with priors based on current studies of the cosmic microwave
background. In this case, combining $B$ and $P$ does not give any appreciable benefit other than
allowing a precise determination of galaxy bias. Finally, we discuss how results depend on the binning
strategy for the clustering statistics as well as on the maximum wavenumber. We also show that only
considering the bispectrum monopole leads to a significant loss of information.
