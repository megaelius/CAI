The ESA Gaia mission provides a unique time-domain survey for more than 1.6 billion sources with
G ~ 21 mag. We showcase stellar variability across the Galactic colour-absolute magnitude diagram
(CaMD), focusing on pulsating, eruptive, and cataclysmic variables, as well as on stars exhibiting
variability due to rotation and eclipses. We illustrate the locations of variable star classes,
variable object fractions, and typical variability amplitudes throughout the CaMD and illustrate
how variability-related changes in colour and brightness induce `motions' using 22 months worth
of calibrated photometric, spectro-photometric, and astrometric Gaia data of stars with significant
parallax. To ensure a large variety of variable star classes to populate the CaMD, we crossmatch
Gaia sources with known variable stars. We also used the statistics and variability detection modules
of the Gaia variability pipeline. Corrections for interstellar extinction are not implemented
in this article. Gaia enables the first investigation of Galactic variable star populations across
the CaMD on a similar, if not larger, scale than previously done in the Magellanic Clouds. Despite
observed colours not being reddening corrected, we clearly see distinct regions where variable
stars occur and determine variable star fractions to within Gaia's current detection thresholds.
Finally, we show the most complete description of variability-induced motion within the CaMD to
date. Gaia enables novel insights into variability phenomena for an unprecedented number of stars,
which will benefit the understanding of stellar astrophysics. The CaMD of Galactic variable stars
provides crucial information on physical origins of variability in a way previously accessible
only for Galactic star clusters or external galaxies.
