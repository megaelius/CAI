Longitudinal control signals used to keep gravitational wave detectors at a stable operating point
are often affected by modulations from test mass misalignments leading to an elevated noise floor
ranging from 50 to 500 Hz. Nonstationary noise of this kind results in modulation sidebands and increases
the number of glitches observed in the calibrated strain data. These artifacts ultimately affect
the data quality and decrease the efficiency of the data analysis pipelines looking for astrophysical
signals from continuous waves as well as the transient events. In this work, we develop a scheme to
subtract one such bilinear noise from the gravitational wave strain data and demonstrate it at the
GEO 600 observatory. We estimate the coupling by making use of narrow-band signal injections that
are already in place for noise projection purposes and construct a coherent bilinear signal by a
two-stage system identification process. We improve upon the existing filter design techniques
by employing a Bayesian adaptive directed search strategy that optimizes across the several key
parameters that affect the accuracy of the estimated model. The scheme takes into account the possible
nonstationarities in the coupling by periodically updating the involved filter coefficients.
The resulting postoffline subtraction leads to a suppression of modulation sidebands around the
calibration lines along with a broadband reduction of the midfrequency noise floor. The observed
increase in the astrophysical range and a reduction in the occurrence of nonastrophysical transients
suggest that the above method is a viable data cleaning technique for current and future generation
gravitational wave observatories.
