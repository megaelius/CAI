Aims: Our aim is to identify the dominant molecular cooling lines and characteristic emission features
in the 1.3 mm window of distinct regions in the northern part of the Orion A molecular cloud. By defining
and analysing template regions, we also intend to help with the interpretation of observations
from more distant sources which cannot be easily spatially resolved. Methods: We analyse an imaging
line survey covering the area of OMC-1 to OMC-3 from 200.2 to 281.8 GHz obtained with the PI230 receiver
at the APEX telescope. Masks are used to define regions with distinct properties (e.g. column density
or temperature ranges) from which we obtain averaged spectra. Lines of 29 molecular species (55
isotopologues) are fitted for each region to obtain the respective total intensity. Results: We
find that strong sources like Orion KL have a clear impact on the emission on larger scales. Although
not spatially extended, their line emission contributes substantially to spectra averaged over
large regions. Conversely, the emission signatures of dense, cold regions like OMC-2 and OMC-3
(e.g. enhanced N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ emission and low HCN/HNC ratio) seem to be difficult to pick up on
larger scales, where they are eclipsed by signatures of stronger sources. In all regions, HCO$^{+}$
appears to contribute between 3% and 6% to the total intensity, the most stable value for all bright
species. N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ shows the strongest correlation with column density, but not with typical
high-density tracers like HCN, HCO$^{+}$, H$_{2}$CO, or HNC. Common line ratios associated with
UV illumination, CN/HNC and CN/HCO$^{+}$, show ambiguous results on larger scales, suggesting
that the identification of UV illuminated material may be more challenging. The HCN/HNC ratio may
be related to temperature over varying scales.
