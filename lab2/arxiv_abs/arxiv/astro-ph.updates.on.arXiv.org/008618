Several detections of wide-orbit planet-mass/sub-stellar companions around young solar-like
stars were reported in the last decade. The origin of those possible planets is still unclear but
accretion tracers and VLT/SPHERE observations indicate that they are surrounded by circumplanetary
material or even a circumplanetary disk. We want to investigate if the gas component of disks around
wide-orbit companions is detectable with current and future (sub)mm telescopes and what constraints
such gas observations can provide on the nature of the circumplanetary material and on the mass of
the companion. We applied the radiation thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo to model the dust and
gas component of passive circumplanetary disks and produced realistic synthetic observables.
We considered different companion properties, disk parameters and radiative environments and
compared the resulting synthetic observables to telescope sensitivities and to existing dust
observations. The main criterion for a successful detection is the size of the circumplanetary
disk. At a distance of about 150 pc, a circumplanetary disk with an outer radius of about 10 au is detectable
with ALMA in about 6 hours in optically thick CO lines. Other aspects such as the companion's luminosity,
disk inclination and background radiation fields are also relevant and should be considered to
optimize the observing strategy for detection experiments. For most of the known wide-orbit planet-mass
companions, their maximum theoretical disk size of one third of the Hill radius would be sufficient
to allow detection of CO lines. It is therefore feasible to detect their gas disks and constrain the
mass of the companion through the kinematic signature. Even in the case of non-detections such observations
will provide stringent constraints on disk size and gas mass, information crucial for formation
theories.
