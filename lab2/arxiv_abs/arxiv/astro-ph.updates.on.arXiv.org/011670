We present results from deep Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) observations of 28 metal-poor,
strongly star-forming galaxies selected from the DEEP2 Galaxy Survey. By modelling infrared and
optical photometry, we derive stellar masses and other stellar properties. We determine that these
metal-poor galaxies have low stellar masses, $M_{\star}$ $\approx10^{8.1}$-$10^{9.5}$ $M_{\odot}$.
Combined with the Balmer-derived star formation rates (SFRs), these galaxies have average inverse
SFR/$M_{\star}$ of $\approx$100 Myr. The evolution of stellar mass-gas metallicity relation
to $z\approx0.8$ is measured by combining the modelled masses with previously obtained spectroscopic
measurements of metallicity from [O III] $\lambda$4363 detections. Here, we include measurements
for 79 galaxies from the Metal Abundances across Cosmic Time Survey. Our mass-metallicity relation
is lower at a given stellar mass than at $z=0.1$ by 0.27 dex. This demonstrates a strong evolution
in the mass-metallicity relation, $(1+z)^{-1.45^{+0.61}_{-0.76}}$. We find that the shape of
the $z\approx0.8$ mass-metallicity relation, a steep rise in metallicity at low stellar masses,
transitioning to a plateau at higher masses, is consistent with $z\sim0.1$ studies. We also compare
the evolution in metallicity between $z\approx0.8$ and $z\sim0.1$ against recent strong-line
diagnostic studies at intermediate redshifts and find good agreement. Specifically, we find that
lower mass galaxies ($4\times10^8$ $M_{\odot}$) built up their metal content 1.6 times more rapidly
than higher mass galaxies ($10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$). Finally, we examine whether the mass-metallicity
relation has a secondary dependence on SFR, and statistically concluded that there is no strong
secondary dependence for $z\approx0.8$ low-mass galaxies.
