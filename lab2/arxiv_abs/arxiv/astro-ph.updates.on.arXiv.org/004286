We present the overall statistical results from the Robo-AO Kepler planetary candidate survey,
comprising of 3857 observations with 0.1"-resolution of planetary candidate systems with Robo-AO,
an automated laser adaptive optics system. These observations reveal previously unknown nearby
stars blended with the planetary candidate host star which alter the derived planetary radii or
may be the source of an astrophysical false positive transit signal. In the first three papers in
the survey, we detected 440 nearby stars around 3313 planetary candidate host stars. In this paper,
we present observations of 532 planetary candidate host stars, detecting 94 companions around
88 stars; 84 of these companions have not previously been observed in high-resolution. We also report
50 more-widely-separated companions near 715 targets previously observed by Robo-AO. We derive
corrected planetary radius estimates for the 814 planetary candidates in systems with a detected
nearby star. If planetary candidates are equally likely to orbit the primary or secondary star,
the radius estimates for planetary candidates in systems with likely bound nearby stars increase
by a factor of 1.54, on average. We find that 35 previously-believed rocky planet candidates are
likely not rocky due to the presence of nearby stars. From the combined datasets from the complete
Robo-AO KOI survey, we find that 14.5\pm0.5% of planetary candidate hosts have a nearby star with
4", while 1.2% have two nearby stars and 0.08% have three. We find that 16% of Earth-sized, 13% of Neptune-sized,
14% of Saturn-sized, and 19% of Jupiter-sized planet candidates have stars close enough to affect
their radius estimates.
