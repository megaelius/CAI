Solar flare precursors depict constrained rate of energy release contrasting the imminent rapid
energy release which calls for different regime of plasma processes to be at play. Due to subtle emission
during the precursor phase, its diagnostics remain delusive, revealing either the non-thermal
electrons (NTEs) or the thermal conduction to be the driver. In this regard, we investigate the chromospheric
response during various phases of a B6.4 flare on August 20, 2005. Spatio-temporal investigation
of flare ribbon enhancement during the precursor phase, carried out using spectra-images recorded
in several wavelength positions on the H-alpha line profile, revealed its delayed response (180
seconds) compared to the X-ray emission, as well as sequential increment in the width of the line-profile
which are indicative of a slow heating process. However, energy contained in the H-alpha emission
during the precursor phase reach as high as 80% of that estimated during the main phase. Additionally,
the plasma hydrodynamics during the precursor phase, as resulted from the application of a single-loop
one-dimensional model, revealed the presence of power-law extension in the model generated X-ray
spectra, with flux lower than the RHESSI background. Therefore, our multi-wavelength diagnostics
and hydrodynamical modeling of the precursor emission indicates the role of a two-stage process.
Firstly, reconnection triggered NTEs, although too small in flux to overcome the observational
constraints, thermalize in the upper chromosphere. This leads to the generation of a slow conduction
front which causes plasma heating during the precursor phase.
