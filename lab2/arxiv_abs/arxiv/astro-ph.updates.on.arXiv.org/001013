We present a method to couple N-body star cluster simulations to a cosmological tidal field, using
the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software Environment. We apply this method to star clusters embedded
in the CosmoGrid dark matter-only LambdaCDM simulation. Our star clusters are born at z = 10 (corresponding
to an age of the Universe of about 500 Myr) by selecting a dark matter particle and initializing a star
cluster with 32,000 stars on its location. We then follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster
within the cosmological environment. We compare the evolution of star clusters in two Milky-Way
size haloes with a different accretion history. The mass loss of the star clusters is continuous
irrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger events tend to increase the rate
of mass loss. From the selected two dark matter haloes, the halo that experienced the larger number
of mergers tends to drive a smaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the
final masses of both haloes are similar. We identify two families of star clusters: native clusters,
which become part of the main halo before its final major merger event, and the immigrant clusters,
which are accreted upon or after this event; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly than
immigrant clusters. Accounting for the evolution of the dark matter halo causes immigrant star
clusters to retain more mass than when the z=0 tidal field is taken as a static potential. The reason
for this is the weaker tidal field experienced by immigrant star clusters before merging with the
larger dark matter halo.
