We investigate the impact of cosmic rays (CR) and different modes of CR transport on the properties
of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations in the context
of the AURIGA project. We systematically study how advection, anisotropic diffusion and additional
Alfv\'en-wave cooling affect the galactic disk and the circum-galactic medium (CGM). Global properties
such as stellar mass and star formation rate vary little between simulations with and without various
CR transport physics, whereas structural properties such as disk sizes, CGM densities or temperatures
can be strongly affected. In our simulations, CRs affect the accretion of gas onto galaxies by modifying
the CGM flow structure. This alters the angular momentum distribution which manifests itself as
a difference in stellar and gaseous disk size. The strength of this effect depends on the CR transport
model: CR advection results in the most compact disks while the Alfv\'en-wave model resembles more
the AURIGA model. The advection and diffusion models exhibit large ($r\sim50$ kpc) CR pressure-dominated
gas haloes causing a smoother and partly cooler CGM. The additional CR pressure smoothes small-scale
density peaks and compensates for the missing thermal pressure support at lower CGM temperatures.
In contrast, the Alfv\'en-wave model is only CR pressure dominated at the disk-halo interface and
only in this model the gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions agrees with observations.
In contrast to previous findings, we conclude that details of CR transport are critical for accurately
predicting the impact of CR feedback on galaxy formation.
