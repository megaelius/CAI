Realizing Refsdal's original idea from 1964, we present estimates of the Hubble constant that are
complementary to and potentially competitive with those of other cosmological probes. We use the
observed positions of 89 multiple images, with extensive spectroscopic information, from 28 background
sources and the measured time delays between the images S1-S4 and SX of supernova "Refsdal" ($z =
1.489$), which were obtained thanks to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) deep imaging and Multi Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data. We extend the strong lensing modeling of the Hubble Frontier
Fields (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5$+$2223 ($z = 0.542$), published by Grillo et al. (2016),
and explore different $\Lambda$CDM models. Taking advantage of the lensing information associated
to the presence of very close pairs of multiple images at various redshifts and to the extended surface
brightness distribution of the SN Refsdal host, we can reconstruct the total mass density profile
of the cluster very precisely. The combined dependence of the multiple image positions and time
delays on the cosmological parameters allows us to infer the values of $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ with relative (1$\sigma$) statistical errors of, respectively, 6% (7%) and 31% (26%) in flat
(general) cosmological models, assuming a conservative 3% uncertainty on the final time delay
of image SX and, remarkably, no priors from other cosmological experiments. Our best estimate of
$H_{0}$, based on the model described in this work, will be presented when the final time-delay measurement
becomes available. Our results show that it is possible to utilize time delays in lens galaxy clusters
as an important alternative tool for measuring the expansion rate and the geometry of the Universe.
