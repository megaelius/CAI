Exploding granules constitute the strongest horizontal flows on the quiet Sun and contribute to
the structure of the surface horizontal velocity fields which build the large-scale organization
of the discrete magnetic field. In this work we explore exploding granule expansion through the
observations of the ground-based THEMIS telescope, IRIS, SDO, and the Hinode space-borne instruments,
and finally with the magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We evaluate the detection and the expansion
of exploding granules at several wavelengths and at various spatial and temporal resolutions.
To analyze the different temporal sequences, two methods of image segmentation are applied to select
the granules. The first allows us to follow individually the exploding granules observed simultaneously
by THEMIS, IRIS, and SDO. The second uses long time independent sequences from THEMIS, IRIS, SDO,
Hinode, and a simulation. In the first method (called manual) the segmentation isolates the cell
of the granules (bright granules and intergranular parts), while in the second method (called statistical)
only the bright part of the granules are isolated. The results obtained with simultaneous or distinct
temporal observations using the two methods of segmentation are in good agreement. The granule
area evolves linearly with an expansion velocity that decreases with the radius. A rapid decrease
in the velocity expansion in the first two minutes is observed. The detection and measurement of
the dynamics of the explosive granules can be performed from ground- and space-based instruments.
Our work reveals the usefulness of SDO data, with low spatial resolution, to study the dynamics of
the exploding granules all over the solar surface
