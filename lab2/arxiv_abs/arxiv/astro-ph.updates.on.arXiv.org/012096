Our objective is to estimate the C/O ratio in the atmosphere of beta Pictoris b and obtain an estimate
of the dynamical mass of the planet, as well as to refine its orbital parameters using high-precision
astrometry. We used the GRAVITY instrument with the four 8.2 m telescopes of the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer to obtain K-band spectro-interferometric data on $\beta$ Pic b. We extracted a
medium resolution (R=500) K-band spectrum of the planet and a high-precision astrometric position.
We estimated the planetary C/O ratio using two different approaches (forward modeling and free
retrieval) from two different codes (ExoREM and petitRADTRANS, respectively). Finally, we used
a simplified model of two formation scenarios (gravitational collapse and core-accretion) to
determine which can best explain the measured C/O ratio. Our new astrometry disfavors a circular
orbit for $\beta$ Pic b ($e=0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$). Combined with previous results and with Hipparcos/GAIA
measurements, this astrometry points to a planet mass of $M = 12.7\pm{}2.2\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$.
This value is compatible with the mass derived with the free-retrieval code petitRADTRANS using
spectral data only. The forward modeling and free-retrieval approches yield very similar results
regarding the atmosphere of beta Pic b. In particular, the C/O ratios derived with the two codes are
identical ($0.43\pm{}0.05$ vs $0.43^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$). We argue that if the stellar C/O in $\beta$
Pic is Solar, then this combination of a very high mass and a low C/O ratio for the planet suggests a
formation through core-accretion, with strong planetesimal enrichment.
