We analyze the evolution of the potentially habitable planet Proxima Centauri b to identify environmental
factors that affect its long-term habitability. We consider physical processes acting on size
scales ranging from the galactic to the stellar system to the planet's core. We find that there is
a significant probability that Proxima Centauri has had encounters with its companion stars, Alpha
Centauri A and B, that are close enough to destabilize an extended planetary system. If the system
has an additional planet, as suggested by the discovery data, then it may perturb planet b's eccentricity
and inclination, possibly driving those parameters to non-zero values, even in the presence of
strong tidal damping. We also model the internal evolution of the planet, evaluating the roles of
different radiogenic abundances and tidal heating and find that magnetic field generation is likely
for billions of years. We find that if planet b formed in situ, then it experienced 169 +/- 13 million
years in a runaway greenhouse as the star contracted during its formation. This early phase could
remove up to 5 times as much water as in the modern Earth's oceans, possibly producing a large abiotic
oxygen atmosphere. On the other hand, if Proxima Centauri b formed with a substantial hydrogen atmosphere
(0.01 - 1% of the planet's mass), then this envelope could have shielded the water long enough for
it to be retained before being blown off itself. After modeling this wide range of processes we conclude
that water retention during the host star's pre-main sequence phase is the biggest obstacle for
Proxima b's habitability. These results are all obtained with a new software package called VPLANET.
