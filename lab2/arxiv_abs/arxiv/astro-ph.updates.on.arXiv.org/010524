We study the impact of local density and stellar mass on the morphology of ~500 quiescent (Q) and SFGs
from the VIS3COS survey. We perform B/D decomposition of the SBPs and find ~41% of 10^10 Msun galaxies
to be best fitted with 2 components. We complement our analysis with non-parametric measurements
and qualitative visual classifications. We find that galaxy morphology depends on stellar mass
and environment for our sample as a whole. We only find an impact of the environment on galaxy sizes
for galaxies more massive than 10^11 Msun. We find higher n and B/T in high-density regions when compared
to low-density counterparts at similar stellar masses. We also find that higher stellar mass galaxies
have steeper light profiles compared to the lower ones. Using visual classifications, we find a
morphology-density relation at z~0.84 for galaxies more massive than 10^10 Msun, with elliptical
galaxies being dominant at high-density regions and disks more common in low-density regions.
However, when splitting the sample into colour-colour selected SF and Q sub-populations, there
are no statistically significant differences between low- and high-density regions. We find that
Q galaxies are smaller, have higher n, and higher B/T when compared to SF counterparts. We confirm
these trends with non-parametric quantities, finding Q galaxies to be smoother and having most
of their light over smaller areas than SFGs. Overall, we find that the dependence of morphology on
stellar mass is stronger than with local density and these relations are strongly correlated with
the quenching fraction. The change in average morphology corresponds to a change in the relative
fractions of blue disk-like galaxies and red elliptical galaxies with stellar mass and environment.
We hypothesize that the processes responsible for the quenching of SF must also affect the galaxy
morphology on similar timescales.
