(abridged) Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were constructed for a sample of 477 classical
cepheids (CCs). The SEDs were fitted with a dust radiative transfer code. Four stars showed a large
mid- or far-infrared excess and the fitting then included a dust component. These comprise the well-known
case of RS Pup, and three stars that are (likely) Type-II cepheids (T2Cs), AU Peg, QQ Per, and FQ Lac.
The remainder of the sample was fitted with a stellar photosphere to derive the best-fitting luminosity
and effective temperature. Distance and reddening were taken from the literature. The stars were
plotted in a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and compared to evolutionary tracks for cepheids and
theoretical instability strips. For the large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent
with the instability strip for a CC or T2C. About 5% of the stars are outliers in the sense that they
are much hotter or cooler than expected. A comparison to effective temperatures derived from spectroscopy
suggests in some cases that the photometrically derived temperature is not correct and that this
is likely linked to an incorrectly adopted reddening. In this work the presence of a small NIR excess,
as has been proposed in the literature for a few well-known cepheids, is investigated. Firstly,
this was done by using a sample of about a dozen stars for which a mid-infrared spectrum is available.
Secondly, the SEDs of all stars were fitted with a dust model to see if a statistically significant
better fit could be obtained. The results were compared to recent work. Eight new candidates for
exhibiting a NIR excess are proposed, solely based on the photometric SEDs. Obtaining mid-infrared
spectra would be needed to confirm this excess. Finally, period-bolometric luminosity and period-radius
relations are presented for samples of over 370 fundamental-mode CCs.
