Aims: We present a comprehensive study of the supernova remnant (SNR) population of the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC). We measure multiwavelength properties of the SMC SNRs and compare them to those of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) population. Methods: This study combines the large dataset of XMM-Newton
observations of the SMC, archival and recent radio continuum observations, an optical line emission
survey, and new optical spectroscopic observations. We can thus build a complete and clean sample
of 19 confirmed and 4 candidate SNRs. The homogeneous X-ray spectral analysis allows to search for
SN ejecta and Fe K line emission, and to measure interstellar medium (ISM) abundances. We estimate
the ratio of core-collapse to type Ia supernova rates of the SMC based on the X-ray properties and
the local stellar environment of each SNR. Results : After the removal of unconfirmed or misclassified
objects, and the addition of two newly confirmed SNRs based on multi-wavelength features, we present
a final list of 21 confirmed SNRs and 2 candidates. While no Fe K line is detected even for the brightest
and youngest SNR, we find X-ray evidence of SN ejecta in 11 SNRs. We estimate a ratio of 4.7$_{-1.9}
^{+0.6}$ core-collapse supernova to every type Ia SN, three times higher than in the LMC. The difference
can be ascribed to the absence of the enhanced star formation episode in the SMC, which occurred in
the LMC 0.5-1.5 Gyr ago. The hot-gas abundances of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe are 0.1-0.2 times solar. Their
ratios with respect to SMC stellar abundances reflect the effects of dust depletion and partial
dust destruction in SNR shocks. We find evidence that the ambient medium probed by SMC SNRs is less
disturbed and less dense on average than in the LMC, consistent with the different morphologies
of the two galaxies.
