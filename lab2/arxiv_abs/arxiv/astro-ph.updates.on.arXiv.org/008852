Modern interferometric imaging relies on advanced calibration that incorporates direction-dependent
effects. Their increasing number of antennas (e.g. in LOFAR, VLA, MeerKAT/SKA) and sensitivity
are often tempered with the accuracy of their calibration. Beam accuracy drives particularly the
capability for high dynamic range imaging (HDR - contrast > 1:$10^6$). The Radio Interferometric
Measurement Equation (RIME) proposes a refined calibration framework for wide field of views (i.e.
beyond the primary lobe and first null) using beam models. We have used holography data taken on 12
antennas of the Very Large Array (VLA) with two different approaches: a `data-driven' representation
derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a projection on the Zernike polynomials. We
determined sparse representations of the beam to encode its spatial and spectral variations. For
each approach, we compressed the spatial and spectral distribution of coefficients using low-rank
approximations. The spectral behaviour was encoded with a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We
compared our modelling to that of the Cassbeam software which provides a parametric model of the
antenna and its radiated field. We present comparisons of the beam reconstruction fidelity vs.
`compressibility'. We found that the PCA method provides the most accurate model. In the case of
VLA antennas, we discuss the frequency ripple over L-band which is associated with a standing wave
between antenna reflectors. The results are a series of coefficients that can easily be used `on-the-fly'
in calibration pipelines to generate accurate beams at low computing costs.
