We present an analysis of the Counts-in-Cells (CiC) statistics of subhalos in the publically available
Illustris-TNG cosmological simulations (TNG100-1, TNG100-3 and TNG300-3), in redshifts ranging
from $z = 0$ to $z=5$. We fit the CiC statistics to two models: the gravitational quasi-equilibrium
distribution (GQED) and the negative binomial distribution (NBD). We analyzed differences between
``full'' runs and their associated ``dark-only'' counterparts, in terms of GQED and NBD, and also
by the use of gaussian kernel density estimates. We discuss the behaviour of the best-fit parameters
$\bar{N}$ (average number of subhalos per cell), and the clustering parameters $b$ (GQED) and $g$
(NBD), in terms of redshifts and comoving cell sizes. We found that ``full'' and ``dark-only'' TNG
runs follow similar CiC distributions. However, there are quantifiable distinctions between
these sets of runs in the evolution and scaling of the best-fit parameters. We compare our results
with previous numerical, observational and ``mock'' catalogs, and found similar scaling and evolutionary
trends in all samples, up to factors in the amplitude of parameter values, possibly regulated by
different magnitude cutoffs in the observational samples. Our results suggest the overall validity
of the GQED and NBD models for describing the large-scale statistics of extended, multi-component
gravitational systems and subject to complex baryonic physics. Our analysis indicate that gravithermodynamics
is generally suitable for describing gravitational clustering in the presence of baryonic physics
and, with proper refinements, it may provide additional theoretical guidance for the modelling
of bias.
