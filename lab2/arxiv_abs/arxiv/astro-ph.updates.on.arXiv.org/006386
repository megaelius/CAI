Poor modelling of the surface regions of solar-like stars causes a systematic discrepancy between
the observed and model pulsation frequencies. We aim to characterise this frequency discrepancy
for main sequence solar-like oscillators for a wide range of initial masses and metallicities.
We fit stellar models to the observed mode frequencies of the 67 stars, including the Sun, in the $Kepler$
LEGACY sample, using three different empirical surface corrections. The three surface corrections
we analyse are a frequency power-law, a cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia, and a linear
combination of an inverse and cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia. We construct a grid
of stellar evolution models using the stellar evolution code MESA and calculate mode frequencies
using GYRE. We scale the frequencies of each stellar model by an empirical calculated homology coefficient,
which greatly improves the robustness of our grid. We calculate stellar parameters and surface
corrections for each star using the average of the best-fitting models from each evolutionary track,
weighted by the likelihood of each model. The resulting model stellar parameters agree well with
an independent reference, the $\texttt{BASTA}$ pipeline. However, we find that the adopted physics
of the stellar models has a greater impact on the fitted stellar parameters than the choice of correction
method. We find that scaling the frequencies by the mode inertia improves the fit between the models
and observations. The inclusion of the inverse frequency term produces substantially better model
fits to lower surface gravity stars.
