Taking advantage of HST CANDELS data, we analyze the lowest redshift (z<0.5) massive galaxies in
order to disentangle their structural constituents and study possible faint non-axis-symmetric
features. Due to the excellent HST spatial resolution for intermediate-z objects, they are hard
to model by purely automatic parametric fitting algorithms. We performed careful single and double
S\'ersic fits to their galaxy surface brightness profiles. We also compare the model color profiles
with the observed ones and also derive multi-component global effective radii attempting to obtain
a better interpretation of the mass-size relation. Additionally, we test the robustness of our
measured structural parameters via simulations. We find that the S\'ersic index does not offer
a good proxy for the visual morphological type for our sample of massive galaxies. Our derived multi-component
effective radii give a better description of the size of our sample galaxies than those inferred
from single S\'ersic models with GALFIT. Our galaxy population lays on the scatter of the local mass-size
relation, indicating that these massive galaxies do not experience a significant growth in size
since z~0.5. Interestingly the few outliers are late-type galaxies, indicating that spheroids
must reach the local mass-size relation earlier. For most of our sample galaxies, both single and
multi-component S\'ersic models with GALFIT show substantial systematic deviations from the
observed SBPs in the outskirts. These residuals may be partly due to several factors, namely a non-optimal
data reduction for low surface brightness features, the existence of prominent stellar haloes
for massive galaxies and could also arise from conceptual shortcomings of parametric 2D image decomposition
tools. They consequently propagate into galaxy color profiles.
