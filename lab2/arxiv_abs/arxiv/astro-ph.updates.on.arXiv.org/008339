Bar fractions depend on the properties of the host galaxies, which are closely related to the formation
and evolution of bars. However, observational studies do not provide consistent results. We investigate
the bar fraction and its dependence on the properties of the host galaxies by using three bar classification
methods: visual inspection, ellipse fitting method, and Fourier analysis. Our volume-limited
sample consists of 1,698 spiral galaxies brighter than $M_{\rm r}=-15.2$ with $z < 0.01$ from SDSS/DR7
visually classified by Ann et al. (2015). We first compare the consistency of classification among
the three methods. Automatic classifications detect visually determined strongly barred galaxies
with the concordance of $74\% \sim 85\%$. However, they have some difficulty in identifying bars,
in particular, in bulge-dominated galaxies, which affects the distribution of bar fraction as
a function of the Hubble type. We obtain, for the same sample, different bar fractions of 63%, 48%,
and 36% by visual inspection, ellipse fitting, and Fourier analysis, respectively. The difference
is mainly due to how many weak bars are included. Moreover, we find the different dependence of bar
fraction on the Hubble type for strong versus weak bars: SBs are preponderant in early-type spirals
whereas SABs in late-type spirals. This causes a contradictory dependence on host galaxy properties
when different classification methods are used. We propose that strong bars and weak bars experience
different processes for their formation, growth, and dissipation by interacting with different
inner galactic structures of early-type and late-type spirals.
