The stability properties of a low density ultra relativistic pair beam produced in the intergalactic
medium by multi-TeV gamma-ray photons from blazars are analyzed. The problem is relevant for probes
of magnetic field in cosmic voids through gamma-ray observations. In addition, dissipation of
such beams could affect considerably the thermal history of the intergalactic medium and structure
formation. We use a Monte Carlo method to quantify the properties of the blazar induced electromagnetic
shower, in particular the bulk Lorentz factor and the angular spread of the pair beam generated by
the shower, as a function of distance from the blazar itself. We then use linear and nonlinear kinetic
theory to study the stability of the pair beam against the growth of electrostatic plasma waves,
employing the Monte Carlo results for our quantitative estimates. We find that the fastest growing
mode, like any perturbation mode with even a very modest component perpendicular to the beam direction,
cannot be described in the reactive regime. Due to the effect of non-linear Landau damping, which
suppresses the growth of plasma oscillations, the beam relaxation timescale is found significantly
longer than the inverse Compton loss time. Finally, density inhomogeneities associated with cosmic
structure induce loss of resonance between the beam particles and plasma oscillations, strongly
inhibiting their growth. We conclude that relativistic pair beams produced by blazars in the intergalactic
medium are stable on timescales long compared to the electromagnetic cascade's. There appears
to be little or no effect of pair-beams on the intergalactic medium.
