Correlations between the mass of a supermassive black hole and the properties of its host galaxy
(e.g., total stellar mass (M*), luminosity (Lhost)) suggest an evolutionary connection. A powerful
test of a co-evolution scenario is to measure the relations MBH-Lhost and MBH-M* at high redshift
and compare with local estimates. For this purpose, we acquired HST imaging with WFC3 of 32 X-ray-selected
broad-line AGN at 1.2<z<1.7 in deep survey fields. By applying state-of-the-art tools to decompose
the HST images including available ACS data, we measured the host galaxy luminosity and stellar
mass along with other properties through the 2D model fitting. The black hole mass was determined
using the broad Halpha line, detected in the near-infrared with Subaru/FMOS, which potentially
minimizes systematic effects using other indicators. We find that the observed ratio of MBH to total
M* is 2.7 times larger at z~1.5 than in the local universe, while the scatter is equivalent between
the two epochs. A non-evolving mass ratio is consistent with the data at the 2-3 sigma confidence
level when accounting for selection effects and their uncertainties. The relationship between
MBH-Lhost paints a similar picture. Therefore, our results cannot distinguish whether SMBHs and
their total M* and Lhost proceed in lockstep or whether the growth of the former somewhat overshoots
the latter, given the uncertainties. Based on a statistical estimate of the bulge-to-total mass
fraction, the ratio MBH/M* is offset from the local value by a factor of ~7 which is significant even
accounting for selection effects. Taken together, these observations are consistent with a scenario
in which stellar mass is subsequently transferred from an angular momentum supported component
of the galaxy to the pressure supported one through secular processes or minor mergers at a faster
rate than mass accretion onto the SMBH.
