We present a Chandra archival study of optically selected AGN pairs at a median redshift $\bar{z}
\sim$ 0.1. Out of 1286 AGN pairs (with projected separations $r_p < 100$ kpc and velocity offsets
$\Delta v < 600$ km s$^{-1}$) optically identified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data
Release, we find 67 systems with archival Chandra observations, which represent the largest sample
of optically selected AGN pairs studied in the X-ray. Among the 67 AGN pairs, 18 systems have both
nuclei detected in the X-rays, 39 have one nucleus detected in the X-rays, whereas 10 have no X-ray
detection. The X-ray detection rate, $75/134=56\%(\pm6\%~1\sigma$ Poisson errors), is significantly
higher than that ($23/134=17\%\pm4\%$) of a comparison sample of star-forming galaxy pairs, lending
support to the optical AGN classification. In the conservative case where X-ray contamination
from star formation is removed, the X-ray detection rate becomes $27\%\pm4\%$, consistent with
predictions from latest galaxy merger simulations. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity $L_{2-10~{\rm
keV}}$ increases with decreasing projected separation in AGN pairs for $r_p \gtrsim 15$ kpc, suggesting
an enhancement of black hole accretion even in early-stage mergers. On the other hand, $L_{2-10~{\rm
keV}}$ appears to decrease with decreasing projected separation at $r_p \lesssim 15$ kpc, which
is contradictory to predictions from merger simulations. The apparent decrease in $L_{2-10~{\rm
keV}}$ of AGN pairs at $r_p \lesssim 15$ kpc may be caused by: (i) enhanced absorbing columns from
merger-induced gas inflows, (ii) feedback effects from early-stage mergers, and/or (iii) small
number statistics. Future X-ray studies with larger samples are needed to put our results on firmer
statistical ground.
