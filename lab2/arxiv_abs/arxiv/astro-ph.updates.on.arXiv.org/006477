We present a detailed spectral analysis of the Black Hole Binary XTE J1752-223 in the hard state of
its 2009 outburst. Regular monitoring of this source by RXTE provided high signal-to-noise spectra
along the outburst rise and decay. During one full month this source stalled at $\sim$30\% of its
peak count rate at a constant hardness and intensity. By combining all the data in this exceptionally-stable
hard state, we obtained an aggregate PCA spectrum (3-45 keV) with 100 million counts, and a corresponding
HEXTE spectrum (20-140 keV) with 5.8 million counts. Implementing a version of our reflection code
with a physical model for Comptonization, we obtain tight constraints on important physical parameters
for this system. In particular, the inner accretion disk is measured very close in, at $R_\mathrm{in}=1.7\pm0.4$
$R_g$. Assuming $R_\mathrm{in}=R_\mathrm{ISCO}$, we find a relatively high black hole spin ($a_*=0.92\pm0.06$).
Imposing a lamppost geometry, we obtain a low inclination ($i=35\pm4$ deg), which agrees with the
upper limit found in the radio ($i<49$ deg). However, we note that this model cannot be statistically
distinguished from a non-lamppost model with free emissivity index, for which the inclination
is markedly higher. Additionally, we find a relatively cool corona ($57-70$ keV), and large iron
abundance ($3.3-3.7$ solar). We further find that properly accounting for Comptonization of the
reflection emission improves the fit significantly and causes an otherwise low reflection fraction
($\sim 0.2-0.3$) to increase by an order of magnitude, in line with geometrical expectations for
a lamppost corona. We compare these results with similar investigations reported for GX 339-4 in
its bright hard state.
