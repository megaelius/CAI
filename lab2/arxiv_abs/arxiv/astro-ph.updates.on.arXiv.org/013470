Low-mass planets that are in the process of growing larger within protoplanetary disks exchange
torques with the disk and change their semi-major axis accordingly. This process is called type
I migration and is strongly dependent on the underlying disk structure. As a result, there are many
uncertainties about planetary migration in general. In a number of simulations, the current type
I migration rates lead to planets reaching the inner edge of the disk within the disk lifetime. A new
kind of torque exchange between planet and disk, the thermal torque, aims to slow down inward migration
via the heating torque. The heating torque may even cause planets to migrate outwards, if the planetary
luminosity is large enough. Here, we study the influence on planetary migration of the thermal torque
on top of previous type I models. We find that the formula of Paardekooper et al. (2011) allows for
more outward migration than that of Jim\'enez & Masset (2017) in most configurations, but we also
find that planets evolve to very similar mass and final orbital radius using both formulae in a single
planet-formation scenario, including pebble and gas accretion. Adding the thermal torque can
introduce new, but small, regions of outwards migration if the accretion rates onto the planet correspond
to typical solid accretion rates following the pebble accretion scenario. If the accretion rates
onto the planets become very large, as could be the case in environments with large pebble fluxes
(e.g., high-metallicity environments), the thermal torque can allow more efficient outward migration.
However, even then, the changes for the final mass and orbital positions in our planet formation
scenario are quite small. This implies that for single planet evolution scenarios, the influence
of the heating torque is probably negligible.
