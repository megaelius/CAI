Most secondary sources of cosmic microwave background anisotropy (radio sources, dusty galaxies
-DSFGs-, thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich -tSZ- distortions from hot gas, and gravitational lensing)
are highly non-Gaussian. Statistics beyond the power spectrum are therefore potentially important
sources of information about the physics of these processes. We combine data from the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope and with data from the Planck satellite (only using Planck data in the overlapping region)
to constrain the amplitudes of a set of theoretical bispectrum templates from the tSZ effect, DSFGs,
gravitational lensing, and radio galaxies. We make a strong detection of radio galaxies (>5$\sigma$)
and have hints of non-Gaussianity arising from the tSZ effect, DSFGs, from cross-correlations
between the tSZ effect and DSFGs and from cross-correlations among the tSZ effect, DSFGs and radio
galaxies. These results suggest that the same halos host radio sources, DSFGs, and have tSZ signal.
We present a new method to calculate the non-Gaussian contributions to the template covariances.
Using this method we find significant non-Gaussian contributions to the variance and covariance
of our templates, with templates involving the tSZ effect most effected. Strong degeneracies exist
between the various sources at the current noise levels. In light of these degeneracies, combined
with theoretical uncertainty in the templates, these results are a demonstration of this technique.
With these caveats, we demonstrate the utility of future bispectrum measurements by using the tSZ
bispectrum measurement to constrain a combination of the amplitude of matter fluctuations and
the matter density to be $\sigma_8 \Omega_m^{0.17}=0.65^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$. Improvements in
signal to noise from upcoming observations will enable the separation of bispectrum components
and robust constraints on cosmological parameters.
