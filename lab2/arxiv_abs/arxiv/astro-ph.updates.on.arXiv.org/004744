We study large-scale inhomogeneous perturbations and instabilities of interacting dark energy
(IDE) models. Past analysis of large-scale perturbative instabilities, has shown that we can only
test IDE models with observational data when its parameter ranges are either $w_{x}\geq -1$ and
$\xi \geq 0,$ or $w_{x}\leq -1~$ and $~\xi \leq 0$, where $w_{x}$ is the dark energy equation of state
(EoS), and $\xi$ is a coupling parameter governing the strength and direction of the energy transfer.
We show that by adding a factor $(1+w_{x})$ to the background energy transfer, the whole parameter
space can be tested against all the data and thus, the instabilities in such interaction models can
be removed. We test three classes of interaction model using the latest astronomical data from different
sources. Precise constraints are found. Our analysis shows that a very small but non-zero deviation
from pure $\Lambda$-cosmology is suggested by the observational data while the no-interaction
scenario can be recovered at the 68.3% confidence-level. In particular, for three IDE models, identified
as IDE 1, IDE 2, and IDE 3, the 68.3% CL constraints on the interaction coupling strengths are, $\xi=
0.0360_{-0.0360}^{+0.0091}$ (IDE 1), $\xi= 0.0433_{-0.0433}^{+0.0062}$ (IDE 2), $\xi= 0.1064_{-0.1064}^{+0.0437}$
(IDE 3). In addition, we find that the dark energy EoS tends towards the phantom region taking the
68.3% CL constraints, $w_x= -1.0230_{-0.0257}^{+0.0329}$ (IDE 1), $w_x= -1.0247_{-0.0302}^{+0.0289}$
(IDE 2), and $w_x= -1.0275_{-0.0318}^{+0.0228}$ (IDE 3). However, the possibility of $w_{x}>-1$
is also not rejected by the astronomical data used here. Moreover, we find in all IDE models that,
as the value of Hubble constant decreases, the behavior of the dark energy EoS shifts from phantom
to quintessence type with its EoS very close to that a simple cosmological constant at the present
time.
