Finding solar siblings, that is, stars that formed in the same cluster as the Sun, will yield information
about the conditions at the Sun's birthplace. We search for solar sibling candidates in AMBRE, the
very large spectra database of solar vicinity stars. Since the ages and chemical abundances of solar
siblings are very similar to those of the Sun, we carried out a chemistry- and age-based search for
solar sibling candidates. We used high-resolution spectra to derive precise stellar parameters
and chemical abundances of the stars. We used these spectroscopic parameters together with Gaia
DR2 astrometric data to derive stellar isochronal ages. Gaia data were also used to study the kinematics
of the sibling candidates. From the about 17000 stars that are characterized within the AMBRE project,
we first selected 55 stars whose metallicities are closest to the solar value (-0.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.1
dex). For these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, alpha- and neutron-capture
elements, based on which we selected 12 solar sibling candidates with average abundances and metallicities
between -0.03 to 0.03 dex. Our further selection left us with 4 candidates with stellar ages that
are compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the 2 of the hottest candidates,
we derived the carbon isotopic ratios, which are compatible with the solar value. HD186302 is the
most precisely characterized and probably the most probable candidate of our 4 best candidates.
Very precise chemical characterization and age estimation is necessary to identify solar siblings.
We propose that in addition to typical chemical tagging, the study of isotopic ratios can give further
important information about the relation of sibling candidates with the Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic
age determinations of the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise isochronal ages.
