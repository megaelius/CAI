Context. Recent, nonlinear simulations of wave generation and propagation in full-star models
have been carried out in the anelastic approximation using spectral methods. Although it makes
long time steps possible, this approach excludes the physics of sound waves completely and rather
high artificial viscosity and thermal diffusivity are needed for numerical stability. Direct
comparison with observations is thus limited. Aims. We explore the capabilities of our compressible
multidimensional hydrodynamics code SLH to simulate stellar oscillations. Methods. We compare
some fundamental properties of internal gravity and pressure waves in 2D SLH simulations to linear
wave theory using two test cases: (1) an interval gravity wave packet in the Boussinesq limit and
(2) a realistic $3\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with a convective core and a radiative envelope.
Oscillation properties of the stellar model are also discussed in the context of observations.
Results. Our tests show that specialized low-Mach techniques are necessary when simulating oscillations
in stellar interiors. Basic properties of internal gravity and pressure waves in our simulations
are in good agreement with linear wave theory. As compared to anelastic simulations of the same stellar
model, we can follow internal gravity waves of much lower frequencies. The temporal frequency spectra
of velocity and temperature are flat and compatible with observed spectra of massive stars. Conclusion.
The low-Mach compressible approach to hydrodynamical simulations of stellar oscillations is
promising. Our simulations are less dissipative and require less luminosity boosting than comparable
spectral simulations. The fully-compressible approach allows the coupling of gravity and pressure
waves to be studied too.
