We report on the results of a multiwavelength monitoring campaign of the bright, nearby Seyfert
galaxy, Ark 120 using a ~50-day observing programme with Swift and a ~4-month co-ordinated ground-based
observing campaign, predominantly using the Skynet Robotic Telescope Network. We find Ark 120
to be variable at all optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths, with the variability observed to be well-correlated
between wavelength bands on short timescales. We perform cross-correlation analysis across all
available wavelength bands, detecting time delays between emission in the X-ray band and the Swift
V, B and UVW1 bands. In each case, we find that the longer-wavelength emission is delayed with respect
to the shorter-wavelength emission. Within our measurement uncertainties, the time delays are
consistent with the \tau ~ \lambda^{4/3} relation, as predicted by a disc reprocessing scenario.
The measured lag centroids are \tau_{cent} = 11.90 +/- 7.33, 10.80 +/- 4.08, and 10.60 +/- 2.87 days
between the X-ray and V, B, and UVW1 bands, respectively. These time delays are longer than those
expected from standard accretion theory and, as such, Ark 120 may be another example of an active
galaxy whose accretion disc appears to exist on a larger scale than predicted by the standard thin-disc
model. Additionally, we detect further inter-band time delays: most notably between the ground-based
I and B bands (\tau_{cent} = 3.46 +/- 0.86 days), and between both the Swift XRT and UVW1 bands and the
I band (\tau_{cent} = 12.34 +/- 4.83 and 2.69 +/- 2.05 days, respectively), highlighting the importance
of co-ordinated ground-based optical observations.
