We present a new pseudo-spectral open-source code nicknamed pizza. It is dedicated to the study
of rapidly-rotating Boussinesq convection under the 2-D spherical quasi-geostrophic approximation,
a physical hypothesis that is appropriate to model the turbulent convection that develops in planetary
interiors. The code uses a Fourier decomposition in the azimuthal direction and supports both a
Chebyshev collocation method and a sparse Chebyshev integration formulation in the cylindrically-radial
direction. It supports several temporal discretisation schemes encompassing multi-step time
steppers as well as diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta schemes. The code has been tested and validated
by comparing weakly-nonlinear convection with the eigenmodes from a linear solver. The comparison
of the two radial discretisation schemes has revealed the superiority of the Chebyshev integration
method over the classical collocation approach both in terms of memory requirements and operation
counts. The good parallelisation efficiency enables the computation of large problem sizes with
$\mathcal{O}(10^4\times 10^4)$ grid points using several thousands of ranks. This allows the
computation of numerical models in the turbulent regime of quasi-geostrophic convection characterised
by large Reynolds $Re$ and yet small Rossby numbers $Ro$. A preliminary result obtained for a strongly
supercritical numerical model with a small Ekman number of $10^{-9}$ and a Prandtl number of unity
yields $Re\simeq 10^5$ and $Ro \simeq 10^{-4}$. pizza is hence an efficient tool to study spherical
quasi-geostrophic convection in a parameter regime inaccessible to current global 3-D spherical
shell models.
