The gaseous mass of protoplanetary disks is a fundamental quantity in planet formation. The presence
of gas is necessary to assemble planetesimals, it determines timescales of giant planet birth,
and it is an unknown factor for a wide range of properties of planet formation, from chemical abundances
(X/H) to the mass efficiency of planet formation. The gas mass obtained from traditional tracers,
such as dust thermal continuum and CO isotopologues, are now known to have significant (1 - 2 orders
of magnitude) discrepancies. Emission from the isotopologue of H2, hydrogen deuteride (HD), offers
an alternative measurement of the disk gas mass. Of all of the regions of the spectrum, the far-infrared
stands out in that orders of magnitude gains in sensitivity can be gleaned by cooling a large aperture
telescope to 8 K. Such a facility can open up a vast new area of the spectrum to exploration. One of the
primary benefits of this far-infrared revolution would be the ability to survey hundreds of planet-forming
disks in HD emission to derive their gaseous masses. For the first time, we will have statistics on
the gas mass as a function of evolution, tracing birth to dispersal as a function of stellar spectral
type. These measurements have broad implications for our understanding of the time scale during
which gas is available to form giant planets, the dynamical evolution of the seeds of terrestrial
worlds, and the resulting chemical composition of pre-planetary embryos carrying the elements
needed for life. Measurements of the ground-state line of HD requires a space-based observatory
operating in the far-infrared at 112 microns.
