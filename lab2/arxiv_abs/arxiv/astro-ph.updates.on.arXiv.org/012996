Hierarchical code coupling strategies make it possible to combine the results of individual numerical
solvers into a self-consistent symplectic solution. We explore the possibility of allowing such
a coupling strategy to be non-intrusive. In that case, the underlying numerical implementation
is not affected by the coupling itself, but its functionality is carried over in the interface. This
method is efficient for solving the equations of motion for a self-gravitating system over a wide
range of scales. We adopt a dedicated integrator for solving each particular part of the problem
and combine the results to a self-consistent solution. In particular, we explore the possibilities
of combining the evolution of one or more microscopic systems that are embedded in a macroscopic
system. The here presented generalizations of Bridge include higher-order coupling strategies
(from the classic 2nd order up to 10th-order), but we also demonstrate how multiple bridges can be
nested and how additional processes can be introduced at the bridge time-step to enrich the physics,
for example by incorporating dissipative processes. Such augmentation allows for including additional
processes in a classic Newtonian N-body integrator without alterations to the underlying code.
These additional processes include for example the Yarkovsky effect, dynamical friction or relativistic
dynamics. Some of these processes operate on all particles whereas others apply only to a subset.
The presented method is non-intrusive in the sense that the underlying methods remain operational
without changes to the code (apart from adding the get- and set-functions to enable the bridge operator).
As a result, the fundamental integrators continue to operate with their internal time step and preserve
their local optimizations and parallelism. ... abridged ...
