PKS 1510-089 is a flat spectrum radio quasar strongly variable in the optical and GeV range. We search
for low-state VHE gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089. We aim to characterize and model the source
in a broad-band context, which would provide a baseline over which high states and flares could be
better understood. We use daily binned Fermi-LAT flux measurements of PKS 1510-089 to characterize
the GeV emission and select the observation periods of MAGIC during low state of activity. For the
selected times we compute the average radio, IR, optical, UV, X-ray and gamma-ray emission to construct
a low-state spectral energy distribution of the source. The broadband emission is modelled within
an External Compton scenario with a stationary emission region through which plasma and magnetic
field are flowing. We perform also the emission-model-independent calculations of the maximum
absorption in the broad line region (BLR) using two different models. Results. The MAGIC telescopes
collected 75 hrs of data during times when the Fermi-LAT flux measured above 1 GeV was below 3x10-8cm-2s-1,
which is the threshold adopted for the definition of a low gamma-ray activity state. The data show
a strongly significant (9.5{\sigma}) VHE gamma-ray emission at the level of (4.27+-0.61stat)x10-12cm-2s-1
above 150GeV, a factor 80 smaller than the highest flare observed so far from this object. Despite
the lower flux, the spectral shape is consistent with earlier detections in the VHE band. The broad-band
emission is compatible with the EC scenario assuming a large emission region located beyond the
BLR. For the first time the gamma-ray data allow us to place a limit on the location of the emission
region during a low gamma-ray state of a FSRQ. For the used model of the BLR, the 95% C.L. on the location
of the emission region allows us to place it at the distance >74% of the outer radius of the BLR.
