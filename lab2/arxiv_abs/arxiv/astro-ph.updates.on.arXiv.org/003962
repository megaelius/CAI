Aims. We analyze the properties of the sources in the NGC253 to define an up to date catalog of GC candidates
in the galaxy. Methods. Our analysis is based on the science verification data of two ESO survey telescopes,
VST and VISTA. Using ugri photometry from VST and JKs from VISTA, GC candidates were selected using
the morpho-photometric and color properties of spectroscopically confirmed GCs available in
the literature. The strength of the results was verified against available archival HST/ACS data
from the GHOSTS survey. Results. The adopted GC selection leads to the definition of a sample of ~350
GC candidates. At visual inspection, we find that 82 objects match all the requirements for selecting
GC candidates and 155 are flagged as uncertain GC candidate; 110 are unlikely GCs, most likely background
galaxies. Furthermore, our analysis shows that four of the previously spectroscopically confirmed
GCs, i.e., ~20% of the total spectroscopic sample, are more likely either background galaxies or
high-velocity Milky Way stars. The radial density profile of the selected best candidates shows
the typically observed r1/4-law radial profile. The analysis of the color distributions reveals
only marginal evidence of the presence of color bimodality, which is normally observed in galaxies
of similar luminosity. The GC luminosity function does not show the typical symmetry, mainly because
of the lack of bright GCs. Part of the bright GCs missing might be at very large galactocentric distances
or along the line of sight of the galaxy dusty disk. Conclusions. Using ugriJKs photometry we purged
the list of GCs with spectroscopic membership and photometric GC candidates in NGC 253. Our results
show that the use of either spectroscopic or photometric data only does not generally ensure a contaminant-free
sample and a combination of both spectroscopy and photometry is preferred.
