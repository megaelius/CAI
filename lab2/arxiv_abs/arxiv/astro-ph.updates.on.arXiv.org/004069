We review some applications of the method of electronic searching for historical observations
of sunspots and aurorae in the Chinese text corpus by Hayakawa et al. etc. However, we show strong
shortcomings in the digital search technique as applied by them: almost all likely true sunspot
and aurora records were presented before (e.g. Xu et al. 2000), which is not mentioned in those papers;
the remaining records are dubious and often refer to other phenomena, neither spots nor aurorae
(this also applies to Hayakawa et al. 2017c). Most of the above publications include very few Chinese
texts and translations, and their tables with abbreviated keywords do not allow the reader to consider
alternative interpretations (the tables also do not specify which records mention night-time).
We have compared some of their event tables with previously published catalogs and found various
discrepancies. There are also intrinsic inconsistencies, misleading information (lunar phase
for day-time events), and dating errors. We present Chinese texts and translations for some of their
presumable new aurorae: only one can be considered a likely true aurora (AD 604 Jan); some others
were selected on the sole basis of the use of the word "light" or "rainbow". Several alleged new aurorae
present observations beside the Sun during day-time. There are well-known comets among their presumable
aurorae. We also discuss, (i) whether "heiqi ri pang" can stand for black spot(s) "on one side of"
or "beside" the sun, (ii) aurora color confusion in Hayakawa et al. (2015, 2016), and (iii) whether
"white" and "unusual rainbows" can be aurorae.
