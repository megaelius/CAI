Pulsars around the Massive Black Hole (MBH) in the Galactic Center (GC) are expected to be revealed
by the incoming facilities (e.g., the Square Kilometre Array). Under a full relativistic framework
with the pulsar approximated as a test particle, we investigate the constraints on the spinning
of the MBH by monitoring the timing of surrounding pulsars. For GC pulsars orbiting closely around
the MBH (e.g., $\lesssim1000$AU), we find that full relativistic treatment in modeling accurately
their timing signals can be necessary, as the relativistic signals are orders of magnitude larger
than the time of arrival measurement accuracies. Although usually there are near-degeneracies
among MBH spin parameters, the constraints on the spinning of the MBH are still very tight. By continuously
monitoring a normal pulsar in orbits with a period of $\sim2.6$yr and an eccentricity of $0.3-0.9$
under timing precision of $1-5$ms, within $\sim 8$yr the spin magnitude and the orientations of
the GC MBH can be constrained with $2\sigma$ error of $10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ and $10^{-1}-10^\circ$,
respectively. Even for pulsars in orbits similar to the detected star S2/S0-2 or S0-102, we find
that the spinning of the MBH can still be constrained within $4-8$yr, with the most significant constraints
provided near the pericenter passage. If the proper motion of the pulsars with astrometric accuracy
of $10\mu$as can also be collected along with the timing measurement, then the position, velocity,
mass and the distance to the Solar System of the MBH can be constrained about $\sim10\mu$as, $\sim1\mu$as$/$yr,
$\sim 10 M_\odot$ and $\sim1$pc, respectively.
