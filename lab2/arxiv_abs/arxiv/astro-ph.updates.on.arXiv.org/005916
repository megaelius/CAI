We present an investigation of a large sample of confirmed (N=233) and candidate (N=54) Galactic
classical Be stars (mean V magnitude range of 6.4 to 12.6 mag), with the main aim of characterizing
their photometric variability. Our sample stars were preselected among early-type variables
using light curve morphology criteria. Spectroscopic information was gleaned from the literature,
and archival and newly-acquired spectra. Photometric variability was analyzed using archival
ASAS-3 time series data. To enable a comparison of results, we have largely adopted the methodology
of Labadie-Bartz et al. (2017), who carried out a similar investigation based on KELT data. Complex
photometric variations were established in most stars: outbursts on different time-scales (in
73$\pm$5% of stars), long-term variations (36$\pm$6%), periodic variations on intermediate
time-scales (1$\pm$1%) and short-term periodic variations (6$\pm$3%). 24$\pm$6% of the outbursting
stars exhibit (semi)periodic outbursts. We close the apparent void of rare outbursters reported
by Labadie-Bartz et al. (2017) and show that Be stars with infrequent outbursts are not rare. While
we do not find a significant difference in the percentage of stars showing outbursts among early-type,
mid-type and late-type Be stars, we show that early-type Be stars exhibit much more frequent outbursts.
We have measured rising and falling times for well-covered and well-defined outbursts. Nearly
all outburst events are characterized by falling times that exceed the rising times. No differences
were found between early-, mid- and late-type stars; a single non-linear function adequately describes
the ratio of falling time to rising time across all spectral subtypes, with the ratio being larger
for short events.
