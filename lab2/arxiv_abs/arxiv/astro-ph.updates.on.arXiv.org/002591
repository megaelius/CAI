In a previous paper it was shown that any dark sector model can be mapped into a non-adiabatic fluid
formed by two interacting components, one with zero pressure and the other with equation-of-state
parameter $\omega = -1$. It was also shown that the latter does not cluster and, hence, the former
is identified as the observed clustering matter. This guarantees that the dark matter power spectrum
does not suffer from oscillations or instabilities. It applies in particular to the generalised
Chaplygin gas, which was shown to be equivalent to interacting models at both background and perturbation
levels. In the present paper we test the non-adiabatic Chaplygin gas against the Hubble diagram
of type Ia supernovae, the position of the first acoustic peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic
microwave background and the linear power spectrum of large scale structures. We consider two different
samples of SNe Ia, namely the Constitution and SDSS compilations, both calibrated with the MLCS2k2
fitter, and for the power spectrum we use the 2dFGRS catalogue. The model parameters to be adjusted
are the present Hubble parameter, the present matter density and the Chaplygin gas parameter $\alpha$.
The joint analysis best fit gives $\alpha \approx - 0.5$, which corresponds to a constant-rate energy
flux from dark energy to dark matter, with the dark energy density decaying linearly with the Hubble
parameter. The $\Lambda$CDM model, equivalent to $\alpha = 0$, stands outside the $3\sigma$ confidence
interval. This result is still valid if we use, as supernovae samples, the SDSS and Union2.1 compilations
calibrated with the SALT2 fitter.
