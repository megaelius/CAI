V404 Cyg, Cyg X-3, V4641 Sgr, and GRS 1915+105 are among the brightest X-ray binaries and display
complex behavior in their multiwavelength emission. Apart from Cyg X-3, the other three sources
have large accretion disks, and there is evidence of a high orbital inclination. Therefore, any
large scale geometrical change in the accretion disk can cause local obscuration events. On the
other hand, Cyg X-3 orbits its Wolf-Rayet companion star inside the heavy stellar wind obscuring
the X-ray source. We study here whether the peculiar X-ray spectra observed from all four sources
can be explained by local obscuration events. We fit the source spectra with two physically motivated
models describing either a scenario where all the intrinsic emission is reprocessed in the surrounding
matter or where the emitter is surrounded by a thick torus with variable opening angle. We show that
the X-ray spectra during specific times are similar in all four sources likely arising from the high-density
environments where they are embedded. The fitted models suggest that a low-luminosity phase preceding
an intense flaring episode in the 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg is heavily obscured, but intrinsically
very bright (super-Eddington) accretion state. Similar spectral evolution to that of V404 Cyg
is observed from the recent, unusually low-luminosity state of GRS 1915+105. The modeling results
point to a geometry change in the (outflowing) obscuring matter in V404 Cyg and GRS 1915+105, which
is also linked to the radio (jet) evolution. All sources display obscured X-ray emission but with
different intrinsic luminosities which points towards different factors causing the obscuration.
This work highlights the importance of taking into account the reprocessing of the X-ray emission
in the surrounding medium in the modeling of the X-ray spectra that may well take place in other sources
as well.
