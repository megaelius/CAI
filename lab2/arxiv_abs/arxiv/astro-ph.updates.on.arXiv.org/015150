The size-mass galaxy distribution is a key diagnostic for galaxy evolution. Massive compact galaxies
are of particular interest as potential surviving relics of a high-redshift phase of star formation.
Some compact galaxies at low redshift could be nearly unresolved in SDSS imaging and thus not included
in galaxy samples. To overcome this, a sample was selected from the 9-band combination of SDSS and
UKIDSS photometry to r < 17.8. This was done in two stages: first using colour-colour selection,
and then by obtaining accurate photometric redshifts using scaled flux matching (SFM). Compared
to spectroscopic redshifts, SFM obtained a 1-sigma scatter of 0.0125 with only 0.3% outliers (|D
ln(1+z)| > 0.06). A sample of 163186 galaxies was obtained with 0.04 < z < 0.15 over 2300 deg^2 using
a combination of spec-z and photo-z. Following Barro et al., log S_1.5 = log M_* - 1.5 log r_50 was used
in order assess the completeness and number density of massive compact galaxies (log M_* > 10, log
S_1.5 > 10.5). The spectroscopic completeness was 76% for compact galaxies compared to 92% for normal-size
galaxies. This difference is primarily attributed to SDSS fibre collisions and not the completeness
of the main galaxy sample selection. Using environmental overdensities, this confirms that compact
quiescent galaxies are significantly more likely to be found in high-density environments compared
to normal-size galaxies. By comparison with a high-redshift sample from 3D-HST, log S_1.5 distribution
functions show significant evolution, with this being a compelling way to compare with simulations
such as EAGLE. The number density of compact quiescent galaxies drops by a factor of about 30 from
z ~ 2 to log (n / Mpc^-3) = -5.3 +- 0.4 in the SDSS-UKIDSS sample. The uncertainty is dominated by the
steep cut off in log S_1.5, which is demonstrated conclusively using this complete sample.
