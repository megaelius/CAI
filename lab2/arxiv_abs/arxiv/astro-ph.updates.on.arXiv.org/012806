We recently developed an automated method, auto-GMM, to kinematically decompose simulated galaxies.
It extracts the kinematic structures in an accurate, efficient, and unsupervised way. Here we use
auto-GMM to study the stellar kinematic structures of disk galaxies from the TNG100 run of the cosmological
suite IllustrisTNG. We identify four to five kinematic structures that are commonly present among
the diverse galaxy population. Structures having strong to moderate rotation are defined as cold
and warm disks, respectively. Spheroidal structures dominated by random motions are classified
as bulges or stellar halos, depending on how tightly bound they are. Disky bulges are defined as structures
that have moderate rotation but compact morphology. TNG100 returns multiple structures that have
reasonable properties, qualitatively consistent with our general expectations. Across all disky
galaxies and accounting for the stellar mass within 3 half-mass radii, the kinematic spheroidal
structures, obtained by summing up stars of bulges and halos, contribute $\sim 45\%$ of the total
stellar mass, while the disky structures constitute $\sim 55\%$. This study also provides important
insights about the relationship between kinematically and morphologically derived galactic
structures. Comparing the morphology of kinematic structures with that of traditional bulge+disk
decomposition, we conclude: (1) the morphologically decomposed bulges are composite structures
comprised of a slowly rotating bulge, an inner halo, and a disky bulge; (2) kinematically disky bulges,
akin to what are commonly called pseudo bulges in observations, are compact disk-like components
that have rotation similar to warm disks; (3) halos contribute almost $30\%$ of the surface density
of the outer part of morphological disks when viewed face-on; and (4) both cold and warm disks are
often truncated in central regions.
