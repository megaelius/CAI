The regions around the celestial poles offer the ability to find and characterize long-term variables
from ground-based observatories. We used multi-year Evryscope data to search for high-amplitude
(~5% or greater) variable objects among 160,000 bright stars (Mv < 14.5) near the South Celestial
Pole. We developed a machine learning based spectral classifier to identify eclipse and transit
candidates with M-dwarf or K-dwarf host stars - and potential low-mass secondary stars or gas giant
planets. The large amplitude transit signals from low-mass companions of smaller dwarf host stars
lessens the photometric precision and systematics removal requirements necessary for detection,
and increases the discoveries from long-term observations with modest light curve precision.
The Evryscope is a robotic telescope array that observes the Southern sky continuously at 2-minute
cadence, searching for stellar variability, transients, transits around exotic stars and other
observationally challenging astrophysical variables. In this study, covering all stars 9 < Mv
< 14.5, in declinations -75 to -90 deg, we recover 346 known variables and discover 303 new variables,
including 168 eclipsing binaries. We characterize the discoveries and provide the amplitudes,
periods, and variability type. A 1.7 Jupiter radius planet candidate with a late K-dwarf primary
was found and the transit signal was verified with the PROMPT telescope network. Further followup
revealed this object to be a likely grazing eclipsing binary system with nearly identical primary
and secondary K5 stars. Radial velocity measurements from the Goodman Spectrograph on the 4.1 meter
SOAR telescope of the likely-lowest-mass targets reveal that six of the eclipsing binary discoveries
are low-mass (.06 - .37 solar mass) secondaries with K-dwarf primaries, strong candidates for precision
mass-radius measurements.
