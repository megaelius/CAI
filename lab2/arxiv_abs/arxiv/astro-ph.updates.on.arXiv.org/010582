We consider a series of MHD simulations in which a small amplitude, transverse velocity perturbation
is introduced into a complex magnetic field. We analysed the deformation of the wave fronts as the
perturbation propagates through the braided magnetic structures and explore the nature of Alfv\'enic
wave phase mixing in this regime. Spatial gradients in the local Alfv\'en speed and variations in
the length of magnetic field lines ensure that small scales form throughout the propagating wave
front due to phase mixing. Additionally, the presence of complex, intricate current sheets associated
with the background field locally modifies the polarisation of the wave front. The combination
of these two effects enhances the rate of viscous dissipation, particularly in more complex field
configurations. Unlike in classical phase mixing configurations, the greater spatial extent
of Alfv\'en speed gradients ensures that wave energy is deposited over a larger cross-section of
the magnetic structure. Further, the complexity of the background magnetic field ensures that
small gradients in a wave driver can map to large gradients within the coronal plasma. The phase mixing
of MHD waves in a complex magnetic field will progress throughout the braided volume. As a result,
in a non-ideal regime wave energy will be dissipated over a greater cross-section than in classical
phase mixing models. The formation rate of small spatial scales in a propagating wave front is a function
of the complexity of the background magnetic field. As such, if the coronal field is sufficiently
complex it remains plausible that phase mixing induced wave heating can contribute to maintaining
observed temperatures. Furthermore, the weak compressibility of the transverse wave and the observed
phase mixing pattern may provide seismological information about the nature of the background
plasma.
