We investigate the potential for the emission lines OV] $\lambda\lambda$1213.8,1218.3 and HeII
$\lambda$1215.1 to contaminate flux measurements of Ly$\alpha$ $\lambda$1215.7 in the extended
nebulae of quasars. We have computed a grid of photoionization models with a substantial range in
the slope of the ionizing powerlaw (-1.5 $<$ $\alpha$ $<$ -0.5), gas metallicity (0.01 $<$ $Z/Z_{\odot}$
$<$ 3.0), gas density (1 $<$ $n_H$ $<$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$), and ionization parameter (10$^{-5}$ $<$
U $<$ 1.0). We find the contribution from HeII $\lambda$1215.1 to be negligible, i.e., $<$ 0.1 of
Ly$\alpha$ flux, across our entire model grid. The contribution from OV] $\lambda\lambda$1213.8,1218.3
is generally negligible when U is low (<10$^{-3}$) and/or when the gas metallicity is low ($Z/Z_{\odot}$
< 0.1). However, at higher values of U and Z we find that OV] can significantly contaminate Ly$\alpha$,
in some circumstances accounting for more than half the total flux of the Ly$\alpha$+HeII+OV] blend.
We also provide means to estimate the fluxes of OV] $\lambda\lambda$1213.8,1218.3 and HeII $\lambda$1215.1
by extrapolating from other lines. We estimate the fluxes of OV] and HeII for a sample of 107 Type 2
active galaxies at z$>$2, and find evidence for significant (>10\%) contamination of Ly$\alpha$
fluxes in the majority of cases (84\%). We also discuss prospects for using OV] $\lambda\lambda$1213.8,1218.3
as a diagnostic for the presence of AGN activity in high-z Ly$\alpha$ emitters, and caution that
the presence of significant OV] emission could impact the apparent kinematics of Ly$\alpha$, potentially
mimicking the presence of high-velocity gas outflows.
