Context: Very-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) {\gamma}-ray emission from blazars inevitably
gives rise to electron-positron pair production through the interaction of these {\gamma}-rays
with the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). Depending on the magnetic fields in the proximity
of the source, the cascade initiated from pair production can result in either an isotropic halo
around an initially beamed source or a magnetically broadened cascade flux. Aims: Both extended
pair halo (PH) and magnetically broadened cascade (MBC) emission from regions surrounding the
blazars 1ES 1101-232, 1ES 0229+200 and PKS 2155-304 were searched for, using VHE {\gamma}-ray data
taken with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), and high energy (HE; 100 MeV<E<100
GeV) {\gamma}-ray data with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Methods: By comparing the angular
distributions of the reconstructed gamma-ray events to the angular profiles calculated from detailed
theoretical models, the presence of PH and MBC was investigated. Results: Upper limits on the extended
emission around 1ES 1101-232, 1ES 0229+200 and PKS 2155-304 are found to be at a level of few percent
of the Crab nebula flux above 1 TeV, depending on the assumed photon index of the cascade emission.
Assuming strong Extra-Galactic Magnetic Field (EGMF) values, > 10$^{-12}$G, this limits the
production of pair halos developing from electromagnetic cascades. For weaker magnetic fields,
in which electromagnetic cascades would result in magnetically broadened cascades, EGMF strengths
in the range (0.3 - 3)$\times 10^{-15}$G were excluded for PKS 2155-304 at the 99% confidence level,
under the assumption of a 1 Mpc coherence length.
