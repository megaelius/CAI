Nine transiting Earth-sized planets have recently been discovered around nearby late M dwarfs,
including the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets and two planets discovered by the MEarth survey, GJ 1132b
and LHS 1140b. These planets are the smallest known planets that may have atmospheres amenable to
detection with JWST. Some orbit at distances where a planet could have surface liquid water. We present
model thermal emission and transmission spectra for each planet, varying the composition and surface
pressure of the atmosphere. We base the elemental compositions on those of Earth, Titan, and Venus,
and we calculate the molecular compositions assuming chemical equilibrium, which can strongly
depend on temperature. Both thermal emission and transmission spectra are sensitive to the atmospheric
composition; thermal emission spectra are also sensitive to surface pressure and temperature.
We predict each planet's observability with JWST. GJ 1132b and TRAPPIST-1b are excellent targets
for emission spectroscopy with JWST/MIRI, requiring less than 10 eclipse observations to detect
thermal emission. Emission photometry for TRAPPIST-1c requires 5--15 eclipses; LHS 1140b and
TRAPPIST-1d, TRAPPIST-1e, and TRAPPIST-1f, which could possibly have surface liquid water, may
be accessible with MIRI photometry for some atmospheric compositions. Seven of the nine planets
are strong candidates for transmission spectroscopy measurements with JWST, though the number
of transits required depends strongly on the planets' actual masses. Using the measured masses,
less than 20 transits are required for a 5-sigma detection of spectral features for GJ 1132b and six
of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Dedicated campaigns to measure the atmospheres of these nine planets
will allow us, for the first time, to probe formation and evolution processes of terrestrial planetary
atmospheres beyond our solar system.
