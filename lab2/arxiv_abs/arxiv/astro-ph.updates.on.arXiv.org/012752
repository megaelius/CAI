Utilizing more than 100 long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in the Swift-Ryan-2012 sample that include
the observed redshifts and jet angles, Le & Mehta performed a timely study of the rate-density of
LGRBs with an assumed broken power law GRB spectrum and obtained a GRB-burst-rate functional form
that gives acceptable fits to the preSwift and Swift redshift and jet angle distributions. The results
indicated an excess of LGRBs at redshift below $z \sim 2$ in the Swift sample. In this work, we are investigating
if the excess is caused by the cosmological Hubble constant $H_0$, the $\gamma$-ray energy released
$E_\gamma$, the low- and high-energy indices ($\alpha, \beta$) of the Band function, the minimum
and maximum jet angles $\theta_{\rm j,min}$ and $\theta_{\rm j, max}$, or that the excess is due
to a biased in the Swift-Ryan-2012 sample. Our analyses indicate that none of the above physical
parameters resolved the excess problem, but suggesting that the Swift-Ryan-2012~sample is biased
with possible afterglow selection effect. The following model physical parameter values provide
the best fit to the Swift-Ryan-2012 and preSwift~samples: the Hubble constant $H_0 = 72 \, {\rm km
s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, the energy released $E_\gamma \sim 4.47 \times 10^{51}$ erg, the energy indices
$\alpha \sim 0.9$ and $\beta \sim -2.13$, the jet angles of $\theta_{\rm j,max} \sim 0.8$ rad, and
$\theta_{\rm j, min} \sim 0.065$ and $\sim 0.04$ rad for preSwift and Swift, respectively, $s \sim
-1.55$ the jet angle power-law index, and a GRB formation rate that is similar to the Hopkins & Beacom
observed star formation history and as extended by Li. Using the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxy
Legacy Survey (SHOALS) Swift-Perley LGRB sample and applying the same physical parameter values
as above, however, our model provides consistent results with this data set and indicating no excess
of LGRBs at any redshift.
