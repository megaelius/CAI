The complete sample of large-perihelion nearly-parabolic comets discovered during the period
1901-2010 is studied starting from their orbit determination. Next, an orbital evolution that
includes three perihelion passages (previous-observed-next) is investigated where a full model
of Galactic perturbations and perturbations from passing stars have been incorporated. We show
that the distribution of planetary perturbations suffered by actual large-perihelion comets
during their passage through the Solar system has a deep, unexpected minimum around zero which indicates
a lack of "almost unperturbed" comets. By a series of simulations we show that this deep well is moderately
resistant to some diffusion of orbital elements of analysed comets. It seems reasonable to state
that the observed stream of these large-perihelion comets experienced a series of specific planetary
configurations when passing through the planetary zone. An analysis of the past dynamics of these
comets clearly shows that dynamically new comets may appear only when their original semimajor
axes are greater than 20 000 au. However, only for semimajor axes longer than 40 000 au dynamically
old comets are completely not present. We demonstrated that the observed $1/a_{\rm ori}$ distribution
exhibits a local minimum separating dynamically new from dynamically old comets. Long-term dynamical
studies reveal a large variety of orbital behaviour. Several interesting examples of action of
passing stars are also described, in particular the impact of Gliese 710 which will pass close to
the Sun in the future. However, none of the obtained stellar perturbations is sufficient to change
the dynamical status of analysed comets.
