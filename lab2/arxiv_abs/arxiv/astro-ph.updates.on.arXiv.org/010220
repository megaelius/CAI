Worldwide very long baseline radio interferometry arrays are expected to obtain horizon-scale
images of supermassive black hole candidates as well as of relativistic jets in several nearby active
galactic nuclei. This motivates the development of models for magnetohydrodynamic flows in strong
gravitational fields. The Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC) intends to aid with the modelling of
such sources by means of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations in arbitrary
stationary spacetimes. New additions were required to guarantee an accurate evolution of the magnetic
field when small and large scales are captured simultaneously. We discuss the adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) techniques employed in BHAC, essential to keep several problems computationally tractable,
as well as staggered-mesh-based constrained transport (CT) algorithms to preserve the divergence-free
constraint of the magnetic field, including a general class of prolongation operators for face-allocated
variables compatible with them. Through several standard tests, we show that the choice of divergence-control
method can produce qualitative differences in simulations of scientifically relevant accretion
problems. We demonstrate the ability of AMR to reduce the computational costs of accretion simulations
while sufficiently resolving turbulence from the magnetorotational instability. In particular,
we describe a simulation of an accreting Kerr black hole in Cartesian coordinates using AMR to follow
the propagation of a relativistic jet while self-consistently including the jet engine, a problem
set up-for which the new AMR implementation is particularly advantageous. The CT methods and AMR
strategies discussed here are being employed in the simulations performed with BHAC used in the
generation of theoretical models for the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration.
