We investigate the difference in the spatial distribution of the energy input for parametrizations
of different mechanisms to heat the corona of the Sun and possible impacts on the coronal emission.
We use a 3D MHD model of a solar active region as a reference and compare the Ohmic-type heating in this
model to parametrizations for alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) heating models,
in particular, we use Alfven wave and MHD turbulence heating. We extract the quantities needed for
these two parametrizations from the reference model and investigate the spatial distribution
of the heat input in all three cases, globally and along individual field lines. To study differences
in the resulting coronal emission we employ 1D loop models with a prescribed heat input based on the
heating rate we extracted along a bundle of field lines. On average, all heating implementations
show a roughly drop of the heating rate with height. This also holds for individual field lines. While
all mechanism show a concentration of the energy input towards the low parts of the atmosphere, for
individual field lines the concentration towards the footpoints is much stronger for the DC mechanisms
than for the Alfven wave AC case. In contrast, the AC model gives a stronger concentration of the emission
towards the footpoints. This is because the more homogeneous distribution of the energy input leads
to higher coronal temperatures and a more extended transition region. The significant difference
in the concentration of the heat input towards the foot points for the AC and DC mechanisms, and the
pointed difference in the spatial distribution of the coronal emission for these cases shows that
the two mechanisms should be discriminable by observations. Before drawing final conclusions,
these parametrizations should be implemented in new 3D models in a more self-consistent way.
