We examine Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage through H II regions regulated by turbulence and radiative
feedback in a giant molecular cloud in the context of fully-coupled radiation hydrodynamics (RHD).
The physical relations of the LyC escape with H I covering fraction, kinematics, spectral hardness,
and the emergent Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) line profiles are studied using a series of RHD turbulence
simulations performed with RAMSES-RT. The turbulence-regulated mechanism allows ionizing photons
to leak out at early times before the onset of supernova feedback. The LyC photons escape through
turbulence-generated low column density channels which are evacuated efficiently by radiative
feedback via photoheating-induced shocks across the D-type ionization fronts. Ly$\alpha$ photons
funnel through the photoionized channels along the paths of LyC escape, resulting in a diverse Ly$\alpha$
spectral morphology including narrow double-peaked profiles. The Ly$\alpha$ peak separation
is controlled by the residual H I column density of the channels and the line asymmetry correlates
with the porosity and multiphase structure of the H II region. This mechanism through the turbulent
H II regions can naturally reproduce the observed Ly$\alpha$ spectral characteristics of some
of LyC-leaking galaxies. This RHD turbulence-origin provides an appealing hypothesis to explain
high LyC leakage from very young ($\sim3$ Myr) star-forming galaxies found in the local Universe
without need of extreme galactic outflows nor supernova feedback. We discuss the implications
of the turbulent H II regions on other nebular emission lines and a possible observational test with
the Magellanic System and local blue compact dwarf galaxies as analogs of reionization-era systems.
