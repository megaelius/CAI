We describe a program to measure surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances to galaxies observed
in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), a photometric imaging survey covering $104~deg^2$
of the Virgo cluster in the ${u}^*,g,i,z$ bandpasses with the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope.
We describe the selection of the sample galaxies, the procedures for measuring the apparent $i$-band
SBF magnitude $\bar{i}$, and the calibration of the absolute $\bar{M}_i$ as a function of observed
stellar population properties. The multi-band NGVS data set provides multiple options for calibrating
the SBF distances, and we explore various calibrations involving individual color indices as well
as combinations of two different colors. Within the color range of the present sample, the two-color
calibrations do not significantly improve the scatter with respect to wide-baseline, single-color
calibrations involving $u^{*}$. We adopt the ${u}^*{-}z$ calibration as reference for the present
galaxy sample, with an observed scatter of 0.11 mag. For a few cases that lack good ${u}^*$ photometry,
we use an alternative relation based on a combination of $g{-}i$ and $g{-}z$ colors, with only a slightly
larger observed scatter of 0.12 mag. The agreement of our measurements with the best existing distance
estimates provides confidence that our measurements are accurate. We present a preliminary catalog
of distances for 89 galaxies brighter than $B_T\approx13.0$ mag within the survey footprint, including
members of the background M and W Clouds at roughly twice the distance of the main body of the Virgo
cluster. The extension of the present work to fainter and bluer galaxies is in progress.
