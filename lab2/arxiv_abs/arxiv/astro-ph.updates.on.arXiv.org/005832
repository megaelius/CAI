Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of the dark sector, once measurement systematic
errors can be controlled. In Refregier & Amara (2014), a calibration method based on forward modeling,
called MCCL, was proposed. This relies on fast image simulations (e.g., UFig; Berge et al. 2013)
that capture the key features of galaxy populations and measurement effects. The MCCL approach
has been used in Herbel et al. (2017) to determine the redshift distribution of cosmological galaxy
samples and, in the process, the authors derived a model for the galaxy population mainly based on
broad-band photometry. Here, we test this model by forward modeling the 40 narrow-band photometry
given by the novel PAU Survey (PAUS). For this purpose, we apply the same forced photometric pipeline
on data and simulations using Source Extractor (Bertin & Arnouts 1996). The image simulation scheme
performance is assessed at the image and at the catalogues level. We find good agreement for the distribution
of pixel values, the magnitudes, in the magnitude-size relation and the interband correlations.
A principal component analysis is then performed, in order to derive a global comparison of the narrow-band
photometry between the data and the simulations. We use a `mixing' matrix to quantify the agreement
between the observed and simulated sets of Principal Components (PCs). We find good agreement,
especially for the first three most significant PCs. We also compare the coefficients of the PCs
decomposition. While there are slight differences for some coefficients, we find that the distributions
are in good agreement. Together, our results show that the galaxy population model derived from
broad-band photometry is in good overall agreement with the PAUS data. This offers good prospect
for incorporating spectral information to the galaxy model by adjusting it to the PAUS narrow-band
data using forward modeling.
