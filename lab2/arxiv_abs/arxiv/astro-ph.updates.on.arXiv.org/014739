Hydrogen in rocky planet atmospheres has been invoked in arguments for extending the habitable
zone via N2-H2 and CO2-H2 greenhouse warming, and providing atmospheric conditions suitable for
efficient production of prebiotic molecules. On Earth and Super-Earth-sized bodies, where H2-rich
primordial envelopes are quickly lost to space, volcanic outgassing can act as a hydrogen source,
provided it balances with the loss rate from the top of the atmosphere. Here, we show that both Earth-like
and Mars-like planets can sustain atmospheric H2 fractions of several percent across relevant
magmatic fO2 ranges. In general this requires hydrogen escape to operate somewhat less efficiently
than the diffusion limit. We use a thermodynamical model of magma degassing to determine which combinations
of magma oxidation, volcanic flux, and hydrogen escape efficiency can build up appreciable levels
of hydrogen in a planet's secondary atmosphere. On a planet similar to the Archean Earth and with
a similar magmatic fO2, we suggest that the mixing ratio of atmospheric hydrogen could have been
in the range 0.2-3%. A planet erupting magmas around the Iron-Wustite (IW) buffer (i.e., ~3 log fO2
units lower than Archean Earth's), but with otherwise similar volcanic fluxes and H2 loss rates
to early Earth, could sustain an atmosphere with approximately 10-20% H2. For an early Mars-like
planet with magmas around IW, but a lower range of surface pressures and volcanic fluxes compared
to Earth, an atmospheric H2 mixing ratio of 2-8% is possible. On early Mars, this H2 mixing ratio could
be sufficient to deglaciate the planet. However, the sensitivity of these results to primary magmatic
water contents and volcanic fluxes show the need for improved constraints on the crustal recycling
efficiency and mantle water contents of early Mars.
