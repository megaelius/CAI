In this paper we report on the characterization of the Hamamatsu VUV4 (S/N: S13370-6152) Vacuum
Ultra-Violet (VUV) sensitive Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) as part of the development of
a solution for the detection of liquid xenon scintillation light for the nEXO experiment. Various
SiPM features, such as: dark noise, gain, correlated avalanches, direct crosstalk and Photon Detection
Efficiency (PDE) were measured in a dedicated setup at TRIUMF. SiPMs were characterized in the range
$163 \text{ } \text{K} \leq \text{T}\leq 233 \text{ } \text{K}$. At an over voltage of $3.1\pm0.2$
V and at $\text{T}=163 \text{ }\text{K}$ we report a number of Correlated Avalanches (CAs) per pulse
in the $1 \upmu\text{s}$ interval following the trigger pulse of $0.161\pm0.005$. At the same settings
the Dark-Noise (DN) rate is $0.137\pm0.002 \text{ Hz/mm}^{2}$. Both the number of CAs and the DN
rate are within nEXO specifications. The PDE of the Hamamatsu VUV4 was measured for two different
devices at $\text{T}=233 \text{ }\text{K}$ for a mean wavelength of $189\pm7\text{ nm}$. At $3.6\pm0.2$
V and $3.5\pm0.2$ V of over voltage we report a PDE of $13.4\pm2.6\text{ }\%$ and $11\pm2\%$, corresponding
to a saturation PDE of $14.8\pm2.8\text{ }\%$ and $12.2\pm2.3\%$, respectively. Both values are
well below the $24\text{ }\%$ saturation PDE advertised by Hamamatsu. More generally, the second
device tested at $3.5\pm0.2$ V of over voltage is below the nEXO PDE requirement. The first one instead
yields a PDE that is marginally close to meeting the nEXO specifications. This suggests that with
modest improvements the Hamamatsu VUV4 MPPCs could be considered as an alternative to the FBK-LF
SiPMs for the final design of the nEXO detector.
