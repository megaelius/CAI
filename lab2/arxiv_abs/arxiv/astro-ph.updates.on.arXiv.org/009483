Some M-dwarfs around F-/G-type stars have been measured to be hotter and larger than predicted by
stellar evolution models. Inconsistencies between observations and models need addressing with
more mass, radius and luminosity measurements of low-mass stars to test and refine evolutionary
models. Our aim is to measure the masses, radii and ages of the stars in five low-mass eclipsing binary
systems discovered by the WASP survey. We use WASP photometry to establish eclipse-time ephemerides
and to obtain initial estimates for the transit depth and width. Radial velocity measurements were
simultaneously fitted with follow-up photometry to find the best-fitting orbital solution. This
solution was combined with measurements of atmospheric parameters to interpolate evolutionary
models and estimate the mass of the primary star, and the mass and radius of the M-dwarf companion.
We assess how the best fitting orbital solution changes if an alternative limb-darkening law is
used and quantify the systematic effects of unresolved companions. We also gauge how the best-fitting
evolutionary model changes if different values are used for the mixing length parameter and helium
enhancement. We report the mass and radius of five M-dwarfs and find little evidence of inflation
with respect to evolutionary models. The primary stars in two systems are near the ``blue hook''
stage of their post sequence evolution, resulting in two possible solutions for mass and age. We
find that choices in helium enhancement and mixing-length parameter can introduce an additional
3-5\,\% uncertainty in measured M-dwarf mass. Unresolved companions can introduce an additional
3-8\% uncertainty in the radius of an M-dwarf, while the choice of limb-darkening law can introduce
up to an additional 2\% uncertainty.
