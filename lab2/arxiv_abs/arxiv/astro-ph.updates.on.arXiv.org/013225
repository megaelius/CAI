We present a comprehensive X-ray spectroscopy and imaging study of supernova remnant W49B using
archival XMM-Newton observations. The overionization state of the shocked ejecta in W49B is clearly
indicated by the radiative recombination continua of Si XIV, S XV, and Fe XXV, combined with the Ly$\alpha$
lines of Ca and Fe. The line flux images of W49B indicate high emission measures of the central bar-like
region for almost all the emission lines, while the equivalent width maps reveal a stratified structure
for the metal abundance distributions. The global spectrum of W49B is well reproduced by a model
containing one collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma component and two recombining
plasma (RP) components. The CIE plasma represents the shocked interstellar medium, which dominates
the X-ray emitting volume in W49B with a mass $\sim450M_\odot$. The two RP components with a total
mass $\sim4.6M_\odot$ are both dominated by the ejecta material, but characterized by different
electron temperatures ($\sim1.60$ keV and $\sim0.64$ keV). The recombination ages of the RP components
are estimated as $\sim6000$ yr and $\sim3400$ yr, respectively. We then reveal the possibility
of a thermal conduction origin for the high-temperature RP in W49B by calculating the conduction
timescale. The metal abundance ratios of the ejecta in W49B are roughly consistent with a core-collapse
explosion model with a $\lesssim15M_\odot$ progenitor, except for a rather high Mn/Fe. A Type Ia
origin can explain the Mn abundance, while it predicts much higher ejecta masses than observed values
for all the metal species considered in our analysis.
