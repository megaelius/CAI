This paper describes the observations and the first data release (DR1) of the ESO public spectroscopic
survey "VANDELS, a deep VIMOS survey of the CANDELS CDFS and UDS fields". VANDELS' main targets are
star-forming galaxies at 2.4<z<5.5 and massive passive galaxies at 1<z<2.5. By adopting a strategy
of ultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed to be the deepest
ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe. Exploiting the red sensitivity of the
VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has obtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000
A with sufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift galaxy evolution
via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the release of all spectra obtained during
the first season of observations and includes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the
total) scheduled integration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects
with a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D spectra, the associated
error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D spectra. We also provide a catalog with
the essential galaxy parameters, including spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags.
In this paper we present the survey layout and observations, the data reduction and redshift measurement
procedure and the general properties of the VANDELS-DR1 sample. We also discuss the spectroscopic
redshift distribution, the accuracy of the photometric redshifts and we provide some examples
of data products. All VANDELS-DR1 data are publicly available and can be retrieved from the ESO archive.
Two further data releases are foreseen in the next 2 years with a final release scheduled for June
2020 which will include improved re-reduction of the entire spectroscopic data set. (abridged)
