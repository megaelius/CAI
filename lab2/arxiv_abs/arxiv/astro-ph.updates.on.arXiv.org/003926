The ability to perform detailed chemical analysis of Sun-like F-, G-, and K-type stars is a powerful
tool with many applications including studying the chemical evolution of the Galaxy and constraining
planet formation theories. Unfortunately, complications in modeling cooler stellar atmospheres
hinders similar analysis of M-dwarf stars. Empirically-calibrated methods to measure M dwarf
metallicity from moderate-resolution spectra are currently limited to measuring overall metallicity
and rely on astrophysical abundance correlations in stellar populations. We present a new, empirical
calibration of synthetic M dwarf spectra that can be used to infer effective temperature, Fe abundance,
and Ti abundance. We obtained high-resolution (R~25,000), Y-band (~1 micron) spectra of 29 M dwarfs
with NIRSPEC on Keck II. Using the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere modeling code (version 15.5), we generated
a grid of synthetic spectra covering a range of temperatures, metallicities, and alpha-enhancements.
From our observed and synthetic spectra, we measured the equivalent widths of multiple Fe I and Ti
I lines and a temperature-sensitive index based on the FeH bandhead. We used abundances measured
from widely-separated solar-type companions to empirically calibrate transformations to the
observed indices and equivalent widths that force agreement with the models. Our calibration achieves
precisions in Teff, [Fe/H], and [Ti/Fe] of 60 K, 0.1 dex, and 0.05 dex, respectively and is calibrated
for 3200 K < Teff < 4100 K, -0.7 < [Fe/H] < +0.3, and -0.05 < [Ti/Fe] < +0.3. This work is a step toward detailed
chemical analysis of M dwarfs at a similar precision achieved for FGK stars.
