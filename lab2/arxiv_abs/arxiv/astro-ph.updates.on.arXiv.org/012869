The SOLIS (Seeds Of Life In Space) IRAM/NOEMA Large Program aims at studying a set of crucial complex
organic molecules in a sample of sources, with well-known physical structure, covering the various
phases of Solar-type star formation. One representative object of the transition from the prestellar
core to the protostar phases has been observed toward the Very Low Luminosity Object (VeLLO) called
L1521F. This type of source is important to study to make the link between prestellar cores and Class
0 sources and also to constrain the chemical evolution during the process of star formation. Two
frequency windows (81.6-82.6 GHz and 96.65-97.65 GHz) were used to observe the emission from several
complex organics toward the L1521F VeLLO. Only 2 transitions of methanol (A+, E2) have been detected
in the narrow window centered at 96.7 GHz (with an upper limit on E1) in a very compact emission blob
(~7'' corresponding to ~1000au) toward the NE of the L1521F protostar. The CS 2-1 transition is also
detected within the WideX bandwidth. Consistently, with what has been found in prestellar cores,
the methanol emission appears ~1000au away from the dust peak. The location of the methanol blob
coincides with one of the filaments previously reported in the literature. The Tex of the gas inferred
from methanol is (10$\pm$2) K, while the H2 gas density (estimated from the detected CS 2-1 emission
and previous CS 5-4 ALMA obs.) is a factor >25 higher than the density in the surrounding environment
(n(H2) >10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$). From its compactness, low excitation temperature and high gas density,
we suggest that the methanol emission detected with NOEMA is either a cold and dense shock-induced
blob, recently formed ($\leq$ few hundred years) by infalling gas or a cold and dense fragment that
may have just been formed as a result of the intense gas dynamics found within the L1521F VeLLO system.
