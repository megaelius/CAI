We present new models for the evolution of stars with mass in the range 1Msun < M < 7.5Msun, followed
from the pre-main-sequence through the asymptotic giant branch phase. The metallicity adopted
is $Z=3*10^{-4} (which, with an alpha-enhancement of +0.4, corresponds to [Fe/H]=-2). Dust formation
is described by following the growth of dust grains of various types as the wind expands from the stellar
surface. Models with mass M>3Msun experience Hot Bottom Burning, thus maintaining the surface
C/O below unity. Unlike higher Z models, the scarcity of silicon available in the envelope prevents
the formation of silicates in meaningful quantities, sufficient to trigger the acceleration of
the wind via radiation pressure on the dust grains formed. No silicate formation occurs below a threshold
metallicity of Z=10^{-3}. Low--mass stars, with M< 2.5Msun become carbon stars, forming solid
carbon dust in their surroundings. The total dust mass formed depends on the uncertain extent of
the inwards penetration of the convective envelope during the Third Dredge--Up episodes following
the Thermal Pulses. Carbon grains have sizes 0.08 micron < a_C < 0.12 micron and the total amount
of dust formed (increasing with the mass of the star) is M_C=(2-6)*10^{-4}Msun. Our results imply
that AGB stars with Z=3*10^{-4} can only contribute to carbon dust enrichment of the interstellar
medium on relatively long timescales, > 300 Myr, comparable to the evolutionary time of a 3Msun
star. At lower metallicities the scarcity of silicon available and the presence of Hot Bottom Burning
even in M< 2Msun, prevents the formation of silicate and carbon grains. We extrapolate our conclusion
to more metal--poor environments, and deduce that at Z < 10^{-4} dust enrichment is mostly due
to metal condensation in supernova ejecta.
