We present X-shooter at the Vewry Large Telescope observations of a sample of 10 luminous, X-ray
obscured QSOs at z$\sim1.5$ from the XMM-COSMOS survey, expected to be caught in the transitioning
phase from starburst to active galactic nucleus (AGN)-dominated systems. The main selection criterion
is X-ray detection at bright fluxes (L$>=10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) coupled to red optical-to-NIR-to-MIR
colors. Thanks to its large wavelength coverage, X-shooter allowed us to determine accurate redshifts
from the presence of multiple emission lines for five out of six targets for which we had only a photometric
redshift estimate, with an 80 percent success rate, significantly larger than what is observed
in similar programs of spectroscopic follow-up of red QSOs. We report the detection of broad and
shifted components in the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$5007,4959 complexes for six out of eight sources
with these lines observable in regions free from strong atmospheric absorptions. The full width
half-maximum (FWHM) associated with the broad components are in the range FWHM$\sim900-1600$
km s$^{-1}$, larger than the average value observed in SDSS Type 2 AGN samples at similar observed
[OIII] luminosity, but comparable to those observed for QSO/ultraluminous infrared galaxies
systems for which the presence of kpc scale outflows have been revealed through integral field unit
spectroscopy. Although the total outflow energetics (inferred under reasonable assumptions)
may be consistent with winds accelerated by stellar processes, we favour an AGN origin for the outflows
given the high outflow velocities oberved (v$>1000$ km s$^{-1}$) and the presence of strong
winds also in objects undetected in the far infrared.
