The physics of accretion during quiescence in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is poorly understood,
yet there are signs that accretion must be happening. Several LMXBs show variability during quiescence,
particularly striking is the case of the nearby neutron star Cen X-4. With the goal of unveiling the
real nature of its quiescent variability we conducted the first long-term, multiwavelength simultaneous
monitoring of Cen X-4, thanks to 60 observations performed by Swift on a daily basis. During those
observations, Cen X-4 is highly variable in all energy bands on timescales from days to months, with
the strongest quiescent short-term variability detected in the X-ray band, a factor of 22 drop in
only 4 days. The X-ray and the UV and optical emission are correlated on timescales down to less than
110 s. The shape of the correlation is a power law with index 0.2-0.6. The X-ray spectrum is well fitted
by a hydrogen NS atmosphere (kT=59-80 eV) and a power law (spectral index 1.4-2.0). The spectral
shape remains constant as the flux varies. Both components are varying in tandem with the X-ray flux,
with each responsible for about 50% of the total flux, implying that they are physically linked.
We conclude that the X-rays are likely generated by matter accreting down to the NS surface. Based
on the short timescale of the correlation, we also unambiguously demonstrate that the UV emission
cannot be due to thermal emission from the stream impact point, and neither to thermal emission from
a standard optically thick and geometrically thin disc. The UV emission is produced by reprocessing
most likely from the companion star. We found the accretion disc in quiescence to be UV faint. The
110 s correlation timescale suggests that the accreting matter could be in an advection dominated
accretion flow state (ADAF), which is likely UV faint, at a distance less to 6150 Schwarzschild Radii.
