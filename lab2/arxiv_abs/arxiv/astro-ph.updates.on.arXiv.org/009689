We consider a binary system composed of a pulsar and a massive, fast rotating, highly distorted main
sequence star as a potential scenario to dynamically put to the test certain post-Keplerian effects
of both Newtonian and post-Newtonian nature. We numerically produce time series of the perturbations
$\Delta\left(\delta\tau\right)$ of the R{\o}mer-like, orbital component of the pulsar's time
delay $\delta\tau$ induced over 10 years by the pN gravitoelectric mass monopole, quadrupole,
gravitomagnetic spin dipole and octupole accelerations along with the Newtonian quadrupolar
one. We do not deal with the various propagation time delays due to the travelling electromagnetic
waves. It turns out that, for a Be-type star with $M = 15\ \textrm{M}_\odot$, $R_\textrm{e} = 5.96\
\textrm{R}_\odot$, $\nu = 0.203$, $S = 3.41\times 10^{45}\ \textrm{J}\ \textrm{s}$, $J_2 = 1.92\times
10^{-3}$ orbited by a pulsar with an orbital period $P_\textrm{b}\simeq 40-70\ \textrm{d}$, the
classical oblateness-driven effects are at the $\lesssim 4-150\ \textrm{s}$ level, while the
pN shifts are of the order of $\lesssim 1.5-20\ \textrm{s}\ \left(GMc^{-2}\right)$, $\lesssim
10-40\ \textrm{ms}\ \left(GMR^2_\textrm{e} J_2 c^{-2}\right)$, $\lesssim 0.5 - 6\ \textrm{ms}\
\left(GSc^{-2}\right)$, $\lesssim 5 - 20\ \mu\textrm{s}\ \left(GSR^2_\textrm{e} \varepsilon^2
c^{-2}\right)$, depending on their orbital configuration. The root-mean-square (rms) timing
residuals $\sigma_{\tau}$ of almost all the existing non-recycled, non-millisecond pulsars
orbiting massive, fast rotating main sequence stars are $\lesssim\textrm{ms}$. Thus, such kind
of binaries have the potential to become interesting laboratories to measure, or, at least, constrain,
some Newtonian and post-Newtonian key features of the distorted gravitational fields of the fast
rotating stars hosted by them [Abridged].
