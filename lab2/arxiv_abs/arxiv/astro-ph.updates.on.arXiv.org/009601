On 27 Apr 2015, when 67P/C-G was at 1.76 au from the Sun and moving towards perihelion, the OSIRIS and
VIRTIS-M instruments on Rosetta observed the evolving dust and gas coma during a complete rotation
of the comet. We aim to characterize the dust, H2O and CO2 gas spatial distribution in the inner coma.
To do this we performed a quantitative analysis of the release of dust and gas and compared the observed
H2O production rate with the one calculated using a thermo-physical model. For this study we selected
OSIRIS WAC images at 612 nm (dust) and VIRTIS-M image cubes at 612 nm, 2700 nm (H2O) and 4200 nm (CO2).
We measured the average signal in a circular annulus, to study spatial variation around the comet,
and in a sector of the annulus, to study temporal variation in the sunward direction with comet rotation,
both at a fixed distance of 3.1 km from the comet centre. The spatial correlation between dust and
water, both coming from the sun-lit side of the comet, shows that water is the main driver of dust activity
in this time period. The spatial distribution of CO2 is not correlated with water and dust. There
is no strong temporal correlation between the dust brightness and water production rate as the comet
rotates. The dust brightness shows a peak at 0deg sub-solar longitude, which is not pronounced in
the water production. At the same epoch, there is also a maximum in CO2 production. An excess of measured
water production, with respect to the value calculated using a simple thermo-physical model, is
observed when the head lobe and regions of the Southern hemisphere with strong seasonal variations
are illuminated. A drastic decrease in dust production, when the water production (both measured
and from the model) displays a maximum, happens when typical Northern consolidated regions are
illuminated and the Southern hemisphere regions with strong seasonal variations are instead in
shadow.
