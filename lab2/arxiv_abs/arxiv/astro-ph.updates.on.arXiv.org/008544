Astronomical data are typically irregular in time, e.g. the space (HIPPARCOS/TYCHO, KEPLER, GAIA,
WISE etc.) and ground-based CCD (NSVS, ASAS, CRTS, SuperWASP etc.) and photographic (Harvard,
Sonneberg, Odessa etc.) photometrical surveys. This leads to cancellation of the conditions,
which lead to the orthogonality of the basic functions, and thus the simplified methods give biased
parameters of the approximations. We have elaborated a series of algorithms and programs for statistically
correct analysis, and have applied them to 2000+ variable stars of different types. The data were
obtained from an international collaboration in a frame of the "Inter-Longitude Astronomy" (ILA)
campaign. Some highlights of our studies are presented, with an extended list of our original publications.
The main improvements were done: 1) for the periodogram analysis - the parameters are determined
from a complete set of equations containing the (algebraic polynomial) trend superimposed on the
(multi-) harmonic wave, so no "detrending", no "prewhitening" are used; 2) for the approximations
- we use additional (multi-) harmonic waves, and also "special shapes" (patterns) for parts of the
light curve, which correspond to relatively fast changes (minima of the eclipsing binaries, minima
and maxima for the pulsating variables); 3) "auto correlation analysis" (ACF) - taking into account
the bias due to a trend removal (previously - only a subtraction of the sample mean was taken into account);
ACF for the irregularly spaced data; 4) for the signals with bad coherence, the "scalegram" analysis
is proposed, which allows to estimate a characteristic cycle length and the amplitude, as well as
to provide a realistic approximation; 5) the extension of the Morlet-type wavelet for more periodic
signals and 6) "running" (parabola, sine) approximations for aperiodic and "nearly periodic"
variations, respectively.
