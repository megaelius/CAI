ASTRI is a project aiming at the realization of a gamma-ray imaging Cherenkov telescope that observes
the sky in the TeV band. Recently, the development of a mini-array (MA) of ASTRI telescopes has been
funded by the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica. The ASTRI Comprehensive Data Challenge (ACDC)
project aims at optimizing the scientific exploitation and analysis techniques of the ASTRI MA,
by performing a complete end-to-end simulation of a tentative scientific program, from the generation
of suitable instrument response functions to the proposal, selection, analysis, and interpretation
of the simulated data. We assumed that the MA will comprise nine ASTRI telescopes arranged in a (almost)
square geometry (mean distance between telescopes of ~250m). We simulated three years of observations,
adopting a realistic pointing plan that takes into account, for each field, visibility constraints
for an assumed site in Paranal (Chile) and observational time slots in dark sky conditions. We simulated
the observations of nineteen Galactic and extragalactic fields selected for their scientific
interest, including several classes of objects (such as pulsar wind nebulae, supernova remnants,
gamma-ray binaries etc), for a total of 81 point-like and extended sources. Here we present an overview
of the ACDC project, providing details on the different software packages needed to carry out the
simulated three-years operation of the ASTRI MA. We discuss the results of a systematic analysis
applied on the whole simulated data, by making use of prototype science tools widely adopted by the
TeV astronomical community. Furthermore, particular emphasis is also given to some targets used
as benchmarks.
