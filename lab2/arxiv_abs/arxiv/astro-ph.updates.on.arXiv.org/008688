The asteroseismic modelling of period spacing patterns from gravito-inertial modes in stars with
a convective core is a high-dimensional problem. We utilise the measured period spacing pattern
of prograde dipole gravity modes (acquiring $\Pi_0$), in combination with the effective temperature
($T_{\rm eff}$) and surface gravity ($\log g$) derived from spectroscopy, to estimate the fundamental
stellar parameters and core properties of 37 $\gamma~$Doradus ($\gamma~$Dor) stars whose rotation
frequency has been derived from $\textit{Kepler}$ photometry. We make use of two 6D grids of stellar
models, one with step core overshooting and one with exponential core overshooting, to evaluate
correlations between the three observables $\Pi_0$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and $\log g$ and the mass, age,
core overshooting, metallicity, initial hydrogen mass fraction and envelope mixing. We provide
multivariate linear model recipes relating the stellar parameters to be estimated to the three
observables ($\Pi_0$, $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$). We estimate the (core) mass, age, core overshooting
and metallicity of $\gamma~$Dor stars from an ensemble analysis and achieve relative uncertainties
of $\sim\!10$ per cent for the parameters. The asteroseismic age determination allows us to conclude
that efficient angular momentum transport occurs already early on during the main sequence. We
find that the nine stars with observed Rossby modes occur across almost the entire main-sequence
phase, except close to core-hydrogen exhaustion. Future improvements of our work will come from
the inclusion of more types of detected modes per star, larger samples, and modelling of individual
mode frequencies.
