Approximately one-third of the gamma-ray sources in the third Fermi-LAT catalog are unidentified
or unassociated with objects at other wavelengths. Observations with Swift-XRT have yielded possible
counterparts in $\sim$30% of these source regions. The objective of this work is to identify the
nature of these possible counterparts, utilizing their gamma ray properties coupled with the Swift
derived X-ray properties. The majority of the known sources in the Fermi catalogs are blazars, which
constitute the bulk of the extragalactic gamma-ray source population. The galactic population
on the other hand is dominated by pulsars. Blazars and pulsars occupy different parameter space
when X-ray fluxes are compared with various gamma-ray properties. In this work, we utilize the X-ray
observations performed with the Swift-XRT for the unknown Fermi sources and compare their X-ray
and gamma-ray properties to differentiate between the two source classes. We employ two machine
learning algorithms, decision tree and random forest classifier, to our high signal-to-noise
ratio sample of 217 sources, each of which correspond to Fermi unassociated regions. The accuracy
score for both methods were found to be 97% and 99%, respectively. The random forest classifier,
which is based on the application of a multitude of decision trees, associated a probability value
(P$_{bzr}$) for each source to be a blazar. This yielded 173 blazar candidates with P$_{bzr}$ $\geq$
90% for each of these sources, and 134 of these possible blazar source associations had P$_{bzr}$
$\geq$ 99%. The results yielded 13 sources with P$_{bzr}$ $\leq$ 10%, which we deemed as reasonable
candidates for pulsars, 7 of which result with P$_{bzr}$ $\leq$ 1%. There were 31 sources that exhibited
intermediate probabilities and were termed ambiguous due to their unclear characterization as
a pulsar or a blazar.
