To better understand the origin and evolution of the Milky Way bulge, we have conducted a survey of
bulge red giant branch and clump stars using the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope.
We targeted ARGOS survey stars with pre-determined bulge memberships, covering the full metallicity
distribution function. The spectra have signal-to-noise ratios comparable to, and were analysed
using the same methods as the GALAH survey. In this work, we present the survey design, stellar parameters,
distribution of metallicity and alpha-element abundances along the minor bulge axis at latitudes
$b$ = $-10^{\circ}, -7.5^{\circ}$ and $-5^{\circ}$. Our analysis of ARGOS stars indicates that
the centroids of ARGOS metallicity components should be located $\approx$0.09 dex closer together.
The vertical distribution of $\alpha$-element abundances is consistent with the varying contributions
of the different metallicity components. Closer to the plane, alpha abundance ratios are lower
as the metal-rich population dominates. At higher latitudes, the alpha abundance ratios increase
as the number of metal-poor stars increases. However, we find that the trend of alpha-enrichment
with respect to metallicity is independent of latitude. Comparison of our results with those of
GALAH DR2 revealed that for [Fe/H] $\approx -0.8$, the bulge shares the same abundance trend as the
high-$\alpha$ disk population. However, the metal-poor bulge population ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -0.8$)
show enhanced alpha abundance ratios compared to the disk/halo. These observations point to fairly
rapid chemical evolution in the bulge, and that the metal-poor bulge population does not share the
same similarity with the disk as the more metal-rich populations.
