We spectroscopically detected 838 likely, 448 probable, and 265 possible strong lens candidates
within $\approx2$ million galaxy spectra contained within the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (eBOSS) from the sixteenth data release (DR16) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We
apply the spectroscopic detection method of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
Emission-Line Lens Survey (BELLS) and add Gaussian fit information, grading, additional inspection
observables, and additional inspection methods to improve our selection method. We observed 477
candidates with lensing evidence within low-resolution images from both the Legacy survey of SDSS-I/II
and the DESI Legacy survey, which is $12\%$ higher than the percentage of BELLS candidates observed
with similar lensing evidence. Our search within the latest and improved reductions of the BOSS
survey yielded a $20\%$ increase in the number of lens candidates expected from searching all BOSS
and eBOSS galaxies. The distribution of target and background redshifts of our candidates is similar
to the candidates and confirmed lenses within the BELLS observations. We present our Spectroscopic
Identification of Lensing Objects (SILO) candidates in a value-added catalogue (VAC) in SDSS DR16.
The examination of these lens candidates in follow-up high-resolution imaging may yield more than
twice the lenses found in previous spectroscopic detection surveys within SDSS, which would extend
the results of previous lens surveys within SDSS to higher redshifts, constrain models of mass structures
in spiral galaxies, and test if including the identification of possible lensing features within
low-resolution images has merit to spectroscopic detection programs.
