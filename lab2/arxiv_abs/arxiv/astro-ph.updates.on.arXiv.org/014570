In situ observations of energetic particles at the Earth's bow-shock attainable by the satellite
missions have long created an opinion that electrons are most efficiently accelerated in a quasi-perpendicular
shock geometry. However, shocks that deemed responsible for the production of cosmic ray electrons
and their radiation from sources such as supernova remnants are much more powerful and larger than
the Earth's bow-shock. Their remote observations suggest that electrons are accelerated very
efficiently in the quasi-parallel shocks as well. In this paper we investigate the possibility
that protons accelerated to high energies create sufficient wave turbulence necessary for the
electron preheating and subsequent injection into the diffusive shock acceleration in a quasi-parallel
shock geometry. An additional test-particle-electron population, meant as a low-density addition
to the electron core-distribution the hybrid simulation operates on, is introduced. Its purpose
is to investigate how these electrons are energized by the "hybrid" electromagnetic field. The
reduced spatial dimensionality allowed us to dramatically increase the number of macro-ions per
numerical cell and achieve the converged results for the velocity distributions of test-electrons.
We discuss the electron preheating mechanisms which can make a significant part of thermal electrons
accessible to the ion-driven waves observed in hybrid simulations. We find that the precursor wave
field supplied by ions has considerable potential to preheat the electrons before they are shocked
at the subshock. Our results indicate that a downstream thermal equilibration of the hot test-electrons
and protons does not occur. Instead, the resulting electron-to-proton temperature ratio is a decreasing
function of the shock Mach number, $M_\mathrm{A},$ tending to a saturation at high $M_\mathrm{A}.$
