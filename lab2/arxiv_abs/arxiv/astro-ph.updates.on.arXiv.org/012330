The space-borne gravitational wave interferometer, LISA, is expected to detect signals from numerous
binary white dwarfs. At small orbital separation, rapid rotation and large tidal bulges may allow
for the stellar internal structure to be probed through such observations. Finite-size effects
are encoded in quantities like the moment of inertia ($I$), tidal Love number (Love), and quadrupole
moment ($Q$). The universal relations among them (I-Love-Q relations) can be used to reduce the
number of parameters in the gravitational-wave templates. We here study I-Love-Q relations for
more realistic white dwarf models than used in previous studies. In particular, we extend previous
works by including (i) differential rotation and (ii) internal temperature profiles taken from
detailed stellar evolution calculations. We use the publicly available stellar evolution code
MESA to generate cooling models of both low- and high-mass white dwarfs. We show that differential
rotation causes the I-Q relation (and similarly the Love-Q relation) to deviate from that of constant
rotation. We also find that the introduction of finite temperatures causes the white dwarf to move
along the zero-temperature mass sequence of I-Q values, moving towards values that suggest a lower
mass. We further find that after only a few Myrs, high-mass white dwarfs are well-described by the
zero-temperature model, suggesting that the relations with zero-temperature may be good enough
in most practical cases. Low-mass, He-core white dwarfs with thick hydrogen envelopes may undergo
long periods of H burning which sustain the stellar temperature and allow deviations from the I-Love-Q
relations for longer times.
