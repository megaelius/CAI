The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect enables us to directly probe the density-weighted velocity
field up to very large cosmic scales. We investigate the effects of intrinsic alignments (IAs) of
dark-matter halo shapes on cosmic density and velocity fields on such large scales. In the literature
IAs have been detected up to $\sim 100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ using the gravitational shear-intrinsic
ellipticity correlation and the alignment correlation function. In this paper we introduce the
corresponding various velocity statistics: the (density-weighted) velocity-intrinsic ellipticity
correlation as well as the alignment pairwise infall momentum, momentum correlation function,
and density-weighted pairwise velocity dispersion. We derive theoretical expressions for these
velocity alignment statistics for the first time based on the assumption that the density fluctuation
is a Gaussian random field. Using large-volume, high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we measure
the alignment statistics of density and velocity fields. The behaviors of IAs in the velocity statistics
are similar to those in the density statistics, except that the halo orientations are aligned with
the velocity field up to scales larger than those with the density field, $r\gg 100~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$,
because of a factor of the wave number in the linear relation between the density and velocity fields
in Fourier space, $v\propto \delta/k$. We show that the detected IAs of the velocity field can be
well predicted by the linear alignment model. We also demonstrate that the baryon acoustic oscillation
features can be detected in both the conventional and alignment velocity statistics. Our results
indicate that observations of IAs with the velocity field on large scales can provide additional
information on cosmological models, complementary to those with the density field.
