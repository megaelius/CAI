We present multi-wavelength measurements of the thermal, chemical, and cloud contrasts associated
with the visibly dark formations (also known as 5-$\mu$m hot spots) and intervening bright plumes
on the boundary between Jupiter's Equatorial Zone (EZ) and North Equatorial Belt (NEB). Observations
made by the TEXES 5-20 $\mu$m spectrometer at the Gemini North Telescope in March 2017 reveal the
upper-tropospheric properties of 12 hot spots, which are directly compared to measurements by
Juno using the Microwave Radiometer (MWR), JIRAM at 5 $\mu$m, and JunoCam visible images. MWR and
thermal-infrared spectroscopic results are consistent near 0.7 bar. Mid-infrared-derived aerosol
opacity is consistent with that inferred from visible-albedo and 5-$\mu$m opacity maps. Aerosol
contrasts, the defining characteristics of the cloudy plumes and aerosol-depleted hot spots,
are not a good proxy for microwave brightness. The hot spots are neither uniformly warmer nor ammonia-depleted
compared to their surroundings at $p<1$ bar. At 0.7 bar, the microwave brightness at the edges of
hot spots is comparable to other features within the NEB. Conversely, hot spots are brighter at 1.5
bar, signifying either warm temperatures and/or depleted NH$_3$ at depth. Temperatures and ammonia
are spatially variable within the hot spots, so the precise location of the observations matters
to their interpretation. Reflective plumes sometimes have enhanced NH$_3$, cold temperatures,
and elevated aerosol opacity, but each plume appears different. Neither plumes nor hot spots had
microwave signatures in channels sensing $p>10$ bars, suggesting that the hot-spot/plume wave
is a relatively shallow feature.
