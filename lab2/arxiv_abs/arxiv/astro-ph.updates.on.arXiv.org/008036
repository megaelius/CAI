The Chromospheric Telescope (ChroTel) is a small 10-cm robotic telescope at Observatorio del Teide
on Tenerife (Spain), which observes the entire Sun in H$\alpha$, CaII K, and HeI 10830\AA. We present
a new calibration method that includes limb-darkening correction, removal of non-uniform filter
transmission, and determination of HeI Doppler velocities. Chromospheric full-disk filtergrams
are often obtained with Lyot filters, which may display non-uniform transmission causing large-scale
intensity variations across the solar disk. Removal of a 2D symmetric limb-darkening function
from full-disk images results in a flat background. However, transmission artifacts remain and
are even more distinct in these contrast-enhanced images. Zernike polynomials are uniquely appropriate
to fit these large-scale intensity variations of the background. The Zernike coefficients show
a distinct temporal evolution for ChroTel data, which is likely related to the telescope's alt-azimuth
mount that introduces image rotation. In addition, applying this calibration to sets of seven filtergrams
that cover the HeI triplet facilitates determining chromospheric Doppler velocities. To validate
the method, we use three data sets with varying levels of solar activity. The Doppler velocities
are benchmarked with respect to co-temporal high-resolution spectroscopic data of the GREGOR
Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS). Furthermore, this technique can be applied to ChroTel H$\alpha$
and CaII K data. The calibration method for ChroTel filtergrams can be easily adapted to other full-disk
data exhibiting unwanted large-scale variations. The spectral region of the HeI triplet is a primary
choice for high-resolution near-infrared spectropolarimetry. Here, the improved calibration
of ChroTel data will provide valuable context data.
