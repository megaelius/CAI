Axions are some of the best motivated particles beyond the Standard Model. We show how the attractive
self-interactions of dark matter (DM) axions over a broad range of masses, from $10^{-22}$ eV to
$10^7$ GeV, can lead to nongravitational growth of density fluctuations and the formation of bound
objects. This structure formation enhancement is driven by parametric resonance when the initial
field misalignment is large, and it affects axion density perturbations on length scales of order
the Hubble horizon when the axion field starts oscillating, deep inside the radiation-dominated
era. This effect can turn an otherwise nearly scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic perturbations
into one that has a spike at the aforementioned scales, producing objects ranging from dense DM halos
to scalar-field configurations such as solitons and oscillons. We call this class of cosmological
scenarios for axion DM production "the large-misalignment mechanism." We explore observational
consequences of this mechanism for axions with masses up to $10$ eV. For axions heavier than $10^{-5}$
eV, the compact axion halos are numerous enough to significantly impact Earth-bound direct detection
experiments, yielding intermittent but coherent signals with repetition rates exceeding one
per decade and crossing times less than a day. These episodic increases in the axion density and kinematic
coherence suggest new approaches for axion DM searches, including for the QCD axion. Dense structures
made up of axions from $10^{-22}$ eV to $10^{-5}$ eV are detectable through gravitational lensing
searches, and their gravitational interactions can also perturb baryonic structures and alter
star formation. At very high misalignment amplitudes, the axion field can undergo self-interaction-induced
implosions long before matter-radiation equality, producing potentially-detectable low-frequency
stochastic gravitational waves.
