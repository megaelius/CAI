Close binaries of supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs) with separations of $\lesssim 0.1$pc as
the final stage of galaxy mergers are sources of low frequency gravitational waves (GW), however,
they are still elusive observationally because they are not spatially resolved. Fortunately,
reverberation as echoes of broad emission lines to ionizing continuum conveys invaluable information
of the dynamics of broad-line regions (BLRs) governed by supermassive black holes in the central
regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we demonstrate how to composite the hybrid
2-dimensional transfer functions of binary BLRs around the CB-SMBHs in AGNs, providing an opportunity
of identifying them from reverberation mapping (RM) data. It is found that there are variation-coupling
effects in the transfer functions, arising from the coupling of CB-SMBH light curves in the Fourier
space. We provide semi-analytical formulations of the transfer functions for kinematic maps of
the gas. For cases with the simplest variation-coupling effects, we make calculations for several
BLR models and reveal significant distinctions from those of single active black holes. In principle,
the difference is caused by the orbital motion of the CB-SMBH systems. In order to search for CB-SMBHs
in time-domain space, selection of target candidates should focus on local AGNs with H$\beta$ double-peaked
profiles and weaker near-infrared emission. High-fidelity RM-campaigns of monitoring the targets
in future will provide opportunities to reveal these kinematic signatures of the CB-SMBHs and hence
for measurements of their orbital parameters.
