To date, no compelling evidence has been found that the universe has non-trivial spatial topology.
Meanwhile, anomalies in the observed CMB temperature map, such as the lack of correlations at large
angular separations, remain observationally robust. We show that if our universe is flat and has
one compact dimension of appropriate size (slab topology), this would suppress large-angle temperature
correlations while maintaining a low-$\ell$ angular power spectrum consistent with observations.
The optimal length appears to be $1.4$ times the conformal radius of the CMB's last scattering surface
($\chi_{rec}$). We construct the probability distribution function of the statistic $S_{1/2}$
using simulated Sachs-Wolf-only skies for each of several values of $L_z/\chi_{rec}$. For $L_z\simeq1.4\chi_{rec}$
the $p$-value of four standard masked Planck maps is $p\simeq0.15$, compared to $p\lesssim0.003$
for the conventional topologically trivial space. The mean angular power spectrum $\langle C_{\ell}
\rangle$ of the $L_z=1.4\chi_{rec}$ slab space matches the observed power spectrum at $2\leq\ell\lesssim6$
-- including a substantially suppressed quadrupole $C_2$, a slightly suppressed octopole $C_3$,
and unsuppressed higher multipoles. It does not predict other low-$\ell$ CMB anomalies, and does
not take account of normally sub-dominant Integrated Sachs Wolfe contributions. An $L_z=1.4\chi_{rec}$
slab topology is consistent with published limits from the Planck maps ($L_z\gtrsim1.12\chi_{rec}$).
It is within the 95% confidence range $1.2\leq L_z/\chi_{rec}\leq2.1$ inferred using the covariance-matrix
of temperature fluctuations. However, it violates published circles-in-the-sky limits from
WMAP and related unpublished limits from Planck ($L_z/\chi_{rec}\gtrsim1.9$). We remark on the
possibility to satisfy these limits, and "postdict" other large-angle anomalies, with closely
related topologies.
