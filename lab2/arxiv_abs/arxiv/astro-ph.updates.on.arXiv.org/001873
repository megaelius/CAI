We present the results of near-infrared (NIR) H- and K-band European Southern Observatory SINFONI
integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1433. We present emission and absorption
line measurements in the central kpc of NGC 1433. We detect a narrow Balmer line and several H2 lines.
We find that the stellar continuum peaks in the optical and NIR in the same position, indicating that
there is no covering of the center by a nuclear dust lane. A strong velocity gradient is detected in
all emission lines at that position. The position angle of this gradient is at 155\deg whereas the
galactic rotation is at a position angle of 201\deg. Our measures of the molecular hydrogen lines,
hydrogen recombination lines, and [Feii] indicate that the excitation at the nucleus is caused
by thermal excitation, i.e. shocks which can be associated with active galactic nuclei emission,
supernovae or outflows. The line ratios [Feii]/Pa{\beta} and H2/Br{\gamma} show a Seyfert to LINER
identification of the nucleus. The stellar continuum is dominated by spectral signatures of red-giant
M stars. The stellar line-of-sight velocity follows the galactic field whereas the light continuum
follows the nuclear bar. The dynamical center of NGC 1433 coincides with the optical and NIR center
of the galaxy and the black hole position. Within the central arcsecond, the molecular hydrogen
and the 12CO(3-2) emissions - observed in the NIR and in the sub-millimeter with SINFONI and ALMA,
respectively - are indicative for a nuclear outflow originating from the galaxy's SMBH. A small
circum nuclear disk cannot be fully excluded. Derived gravitational torques show that the nuclear
bar is able to drive gas inwards to scales where viscosity torques and dynamical friction become
important. The black hole mass derived using stellar velocity dispersion is 10^7 M_sun.
