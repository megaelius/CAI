Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and other solar eruptive phenomena can be physically linked by combining
data from a multitude of ground-based and space-based instruments alongside models, however this
can be challenging for automated operational systems. The EU Framework Package 7 HELCATS project
provides catalogues of CME observations and properties from the Helio- spheric Imagers onboard
the two NASA/STEREO spacecraft in order to track the evolution of CMEs in the inner heliosphere.
From the main HICAT catalogue of over 2,000 CME detections, an automated algorithm has been developed
to connect the CMEs observed by STEREO to any corresponding solar flares and active region (AR) sources
on the solar surface. CME kinematic properties, such as speed and angular width, are compared with
AR magnetic field properties, such as magnetic flux, area, and neutral line characteristics. The
resulting LOWCAT catalogue is also compared to the extensive AR property database created by the
EU Horizon 2020 FLARECAST project, which provides more complex magnetic field parameters derived
from vector magnetograms. Initial statistical analysis has been undertaken on the new data to provide
insight into the link between flare and CME events, and characteristics of eruptive ARs. Warning
thresholds determined from analysis of the evolution of these parameters is shown to be a useful
output for operational space weather purposes. Parameters of particular interest for further
analysis include total unsigned flux, vertical current, and current helicity. The automated method
developed to create the LOWCAT catalogue may also be useful for future efforts to develop operational
CME forecasting.
