YZ Phe is a very short-period contact binary (Sp.= K2 V) with an orbital period of 0.2347 days near
the short period limit (0.22\,d). Here we present the complete light curves in $VRI$ bands, which
photometric data were obtained with the 0.61-m reflector of PROMPT-8 at CTIO in Chile during June
to October 2016 and August 2017. The photometric solutions were determined by using the W-D method
and results reveal that YZ Phe is a W-subtype shallow contact binary ($f$ = 10\%, q (W) = 2.635 or q =
0.379 in general meaning) with the variations of size and location of spot on the more massive component,
showing a strong O'Connell effect with light-curve variations and long-term magnetic activity
cycles. By compiling all available eclipse times, the result shows a long-term period decrease
at a rate of $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = -1.32(\pm 0.02)\times 10^{-8}$ d $yr^{-1}$, superimposed
on a cyclic variation ($A_3$ = 0.0081 days and $P_3$ = 40.76 years). The cyclic change can be interpreted
by the light-travel time effect via the presence of a cool third body. Based on photometric solutions,
the third light was detected with 2\% of total light in V and I bands. Those support the existence of
a third body. For the long-term period change, it can be explained by mass transfer from the more massive
component ($M_2 \sim 0.74 M_{\odot}$) to the less massive one ($M_1 \sim 0.28 M_{\odot}$) or plus
AML via magnetic braking. With q $<$ 0.4 and long-term period decrease, all suggest that YZ Phe is
on the AML-controlled state and its fill-out factor will increase as well as the system will evolve
into a deeper normal contact binary.
