We present observations of DES16C2nm, the first spectroscopically confirmed hydrogen-free superluminous
supernova (SLSN-I) at redshift z~2. DES16C2nm was discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Supernova
Program, with follow-up photometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, and the European
Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope supplementing the DES data. Spectroscopic observations
confirm DES16C2nm to be at z=1.998, and spectroscopically similar to Gaia16apd (a SLSN-I at z=0.102),
with a peak absolute magnitude of U=-22.26$\pm$0.06. The high redshift of DES16C2nm provides a
unique opportunity to study the ultraviolet (UV) properties of SLSNe-I. Combining DES16C2nm with
ten similar events from the literature, we show that there exists a homogeneous class of SLSNe-I
in the UV (~2500A), with peak luminosities in the (rest-frame) U band, and increasing absorption
to shorter wavelengths. There is no evidence that the mean photometric and spectroscopic properties
of SLSNe-I differ between low (z<1) and high redshift (z>1), but there is clear evidence of diversity
in the spectrum at <2000A, possibly caused by the variations in temperature between events. No significant
correlations are observed between spectral line velocities and photometric luminosity. Using
these data, we estimate that SLSNe-I can be discovered to z=3.8 by DES. While SLSNe-I are typically
identified from their blue observed colors at low redshift (z<1), we highlight that at z>2 these
events appear optically red, peaking in the observer-frame z-band. Such characteristics are critical
to identify these objects with future facilities such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, Euclid,
and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, which should detect such SLSNe-I to z=3.5, 3.7, and
6.6, respectively.
