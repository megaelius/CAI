It is now clear that binarity plays a crucial role in many aspects of planetary nebulae (PNe), particularly
the striking morphologies they exhibit. To date, there are ~60 known bCSPNe. However, both theory
and observation indicates that this represents only the tip of the iceberg, with the Galactic PN
population hosting orders of magnitude more. We are involved in a search for new bCSPNe to enhance
the statistical validation of the key role of binarity in the formation and shaping of PNe. New discoveries
of bCSPNe and their characterization carry important implications not only for understanding
PN evolution, but also for studying binary evolution and the poorly-understood common-envelope
phase. We used data from the TESS satellite to search for variability in the eight CSPNe that belong
to the two-minute cadence preselected targets in Cycle 1, with their available pipeline-extracted
light curves. We identified strong periodicities and analysed them in the context of the binary
scenario.All the CSPNe but one (Abell15) show clear signs of periodic variability in TESS. The cause
of this variability can be attributed to different effects, some of them requiring the presence
of a companion star. We find simple sinusoidal modulations in several of the systems, compatible
with irradiation effects. In addition, two of the central stars (PG1034+001 and NGC5189) also show
photometric variations due to ellipsoidal variations and other signs of variability probably
caused by star spots or relativistic Doppler-beaming. The case of the well-studied Helix Nebula
is of particular interest: here we constructed a series of binary models to explain the modulations
we see in the light curve. We find that the variability constrains the possible companion to be very
low-mass main-sequence star or sub-stellar object. We also identify, in substantial detail, the
individual pulsation frequencies of NGC246.
