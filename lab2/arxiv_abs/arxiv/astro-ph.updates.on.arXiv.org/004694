Chemical disequilibrium in planetary atmospheres has been proposed as a generalized method for
detecting life on exoplanets through remote spectroscopy. Among solar system planets with substantial
atmospheres, the modern Earth has the largest thermodynamic chemical disequilibrium due to the
presence of life. However, how this disequilibrium changed over time and, in particular, the biogenic
disequilibria maintained in the anoxic Archean or less oxic Proterozoic eons are unknown. We calculate
the atmosphere-ocean disequilibrium in the Precambrian using conservative proxy- and model-based
estimates of early atmospheric and oceanic compositions. We omit crustal solids because subsurface
composition is not detectable on exoplanets, unlike above-surface volatiles. We find that (i)
disequilibrium increased through time in step with the rise of oxygen; (ii) both the Proterozoic
and Phanerozoic may have had remotely detectable biogenic disequilibria due to the coexistence
of O$_{2}$, N$_{2}$, and liquid water; and (iii) the Archean had a biogenic disequilibrium caused
by the coexistence of N$_2$, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and liquid water, which, for an exoplanet twin, may
be remotely detectable. On the basis of this disequilibrium, we argue that the simultaneous detection
of abundant CH$_{4}$ and CO$_{2}$ in a habitable exoplanet's atmosphere is a potential biosignature.
Specifically, we show that methane mixing ratios greater than 0.001 are potentially biogenic,
whereas those exceeding 0.01 are likely biogenic due to the difficulty in maintaining large abiotic
methane fluxes to support high methane levels in anoxic atmospheres. Biogenicity would be strengthened
by the absence of abundant CO, which should not coexist in a biological scenario.
