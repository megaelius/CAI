Understanding the galaxy-halo connection is fundamental for contemporary models of galaxy clustering.
The extent to which the haloes' assembly history and environment impact galaxy clustering (a.k.a.
galaxy assembly bias; GAB), remains a complex and challenging problem. Using a semi-analytic galaxy
formation model, we study the individual contributions of different secondary halo properties
to the GAB signal. These are obtained by comparing the clustering of stellar-mass selected samples
to that of shuffled samples where the galaxies are randomly reassigned to haloes of fixed mass and
a specified secondary halo property. We explore a large range of internal halo properties and environmental
measures. We find that commonly-used properties like the halo age or concentration amount to only
20-30% of the signal, while the smoothed matter density or the tidal anisotropy can explain the full
level of GAB (though care should be given to the specific definition). For the ``successful'' measures,
we examine the occupancy variations and the associated changes in the halo occupation function
parameters. These are used to create mock catalogues which reproduce the full level of GAB. Finally,
we propose a practical modification of the standard halo occupation distribution model, which
can be tuned to any level of assembly bias. Fitting the parameters to our semi-analytic model, we
demonstrate that the corresponding mock catalogue recovers the target level of GAB as well as the
occupancy variations. Our results enable producing realistic mock catalogues and directly inform
theoretical modelling of assembly bias and attempts to detect it in the Universe.
