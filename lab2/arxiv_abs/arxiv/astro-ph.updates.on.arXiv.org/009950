In this first paper of the series, we present initial results of newly upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio
Telescope (uGMRT) observation of European Large-Area ISO Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1) at 325 MHz
with 32 MHz bandwidth. Precise measurement of fluctuations in Galactic and extragalactic foreground
emission as a function of frequency as well as angular scale is necessary for detecting redshifted
21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from Cosmic Dawn, Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and post-reionization
epoch. Here, for the first time we have statistically quantified the Galactic and extragalactic
foreground sources in the ELAIS-N1 field in the form of angular power spectrum using the newly developed
Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE). We have calibrated the data with and without direction-dependent
calibration techniques. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of TGE against the direction dependent
effects by using higher tapering of field of view (FoV). We have found that diffuse Galactic synchrotron
emission (DGSE) dominates the sky, after point source subtraction, across the angular multipole
range $ 1115 \leqslant \mathcal{\ell} \leqslant 5083 $ and $ 1565 \leqslant \mathcal{\ell} \leqslant
4754 $ for direction-dependent and -independent calibrated visibilities respectively. The statistical
fluctuations in DGSE has been quantified as a power law of the form $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{\ell}}=
A \mathcal{\ell}^{-\beta} $. The best fitted values of (A, $\beta$) are ($ 62 \pm 6$ $mK^{2}$, $2.55
\pm 0.3 $) and ($ 48 \pm 4$ $mK^{2}$, $2.28 \pm 0.4 $ ) for the two different calibration approaches.
For both the cases, the power law index is consistent with the previous measurements of DGSE in other
parts of sky.
