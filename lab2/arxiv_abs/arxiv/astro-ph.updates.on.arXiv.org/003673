The slow solar wind exhibits strong variability on timescales from minutes to days, in addition
to changing with the heliosphere on longer timescales from months to years. While the large-scale
changes are likely due to the emerging or restructuring of coronal flux, the small-scale variability
in magnetic field and plasma properties is likely related to magnetic reconnection processes in
the extended solar corona. Higginson et al. (2017b) presented a numerical magnetohydrodynamic
simulation which showed that interchange magnetic reconnection is ubiquitous and most likely
responsible for releasing much of the slow solar wind, in particular along topological features
known as the Separatrix-Web (S-Web). Here, we analyze that simulation further, focusing on two
specific aspects of structured slow solar wind variability. First, we examine the evolution of
three-dimensional magnetic flux ropes formed at the top of the helmet streamer belt by reconnection
in the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). Second, we examine the simulated remote and in situ signatures
of the large-scale torsional Alfv\'en wave (TAW) which propagates along an S-Web arc to high latitudes.
We describe the similarities and differences between the reconnection-generated flux ropes in
the HCS, which resemble the well-known "streamer blob" observations, and the similarly structured
TAW. We discuss the implications of our results for the complexity of the HCS and surrounding plasma
sheet, and the potential for particle acceleration, as well as the interchange reconnection scenarios
which may generate TAWs in the solar corona. We consider our simulation results within the context
of future Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter observations, and discuss predictions for the dynamic
slow solar wind in the extended corona and inner heliosphere.
