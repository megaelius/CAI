We present continuum and molecular line emission ALMA observations of OH 231.8+4.2, a well studied
bipolar nebula around an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. The high angular resolution (~0.2-0.3
arcsec) and sensitivity of our ALMA maps provide the most detailed and accurate description of the
overall nebular structure and kinematics of this object to date. We have identified a number of outflow
components previously unknown. Species studied in this work include 12CO, 13CO, CS, SO, SO2, OCS,
SiO, SiS, H3O+, Na37Cl, and CH3OH. The molecules Na37Cl and CH3OH are first detections in OH 231.8+4.2,
with CH3OH being also a first detection in an AGB star. Our ALMA maps bring to light the totally unexpected
position of the mass-losing AGB star (QX Pup) relative to the large-scale outflow. QX Pup is enshrouded
within a compact (<60 AU) parcel of dust and gas (clump S) in expansion (V~5-7 km/s) that is displaced
by 0.6arcsec to the south of the dense equatorial region (or waist) where the bipolar lobes join.
Our SiO maps disclose a compact bipolar outflow that emerges from QX Pup's vicinity. This outflow
is oriented similarly to the large-scale nebula but the expansion velocities are about ten times
lower (~35 km/s). We deduce short kinematical ages for the SiO outflow, ranging from ~50-80 yr, in
regions within ~150 AU, to ~400-500 yr at the lobe tips (~3500 AU). Adjacent to the SiO outflow, we
identify a small-scale hourglass-shaped structure (mini-hourglass) that is probably made of
compressed ambient material formed as the SiO outflow penetrates the dense, central regions of
the nebula. The lobes and the equatorial waist of the mini-hourglass are both radially expanding
with a constant velocity gradient. The mini-waist is characterized by extremely low velocities,
down to ~1 km/s at ~150 AU, which tentatively suggest the presence of a stable structure. (abridged)
