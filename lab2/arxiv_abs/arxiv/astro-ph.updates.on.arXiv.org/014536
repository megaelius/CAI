The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to observe galaxies at $z>10$ that are presently
inaccessible. Here, we use a self-consistent empirical model, the UniverseMachine, to generate
mock galaxy catalogues and lightcones over the redshift range $z=0-15$. These data include realistic
galaxy properties (stellar masses, star formation rates, and UV luminosities), galaxy-halo relationships,
and galaxy-galaxy clustering. Mock observables are also provided for different model parameters
spanning observational uncertainties at $z<10$. We predict that Cycle 1 JWST surveys will very
likely detect galaxies with $M_*>10^7 M_\odot$ and/or $M_{1500}<-17$ out to at least $z\sim 13.5$.
Number density uncertainties at $z>12$ expand dramatically, so efforts to detect $z>12$ galaxies
will provide the most valuable constraints on galaxy formation models. The faint-end slopes of
the stellar mass/luminosity functions at a given mass/luminosity threshold steepen as redshift
increases. This is because observable galaxies are hosted by haloes in the exponentially falling
regime of the halo mass function at high redshifts. Hence, these faint-end slopes are robustly predicted
to become shallower below current observable limits ($M_\ast < 10^7M_\odot$ or $M_\mathrm{1500}>-17$).
For reionization models, extrapolating luminosity functions with a constant faint-end slope
from $M_{1500}=-17$ down to $M_{1500}=-12$ gives the most reasonable upper limit for the total
UV luminosity and cosmic star formation rate up to $z\sim 12$. We compare to three other empirical
models and one semi-analytic model, showing that the range of predicted observables from our approach
encompasses predictions from other techniques. Public catalogues and lightcones for common fields
are available online.
