Stars which start their lives with spectral types O and early-B are the progenitors of core-collapse
supernovae, long gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars, and black holes. These massive stars are the
primary sources of stellar feedback in star-forming galaxies. At low metallicities, the properties
of massive stars and their evolution are not yet fully explored. Here we report a spectroscopic study
of 320 OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The data, which we obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope,
were analyzed using state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere models. We find that stellar winds of
our sample stars are much weaker than theoretically expected. The stellar rotation rates show a
bi-modal distribution. The well-populated upper Hertzsprung-Russell diagram including our
sample OB stars from SMC Wing as well as additional evolved stars all over SMC from the literature
shows a strict luminosity limit. The comparison with single-star evolutionary tracks suggests
a dichotomy in the fate of massive stars in the SMC. Only stars with Minit<30M$_{\odot}$ seem to evolve
from the main sequence to the cool side of the HRD to become a red supergiant and to explode as type II-P
supernova. In contrast, stars with Minit>30M$_{\odot}$ appear to stay always hot and might evolve
quasi chemically homogeneously, finally collapsing to relatively massive black holes. However,
we find no indication that chemical mixing is correlated with rapid rotation. We report extended
star-formation episodes in a quiescent low-density region of the Wing, which is progressing stochastically.
We measure the key parameters of stellar feedback and establish the links between the rates of star
formation and supernovae. Our study reveals that in metal-poor environments the stellar feedback
is dominated by core-collapse supernovae in combination with winds and ionizing radiation supplied
by a few of the most massive stars.
