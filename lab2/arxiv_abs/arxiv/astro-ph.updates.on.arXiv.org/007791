Radio continuum (RC) emission in galaxies allows us to measure star formation rates (SFRs) unaffected
by extinction due to dust, of which the low-frequency part is uncontaminated from thermal (free-free)
emission. We calibrate the conversion from the spatially resolved 140 MHz RC emission to the SFR
surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) at 1 kpc scale. We used recent observations of three galaxies
(NGC 3184, 4736, and 5055) from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS), and archival LOw-Frequency
ARray (LOFAR) data of NGC 5194. Maps were created with the facet calibration technique and converted
to radio $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ maps using the Condon relation. We compared these maps with hybrid $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ maps from a combination of GALEX far-ultraviolet and Spitzer 24 $\mu\rm m$ data using plots
tracing the relation at $1.2\times 1.2$-kpc$^2$ resolution. The RC emission is smoothed with respect
to the hybrid $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ owing to the transport of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs). This results
in a sublinear relation $(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})_{\rm RC} \propto [(\Sigma_{\rm SFR})_{\rm hyb}]^{a}$,
where $a=0.59\pm 0.13$ (140 MHz) and $a=0.75\pm 0.10$ (1365 MHz). Both relations have a scatter
of $\sigma = 0.3~\rm dex$. If we restrict ourselves to areas of young CREs ($\alpha > -0.65$; $I_\nu
\propto \nu^\alpha$), the relation becomes almost linear at both frequencies with $a\approx 0.9$
and a reduced scatter of $\sigma = 0.2~\rm dex$. We then simulate the effect of CRE transport by convolving
the hybrid $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ maps with a Gaussian kernel until the RC-SFR relation is linearised;
CRE transport lengths are $l=1$-5 kpc. Solving the CRE diffusion equation, we find diffusion coefficients
of $D=(0.13$-$1.5) \times 10^{28} \rm cm^2\,s^{-1}$ at 1 GeV. A RC-SFR relation at $1.4$ GHz can
be exploited to measure SFRs at redshift $z \approx 10$ using $140$ MHz observations.
