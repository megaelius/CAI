The kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
induced by scattering from free electrons in bulk motion, is a primary target of future CMB experiments.
Measurements of the kSZ effect have the potential to address fundamental questions about the structure
and evolution of our Universe on the largest scales and at the earliest times. This potential is unlocked
by combining measurements of small-scale CMB anisotropies with large-scale structure surveys,
a technique known as kSZ tomography. Previous work established a quadratic estimator for the remote
dipole field, the CMB dipole observed at different locations in the Universe. This previous work
did not include gravitational lensing, redshift space distortions, or non-linear evolution of
structure. In this paper, we investigate how well the remote dipole field can be reconstructed in
the presence of such effects by using mock data from a suite of simulations. To properly model both
large and small scales, we develop a novel box-in-box simulation pipeline, where small-scale information
is obtained from N-body simulations, and large-scale information obtained by evolving fields
using linear theory and adding the resulting corrections to the N-body particle data. This pipeline
allows us to create properly correlated maps of the primary CMB including lensing, as well as the
kSZ effect and density maps on the past light cone of an observer. Analyzing an ensemble of mocks,
we find that the dipole field can be reconstructed with high fidelity over a range of angular scales
and redshift bins, although there is evidence of excess power from nonlinear structure. We also
analyze correlations with the primary CMB, investigating the ability of kSZ tomography to reconstruct
the intrinsic CMB dipole. Our results constitute a proof-of-principle that kSZ tomography is a
promising technique for future datasets.
