Horizon Run 5 (HR5) is a cosmological hydrodynamics simulation which captures the properties of
the Universe on a Gpc scale while achieving a resolution of 1 kpc. This enormous dynamic range allows
us to simultaneously capture the physics of the cosmic web on very large scales and account for the
formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies on much smaller scales. Inside the simulation box we zoom-in
on a high-resolution cuboid region with a volume of 1049x114x114 Mpc^3. The sub-grid physics chosen
to model galaxy formation includes radiative heating/cooling, reionization, star formation,
supernova feedback, chemical evolution tracking the enrichment of oxygen and iron, the growth
of supermassive black holes and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in the form of a dual jet-heating
mode. For this simulation we implemented a hybrid MPI-OpenMP version of the RAMSES code, specifically
targeted for modern many-core many thread parallel architectures. For the post-processing, we
extended the Friends-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm and developed a new galaxy finder to analyse the
large outputs of HR5. The simulation successfully reproduces many observations, such as the cosmic
star formation history, connectivity of galaxy distribution and stellar mass functions. The simulation
also indicates that hydrodynamical effects on small scales impact galaxy clustering up to very
large scales near and beyond the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. Hence, caution should
be taken when using that scale as a cosmic standard ruler: one should carefully understand the corresponding
biases. The simulation is expected to be an invaluable asset for the interpretation of upcoming
deep surveys of the Universe.
