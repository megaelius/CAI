I present a new framework for modeling the dynamics of tidal streams. The framework consists of simple
models for the initial action-angle distribution of tidal debris, which can be straightforwardly
evolved forward in time. Taking advantage of the essentially one-dimensional nature of tidal streams,
the transformation to position-velocity coordinates can be linearized and interpolated near
a small number of points along the stream, thus allowing for efficient computations of a stream's
properties in observable quantities. I illustrate how to calculate the stream's average location
(its "track"') in different coordinate systems, how to quickly estimate the dispersion around
its track, and how to draw mock stream data. As a generative model, this framework allows one to compute
the full probability distribution function and marginalize over or condition it on certain phase-space
dimensions as well as convolve it with observational uncertainties. This will be instrumental
in proper data analysis of stream data. In addition to providing a computationally-efficient practical
tool for modeling the dynamics of tidal streams, the action-angle nature of the framework helps
elucidate how the observed width of the stream relates to the velocity dispersion or mass of the progenitor,
and how the progenitors of "orphan"' streams could be located. The practical usefulness of the proposed
framework crucially depends on the ability to calculate action-angle variables for any orbit in
any gravitational potential. A novel method for calculating actions, frequencies, and angles
in any static potential using a single orbit integration is described in an Appendix.
