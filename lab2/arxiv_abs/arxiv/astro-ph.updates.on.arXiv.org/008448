Cosmic rays interacting with gas and photon fields in the Galaxy produce interstellar gamma-ray
emission (IGE), which accounts for almost 50% of the photons detected at gamma-ray energies. Models
of this IGE have to be very accurate for interpreting the high-quality observations by present gamma-ray
telescopes, such as Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Standard models of IGE, used as reference
models for analyses of the Fermi LAT data, show spatial discrepancies with respect to the data, underlining
the necessity of more realistic models. The same CR electrons that produce the inverse-Compton
component of the IGE produce also interstellar synchrotron emission observed in radio and microwave.
However, present standard models do not take advantage of results coming from studies of this interstellar
synchrotron emission. Accounting for such results, in this work we show how they affect the calculated
spatial maps of the large-scale inverse-Compton component of the IGE, which are usually used in
studies of Fermi LAT data. It is found that these results significantly affect these spatial model
maps even at a 60% level. In particular, propagation models based on synchrotron studies produce
a more peaked inverse-Compton emission in the inner Galaxy region with respect to the standard models
used to analyze Fermi LAT data. The conclusion is that radio and microwave observations can be included
in a multifrequency self-consistent approach for a more accurate modeling of the IGE finalized
to a physical comprehensive interpretation of gamma-ray data and its present unexplained features.
Model parameters are provided, which supply a more realistic basis for high-energy gamma-ray studies.
