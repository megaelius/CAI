Context The Vela Molecular Ridge is one of the nearest (700 pc) giant molecular cloud (GMC) complexes
hosting intermediate-mass (up to early B, late O stars) star formation, and is located in the outer
Galaxy, inside the Galactic plane. Vela C is one of the GMCs making up the Vela Molecular Ridge, and
exhibits both sub-regions of robust and sub-regions of more quiescent star formation activity,
with both low- and intermediate(high)-mass star formation in progress. Aims We aim to study the
individual and global properties of dense dust cores in Vela C, and aim to search for spatial variations
in these properties which could be related to different environmental properties and/or evolutionary
stages in the various sub-regions of Vela C. Methods We mapped the submillimetre (345 GHz) emission
from vela C with LABOCA (beam size 19.2", spatial resolution ~0.07 pc at 700 pc) at the APEX telescope.
We used the clump-finding algorithm CuTEx to identify the compact submillimetre sources. We also
used SIMBA (250 GHz) observations, and Herschel and WISE ancillary data. The association with WISE
red sources allowed the protostellar and starless cores to be separated, whereas the Herschel dataset
allowed the dust temperature to be derived for a fraction of cores. The protostellar and starless
core mass functions (CMFs) were constructed following two different approaches, achieving a mass
completeness limit of 3.7 Msun. Results We retrieved 549 submillimetre cores, 316 of which are starless
and mostly gravitationally bound (therefore prestellar in nature). Both the protostellar and
the starless CMFs are consistent with the shape of a Salpeter initial mass function in the high-mass
part of the distribution. Clustering of cores at scales of 1--6 pc is also found, hinting at fractionation
of magnetised, turbulent gas.
