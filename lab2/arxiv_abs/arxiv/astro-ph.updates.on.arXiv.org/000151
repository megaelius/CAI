We investigate the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar mass, in the redshift
range 0.5<z<1.1, using the first ~55000 redshifts from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift
Survey (VIPERS). To characterize the spatial properties of the VIPERS galaxies, we measure the
redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCF), and the projected correlation function,
in samples covering different ranges of B-band absolute magnitudes and stellar masses. We consider
both threshold and binned galaxy samples, with median B-band absolute magnitudes -21.6<MB-5log(h)<-19.5
and median stellar masses 9.8<log(M*[Msun/h^2] <10.7. We assess the real-space clustering
in the data from the projected correlation function, that we model as a power-law in the range 0.2<r_p[Mpc/h]<20.
Finally, we estimate the galaxy bias as a function of luminosity, stellar mass and redshift, assuming
a flat {\Lambda} cold dark matter model to derive the dark matter 2PCF. We provide the best-fit parameters
of the power-law model assumed for the real-space 2PCF - the correlation length and the slope - as
well as the linear bias parameter, as a function of the B-band absolute magnitude, stellar mass and
redshift. We find a clear luminosity and stellar mass dependence of the galaxy clustering at all
redshifts, with more luminous and massive galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude, in agreement
with previous studies. Our analysis provides new constraints on galaxy formation models that now
have to match the observed redshift evolution of the clustering of VIPERS galaxies in a broad range
of luminosity and stellar masses, between z=0.5 and z=1.1.
