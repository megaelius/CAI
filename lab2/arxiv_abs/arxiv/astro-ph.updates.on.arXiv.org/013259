Aims. To demonstrate that `INDICATE' is a powerful spatial analysis tool which when combined with
kinematic data from Gaia DR2 can be used to robustly probe star formation history. Methods. We compared
the dynamic & spatial distributions of young stellar objects (YSOs) at various evolutionary stages
in NGC 2264 using Gaia DR2 proper motion data and INDICATE. Results. The dynamic & spatial behaviours
of YSOs at different evolutionary stages are distinct. Dynamically, Class II YSOs predominately
have non-random trajectories that are consistent with known substructures, whereas Class III
YSOs have random trajectories with no clear expansion or contraction patterns. Spatially, there
is a correlation between the evolutionary stage and source concentration: 69.4% of Class 0/I, 27.9%
of Class II, and 7.7% of Class III objects are found to be clustered. The proportion of YSOs clustered
with objects of the same class also follows this trend. Class 0/I objects are both found to be more
tightly clustered with the general populous/objects of the same class than Class IIs and IIIs by
a factor of 1.2/4.1 and 1.9/6.6, respectively. An exception to these findings is within 0.05deg
of S Mon where Class III objects mimic the behaviours of Class II sources across the wider cluster
region. Our results suggest (i) current YSOs distributions are a result of dynamical evolution,
(ii) prolonged star formation has been occurring sequentially, and (iii) stellar feedback from
S Mon is causing YSOs to appear as more evolved sources. Conclusions. Designed to provide a quantitative
measure of clustering behaviours, INDICATE is a powerful tool with which to perform rigorous spatial
analyses. Our findings are consistent with what is known about NGC 2264, effectively demonstrating
that when combined with kinematic data from Gaia DR2 INDICATE can be used to robustly study the star
formation history of a cluster.
