Our knowledge of the magnetism in white dwarfs is based on an observational dataset that is biased
in favour of stars with very strong magnetic fields. Most of the field measurements available in
the literature have a relatively low sensitivity, while current instruments allow us to detect
magnetic fields of white dwarfs with sub-kG precision. With the aim of obtaining a more complete
view of the incidence of magnetic fields in degenerate stars, we have started a long-term campaign
of high-precision spectropolarimetric observations of white dwarfs. Here we report the results
obtained so far with the low-resolution FORS2 instrument of the ESO VLT and the medium-resolution
ISIS instrument of the WHT. We have considered a sample of 48 stars, of which five are known magnetic
or suspected magnetic stars, and obtained new longitudinal magnetic field measurements with a
mean uncertainty of about 0.6 kG. Overall, in the course of our survey (the results of which have been
partially published in papers devoted to individual stars) we have discovered one new weak-field
magnetic white dwarf, confirmed the magnetic nature of another, found that a suspected magnetic
star is not magnetic, and suggested two new candidate magnetic white dwarfs. Even combined with
data previously obtained in the literature, our sample is not sufficient yet to reach any final conclusions
about the actual incidence of very weak magnetic fields in white dwarfs, but we have set the basis
to achieve a homogeneous survey of an unbiased sample of white dwarfs. As a by-product, our survey
has also enabled us to carry out a detailed characterisation of the ISIS and the FORS2 instruments
for the detection of extremely weak magnetic fields in white dwarfs, and in particular to relate
the S/N to measurement uncertainty for white dwarfs of different spectral types. This study will
help the optimisation of future observations.
