Robust measurements of cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys rely on our understanding
of systematic effects that impact the observed galaxy density field. In this paper we present, validate,
and implement the idea of adopting the systematics mitigation method of Artificial Neural Networks
for modeling the relationship between the target galaxy density field and various observational
realities including but not limited to Galactic extinction, seeing, and stellar density. Our method
by construction does not assume a fitting model a priori and is less prone to over-training by performing
k-fold cross-validation and dimensionality reduction via backward feature elimination. By permuting
the choice of the training, validation, and test sets, we construct a selection mask for the entire
footprint. We apply our method on the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS)
Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) selection from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) DR7
data and show that the spurious large-scale contamination due to imaging systematics can be significantly
reduced by up-weighting the observed galaxy density using the selection mask from the neural network
and that our method is more effective than the conventional linear and quadratic polynomial functions.
We perform extensive analyses on simulated mock datasets with and without systematic effects.
Our analyses indicate that our methodology is more robust to overfitting compared to the conventional
methods. This method can be utilized in the catalog generation of future spectroscopic galaxy surveys
such as eBOSS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to better mitigate observational
systematics.
