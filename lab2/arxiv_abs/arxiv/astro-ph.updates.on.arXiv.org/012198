This paper is based on the multi-band VST Early-type GAlaxy Survey (VEGAS) with the VLT Survey Telescope
(VST). We present new deep photometry of the IC1459 group in g and r band. The main goal of this work
is to investigate the photometric properties of the IC1459 group, and to compare our results with
those obtained for other galaxy groups studied in VEGAS, in order to provide a first view of the variation
of their properties as a function of the evolution of the system. For all galaxies in the IC1459 group,
we fit isophotes and extract the azimuthally-averaged surface-brightness profiles, the position
angle and ellipticity profiles as a function of the semi-major axis, as well as the average colour
profile. In each band, we estimate the total magnitudes, effective radii, mean colour, and total
stellar mass for each galaxies in the group. Then we look at the structure of the brightest galaxies
and faint features in their outskirts, considering also the intragroup component. The wide field
of view, long integration time, high angular resolution, and arcsec-level seeing of OmegaCAM@VST
allow us to map the light distribution of IC1459 down to a surface brightness level of 29.26 mag arcsec^{-2}
in g band and 28.85 mag arcsec^{-2} in r band, and out to 7-10 Re, and to detect the optical counterpart
of HI gas around IC1459. We also explore in depth three low density environments and provide information
to understand how galaxies and groups properties change with the group evolution stage. There is
a good agreement of our results with predictions of numerical simulations regarding the structural
properties of the brightest galaxies of the groups. We suggest that the structure of the outer envelope
of the BCGs, the intra-group light and the HI amount and distribution may be used as indicators of
the different evolutionary stage and mass assembly in galaxy groups.
