The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is located at the dynamical center of the Milky
Way. In a recent study of the X-ray flaring activity from Sgr A* using Chandra, XMM-Newton and Swift
data from 1999 to 2015, it has been argued that the bright flaring rate has increased from 2014 Aug.
31 while the faint flaring rate decreased from around 2013 Aug. We tested the persistence of these
changes in the flaring rates with new X-ray data of Sgr A* obtained in 2016-2018 (total exposure of
1.4Ms). We detected 9 flares in the Chandra data and 5 flares in the Swift data that we added to the set
of 107 previously detected flares. We computed the intrinsic distribution of flare fluxes and durations
corrected for the sensitivity bias using a new method that allowed us to take the error on the flare
fluxes and durations into account. From this intrinsic distribution, we determined the average
flare detection efficiency for each Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift observation. After correcting
each observational exposure for this efficiency, we applied the Bayesian blocks algorithm on the
concatenated flare arrival times. As in the above-mentioned study, we also searched for a flux and
fluence threshold that might lead to a change in flaring rate. We improved the previous method by
computing the average flare detection efficiencies for each flux and fluence range. The Bayesian
block algorithm did not detect any significant change in flaring rate of the 121 flares. However,
we detected an increase by a factor of about three in the flaring rate of the most luminous and most
energetic flares that have occurred since 2014 Aug. 30. The X-ray activity of Sgr A* has increased
for more than four years. Additional studies about the overall near-infrared and radio behavior
of Sgr A* are required to draw strong results on the multiwavelength activity of the black hole.
