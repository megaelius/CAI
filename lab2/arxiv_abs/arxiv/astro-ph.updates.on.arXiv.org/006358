Magnetic reconnection is believed to be the primary mechanism by which non-potential energy stored
in coronal magnetic fields is rapidly released during solar eruptive events. Unfortunately, owing
to the small spatial scales on which reconnection is thought to occur, it is not directly observable
in the solar corona. However, larger scale processes, such as associated inflow and outflow, and
signatures of accelerated particles have been put forward as evidence of reconnection. We explore
the origin of a persistent Type I radio source that accompanies a coronal X--shaped structure during
its passage across the disk. Of particular interest is the time range around a partial collapse of
the structure that is associated with inflow, outflow, and signatures of particle acceleration.
Imaging radio observations from the NRH were used to localise the radio source. SDO AIA EUV observations
from the same time period were analysed, looking for evidence of inflows and outflows. Further \texttt{mpole}
magnetic reconstructions using SDO HMI observations allowed the magnetic connectivity associated
with the radio source to be determined. The Type I radio source was well aligned with a magnetic separator
identified in the extrapolations. During the partial collapse, gradual (1 km/s) and fast (5 km/s)
inflow phases and fast (30 km/s) and rapid (80-100 km/s) outflow phases were observed, resulting
in an estimated reconnection rate of ~ 0.06. The radio source brightening and dimming was found to
be co-temporal with increased soft x-ray emission in both RHESSI and GOES. We interpret the brightening
and dimming of the radio emission as evidence for accelerated electrons in the reconnection region
responding to a gradual fall and rapid rise in electric drift velocity, in response to the inflowing
and outflowing field lines. These results present a comprehensive example of 3D null-point reconnection.
