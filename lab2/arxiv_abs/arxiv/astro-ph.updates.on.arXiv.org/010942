The production of both gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) is widely associated
with the merger of compact objects. Several studies have modelled the evolution of the electromagnetic
emission using the synchrotron emission produced by the deceleration of both a relativistic top-hat
jet seen off-axis, and a wide-angle quasi-spherical outflow (both using numerical studies). In
this study we present an analytical model of the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)
emission for an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow. We calculate the light curves
obtained from an analytic model in which the synchrotron and SSC emission (in the fast- or slow-cooling
regime) of an off-axis top-hat jet and a quasi-spherical outflow are decelerated in either a homogeneous
or a wind-like circumburst medium. We show that the synchrotron emission of the quasi-spherical
outflow is stronger than that of the off-axis jet during the first $\sim$ 10 - 20 days, and weaker during
the next $\gtrsim$ 80 days. Moreover, we show that if the off-axis jet is decelerated in a wind-like
medium, then the SSC emission is very likely to be detected. Applying a MCMC code to our model (for
synchrotron emission only), we find the best-fit values for the radio, optical and X-ray emission
of GRB 170817A which are in accordance with observations. For GRB 170817A, we find using our model
that the synchrotron emission generated by the quasi-spherical outflow and off-axis top-hat jet
increase as $F_\nu\propto t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha\lesssim 0.8$ and $\alpha>3$, respectively.
Finally, we obtain the correspondent SSC light curves which are in accordance with the very-high-energy
gamma-ray upper limits derived with the GeV - TeV observatories.
