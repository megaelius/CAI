The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) was a multi-cycle
treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that surveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with
~900 HST orbits spread across 5 fields over 3 years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae
(SN) of all types, out to z~2.5. We classify ~24 of these as Type Ia SN (SN Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts
and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of 6 SN). Here we present a measurement of
the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 and putting
new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SN that
exploded when the universe was only ~3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history.
This gives the CANDELS high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SN Ia
that explode promptly after formation (<500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available
SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we find that this prompt SNIa fraction is f=0.48 +0.08 -0.09
(stat) +0.04 -0.13 (syst), consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1}
power law for all times t>40 Myr. However, a mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z
surveys and space-based high-z surveys. When the rate measurements from HST surveys are examined
in isolation, the rarity of SN Ia detections at z>1.5 hints that prompt progenitors in the early
universe may in fact be relatively rare, accounting for as little as ~5% of all SN Ia explosions - though
further analysis and larger samples will be needed to examine that suggestion.
