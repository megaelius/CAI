The collapse of dust particle clouds directly to km-sized planetesimals is a promising way to explain
the formation of planetesimals, asteroids and comets. In the past, this collapse has been studied
in stratified shearing box simulations with super-solar dust-to-gas ratio \epsilon, allowing
for streaming instability (SI) and gravitational collapse. This paper studies the non-stratified
SI under dust-to-gas ratios from \epsilon=0.1 up to \epsilon=1000 without self-gravity. The study
covers domain sizes of L=0.1 H, 0.01 H and 0.001 H, in terms of gas disk scale height H, using the PencilCode.
They are performed in radial-azimuthal (2-d) and radial-vertical (2.5-d) extent. The used particles
of St=0.01 and 0.1 mark the upper end of the expected dust growth. SI-activity is found up to very high
dust-to-gas ratios, providing fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratios and turbulent particle
diffusion \delta. We find an SI-like instability that operates in r-\varphi even when vertical
modes are suppressed. This new azimuthal streaming instability (aSI) shows similar properties
and appearance as the SI. Both, SI and aSI, show diffusivity at \epsilon=100 only to be two orders
of magnitude lower than at \epsilon=1, suggesting a \delta ~ \epsilon^{-1} relation that is shallow
around \epsilon = 1. The (a)SI ability to concentrate particles is found to be uncorrelated with
its strength in particle turbulence. Finally, we performed a resolution study to test our findings
of the aSI. This paper stresses out the importance of properly resolving the (a)SI at high dust-to-gas
ratios and planetesimal collapse simulations, leading else wise to potentially incomplete results.
