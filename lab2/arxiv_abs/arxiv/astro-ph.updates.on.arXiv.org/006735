We explore the thermal light sterile neutrino situation from cosmological perspective in the $\Lambda
\textrm{CDM} + r_{0.05} + N_{\textrm{eff}} + m^{\textrm{eff}}_{\textrm{s}}$ model using combinations
of latest data sets available. Here, $r_{0.05}$ is the tensor-to-scalar ratio at the pivot scale
of $k_*=0.05h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ is the effective number of relativistic species
during recombination, and $m^{\textrm{eff}}_{\textrm{s}}$ is the effective mass of the sterile
neutrino. Among Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) datasets, we use Planck 2015 temperature and
low-$l$ ($l <$ 30) polarization data and the latest data release on the B-mode polarization up to
and including 2014 from the BICEP2/Keck collaboration (BK14). We also use the latest BAO data from
SDSS-III BOSS DR12, MGS, and 6dFS; and a Gaussian prior (HST) on the Hubble constant ($H_0 = 73.24
\pm 1.74$ km/sec/Mpc) from direct measurements. We find that inclusion of BK14 data makes the constraints
on the effective mass of sterile neutrino ($m^{\textrm{eff}}_{\textrm{s}}$) slightly stronger
by preferring higher $\sigma_8$ values. The bound of $m^{\textrm{eff}}_{\textrm{s}} <$ 0.46
eV (95\% C.L.) is found for the combination of Planck 2015, BAO and BK14 datasets, whereas the bound
is $m^{\textrm{eff}}_{\textrm{s}} <$ 0.53 eV (95\% C.L.) without the BK14 data. Our most aggressive
bound of $m^{\textrm{eff}}_{\textrm{s}} <$ 0.28 eV (95\% C.L.) is obtained with Planck 2015, HST
and BK14. However, the HST prior also leads to very high $N_{\textrm{eff}}$ which might be in conflict
with bounds from BBN. Our analysis indicates that fully thermalized sterile neutrinos with mass
$\sim 1$ eV are slightly more disfavoured with the inclusion of BK14 data. It also seems to make the
agreement between Planck 2015 and CFHTLenS (weak gravitational lensing data) worse due to the higher
$\sigma_8$ values (abstract abridged).
