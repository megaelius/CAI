The combined detection of a gravitational-wave signal, kilonova, and short gamma-ray burst (sGRB)
from GW170817 marked a scientific breakthrough in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. But
even before GW170817, there have been a number of sGRBs with possible associated kilonova detections.
In this work, we re-examine these "historical" sGRB afterglows with a combination of state-of-the-art
afterglow and kilonova models. This allows us to include optical/near-infrared synchrotron emission
produced by the sGRB as well as ultraviolet/optical/near-infrared emission powered by the radioactive
decay of $r$-process elements (i.e., the kilonova). Fitting the lightcurves, we derive the velocity
and the mass distribution as well as the composition of the ejected material. The posteriors on kilonova
parameters obtained from the fit were turned into distributions for the peak magnitude of the kilonova
emission in different bands and the time at which this peak occurs. From the sGRB with an associated
kilonova, we found that the peak magnitude in H bands falls in the range [-16.2, -13.1] ($95\%$ of
confidence) and occurs within $0.8-3.6\,\rm days$ after the sGRB prompt emission. In g band instead
we obtain a peak magnitude in range [-16.8, -12.3] occurring within the first $18\,\rm hr$ after
the sGRB prompt. From the luminosity distributions of GW170817/AT2017gfo, kilonova candidates
GRB130603B, GRB050709 and GRB060614 (with the possible inclusion of GRB150101B) and the upper
limits from all the other sGRBs not associated with any kilonova detection we obtain for the first
time a kilonova luminosity function in different bands.
