The interstellar medium mediates galactic evolution as the reservoir of material for future star
formation and the repository of energy and matter output by stellar processes. Canadians have played
leading roles in ISM science for decades. The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey identified a wealth
of small-scale structure in H I emission as well as self-absorption and in the structure of polarized
emission. These observations demonstrated that no phase of the ISM, including the transition from
atomic gas to star formation, can be understood in isolation. Canadians have also played leading
roles in the characterization of dust with Planck and balloon-borne telescopes. Canadians have
also used pulsar scintillometry to measure structure in the ISM at the smallest scales, below 1 AU.
The 2020s offer many opportunities for ISM science in Canada. A major but cost-effective upgrade
to the Synthesis Telescope with broadband (400-1800 MHz) single-pixel feeds would enable broadband
polarimetry as well as wide-area, arcminute surveys of radio recombination lines. The next generation
of balloon-borne telescopes will investigate magnetic fields and dust properties. Large single
dishes, particularly the Green Bank Telescope, remain essential for our understanding of the diffuse
structure which characterizes the ISM. Very long baseline interferometry capability enables
parallax measurements of pulsars and masers and for further progress in scintillometry. ISM astronomers
will continue to participate in cosmological experiments including CHIME and CHORD. Protecting
quiet radio frequency interference environments will be ever more important as broadband observations
are ever more central to ISM science. Computational capability is essential both for numerical
work and for handling the observational data.
