We report on the detection of a statistically significant flare-like event in the Mg~II~$\lambda$
2798~\AA\ emission line and the UV~Fe~II band of CTA~102 during the outburst of autumn 2017. The
ratio between the maximum and minimum of $\lambda$3000~\AA\ continuum flux for the observation
period ($2010-2017$) is 179$\pm$15. Respectively, the max/min ratios 8.1$\pm$10.5 and 34.0$\pm$45.5
confirmed the variability of the Mg~II emission line and of the Fe~II band. The highest levels of
emission lines fluxes recorded coincide with a superluminal jet component traversing through
a stationary component located at $\sim$0.1 mas from the 43 GHz core. Additionally, comparing the
Mg~II line profile in the minimum of activity against the one in the maximum, we found that the latter
is broader and blue-shifted. As a result of these findings, we can conclude that the non-thermal
continuum emission produced by material in the jet moving at relativistic speeds is related to the
broad emission line fluctuations. In consequence, these fluctuations are also linked to the presence
of broad-line region (BLR) clouds located at $\sim$25 pc from the central engine, outside from the
inner parsec, where the canonical BLR is located. Our results suggest that during strong activity
in CTA~102, the source of non-thermal emission and broad-line clouds outside the inner parsec introduces
uncertainties in the estimates of black hole (BH) mass. Therefore, it is important to estimate the
BH mass, using single-epoch or reverberation mapping techniques, only with spectra where the continuum
luminosity is dominated by the accretion disk.
