Exoplanet transit spectroscopy enables the characterization of distant worlds, and will yield
key results for NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. However, transit spectra models are often simplified,
omitting potentially important processes like refraction and multiple scattering. While the
former process has seen recent development, the effects of light multiple scattering on exoplanet
transit spectra has received little attention. Here, we develop a detailed theory of exoplanet
transit spectroscopy that extends to the full refracting and multiple scattering case. We explore
the importance of scattering for planet-wide cloud layers, where the relevant parameters are the
slant scattering optical depth, the scattering asymmetry parameter, and the angular size of the
host star. The latter determines the size of the "target" for a photon that is back-mapped from an
observer. We provide results that straightforwardly indicate the potential importance of multiple
scattering for transit spectra. When the orbital distance is smaller than 10-20 times the stellar
radius, multiple scattering effects for aerosols with asymmetry parameters larger than 0.8-0.9
can become significant. We provide examples of the impacts of cloud/haze multiple scattering on
transit spectra of a hot Jupiter-like exoplanet. For cases with a forward and conservatively scattering
cloud/haze, differences due to multiple scattering effects can exceed 200 ppm, but shrink to zero
at wavelength ranges corresponding to strong gas absorption or when the slant optical depth of the
cloud exceeds several tens. We conclude with a discussion of types of aerosols for which multiple
scattering in transit spectra may be important.
