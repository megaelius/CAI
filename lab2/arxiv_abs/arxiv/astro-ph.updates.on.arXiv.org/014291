In this work, we investigated the X-ray emission for a sample of young radio AGNs by combining their
data from Chandra/XMM-Newton and at other wavebands. We find strong correlations between the X-ray
luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ in 2$-$10 keV and the radio luminosities $L_{\rm R}$ at 5 GHz for VLBI radio-core,
VLA radio-core and FIRST component, indicating that both pc- and kpc-scale radio emission strongly
correlate with X-ray emission in these sources. We find approximately linear dependence of radio
on X-ray luminosity in the sources with radiative efficient accretion flows (i.e., the Eddington
ratio $R_{\rm edd} \gtrsim 10^{-3} $) with b $\sim$ 1 ($L_{\rm R}$ $\propto$ $L_{\rm X} ^{b}$) and
$\xi_{\rm RX}$ $\sim$ 1 in fundamental plane using VLBI data, where the dependence is consistent
with the re-analysed result on the previous study in \cite{2016ApJ...818..185F} at $R_{\rm edd}
\gtrsim 10^{-3}$, however is significantly deviated from the theoretical prediction of accretion
flow as the origin of X-ray emission. In contrast to radio-quiet quasars, there is no significant
correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio. Our results seem to indicate that the X-ray emission
of high-accreting young radio AGNs may be from jet. We constructed the SEDs for 18 sources (most are
in radiative efficient accretion) including 9 galaxies and 9 quasars with high-quality X-ray data,
and find that the X-ray emission of most quasars is more luminous than that of normal radio-quiet
quasars. This is clearly seen from the quasar composite SED, of which the X-ray emission is apparently
higher than that of radio-quiet quasars, likely supporting the jet-related X-ray emission in young
radio AGNs. The scenario that the X-ray emission is from self-synchrotron Compton (SSC) is discussed.
