We study the correlation between galaxy structure and the quenching of star formation using a sample
of SDSS central galaxies with stellar masses 9.75< log M_*/M_sun<11.25 and redshifts z<0.075.
GALEX UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies, and
to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance
between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably
similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density
within a radius of 1 kpc, \Sigma_1, is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve.
When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-\Sigma_1 plane
at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. \Sigma_1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through
the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed \Sigma_1.
The \Sigma_1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, \Sigma_1 ~ M_*^{0.64}. However,
the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold \Sigma_1 implies that a dense bulge
is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step
quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by
bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, AGN feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas
external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock
heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its
surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed
scatter in color vs. \Sigma_1. (Abridged)
