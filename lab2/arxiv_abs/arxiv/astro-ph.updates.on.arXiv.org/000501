We present an IR study of high-redshift galaxy clusters with the MIPS camera on the Spitzer Space
Telescope. Employing a sample of 42 clusters from the RCS-1 over the redshift range 0.3 < z <
1.0 and spanning an approximate range in mass of 10^{14-15} Msun, we show the number of IR-luminous
galaxies in clusters above a fixed IR luminosity of 2x10^{11} Msun per unit cluster mass evolves
as (1+z)^{5.1+/-1.9}. These results assume a single star forming galaxy template; the presence
of AGN, and an evolution in their relative contribution to the mid-IR galaxy emission, will alter
the overall number counts per cluster and their rate of evolution. We infer the total SFR per unit
cluster mass and find T_SFR/M_c ~ (1+z)^{5.4+/-1.9}. This evolution can be attributed entirely
to the change in the in-falling field galaxy population. The T_SFR/M_c (binned over all redshift)
decreases with increasing cluster mass with a slope (T_SFR/M_c ~ M_c^{-1.5+/-0.4}) consistent
with the dependence of the stellar-to-total mass per unit cluster mass seen locally. The inferred
star formation seen here could produce ~5-10% of the total stellar mass in massive clusters at z =
0. Finally, we show a clear decrease in the number of IR-bright galaxies per unit optical galaxy in
the cluster cores, confirming star formation continues to avoid the highest density regions of
the universe at z ~ 0.75 (the average redshift of the high-redshift clusters). While several previous
studies appear to show enhanced star formation in high-redshift clusters relative to the field
we note that these papers have not accounted for the overall increase in galaxy or dark matter density
at the location of clusters. Once this is done, clusters at z ~ 0.75 have the same or less star formation
per unit mass or galaxy as the field.
