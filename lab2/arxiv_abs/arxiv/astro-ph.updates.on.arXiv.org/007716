We use the framework of generalised global symmetries to study various hydrodynamic regimes of
hot electromagnetism. We formulate the hydrodynamic theories with an unbroken or a spontaneously
broken U(1) one-form symmetry. The latter of these describes a one-form superfluid, which is characterised
by a vector Goldstone mode and a two-form superfluid velocity. Two special limits of this theory
have been studied in detail: the string fluid limit where the U(1) one-form symmetry is partly restored,
and the electric limit in which the symmetry is completely broken. The transport properties of these
theories are investigated in depth by studying the constraints arising from the second law of thermodynamics
and Onsager's relations at first order in derivatives. We also write down a hydrostatic effective
action for the Goldstone modes in these theories and use it to characterise the space of all equilibrium
configurations. To make explicit contact with hot electromagnetism, the traditional treatment
of magnetohydrodynamics, where the electromagnetic photon is incorporated as a dynamical degrees
of freedom, is extended to include parity-violating contributions. We argue that the chemical
potential and electric fields are not independently dynamical in magnetohydrodynamics, and illustrate
how to eliminate these within the hydrodynamic derivative expansion using Maxwell's equations.
Additionally, a new hydrodynamic theory of non-conducting, but polarised, plasmas is formulated,
focusing primarily on the magnetically dominated sector. Finally, it is shown that the different
limits of one-form superfluids formulated in terms of generalised global symmetries are exactly
equivalent to magnetohydrodynamics and the hydrodynamics of non-conducting plasmas at the non-linear
level.
