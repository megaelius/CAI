We present the results of a feasibility study, which examined deployment of a ground-based millimeter-wave
polarimeter, tailored for observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB), to Isi Station in Greenland.
The instrument for this study is based on lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs)
and an F/2.4 catoptric, crossed-Dragone telescope with a 500 mm aperture. The telescope is mounted
inside the receiver and cooled to $<\,4$ K by a closed-cycle $^4$He refrigerator to reduce background
loading on the detectors. Linearly polarized signals from the sky are modulated with a metal-mesh
half-wave plate that is rotated at the aperture stop of the telescope with a hollow-shaft motor based
on a superconducting magnetic bearing. The modular detector array design includes at least 2300
LEKIDs, and it can be configured for spectral bands centered on 150~GHz or greater. Our study considered
configurations for observing in spectral bands centered on 150, 210 and 267~GHz. The entire polarimeter
is mounted on a commercial precision rotary air bearing, which allows fast azimuth scan speeds with
negligible vibration and mechanical wear over time. A slip ring provides power to the instrument,
enabling circular scans (360 degrees of continuous rotation). This mount, when combined with sky
rotation and the latitude of the observation site, produces a hypotrochoid scan pattern, which
yields excellent cross-linking and enables 34\% of the sky to be observed using a range of constant
elevation scans. This scan pattern and sky coverage combined with the beam size (15~arcmin at 150~GHz)
makes the instrument sensitive to $5 < \ell < 1000$ in the angular power spectra.
