We present a measurement of the angular bispectrum of the millimeter-wave sky in observing bands
centered at roughly 95, 150, and 220 GHz, on angular scales of 1' <~ theta <~ 10' (multipole
number 1000 <~ l <~ 10,000). At these frequencies and angular scales, the main contributions
to the bispectrum are expected to be the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and emission from
extragalactic sources, predominantly dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and active galactic
nuclei. We measure the bispectrum in 800 square degrees of three-band South Pole Telescope data,
and we use a multi-frequency fitting procedure to separate the bispectrum of the tSZ effect from
the extragalactic source contribution. We simultaneously detect the bispectrum of the tSZ effect
at >10 sigma, the unclustered component of the extragalactic source bispectrum at >6 sigma
in each frequency band, and the bispectrum due to the clustering of DSFGs---i.e., the clustered
cosmic infrared background (CIB) bispectrum---at >5 sigma. This is the first reported detection
of the clustered CIB bispectrum. We use the measured tSZ bispectrum amplitude, compared to theoretical
predictions, to constrain the normalization of the matter power spectrum to be sigma_8 = 0.786 +/-
0.031 and to predict the amplitude of the tSZ power spectrum. This prediction improves our ability
to separate the thermal and kinematic contributions to the total SZ power spectrum. The addition
of bispectrum data improves our constraint on the tSZ power spectrum amplitude by a factor of two
compared to power spectrum measurements alone and provides the first evidence of a nonzero kinematic
SZ (kSZ) power spectrum, with a derived constraint on the kSZ amplitude at l=3000 of A_kSZ = 2.9 +/-
1.5 uK^2.
