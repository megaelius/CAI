We present an analysis of 39 nuclei and their early-type hosts in the Virgo Cluster using ten broadband
filters: F300W, F475W, F850LP, F160W, $u^*griz$, and $K_s$. We describe the Virgo Redux program,
which provides high-resolution UV and NIR imaging. Combining this data with optical and NIR imaging
from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey and the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey, we estimate masses,
metallicities and ages using simple stellar population (SSP) models. For 19 nuclei, we compare
to SSP parameters derived from Keck and Gemini spectra and find reasonable agreement between the
photometric and spectroscopic metallicity: the RMS scatter is 0.3 dex. We reproduce the nucleus-galaxy
mass fraction of $0.33^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ percent for galaxy stellar masses $10^{8.4}-10^{10.3}
M_\odot$ with a typical precision of $\sim$35% for the nuclei masses. Based on available model predictions,
there is no single preferred formation scenario for nuclei, suggesting that nuclei are formed stochastically
through a mix of processes. Nuclei metallicities are statistically identical to those of their
hosts, appearing $0.07 \pm 0.3$ dex more metal-rich on average -- although, omitting galaxies with
unusual origins, nuclei are $0.20\pm0.28$ dex more metal-rich. Nuclei appear to be $0.56 \pm 0.12$
dex more metal rich than ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) at fixed mass. We find no clear age difference
between nuclei and their galaxies, with nuclei displaying a broad range of ages. Interestingly,
we find that the most massive nuclei may be flatter and more closely aligned with the semi-major axes
of their hosts, suggesting that they formed through predominantly dissipative processes.
