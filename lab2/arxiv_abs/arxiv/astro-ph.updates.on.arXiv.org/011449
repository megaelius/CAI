The minimum spanning tree (MST), a graph constructed from a distribution of points, draws lines
between pairs of points so that all points are linked in a single skeletal structure that contains
no loops and has minimal total edge length. The MST has been used in a broad range of scientific fields
such as particle physics (to distinguish classes of events in collider collisions), in astronomy
(to detect mass segregation in star clusters) and cosmology (to search for filaments in the cosmic
web). Its success in these fields has been driven by its sensitivity to the spatial distribution
of points and the patterns within. MiSTree, a public Python package, allows a user to construct the
MST in a variety of coordinates systems, including Celestial coordinates used in astronomy. The
package enables the MST to be constructed quickly by initially using a k-nearest neighbour graph
(kNN, rather than a matrix of pairwise distances) which is then fed to Kruskal's algorithm to construct
the MST. MiSTree enables a user to measure the statistics of the MST and provides classes for binning
the MST statistics (into histograms) and plotting the distributions. Applying the MST will enable
the inclusion of high-order statistics information from the cosmic web which can provide additional
information to improve cosmological parameter constraints. This information has not been fully
exploited due to the computational cost of calculating N-point statistics. MiSTree was designed
to be used in cosmology but could be used in any field which requires extracting non-Gaussian information
from point distributions. The source code for MiSTree is available on GitHub at https://github.com/knaidoo29/mistree
