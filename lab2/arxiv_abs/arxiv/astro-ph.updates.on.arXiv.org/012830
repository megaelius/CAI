Axions or more generally axion-like particles (ALPs) are pseudo-scalar particles predicted by
many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics (SM) and considered as viable candidates
for dark matter (DM) in the universe. If they really exist in nature, they are expected to couple with
photons in the presence of an external electromagnetic field through a form of the Primakoff effect.
In addition, many string theory models of the early universe motivate the existence of a homogeneous
Cosmic ALP Background (CAB) with 0.1-1 keV energies analogous to the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB), arising via the decay of string theory moduli in the very early universe. The coupling between
the CAB ALPs traveling in cosmic magnetic fields and photons allows ALPs to oscillate into photons
and vice versa. In this work, we test the CAB model that is put forward to explain the soft X-ray excess
in the Coma cluster due to CAB ALPs conversion into photons using the M87 jet environment. Then we
demonstrate the potential of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) jet environment to probe low-mass
ALP models, and to potentially constrain the model proposed to better explain the Coma cluster soft
X-ray excess. We find that the overall X-ray emission for the M87 AGN requires an ALP-photon coupling
$g_{a\gamma}$ in the range of $\sim7.50\times 10^{-15}-6.56\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for
ALP masses $m_a\sim 1.1\times 10^{-13}$ eV as long as the M87 jet is misaligned by less than about
20 degrees from the line of sight. These values are up to an order of magnitude smaller than the current
best fit value on $g_{a\gamma}\sim 2\times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ obtained in soft X-ray excess
CAB model for the Coma cluster. Our results cast doubt on the current limits of the largest allowed
value of $g_{a\gamma}$ and suggest a new constraint that $g_{a\gamma}\lesssim 6.56\times 10^{-14}$
GeV$^{-1}$ when a CAB is assumed.
