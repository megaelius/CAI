We show that gravitational lensing can provide a direct method to probe the nature of dark energy
at astrophysical scales. For lensing system as an isolated astrophysical object, we derive the
dark energy contribution to gravitational potential as a repulsive power-law term, containing
a generic equation of state parameter $w$. We find that it generates $w$-dependent and position-dependent
modification to the conventional light orbital equation of $w=-1$. With post-Newtonian approximation,
we compute its direct effect for an isolated lensing system at astrophysical scales and find that
the dark energy force can deflect the path of incident light rays. We demonstrate that the dark-energy-induced
deflection angle $\Delta\alpha_{DE}^{}\propto M^{(1+\frac{1}{3w})}$ (with $1+\frac{1}{3w}>0$),
which increases with the lensing mass $M$ and consistently approaches zero in the limit $M \to 0$.
This effect is distinctive because dark energy tends to diffuse the rays and generates concave lensing
effect. This is in contrast to the conventional convex lensing effect caused by both visible and
dark matter. Measuring such concave lensing effect can directly probe the existence and nature
of dark energy. We estimate this effect and show that the current gravitational lensing experiments
are sensitive to the direct probe of dark energy at astrophysical scales. For the special case $w=-1$,
our independent study favors the previous works that the cosmological constant can affect light
bending, although our prediction qualitatively and quantitatively differ from the literature,
including our consistent realization of $\Delta\alpha_{DE}\to 0$ (under $M \to 0$) at the leading
order.
