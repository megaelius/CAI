Using a combination of N-body simulations, semi-analytic models and radiative transfer calculations,
we have estimated the theoretical cross power spectrum between galaxies and the 21cm emission from
neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization. In accordance with previous studies, we find
that the 21cm emission is initially correlated with halos on large scales (> 30 Mpc), anti-correlated
on intermediate (~ 5 Mpc), and uncorrelated on small (< 3 Mpc) scales. This picture quickly changes
as reionization proceeds and the two fields become anti-correlated on large scales. The normalization
of the cross power spectrum can be used to set constraints on the average neutral fraction in the intergalactic
medium and its shape can be a tool to study the topology of reionization. When we apply a drop-out technique
to select galaxies and add to the 21cm signal the noise expected from the LOFAR telescope, we find
that while the normalization of the cross power spectrum remains a useful tool for probing reionization,
its shape becomes too noisy to be informative. On the other hand, for a Lyalpha Emitter (LAE) survey
both the normalization and the shape of the cross power spectrum are suitable probes of reionization.
A closer look at a specific planned LAE observing program using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam reveals
concerns about the strength of the 21cm signal at the planned redshifts. If the ionized fraction
at z ~ 7 is lower that the one estimated here, then using the cross power spectrum may be a useful exercise
given that at higher redshifts and neutral fractions it is able to distinguish between two toy models
with different topologies.
