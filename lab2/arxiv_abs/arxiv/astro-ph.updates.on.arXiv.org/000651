Quasars represent the brightest Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the Universe and are thought to
indicate the location of prodigiously growing Black Holes (BHs), with luminosities as high as 10^48
erg/sec. It is often expected though that such an extremely energetic process will take place in
the most massive bound structures in the dark matter (DM) distribution. We show that in contrast
to this expectation, in a galaxy formation model which includes AGN feedback, quasars are predicted
to live in average DM halo environments with typical masses of a few times 10^12 Msun. This fundamental
prediction arises from the fact that quasar activity (i.e., BH accretion with luminosity greater
than 10^46 erg/sec) is inhibited in DM haloes where AGN feedback operates. The galaxy hosts of quasars
in our simulations are identified with over massive (in gas and stars) spheroidal galaxies, in which
BH accretion is triggered via a galaxy merger or secular processes. We further show that the z=0 descendants
of high redshift (z~6) QSOs span a wide range of morphologies, galaxy and halo masses. The z~6 BHs
typically grow only by a modest factor by the present day. Remarkably, high redshift QSOs never inhabit
the largest DM haloes at that time and their descendants are very seldom found in the most massive
haloes at z=0. We also show that observationally it is very likely to find an enhancement in the abundance
of galaxies around quasars at z~5. However, these enhancements are considerably weaker compared
to the overdensities expected at the extreme peaks of the DM distribution. Thus, it is very unlikely
that a quasar detected in the $z\gtrsim5$ Universe pinpoints the location of the progenitors of
superclusters in the local Universe.
