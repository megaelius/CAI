Hot subdwarfs represent a poorly understood late phase of stellar evolution. While binary evolution
plays an important role for B-subdwarfs (sdB), the origin of the He dominated O-subdwarfs (He-sdO)
is unknown. We search for chemical signatures of their genesis by means of quantitative analyses
of visual and FUV spectra. Using Tlusty/Synspec to compute line blanketed NLTE model atmospheres,
Teff/log g and abundances have been derived for 4 prototypical He-sdO stars. Final models included
H,He,C,N,O,Ne,Mg,Al,Si,P,S,Fe&Ni. Because of the enrichment of either N or C, models including
these elements at the appropriate high abundance provide sufficiently accurate approximations
to the temperature stratification of full models. No indications for binarity were found, neither
radial velocity variations nor photometric evidence. All stars have atmospheres almost free of
H and Teff =42000K to 47000K, and log g= 5.4 to 5.7. CD-31 4800 displays the signatures of CNO burning,
while heavier elements are subsolar by ~0.4 dex, except Ne & Si being ~solar. The C-rich He-sdOs show
a slightly subsolar metallicity accompanied by N-enrichment and O-deficiency. Ne is enriched
up to a factor of ten with respect to the sun in LS IV+10 9. Stellar masses scatter around the canonical
helium core flash mass. The abundance pattern of CD-31 4800 is consistent with predictions of models
for cold mergers of He-WDs except for the low O abundance observed. Models for composite mergers
predict abundance pattern dissimilar to those determined for the C-rich stars. [CW83]0904-02,
though, may be a candidate for a composite He-WD merger, as it rotates and is more massive than the
other stars. New evolutionary models for the hot flasher scenario predict abundance patterns similar
to those determined for the C-rich stars. Hence, C-rich He-sdO may result from late He flashes with
deep-mixing episodes. (abbreviated)
