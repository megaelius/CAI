Recent work has shown that Milky Way-mass galaxies display an incredible range of stellar halo properties.
Yet, the origin of this diversity is unclear. The nearby galaxy M81 $-$ currently interacting with
M82 and NGC 3077 $-$ sheds unique light on this problem. We present a Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey
of the resolved stellar populations in M81's halo. Using a unique three-filter strategy, and numerous
HST calibration fields, we reveal M81's halo in never-before-seen detail. We resolve the halo to
unprecedented $V$-band equivalent surface brightnesses of $>$34 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, and produce
the first-ever global stellar mass density map for a Milky Way-mass stellar halo outside of the Local
Group (LG). Using the minor axis, we confirm the previous assessment of M81 as one of the lowest mass
and metal-poorest stellar halos known ($M_{\star} \sim 10^9 M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $\sim {-}1.2$)
$-$ indicating a relatively quiet prior accretion history. Yet, in our global stellar mass census
we find that tidally unbound material from M82 and NGC 3077 provides a substantial infusion of metal-rich
material ($M_{\star} \simeq 6{\times}10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, [Fe/H] $\simeq {-}$0.9). We further
show that, following the accretion of its massive satellite M82 (and the LMC-like NGC 3077), M81
will host one of the most massive and metal-rich stellar halos in the nearby universe. Thus, the saga
of M81: following a relatively passive history, M81's merger with M82 will completely transform
its halo from a low-mass, anemic halo rivaling the MW, to a metal-rich behemoth rivaled only by systems
such as M31. This dramatic transformation indicates that the observed diversity in stellar halo
properties is primarily driven by diversity in the largest mergers these galaxies have experienced.
