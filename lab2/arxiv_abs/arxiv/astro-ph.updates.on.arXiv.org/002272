The relations between oxygen abundance and disk surface brightness (OH-SB relation) in the infrared
W1 band are examined for a nearby late-type galaxies. The oxygen abundances were presented in Paper
I. The photometric characteristics of the disks are inferred here using photometric maps from the
literature through bulge-disk decomposition. We find evidence that the OH - SB relation is not unique
but depends on the galactocentric distance r (taken as a fraction of the optical radius R_25) and
on the properties of a galaxy: the disk scale length h and the morphological T-type. The parametric
OH - SB relation reproduces the observed data better than a simple, one-parameter relation; the
deviations resulting when using our parametric relation are smaller by a factor of ~1.4 than that
the simple relation. The influence of the parameters on the OH - SB relation varies with galactocentric
distance. The influence of the T-type on the OH - SB relation is negligible at the centers of galaxies
and increases with galactocentric distance. In contrast, the influence of the disk scale length
on the OH -- SB relation is maximum at the centers of galaxies and decreases with galactocentric distance,
disappearing at the optical edges of galaxies. Two-dimensional relations can be used to reproduce
the observed data at the optical edges of the disks and at the centers of the disks. The disk scale length
should be used as a second parameter in the OH - SB relation at the center of the disk while the morphological
T-type should be used as a second parameter in the relation at optical edge of the disk. The general
properties of the abundance - surface brightness relations are similar for the three considered
bands B, K, and W1.
