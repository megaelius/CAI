Based on an updated Hbeta reverberation mapping (RM) sample of 44 nearby active galactic nuclei
(AGN), we propose a novel approach for black hole (BH) mass estimation using two filtered luminosities
computed from single-epoch (SE) AGN spectra around the Hbeta region. We found that the two optimal-filter
luminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broad line region, BLR)
from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical BH mass estimator. The major advantages
of this new recipe over traditional SE BH mass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad
line width are: 1) it has a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against RM masses; 2)
it is extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose the spectrum; 3) it produces
unambiguous and highly repeatable results even with low signal-to-noise spectra. The combination
of the two luminosities can also cancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially
introduced by uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. In addition, we recalibrated the
traditional SE mass estimators using broad Hbeta full width at half maximum (FWHM) and monochromatic
continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). We found that using the best-fit slopes on FWHM and L_5100
(derived from fitting the BLR radius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line
dispersion and SE FWHM, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for L_5100 and
2 for FWHM) leads to more precise SE mass estimates, improving the intrinsic scatter from 0.41 dex
to 0.36 dex with respect to the RM masses. We compared different estimators and discussed their applications
to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar sample. Due to the limitations of the current RM sample,
application of any SE recipe calibrated against RM masses to distant quasars should be treated with
caution.
