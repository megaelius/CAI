The chemically peculiar (CP) stars of the upper main sequence are mainly characterized by strong
overabundances of heavy elements. Two subgroups (CP2 and CP4) have strong local magnetic fields
which make them interesting targets for astrophysical studies. This star group, in general, is
often used for the analysis of stellar formation and evolution in the context of diffusion as well
as meridional circulation. In continuation of a long term study of CP stars (initiated in the 1980ies),
we present new results based on photoelectric measurements for ten open clusters that are, with
one exception, younger than 235Myr. Observations in star clusters are favourable because they
represent samples of stars of constant age and homogeneous chemical composition. The very efficient
tool of Delta a photometry was applied. It samples the flux depression at 5200A typically for CP stars.
In addition, it is able to trace emission line Be/Ae and lambda Bootis stars. Virtually all CP2 and
CP4 stars can be detected via this tool. For all targets in the cluster areas, we performed a kinematic
membership analysis. We obtained new photoelectric Delta a photometry of 304 stars from which 207
objects have a membership probability higher than 50%. Our search for chemically peculiar objects
results in fifteen detections. The stars have masses between 1.7 M(Sun) and 7.7 M(Sun) and are between
the zero- and terminal-age-main-sequence. We discuss the published spectral classifications
in the light of our Delta a photometry and identify several misclassified CP stars. We are also able
to establish and support the nature of known bona fide CP candidates. The new and confirmed CP stars
are interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up observations to put constraints on the formation
and evolution of CP stars.
