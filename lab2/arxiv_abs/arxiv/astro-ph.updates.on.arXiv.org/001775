Strong shear flow regions found in astrophysical jets are shown to be important dissipation regions,
where the shear flow kinetic energy is converted into electric and magnetic field energy via shear
instabilities. The emergence of these self-consistent fields make shear flows significant sites
for radiation emission and particle acceleration. We focus on electron-scale instabilities,
namely the collisionless, unmagnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and a large-scale
dc magnetic field generation mechanism on the electron scales. We show that these processes are
important candidates to generate magnetic fields in the presence of strong velocity shears, which
may naturally originate in energetic matter outburst of active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursters.
We show that the KHI is robust to density jumps between shearing flows, thus operating in various
scenarios with different density contrasts. Multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations
of the KHI, performed with OSIRIS, reveal the emergence of a strong and large-scale dc magnetic field
component, which is not captured by the standard linear fluid theory. This dc component arises from
kinetic effects associated with the thermal expansion of electrons of one flow into the other across
the shear layer, whilst ions remain unperturbed due to their inertia. The electron expansion forms
dc current sheets, which induce a dc magnetic field. Our results indicate that most of the electromagnetic
energy developed in the KHI is stored in the dc component, reaching values of equipartition on the
order of $10^{-3}$ in the electron time-scale, and persists longer than the proton time-scale.
Particle scattering/acceleration in the self generated fields of these shear flow instabilities
is also analyzed.
