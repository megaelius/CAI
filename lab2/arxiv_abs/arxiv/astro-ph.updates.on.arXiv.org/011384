Tidal interactions are important in driving spin and orbital evolution in planetary and stellar
binary systems, but the fluid dynamical mechanisms responsible remain incompletely understood.
One key mechanism is the interaction between tidal flows and convection. Turbulent convection
is thought to act as an effective viscosity in damping large-scale tidal flows, but there is a long-standing
controversy over the efficiency of this mechanism when the tidal frequency exceeds the turnover
frequency of the dominant convective eddies. This high frequency regime is relevant for many applications,
such as for tides in stars hosting hot Jupiters. We explore the interaction between tidal flows and
convection using hydrodynamical simulations within a local Cartesian model of a small patch of
a convection zone of a star or planet. We adopt the Boussinesq approximation and simulate Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection, modelling the tidal flow as a background oscillatory shear flow. We demonstrate that
the effective viscosity of both laminar and turbulent convection is approximately frequency-independent
for low frequencies. When the forcing frequency exceeds the dominant convective frequency, the
effective viscosity scales inversely with the square of the tidal frequency. We also show that negative
effective viscosities are possible, particularly for high frequency tidal forcing, suggesting
the surprising possibility of tidal anti-dissipation. These results are supported by a complementary
high frequency asymptotic analysis that extends prior work by Ogilvie & Lesur. We discuss the implications
of these results for interpreting the orbital decay of hot Jupiters, and for several other astrophysical
problems.
