Recently we have introduced a nonrelativistic cosmological model (NRCM) exhibiting a dynamical
spatial curvature. For this model the present day cosmic acceleration is not attributed to a negative
pressure (dark energy) but it is driven by a nontrivial energy flow leading to a negative spatial
curvature. In this paper we generalize the NRCM in two different ways to the relativistic regime
and present analytical solutions of the corresponding Einstein equations. These relativistic
models are characterized by two inequivalent extensions of the FLWR metric with a time-dependent
curvature function $K (t)$ and an expansion scalar $a(t)$. The fluid flow is supposed to be geodesic.
The model V1 is shear-free with isotropic pressure and therefore conformal flat. In contrast to
V1 the second model V2 shows a nontrivial shear and an anisotropic pressure. For both models the inhomogeneous
solutions of the corresponding Einstein equations will agree in leading order at small distances
with the NRCM if a(t) and K(t) are each identical with those determined in the NCRM. Then the metric
is completely fixed by three constants. The arising energy momentum tensor contains a nontrivial
energy flow vector. Our models violate locally the weak energy condition. Global volume averaging
leads to explicit expressions for the effective scale factor and the expansion rate $H (z)$. Backreaction
effects cancel each other for the model V2 but they are nonzero and proportional to the square of the
magnitude of the energy flow for the model V1. The large scale (relativistic) corrections to the
NCRM results are small for the model V2 for a small-sized energy flow. We have reproduced a corresponding
adjustment of the three free constants from [1] to cosmic chronometer data leading to the prediction
of an almost constant, negative value for the dimensionless curvature function $k(z) \sim - 1$ for
redshifts $z < 2$.
