Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping suggests that the broad-line regions (BLRs) of AGNs
can have significant net inflow. We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron
and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization
lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry
of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the
absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow
if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient
to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar MHD processes
are operating. In the scattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so
high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as is observed. Scattering
can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities
between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have
a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if
they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important
in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance
of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at
different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.
