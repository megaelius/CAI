A supermassive black hole has been found at the centre of nearly every galaxy observed with sufficient
sensitivity. The masses of these black holes are observed to increase with either the total mass
or the mean (random) velocity of the stars in their host galaxies. The origin of these correlations
remains elusive. Observational systematics and biases severely limit our knowledge of the local
demography of supermassive black holes thus preventing accurate model comparisons and progress
in this field. Here we show that the large-scale spatial distribution of local active galactic nuclei
(AGN), believed to be accreting supermassive black holes, can constrain the shape and normalization
of the black hole-stellar mass relation thus bypassing resolution-related observational biases.
In turn, our results can set more stringent constraints on the so-called "radiative efficiency",
a fundamental parameter describing the inner physics of supermassive black holes that is closely
linked to their spin, geometry, and ability to release energy. The mean value of the radiative efficiency
can be estimated by comparing the average total luminous output of AGN with the relic mass density
locked up in quiescent supermassive black holes at galaxy centres today. For currently accepted
values of the AGN obscured fractions and bolometric corrections, our newest estimates of the local
supermassive black hole mass density favour mean radiative efficiencies of ~10-20\%, suggesting
that the vast majority of supermassive black holes are spinning moderately to rapidly. With large-scale
AGN surveys coming online, our novel methodology will enable even tighter constraints on the fundamental
parameters that regulate the growth of supermassive black holes.
