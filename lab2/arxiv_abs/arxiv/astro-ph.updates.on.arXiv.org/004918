The Kepler mission has provided exquisite data to perform an ensemble asteroseismic analysis on
evolved stars. In this work we systematically characterize solar-like oscillations and granulation
for 16,094 oscillating red giants, using end-of-mission long-cadence data. We produced a homogeneous
catalog of the frequency of maximum power (typical uncertainty $\sigma_{\nu_{\rm max}}$=1.6\%),
the mean large frequency separation ($\sigma_{\Delta\nu}$=0.6\%), oscillation amplitude ($\sigma_{\rm
A}$=4.7\%), granulation power ($\sigma_{\rm gran}$=8.6\%), power excess width ($\sigma_{\rm
width}$=8.8\%), seismically-derived stellar mass ($\sigma_{\rm M}$=7.8\%), radius ($\sigma_{\rm
R}$=2.9\%), and thus surface gravity ($\sigma_{\log g}$=0.01 dex). Thanks to the large red giant
sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch (RGB) and helium-core-burning (HeB) stars collectively
differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess,
which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an
extremely sharp upper edge at fixed $\nu_{\rm max}$, which might hold clues to understand the excitation
and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find both oscillation amplitude and granulation
power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25\%
in granulation power from [Fe/H]=-0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used
as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations
observed by Kepler. They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using
Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic
surveys such as APOGEE and LAMOST.
