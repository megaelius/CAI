We construct a simple and robust approach for deriving constraints on magnetic fields in galaxy
clusters from rotation measure (RM) maps. Relaxing the commonly used assumptions of a correlation
between the magnetic field strength and the plasma density and of a power-law (in wave number) magnetic
field power spectrum, and using an efficient numerical analysis method, we test the consistency
of a wide range of magnetic field models with RM maps of 11 extended sources in 5 clusters, for which
the data were made available to us. We show that the data reveal no indication for a radial dependence
of the average magnetic field strength, and in particular no indication for a correlation between
the gas density and the field strength. The RM maps of a considerable fraction of the sources either
require or are consistent with the presence of a spatially uniform magnetic field of a relatively
small strength, 0.02-0.3 muG, which contributes significantly to the RM. The RM maps of all but one
source do not require a power-law magnetic field power spectrum, and most are consistent with a power
spectrum dominated by a single wave length. The uncertainties in the magnetic field strengths (and
spatial correlation lengths) derived from RM maps exceed an order of magnitude (and often more).
These uncertainties imply, in particular, that there is no indication in current RM data for a systematic
difference between the magnetic field strengths in radio-halo clusters and in radio-quiet clusters.
With the improvement expected in the near future of the quality and quantity of RM data, our analysis
method will enable one to derive more accurate constraints on magnetic fields in galaxy clusters.
