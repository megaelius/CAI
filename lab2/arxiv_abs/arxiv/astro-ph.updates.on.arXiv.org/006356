Modeling core-collapse supernova with neutrino transport in three dimensions requires tremendous
computing resources and some level of approximations. We present a first comparison study of core-collapse
supernovae in 3D with different physics approximations and hydrodynamic codes. We aim to assess
the impact of the hydrodynamic code, approximations for the neutrino and gravity treatments and
rotation, on the simulation of core-collapse supernovae in 3D. We use four different hydrodynamic
codes in this work (ELEPHANT, FLASH, fGR1, and SPHYNX), jointly with two different neutrino treatments
(IDSA and M1) plus three different gravity treatments (Newtonian, 1D General Relativity correction,
and full GR). Additional parameters discussed in this study are the inclusion of neutrino-electron
scattering via a parametrized deleptonization and the influence of rotation. The four codes compared
in this work include Eulerian and fully Lagrangian (SPH) codes for first time. They show agreement
in the overall evolution of the collapse phase and early postbounce within the range of 10% (20% in
few cases). The comparison of the different neutrino treatments highlights the need to further
investigate the antineutrino luminosities in IDSA, which tend to be rather high. We also pinpoint
the need of including a more detailed heavy-lepton neutrino leakage. When comparing with a full
GR code, including an M1 transport method, we confirmed the influence of neutrino-electron scattering
during the collapse phase, which is adequately captured by the parametrized deleptonization scheme.
Also the effective general relativistic potential reproduces the overall dynamic evolution correctly
in all Newtonian codes. Additionally, we could verify that rotation aids to the shock expansion
and were able to estimate the overall angular momentum losses for each code in rotating scenarios.
