We study the orbital and rotational evolution of the binary system composed by a rocky planet and
its host star considering tidal dissipation within both bodies, in order to characterize the dynamical
evolution near spin-orbit resonances w.r.t. the main features of the tidal evolution. We make use
of the equations of motion that give, on one hand, the time evolution of the semimajor axis ($a$),
the eccentricity ($e$) and both inclinations, that of the star's orbit as seen from the planet ($i_{\mathrm{s}}$)
and that of the planet as seen from the star ($i_{\mathrm{p}}$) and, on the other hand, the equations
that drive the rotational evolution along the maximal inertia axis. We produced a set of regular
equations that can be numerically stable for vanishing values of the eccentricity. We focus our
investigations around spin-orbit resonances, because the angular accelerations caused by the
tidal and the triaxial torques combined can produce permanent captures. We select the Kepler-21b
planet because of its proximity to the host star and, as it is presumably a rocky planet, we have the
possibility to use reliable rheological models for terrestrial planets. We found that, for the
parameters and the initial conditions explored, the orbital evolution is practically independent
of the rotational initial conditions but the dependency on the rheological parameters is noticeable.
As the rotational evolution is much faster than the orbital one, we also noticed that, qualitatively,
both the rotational and orbital evolution can be described completely in terms of the secular tidal
evolution. Therefore, we could obtain reliable analytical estimations of characteristic timescales
at least for $a$, $e$ and $i_{\mathrm{s}}$. We found that since the timescale of orbital decay is
longer than the others, the orbit will be circularized and planarized before the planet arrive to
the Roche limit.
