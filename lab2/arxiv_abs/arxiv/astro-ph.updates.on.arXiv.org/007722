We study the co-evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with galaxies by means of semi-analytic
model (SAM) of galaxy formation based on sub-halo merger trees built from Millennium and Millennium-II
simulation. We utilize the simulation results from Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015 to study two aspects
of the co-evolution, \emph{i.e.} the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background generated
by SMBH merger and the SMBH/galaxy clustering. The characteristic strain amplitude of GW background
predicted by Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015 models are $A_{yr^{-1}}=5.00\times10^{-16}$ and $A_{yr^{-1}}=9.42\times10^{-17}$,
respectively. We find the GW amplitude is very sensitive to the galaxy merger rate. The difference
in the galaxy merger rate between Guo 2013 and Henriques 2015, results in a factor $5$ deviation in
the GW strain amplitude. For clusterings, we calculate the spatially isotropic two point auto-
and cross-correlation functions (2PCFs) for both SMBHs and galaxies by using the mock catalogs
generated from Guo 2013 model. We find that all 2PCFs have positive dependence on both SMBH and galaxy
mass. And there exist a significant time evolution in 2PCFs, namely, the clustering effect is enhanced
at lower redshifts. Interestingly, this result is not reported in the active galactic nuclei samples
in SDSS. Our analysis also shows that, roughly, SMBHs and galaxies, with galaxy mass $10^2\sim10^3$
larger than SMBH mass, have similar pattern of clustering, which is a reflection of the co-evolution
of SMBH and galaxy. Finally, we calculate the first ten multiples of the angular power spectrum of
the energy density of GW background. We find the amplitude of angular power spectrum of the first
ten multiples is about $10\%$ to $60\%$ of the monopole component in the whole frequency range.
