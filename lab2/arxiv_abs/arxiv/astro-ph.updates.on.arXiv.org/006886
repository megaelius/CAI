Faint, hidden contaminants in the point-spread functions (PSFs) of stars cause shifts to their
measured positions. Wilson & Naylor (2017) showed failing to account for these shifts can lead to
a drastic decrease in the number of returned catalogue matches in crowded fields. Here we highlight
the effect these perturbations have on cross-matching, for matches between Gaia DR2 and WISE stars
in a crowded Galactic plane region. Applying the uncertainties as quoted to Gaussian-based astrometric
uncertainty functions (AUFs) can lead, in dense Galactic fields, to only matching 55% of the counterparts.
We describe the construction of empirical descriptions for AUFs, building on the cross-matching
method of Wilson & Naylor (2018), utilising the magnitudes of both catalogues to discriminate between
true and false counterparts. We apply the improved cross-matching method to the Galactic plane
|b| < 10. We provide the most likely counterpart matches and their respective probabilities. We
also analyse several cases to verify the robustness of the results, highlighting some important
caveats and considerations. Finally, we discuss the effect PSF resolution has by comparing the
intra-catalogue nearest neighbour separation distributions of a sample of likely contaminated
WISE objects and their corresponding Spitzer counterpart. We show that some WISE contaminants
are resolved in Spitzer, with smaller intra-catalogue separations. We have highlighted the effect
contaminant stars have on WISE, but it is important for all photometric catalogues, playing an important
role in the next generation of surveys, such as LSST.
