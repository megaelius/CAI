Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution of the Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (CRSF)
in the spectrum of the binary X-ray pulsar Her X-1 and present evidence of a true secular decrease
in the centroid energy Ecyc of the cyclotron line in the pulse phase averaged spectra from 1996 to
2012. Methods. Our results are based on repeated observations of Her X-1 by those X-ray observatories
capable of measuring clearly beyond the cyclotron line energy of about 40 keV. Results. The historical
evolution of the pulse phase averaged CRSF centroid energy Ecyc since its discovery in 1976 is characterized
by an initial value around 35 keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond about40 keV between 1990 and 1994,
and an apparent decay thereafter. Much of this decay, however, was found to be due to an artifact,
namely a correlation between Ecyc and the X-ray luminosity Lx discovered in 2007. In observations
after 2006, however, we now find a statistically significant true secular decrease in the cyclotron
line energy. At the same time, the dependence of Ecyc on X-ray luminosity is still valid with an increase
of about 5% in energy for a factor of two increase in luminosity. A decrease in Ecyc by 4.2 keV over the
16 years from 1996 to 2012 can either be modeled by a linear decay, or by a slow decay until 2006 followed
by a more abrupt decrease thereafter. Conclusions. We speculate that the physical reason could
be connected to a geometric displacement of the cyclotron resonant scattering region in the polar
field or to a true physical change in the magnetic field configuration at the polar cap by the continued
accretion.
