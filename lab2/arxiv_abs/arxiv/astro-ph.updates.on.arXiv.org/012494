The LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration (LSC) recently announced the detection of a compact object
binary merger, GW190425, with a total mass of $3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ M$_{\odot}$, and individual
component masses in range of about 1.1 to 2.5 $M_{\odot}$. If the constituent compact objects are
neutron stars, then the total mass is five standard deviations higher than the mean of $2.66\pm 0.12$
M$_{\odot}$ for Galactic binary neutron stars. The non-detection of such massive BNS systems in
the Galaxy indicates a potential bias against their detection, which can arise if such massive BNS
systems are born with short orbital periods and hence inspiral times of $\sim 10$ Myr. However, we
show that the reported merger rate, $\mathcal{R}_{\rm GW190425}=460^{+1050}_{-390}$ yr$^{-1}$
Gpc$^{-3}$, requires extremely high formation efficiency for such systems of $\lambda_{\rm f,BNS}=
2\times10^{-4}-5\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}^{-1}$, orders of magnitude larger than the formation
efficiency of fast merging BNS systems from population synthesis models, $\lambda_{\rm f,BNS}\approx
(2-5)\times10^{-6} M_{\odot}^{-1}$. Moreover, the comparable merger rates inferred from GW190425
and GW170817 is problematic for two reasons: (i) more massive systems are expected to have a lower
formation rate, and (ii) fast merging channels should constitute $\lesssim 10\%$ of the total BNS
systems if case BB unstable mass transfer is permitted to take place as a formation pathway. We argue
that to account for the high merger rate of GW190425 as a BNS system requires: (i) a change in our understanding
NS formation in supernova explosions, or (ii): that more massive NSs need to be preferentially born
with weaker magnetic fields so that they would be undetectable in the radio surveys. Whether such
an explanation is plausible would require detailed modeling of BNS population with careful treatment
of their magnetic fields evolution.
