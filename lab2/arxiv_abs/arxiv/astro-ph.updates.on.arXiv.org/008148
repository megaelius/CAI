The first detection of a binary neutron star merger has opened the brand new era of multimessenger
astronomy. This historic detection has been instrumental in providing constraints on the tidal
polarizability of neutron stars. In turn, the tidal polarizability has been used to impose limits
on stellar radii and ultimately on the equation of state (EOS). The tidal polarizability is also
sensitive to the second tidal Love number k2. It is the main purpose of this work to perform a detailed
study of k2 which, for a given compactness parameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal
polarizability to the EOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS
plays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of state that yield an accurate
description of the properties of finite nuclei and support neutron stars of two solar masses is used.
Given that the tidal polarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a universal
relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness parameter that is highly insensitive
to the underlying EOS. Thus, besides an extraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement
of the individual stellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation. However,
we observe a strong sensitivity of k2 to the EOS, particularly to the contribution from the inner
crust. Although by itself the tidal polarizability can not contribute to the determination of the
mass-radius relation, future detections of binary neutron star mergers are poised to provide significant
constraints on both the tidal polarizabilities and masses of the individual stars, and thus ultimately
on the mass-radius relation. Yet, subleading corrections to the tidal polarizability are encoded
in the second Love number k2 which displays a large sensitivity to the entire (crust-plus-core)
EOS.
