H$_2$CO is one of the most abundant organic molecules in protoplanetary disks and can serve as a precursor
to more complex organic chemistry. We present an ALMA survey of H$_2$CO towards 15 disks covering
a range of stellar spectral types, stellar ages, and dust continuum morphologies. H$_2$CO is detected
towards 13 disks and tentatively detected towards a 14th. We find both centrally-peaked and centrally-depressed
emission morphologies, and half of the disks show ring-like structures at or beyond expected CO
snowline locations. Together these morphologies suggest that H$_2$CO in disks is commonly produced
through both gas-phase and CO-ice-regulated grain-surface chemistry. We extract disk-averaged
and azimuthally-averaged H$_2$CO excitation temperatures and column densities for four disks
with multiple H$_2$CO line detections. The temperatures are between 20-50K, with the exception
of colder temperatures in the DM Tau disk. These temperatures suggest that H$_2$CO emission in disks
is generally emerging from the warm molecular layer, with some contributions from the colder midplane.
Applying the same H$_2$CO excitation temperatures to all disks in the survey, we find that H$_2$CO
column densities span almost three orders of magnitude ($\sim 5 \times 10^{11} - 5 \times 10^{14}
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). The column densities appear uncorrelated with disk size and stellar age,
but Herbig Ae disks may have less H$_2$CO compared to T Tauri disks, possibly because of less CO freeze-out.
More H$_2$CO observations towards Herbig Ae disks are needed to confirm this tentative trend, and
to better constrain under which disk conditions H$_2$CO and other oxygen-bearing organics efficiently
form during planet formation.
