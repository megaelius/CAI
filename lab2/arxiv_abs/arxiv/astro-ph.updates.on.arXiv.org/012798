We explore the expected galaxy environments of CIV absorbers at z>5 using the Technicolor Dawn simulations.
These simulations reproduce the observed history of reionization, the z~6 galaxy stellar mass
function, the Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at z>5, and the SiIV column density distribution
(CDD) at z~5.5. Nonetheless, the CIV CDD remains underproduced. Comparison with observed CII/SiII
equivalent width ratios and the CII line incidence suggests that a low carbon yield accounts for
some, but not all, of the CIV discrepancy. Alternatively, a density-bounded escape scenario could
harden the metagalactic ionizing background more dramatically even than binary stellar evolution,
boosting the CIV CDD into near-agreement with observations. In this case galaxies ionize more efficiently
and fewer are required to host a given high-ionization absorber. Absorbers' environments therefore
constrain ionizing escape. Regardless of the escape scenario, galaxies correlate with CIV absorbers
out to 300 proper kpc (pkpc). The correlation strengthens independently with galaxy luminosity
and CIV column density. Around strong systems (log(N$_{\rm CIV}$/cm$^{-2}$)>14)), the overdensity
of galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$<-18 or log($L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}$/erg s$^{-1}$) > 41.9 declines from
200-300 within 100 pkpc to 40-60 within 250 pkpc. The previously-suggested association between
strong CIV absorbers and Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z>5 is not expected. It may arise if both populations
inhabit large-scale voids, but for different reasons. Although most neighboring galaxies are
too faint for HST, JWST will, with a single pointing, identify ~10 neighboring galaxies per strong
CIV absorber at z > 5. Ground-based tests of these predictions are possible via deep surveys for Ly$\alpha$
emission using integral field units.
