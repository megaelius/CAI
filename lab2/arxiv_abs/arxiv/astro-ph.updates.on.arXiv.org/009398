We conduct forward-modeling analysis based on our 2.5 dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
simulation of magnetic flux rope (MFR) formation and eruption driven by photospheric converging
motion. The current sheet (CS) evolution during the MFR formation and eruption process in our MHD
simulation can be divided into four stages. The current sheet (CS) evolution during the MFR formation
and eruption process in our MHD simulation can be divided into four stages. The first stage shows
the CS forming and gradually lengthening. Resistive instabilities that disrupt the CS mark the
beginning of the second stage. Magnetic islands disappear in the third stage and reappear in the
fourth stage. Synthetic images and light curves of the seven Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) channels, i.e., 9.4 nm, 13.1 nm, 17.1 nm, 19.3 nm, 21.1 nm, 30.4 nm, and 33.5
nm, and the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray are obtained with forward-modeling analysis. The loop-top source
and the coronal sources of the soft X-ray are reproduced in forward modeling. The light curves of
the seven SDO/AIA channels start to rise once resistive instabilities develop. The light curve
of the 3-25 keV thermal X-ray starts to go up when the reconnection rate reaches one of its peaks. Quasiperiodic
pulsations (QPPs) appear twice in the SDO/AIA 17.1 nm, 21.1 nm, and 30.4 nm channels, corresponding
to the period of chaotic (re)appearance and CS-guided displacements of the magnetic islands. QPPs
appear once in the SDO/AIA 9.4 nm and 33.5 nm channels after the disruption of the CS by resistive instabilities
and in the 19.3 nm channel when the chaotic motion of the magnetic islands reappears.
