Deriving the strength and direction of the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic field in the solar atmosphere
is fundamental for understanding its dynamics. Volume information on the magnetic field mostly
relies on coupling 3D reconstruction methods with photospheric and/or chromospheric surface
vector magnetic fields. Infrared coronal polarimetry could provide additional information to
better constrain magnetic field reconstructions. However, combining such data with reconstruction
methods is challenging, e.g., because of the optical-thinness of the solar corona and the lack and
limitations of stereoscopic polarimetry. To address these issues, we introduce the Data-Optimized
Coronal Field Model (DOCFM) framework, a model-data fitting approach that combines a parametrized
3D generative model, e.g., a magnetic field extrapolation or a magnetohydrodynamic model, with
forward modeling of coronal data. We test it with a parametrized flux rope insertion method and infrared
coronal polarimetry where synthetic observations are created from a known "ground truth" physical
state. We show that this framework allows us to accurately retrieve the ground truth 3D magnetic
field of a set of force-free field solutions from the flux rope insertion method. In observational
studies, the DOCFM will provide a means to force the solutions derived with different reconstruction
methods to satisfy additional, common, coronal constraints. The DOCFM framework therefore opens
new perspectives for the exploitation of coronal polarimetry in magnetic field reconstructions
and for developing new techniques to more reliably infer the 3D magnetic fields that trigger solar
flares and coronal mass ejections.
