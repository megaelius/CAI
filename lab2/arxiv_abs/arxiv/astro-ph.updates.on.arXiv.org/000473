Near-IR data of Classical Novae contain useful information about the ejected gas mass and the thermal
emission by dust formed during eruption, and provide independent methods to classify the objects
according to the colour of their progenitors, and the fading rate and features seen after eruption.
The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea survey (VVV) is a near-IR ESO Public Survey mapping the MW bulge
and southern plane. Data taken during 2010-2011 covered the entire area in the JHKs bands plus some
epochs in Ks-band of the ongoing VVV variability campaign. We used the novae list provided by VSX/AAVSO
catalogue to search for all objects within the VVV area. We used the VVV data to create a near-IR catalogue
of the known Galactic novae in the 562 sq.deg. area covered by VVV. The VVV near-IR catalogue of novae
contains JHKs photometry of 93 objects completed as of December 2012. We also checked in the ongoing
VVV variability campaign for the light-curves of novae that erupted in the last years. VVV images
can also be used to discover and study novae by searching for the expanding shell. Since objects are
seen at different distances and reddening levels, the colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams
show the novae spread in magnitude as well as in colour. Dereddened colours and reddening-free indices
were used with caution and cannot be a good approach in all cases since the distance and spectral features
prevent more conclusive results for some extreme objects. Light-curves for some recent novae are
presented. Thanks to its high spatial resolution in the near-IR, and large Ks-range, the VVV survey
can be a major contributor for the search and study of novae in the most crowded and high-extinction
regions of the Milky Way. The VVV survey area contains ~35 of all known novae in the Galaxy.
