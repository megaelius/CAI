We present a comprehensive study of the applications of the pixel color-magnitude diagram (pCMD)
technique for measuring star formation histories (SFHs) and other stellar population parameters
of galaxies, and demonstrate that the technique can also constrain distances. SFHs have previously
been measured through either the modeling of resolved-star CMDs or of integrated-light SEDs, yet
neither approach can easily be applied to galaxies in the "semi-resolved regime". The pCMD technique
has previously been shown to have the potential to measure stellar populations and star formation
histories in semi-resolved galaxies. Here we present Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams with Python
(pcmdpy), a GPU-accelerated package that makes significant computational improvements to the
original code and including more realistic physical models. These advances include the simultaneous
fitting of distance, modeling a Gaussian metallicity-distribution function, and an observationally-motivated
dust model. GPU-acceleration allows these more realistic models to be fit roughly 7x faster than
the simpler models in the original code. We present results from a suite of mock tests, showing that
with proper model assumptions, the code can simultaneously recover SFH, [Fe/H], distance, and
dust extinction. Our results suggest the code, applied to observations with HST-like resolution,
should constrain these properties with high precision within 10 Mpc and can be applied to systems
out to as far as 100 Mpc. pCMDs open a new window to studying the stellar populations of many galaxies
that cannot be readily studied through other means.
