Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are sporadically emitting pulsars detectable only through
searches for single pulses. While over 100 RRATs have been detected, only a small fraction (roughly
20\%) have phase-connected timing solutions, which are critical for determining how they relate
to other neutron star populations. Detecting more pulses in order to achieve solutions is a key to
understanding their physical nature. Astronomical signals collected by radio telescopes contain
noise from many sources, making the detection of weak pulses difficult. Applying a denoising method
to raw time series prior to performing a single-pulse search typically leads to a more accurate estimation
of their times of arrival (TOAs). Taking into account some features of RRAT pulses and noise, we present
a denoising method based on wavelet data analysis, an image-processing technique. Assuming that
the spin period of an RRAT is known, we estimate the frequency spectrum components contributing
to the composition of RRAT pulses. This allows us to suppress the noise, which contributes to other
frequencies. We apply the wavelet denoising method including selective wavelet reconstruction
and wavelet shrinkage to the de-dispersed time series of eight RRATs with existing timing solutions.
The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of most pulses are improved after wavelet denoising. Compared
to the conventional approach, we measure 12% to 69% more TOAs for the eight RRATs. The new timing solutions
for the eight RRATs show 16% to 90% smaller estimation error of most parameters. Thus, we conclude
that wavelet analysis is an effective tool for denoising RRATs signal.
