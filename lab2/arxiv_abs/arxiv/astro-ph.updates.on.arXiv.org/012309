A 70 Msun black hole was discovered in Milky Way disk in a long period and almost circular detached
binary system (LB-1) with a high metallicity 8 Msun B star companion. Current consensus on the formation
of black holes from high metallicity stars limits the black hole mass to be below 20 Msun due to strong
mass loss in stellar winds. So far this was supported by the population of Galactic black hole X-ray
binaries with Cyg X-1 hosting the most massive 15 Msun black hole. Using the Hurley et al. analytic
evolutionary formulae, we show that the formation of a 70 Msun black hole in high metallicity environment
is possible if stellar wind mass loss rates are reduced by factor of 5. As observations indicate,
a fraction of massive stars (10 percent) have surface magnetic fields which, as suggested by Owocki
et al., may quench the wind mass-loss, independently of stellar mass and metallicity. We also computed
detailed stellar evolution models and we confirm such a scenario. A non-rotating 85 Msun star model
at Z=0.014 with decreased winds ends up as a 71 Msun star prior core-collapse with a 32 Msun helium
core and a 28 Msun CO core. Such star avoids pair-instability pulsation supernova mass loss that
severely limits black hole mass and may form a 70 Msun black hole in the direct collapse. Stars that
can form 70 Msun black holes at high Z expand to significant size with radius of R>600 Rsun (thanks
to large H-rich envelope), however, exceeding the size of LB-1 orbit (a<350 Rsun). Therefore, we
can explain the formation of black holes upto 70 Msun at high metallicity, but unable to explain how
a binary star system like LB-1 could have formed without invoking some exotic scenarios.
