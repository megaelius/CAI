Walter et al. (20012) have recently identified the J=6-5, 5-4, and 2-1 CO rotational emission lines,
and [C_{II}] fine-structure emission line from the star-forming interstellar medium in the high-redshift
submillimeter source HDF 850.1, at z = 5.183. We employ large velocity gradient (LVG) modeling to
analyze the spectra of this source assuming the [C_{II}] and CO emissions originate from (i) separate
unvirialized regions, (ii) separate virialized regions, (iii) uniformly mixed unvirialized
region, and (iv) uniformly mixed virialized regions. We present the best fit set of parameters,
including for each case the ratio $\alpha$ between the total hydrogen/helium gas mass and the CO(1-0)
line luminosity. We also present computations of the ratio of H_{2} mass to [C_{II}] line-luminosity
for optically thin conditions, for a range of gas temperatures and densities, for direct conversion
of [C_{II}] line-luminosities to "dark-H_{2}" masses. For HDF 850.1 we find that a model in which
the CO and C^{+} are uniformly mixed in gas that is shielded from UV radiation, requires a cosmic-ray
or X-ray ionization rate of $\zeta \approx$ 10^{-13} s^{-1}, plausibly consistent with the large
star-formation rate ($\sim$ 10^{3} M$_{\odot}$ yr^{-1}) observed in this source. Enforcing the
cosmological constraint posed by the abundance of dark matter halos in the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology and taking into account other possible contributions to the total gas mass, we find that
three of these four models are less likely at the 2$\sigma$ level. We conclude that modeling HDF 850.1's
ISM as a collection of unvirialized molecular clouds with distinct CO and C^{+} layers, for which
$\alpha$ = 0.6 M$_{\odot}$ (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1} for the CO to H_{2} mass-to-luminosity ratio,
(similar to the standard ULIRG value), is most consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
