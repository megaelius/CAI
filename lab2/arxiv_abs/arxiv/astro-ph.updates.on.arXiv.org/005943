The circular polarization of light that planets reflect is often neglected because it is very small
compared to the linear polarization. It could, however, provide information on a planet's atmosphere
and surface, and on the presence of life, because homochiral molecules that are the building blocks
of life on Earth are known to reflect circularly polarized light. We compute $P_c$, the degree of
circular polarization, for light that is reflected by rocky (exo)planets with liquid water or sulfuric
acid solution clouds, both spatially resolved across the planetary disk and, for planets with patchy
clouds, integrated across the planetary disk, for various planetary phase angles $\alpha$. The
optical thickness and vertical distribution of the atmospheric gas and clouds, the size parameter
and refractive index of the cloud particles, and $\alpha$ all influence $P_c$. Spatially resolved,
$P_c$ varies between $\pm 0.20\%$ (the sign indicates the polarization direction). Only for small
gas optical thicknesses above the clouds do significant sign changes (related to cloud particle
properties) across the planets' hemispheres occur. For patchy clouds, the disk--integrated $P_c$
is typically smaller than $\pm 0.025\%$, with maximums for $\alpha$ between $40^\circ$ and $70^\circ$,
and $120^\circ$ to $140^\circ$. As expected, the disk--integrated $P_c$ is virtually zero at $\alpha=0^\circ$
and 180$^\circ$. The disk--integrated $P_c$ is also very small at $\alpha \approx 100^\circ$.
Measuring circular polarization signals appears to be challenging with current technology. The
small atmospheric circular polarization signal could, however, allow the detection of circular
polarization due to homochiral molecules. Confirmation of the detectability of such signals requires
better knowledge of the strength of circular polarization signals of biological sources.
