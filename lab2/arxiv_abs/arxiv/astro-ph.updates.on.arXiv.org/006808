We present a 69 arcmin$^2$ ALMA survey at 1.1mm, GOODS-ALMA, matching the deepest HST-WFC3 H-band
part of the GOODS-South field. We taper the 0"24 original image with a homogeneous and circular synthesized
beam of 0"60 to reduce the number of independent beams - thus reducing the number of purely statistical
spurious detections - and optimize the sensitivity to point sources. We extract a catalogue of galaxies
purely selected by ALMA and identify sources with and without HST counterparts down to a 5$\sigma$
limiting depth of H=28.2 AB (HST/WFC3 F160W). ALMA detects 20 sources brighter than 0.7 mJy in the
0"60 tapered mosaic (rms sensitivity =0.18 mJy/beam) with a purity greater than 80%. Among these
detections, we identify three sources with no HST nor Spitzer-IRAC counterpart, consistent with
the expected number of spurious galaxies from the analysis of the inverted image; their definitive
status will require additional investigation. An additional three sources with HST counterparts
are detected either at high significance in the higher resolution map, or with different detection-algorithm
parameters ensuring a purity greater than 80%. Hence we identify in total 20 robust detections.
Our wide contiguous survey allows us to push further in redshift the blind detection of massive galaxies
with ALMA with a median redshift of $z$=2.92 and a median stellar mass of M$_{\star}$ = 1.1 $\times
10^{11}$M$_\odot$. Our sample includes 20% HST-dark galaxies (4 out of 20), all detected in the
mid-infrared with IRAC. The near-infrared based photometric redshifts of two of them $z\sim$4.3
and 4.8) suggest that these sources have redshifts $z$>4. At least 40% of the ALMA sources host an
X-ray AGN, compared to 14% for other galaxies of similar mass and redshift. The wide area of our ALMA
survey provides lower values at the bright end of number counts than single-dish telescopes
