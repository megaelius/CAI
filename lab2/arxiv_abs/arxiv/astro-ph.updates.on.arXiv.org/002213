We describe and discuss the selection procedure and statistical properties of the galaxy sample
used by the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey (CALIFA), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies
using integral field spectroscopy. The CALIFA "mother sample" was selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with an r-band isophotal major
axis between 45" and 79.2" and with a redshift 0.005 < z < 0.03. The mother sample contains 939
objects, 600 of which will be observed in the course of the CALIFA survey. The selection of targets
for observations is based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of the
mother sample. By comparison with a large set of SDSS galaxies, we find that the CALIFA sample is representative
of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19 > Mr > -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between
10^9.7 and 10^11.4Msun. In particular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead
to any significant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or small galaxies. Only below
luminosities of Mr = -19 (or stellar masses < 10^9.7Msun) is there a prevalence of galaxies with
larger isophotal sizes, especially of nearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form
< 10% of the full sample. We estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities
and sizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimates from the full SDSS
when accounting for large-scale structure. We also present a number of value-added quantities
determined for the galaxies in the CALIFA sample. We explore different ways of characterizing the
environments of CALIFA galaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from
the field to genuine clusters. We finally consider the expected incidence of active galactic nuclei
among CALIFA galaxies.
