Recently, we introduced PLanetary Atmospheric Tool for Observer Noobs (PLATON), a Python package
that calculates model transmission spectra for exoplanets and retrieves atmospheric characteristics
based on observed spectra. We now expand the capabilities of this package to include the ability
to compute secondary eclipse depths. We have also added the option to calculate models using the
correlated-k method for radiative transfer, which vastly improves accuracy without sacrificing
speed. Additionally, we update the opacities in PLATON--many of which were generated using old
or proprietary line lists--using the most recent and complete public line lists. These opacities
are made available at R=1000 and R=10,000 over the $0.3-30 \mu m$ range, and at R=375,000 in select
near IR bands, making it possible to utilize PLATON for ground-based high resolution cross correlation
studies. To demonstrate \platon's new capabilities, we perform a retrieval on published HST and
Spitzer transmission and emission spectra of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD 189733b. This is the
first joint transit and secondary eclipse retrieval for this planet in the literature, as well as
the most comprehensive set of both transit and eclipse data assembled for a retrieval to date. We
find that these high signal-to-noise data are well-matched by atmosphere models with a C/O ratio
of $0.66_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$ and a metallicity of $12_{-5}^{+8}$ times solar where the terminator
is dominated by extended nanometer-sized haze particles at optical wavelengths. These are among
the smallest uncertainties reported to date for the atmospheric composition of a transiting gas
giant planet. We conclude that we are now operating in a regime where the uncertainty due to our choice
of model is larger than the uncertainties associated with the data themselves.
