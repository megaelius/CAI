Space weather events may cause damage to several fields, including aviation, satellites, oil and
gas industries, and electrical systems, leading to economic and commercial losses. Solar flares
are one of the most significant events, and refer to sudden radiation releases that can affect the
Earth's atmosphere within a few hours or minutes. Therefore, it is worth designing high-performance
systems for forecasting such events. Although in the literature there are many approaches for flare
forecasting, there is still a lack of consensus concerning the techniques used for designing these
systems. Seeking to establish some standardization while designing flare predictors, in this
study we propose a novel methodology for designing such predictors, further validated with extreme
gradient boosting tree classifiers and time series. This methodology relies on the following well-defined
machine learning based pipeline: (i) univariate feature selection; (ii) randomized hyper-parameter
optimization; (iii) imbalanced data treatment; (iv) adjustment of cut-off point of classifiers;
and (v) evaluation under operational settings. To verify our methodology effectiveness, we designed
and evaluated three proof-of-concept models for forecasting $\geq C$ class flares up to 72 hours
ahead. Compared to baseline models, those models were able to significantly increase their scores
of true skill statistics (TSS) under operational forecasting scenarios by 0.37 (predicting flares
in the next 24 hours), 0.13 (predicting flares within 24-48 hours), and 0.36 (predicting flares
within 48-72 hours). Besides increasing TSS, the methodology also led to significant increases
in the area under the ROC curve, corroborating that we improved the positive and negative recalls
of classifiers while decreasing the number of false alarms.
