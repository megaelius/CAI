We analyze 494 main sequence turnoff and subgiant stars from the AMBRE:HARPS survey. These stars
have accurate astrometric information from \textit{Gaia}/DR1, providing reliable age estimates
with relative uncertainties of $\pm1-2$ Gyr and allowing precise orbital determinations. The
sample is split based on chemistry into a low-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often identified as thin
disk stellar populations, and a high-[Mg/Fe] sequence, which are often associated with the thick
disk. We find that the high-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence has extended star formation for several Gyr
and is coeval with the oldest stars of the low-[Mg/Fe] chemical sequence: both the low- and high-[Mg/Fe]
sequences were forming stars at the same time. The high-[Mg/Fe] stellar populations are only vertically
extended for the oldest, most-metal poor and highest [Mg/Fe] stars. When comparing vertical velocity
dispersion for both sequences, the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence has lower velocity dispersion than the
low-[Mg/Fe] sequence for stars of similar age. Identifying either group as thin or thick disk based
on chemistry is misleading. The stars belonging to the high-[Mg/Fe] sequence have perigalacticons
that originate in the inner disk, while the perigalacticons of stars on the low-[Mg/Fe] sequence
are generally around the solar neighborhood. From the orbital properties of the stars, the high-and
low-[Mg/Fe] sequences are most likely a reflection of the chemical enrichment history of the inner
and outer disk populations; radial mixing causes both populations to be observed in situ at the solar
position. Based on these results, we emphasize that it is important to be clear in defining what populations
are being referenced when using the terms thin and thick disk, and that ideally the term thick disk
should be reserved for purely geometric definitions to avoid confusion and be consistent with definitions
in external galaxies.
