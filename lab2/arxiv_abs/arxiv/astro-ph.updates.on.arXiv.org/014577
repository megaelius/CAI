We investigate the relations between the properties of bars and their host galaxies in a sample of
77 nearby barred galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological types and luminosities, with
34 SB0-SBa and 43 SBab-SBc galaxies. The sample includes all the galaxies with reliable direct measurement
of their bar pattern speed based on long-slit or integral-field stellar spectroscopy using the
Tremaine-Weinberg method. We limited our analysis to the galaxies with a relatively small relative
error on the bar pattern speed (smaller than 50 per cent) and not hosting an ultrafast bar. For each
galaxy, we collected the radius, strength, pattern speed, corotation radius, and rotation rate
for the bar and we also collected the Hubble type and absolute SDSS r-band magnitude. We also used
literature bulge-to-total luminosity ratio for a subsample of 53 galaxies with an available photometric
decomposition. We confirmed earlier observational findings that longer bars rotate with lower
bar pattern speeds, shorter bars are weaker, and bars with a small bar rotation rate rotate with higher
bar pattern speeds and have smaller corotation radii. In addition, we found that stronger bars rotate
with lower bar pattern speeds, as predicted from the interchange of angular momentum during bar
evolution, which in turn may depend on different galaxy properties. Moreover, we report that brighter
galaxies host longer bars, which rotate with lower bar pattern speeds and have larger corotation
radii. This result is in agreement with a scenario of downsizing in bar formation, if more massive
galaxies formed earlier and had sufficient time to slow down, grow in length, and push corotation
outwards.
