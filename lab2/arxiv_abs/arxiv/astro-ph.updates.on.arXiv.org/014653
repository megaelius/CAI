Exocomets are small bodies releasing gas and dust which orbit stars other than the Sun. Their existence
was first inferred from the detection of variable absorption features in stellar spectra in the
late 1980s using spectroscopy. More recently, they have been detected through photometric transits
from space, and through far-IR/mm gas emission within debris disks. As (exo)comets are considered
to contain the most pristine material accessible in stellar systems, they hold the potential to
give us information about early stage formation and evolution conditions of extra Solar Systems.
In the Solar System, comets carry the physical and chemical memory of the protoplanetary disk environment
where they formed, providing relevant information on processes in the primordial solar nebula.
The aim of this paper is to compare essential compositional properties between Solar System comets
and exocomets. The paper aims to highlight commonalities and to discuss differences which may aid
the communication between the involved research communities and perhaps also avoid misconceptions.
Exocomets likely vary in their composition depending on their formation environment like Solar
System comets do, and since exocomets are not resolved spatially, they pose a challenge when comparing
them to high fidelity observations of Solar System comets. Observations of gas around main sequence
stars, spectroscopic observations of "polluted" white dwarf atmospheres and spectroscopic observations
of transiting exocomets suggest that exocomets may show compositional similarities with Solar
System comets. The recent interstellar visitor 2I/Borisov showed gas, dust and nuclear properties
similar to that of Solar System comets. This raises the tantalising prospect that observations
of interstellar comets may help bridge the fields of exocomet and Solar System comets.
