We present a reformulation of axion modified electrodynamics redefined within the constitutive
relations between the D, H, B and E fields. This allows the interpretation of the axion induced background
bound charge, polarization current and bound current along with the axion induced polarization
and magnetization with the former satisfying the charge-current continuity equation. This representation
is of similar form to odd-parity Lorentz invariance violating background fields. We show that when
a DC B-field is applied an oscillating polarization is induced at a frequency equivalent to the axion
mass. In contrast, when a large DC E-field is applied an oscillating magnetization is induced. We
show that these terms are equivalent to impressed source terms, analogous to the way voltage and
current sources are impressed into Maxwell's equations in circuit and antenna theory. The source
terms represent conversion of external energy into electromagnetic energy, and in the case of axion
modified electrodynamics this is due to the inverse Primakoff effect converting energy from axions
into photons. The axion induced oscillating polarization under a DC B-field is analogous to a permanent
polarized electret or voltage source oscillating at the axion Compton frequency, which sourced
from an electromotive force. Furthermore, the integral forms of the equations can be used to clearly
define the boundary conditions between distinct media either with or without axion induced background
polarization or magnetization. In particular, it is shown that the impressed electrical DC current
that drives the solenoidal magnetic DC field of an electromagnet, induces an impressed magnetic
current parallel to the electrical current, oscillating at the Compton frequency of the axion.
This magnetic current drives the voltage source and defines the boundary condition of the oscillating
axion induced polarization.
