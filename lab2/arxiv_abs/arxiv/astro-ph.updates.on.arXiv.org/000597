The advent of high-resolution imaging of galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect
(SZE) provides a unique probe of the astrophysics of the intracluster medium (ICM) out to high redshifts.
To investigate the effects of cluster mergers on resolved SZE images, we present a high-resolution
cosmological simulation of a 1.5E15 M_sun adiabatic cluster using the TreeSPH code ChaNGa. This
massive cluster undergoes a 10:3:1 ratio triple merger accompanied by a dramatic rise in its integrated
Compton-Y, peaking at z = 0.05. By modeling the thermal SZE (tSZ) and kinetic SZE (kSZ) spectral distortions
of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) at this redshift with relativistic corrections, we produce
various mock images of the cluster at frequencies and resolutions achievable with current high-resolution
SZE instruments. The two gravitationally-bound merging subclusters account for 10% and 1% of the
main cluster's integrated Compton-Y, and have extended merger shock features in the background
ICM visible in our mock images. We show that along certain projections and at specific frequencies,
the kSZ CMB intensity distortion can dominate over the tSZ due to the large line of sight velocities
of the subcluster gas and the unique frequency-dependence of these effects. We estimate that a one-velocity
assumption in estimation of line of sight velocities of the merging subclusters from the kSZ induces
a bias of ~10%. This velocity bias is small relative to other sources of uncertainty in observations,
partially due to helpful bulk motions in the background ICM induced by the merger. Our results show
that high-resolution SZE observations, which have recently detected strong kSZ signals in subclusters
of merging systems, can robustly probe the dynamical as well as the thermal state of the ICM.
