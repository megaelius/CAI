The recent detection of 60Fe in the cosmic rays provides conclusive evidence that there is a recently
synthesized component (few MY) in the GCRs (Binns et al. 2016). In addition, these nuclei must have
been synthesized and accelerated in supernovae near the solar system, probably in the Sco-Cen OB
association subgroups, which are about 100 pc distant from the Sun. Recent theoretical work on the
production of r-process nuclei appears to indicate that it is difficult for SNe to produce the solar
system abundances relative to iron of r-process elements with high atomic number (Z), including
the actinides (Th, U, Np, Pu, and Cm). Instead, it is believed by many that the heaviest r-process
nuclei, or perhaps even all r-process nuclei, are produced in binary neutron star mergers. Since
we now know that there is at least a component of the GCRs that has been recently synthesized and accelerated,
models of r-process production by SNe and BNSM can be tested by measuring the relative abundances
of these ultra-heavy r-process nuclei, and especially the actinides, since they are radioactive
and provide clocks that give the time interval from nucleosynthesis to detection at Earth. Since
BNSM are believed to be much less frequent in our galaxy than SNe (roughly 1000 times less frequent,
the ratios of the actinides, each with their own half-life, will enable a clear determination of
whether the heaviest r-process nuclei are synthesized in SNe or in BNSM. In addition, the r-process
nuclei for the charge range from 34 to 82 can be used to constrain models of r-process production in
BNSM and SNe. Thus, GCRs become a multi-messenger component in the study of BNSM and SNe.
