We use a sample of about 22,000 galaxies at $0.65<z<1.2$ from the VIPERS PDR-1 catalogue,
to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement of the galaxy {\it clustering ratio}
$\eta_{g,R}$. This statistic has favourable properties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities
characterizing the smoothed density field in spheres of given radius $R$: the value of its correlation
function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nR)$, and its variance $\sigma^2(R)$. For sufficiently
large values of $R$, this is a universal number, capturing 2-point clustering information independently
of the linear bias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. In this
paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,R}$ to quasi-linear scales
and how to control and remove observational selection effects which are typical of redshift surveys
as VIPERS. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that
match the survey selection process. These results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,R}$ to non-linearities
and observational effects, which is related to its very definition as a ratio of quantities that
are similarly affected. We measure $\Omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. In addition to
the great precision achieved on our estimation of $\Omega_m$ using VIPERS PDR-1, this result is
remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recent estimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained
applying the same technique to the SDSS-LRG catalogue. It, therefore, suports the robustness of
the present analysis. Moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim
0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\Omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$ which highlights
the great consistency between our estimation and other cosmological probes such as BAOs, CMB and
Supernovae.
