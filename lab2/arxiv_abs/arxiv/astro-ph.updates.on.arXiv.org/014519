Mechanical active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback plays a key role in massive galaxies, galaxy
groups and clusters. However, the energy content of AGN jets that mediate this feedback process
is still far from clear. Here we present a preliminary study of radial elongations $\tau$ of a large
sample of X-ray cavities, which are apparently produced by mechanical AGN feedback. All the cavities
in our sample are elongated along the angular (type-I) or jet directions (type-II), or nearly circular
(type-III). The observed value of $\tau$ roughly decreases as the cavities rise buoyantly, confirming
the same trend found in hydrodynamic simulations. For young cavities, both type-I and II cavities
exist, and the latter dominates. Assuming a spheroidal cavity shape, we derive an analytical relation
between the intrinsic radial elongation $\bar{\tau}$ and the inclination-angle-dependent value
of $\tau$, showing that projection effect makes cavities appear more circular, but does not change
type-I cavities into type-II ones, or vice versa. We summarize radial elongations of young cavities
in hydrodynamic simulations, and find that $\bar{\tau}$ increases with the kinetic fraction of
AGN jets. While mild jets always produce type-II cavities, thermal-energy-dominated strong jets
produce type-I cavities, and kinetic-energy-dominated strong jets produce type-II cavities.
The existence of type-I young cavities indicates that some AGN jets are strong and dominated by thermal
energy (or cosmic rays). If most jets are dominated by non-kinetic energies, our results suggest
that they must be long-duration mild jets. However, if most jets are strong, they must be dominated
by the kinetic energy.
