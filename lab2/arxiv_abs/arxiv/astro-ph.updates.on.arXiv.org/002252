We revisit the excursion set approach to calculate void abundances in chameleon-type modified
gravity theories, which was previously studied by Clampitt, Cai and Li (2013). We focus on properly
accounting for the void-in-cloud effect, i.e., the growth of those voids sitting in over-dense
regions may be restricted by the evolution of their surroundings. This effect may change the distribution
function of voids hence affect predictions on the differences between modified gravity and GR.
We show that the thin-shell approximation usually used to calculate the fifth force is qualitatively
good but quantitatively inaccurate. Therefore, it is necessary to numerically solve the fifth
force in both over-dense and under-dense regions. We then generalise the Eulerian void assignment
method of Paranjape, Lam and Sheth (2012) to our modified gravity model. We implement this method
in our Monte Carlo simulations and compare its results with the original Lagrangian methods. We
find that the abundances of small voids are significantly reduced in both modified gravity and GR
due to the restriction of environments. However, the change in void abundances for the range of void
radii of interest for both models is similar. Therefore, the difference between models remains
similar to the results from the Lagrangian method, especially if correlated steps of the random
walks are used. As Clampitt, Cai and Li (2013), we find that the void abundance is much more sensitive
to modified gravity than halo abundances. Our method can then be a faster alternative to N-body simulations
for studying the qualitative behaviour of a broad class of theories. We also discuss the limitations
and other practical issues associated with its applications.
