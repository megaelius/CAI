Recent surveys have revealed that protoplanetary disks typically have dust masses that appear
to be insufficient to account for the high occurrence rate of exoplanet systems. We demonstrate
that this observed dust depletion is consistent with the radial drift of pebbles. Using a Monte Carlo
method we simulate the evolution of a cluster of protoplanetary disks, using a 1D numerical method
to viscously evolve each gas disk together with the radial drift of dust particles that have grown
to 100 $\mu$m in size. For a 2 Myr old cluster of stars, we find a slightly sub-linear scaling between
the gas disk mass and the gas accretion rate ($M_\mathrm{g}\propto\dot{M}^{0.9}$). However,
for the dust mass we find that evolved dust disks have a much weaker scaling with the gas accretion
rate, with the precise scaling depending on the age at which the cluster is sampled and the intrinsic
age spread of the disks in the cluster. Ultimately, we find that the dust mass present in protoplanetary
disk is on the order of 10-100 Earth masses in 1-3 Myr old star-forming regions, a factor of 10 to 100
depleted from the original dust budget. As the dust drains from the outer disk, pebbles pile up in
the inner disk and locally increase the dust-to-gas ratio by a factor of up to 4 above the initial value.
In these high dust-to-gas ratio regions we find conditions that are favourable for planetesimal
formation via the streaming instability and subsequent growth by pebble accretion. We also find
the following scaling relations with stellar mass within a 1-2 Myr old cluster: a slightly super-linear
scaling between the gas accretion rate and stellar mass ($\dot{M}\propto M_\star^{1.4}$), a slightly
super-linear scaling between the gas disk mass and the stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{g}\propto M_\star^{1.4}$)
and a super-linear relation between the dust disk mass and stellar mass ($M_\mathrm{d}\propto
M_\star^{1.4-4.1}$).
