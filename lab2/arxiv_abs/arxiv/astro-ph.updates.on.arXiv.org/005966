Gas expulsion or gas retention is a central issue in most of the models for multiple stellar populations
and light element anti-correlations in globular clusters. The success of the residual matter expulsion
or its retention within young stellar clusters has also a fundamental importance in order to understand
how star formation proceeds in present-day and ancient star-forming galaxies and if proto-globular
clusters with multiple stellar populations are formed in the present epoch. It is usually suggested
that either the residual gas is rapidly ejected from star-forming clouds by stellar winds and supernova
explosions, or that the enrichment of the residual gas and the formation of the second stellar generation
occur so rapidly, that the negative stellar feedback is not significant. Here we continue our study
of the early development of star clusters in the extreme environments and discuss the restrictions
that strong radiative cooling and stellar mass segregation provide on the gas expulsion from dense
star-forming clouds. A large range of physical initial conditions in star-forming clouds which
include the star-forming cloud mass, compactness, gas metallicity, star formation efficiency
and effects of massive stars segregation are discussed. It is shown that in sufficiently massive
and compact clusters hot shocked winds around individual massive stars may cool before merging
with their neighbors. This dramatically reduces the negative stellar feedback, prevents the development
of the global star cluster wind and expulsion of the residual and the processed matter into the ambient
interstellar medium. The critical lines which separate the gas expulsion and the gas retention
regimes are obtained.
