Nuclear star clusters surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galactic nuclei contain
large numbers of stars, black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs), a fraction of which are likely
to form binaries. These binaries were suggested to form a triple system with the SMBH, which acts
as a perturber and may enhance BH and NS mergers via the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. We follow-up previous
studies, but for the first time perform an extensive statistical study of BH-BH, NS-NS and BH-NS
binary mergers by means of direct high-precision regularized $N$-body simulations, including
Post-Newtonian (PN) terms up to order PN2.5. We consider different SMBH masses, slopes for the BH
mass function, binary semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions, and different spatial
distributions for the binaries. We find that the merger rates are a decreasing function of the SMBH
mass and are in the ranges $\sim 0.17$-$0.52 \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, $\sim 0.06$-$0.10
\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\sim 0.04$-$0.16 \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
for BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS binaries, respectively. However, the rate estimate from this channel
remains highly uncertain and depends on the specific assumptions regarding the star-formation
history in galactic nuclei and the supply rate of compact objects. We find that $\sim 10\%$--$20\%$
of the mergers enter the LIGO band with eccentricities $\gtrsim 0.1$. We also compare our results
to the secular approximation, and show that $N$-body simulations generally predict a larger number
of mergers. Finally, these events can also be observable via their electromagnetic counterparts,
thus making these compact object mergers especially valuable for cosmological and astrophysical
purposes.
