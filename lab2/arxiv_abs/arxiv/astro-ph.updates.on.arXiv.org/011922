On the basis of its low luminosity, its chemical composition, and the absence of a large-scale outflow,
the dense core Cha-MMS1 located in the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud was proposed as a first hydrostatic
core (FHSC) candidate a decade ago. Our goal is to test this hypothesis by searching for a slow, compact
outflow driven by Cha-MMS1 that would match the predictions of MHD simulations for this short phase
of star formation. We use the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) to map Cha-MMS1
at high angular resolution in CO 3-2 and 13CO 3-2 as well as in continuum emission. We report the detection
of a bipolar outflow emanating from the central core, along a (projected) direction roughly parallel
to the filament in which Cha-MMS1 is embedded and perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field.
The morphology of the outflow indicates that its axis lies close to the plane of the sky. We measure
velocities corrected for inclination of more than 90km/s which is clearly incompatible with the
expected properties of a FHSC outflow. Several properties of the outflow are determined and compared
to previous studies of Class 0 and Class I protostars. The outflow of Cha-MMS1 has a much smaller momentum
force than the outflows of other Class 0 protostars. In addition, we find a dynamical age of 200-3000yr
indicating that Cha-MMS1 might be one of the youngest ever observed Class 0 protostars. While the
existence of the outflow suggests the presence of a disk, no disk is detected in continuum emission
and we derive an upper limit of 55au to its radius. We conclude that Cha-MMS1 has already gone through
the FHSC phase and is a young Class 0 protostar, but it has not brought its outflow to full power yet.
