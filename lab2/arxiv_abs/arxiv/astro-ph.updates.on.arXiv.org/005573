The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will conduct a range of observational programs,
including a galaxy redshift survey using the redshifted H$\alpha$ emission line as the primary
feature for spectroscopic redshift determination. Due to the finite spectroscopic resolution
of the WFIRST grism, the H$\alpha$ line and the neighboring NII lines are not separately resolved,
leading to a potential bias in the redshift that depends on the NII/H$\alpha$ ratio. We investigate
how this bias propagates into the redshift-space correlation functions and measurements of cosmic
expansion and growth of structure obtained from the WFIRST redshift survey. Using the Buzzard simulation
of mock galaxies, we explore the effect of line blending and mass (hence environment)-dependent
NII/H$\alpha$ ratio on redshift-space distortion (RSD) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements. We measured the BAO shift parameters $\alpha_{\parallel}$ and $\alpha_{\perp}$,
as well as the growth of structure parameter $f_{v}$, and calculated their errors based on the correlations
between the NII/H$\alpha$ ratio and large-scale structure. We found that $\Delta\alpha_{\parallel}
= 0.31 \pm 0.23 \%$ ($0.26\pm0.17\%$), $\Delta\alpha_{\perp} = -0.10\pm0.10\%$ ($-0.12 \pm 0.11
\%$), and $\Delta f_{v} = 0.17\pm0.33\%$ ($-0.20 \pm 0.30\%$) for the redshift 1.355--1.994 (0.700--1.345)
bins, which would use approximately 18$\%$, 9$\%$, and 7$\%$ of the systematic error budget in a
root-sum-square sense. These errors may be small enough that even without mitigation they are tolerable,
and we discuss mitigations that may further reduce this error.
