We present a catalogue of white dwarf candidates selected from the second data release of $Gaia$
(DR2). We used a sample of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) to map the entire space spanned by these objects in the $Gaia$ Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
We then defined a set of cuts in absolute magnitude, colour, and a number of $Gaia$ quality flags to
remove the majority of contaminating objects. Finally, we adopt a method analogous to the one presented
in our earlier SDSS photometric catalogues to calculate a probability of being a white dwarf ($P_{\mathrm{WD}}$)
for all $Gaia$ sources which passed the initial selection. The final catalogue is composed of $439\,659$
stars with calculated $P_{\mathrm{WD}}$ from which it is possible to select a sample of $\simeq
260\,000$ high-confidence white dwarf candidates in the magnitude range $8<G<21$. We derive atmospheric
parameters for most high-confidence degenerate stars using $Gaia$ data and find them to be in good
agreement with previously available photometric data sets. By comparing this catalogue with an
independent sample of SDSS white dwarf candidates we estimate an upper limit in completeness of
$81$ per cent for white dwarfs with $G \leq 20$ mag and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} > 7000\,$K, at high galactic
latitudes ($|b|>20^{\circ}$). However, the completeness drops at low galactic latitudes, and
the magnitude limit of the catalogue varies significantly across the sky as a function of $Gaia$'s
scanning law. We also provide the list of objects within our sample with available SDSS spectroscopy.
We use this spectroscopic sample to characterise the observed structure of the white dwarf distribution
in the H-R diagram.
