We investigate the stellar disk structure of six nearby edge-on spiral galaxies using high-resolution
JHKs-band images and 3D radiative transfer models. To explore how mass and environment shape spiral
disks, we selected galaxies with rotational velocities between 69 < Vrot < 245 km/sec, and
two with unusual morphologies. We find a wide diversity of disk structure. Of the fast-rotating
(Vrot > 150 km/sec) galaxies, only NGC 4013 has the super-thin+thin+thick nested disk structure
seen in NGC 891 and the Milky Way, albeit with decreased oblateness, while NGC 1055, a disturbed massive
spiral galaxy, contains disks with hz $\lesssim$ 200 pc. NGC 4565, another fast-rotator, contains
a prominent ring at a radius ~5 kpc but no super-thin disk. Despite these differences, all fast-rotating
galaxies in our sample have inner truncations in at least one of their disks. These truncations lead
to Freeman Type II profiles when projected face-on. Slow-rotating galaxies are less complex, lacking
inner disk truncations and requiring fewer disk components to reproduce their light distributions.
Super-thin disk components in undisturbed disks contribute ~25% of the total Ks-band light, up
to that of the thin-disk contribution. The presence of super-thin disks correlates with infrared
flux ratios; galaxies with super-thin disks have f(Ks)/f(60 $\mu$m) $\leq$ 0.12 for integrated
light, consistent with super-thin disks being regions of on-going star-formation. Attenuation-corrected
vertical color gradients in (J-Ks) correlate with the observed disk structure and are consistent
with population gradients with young-to-intermediate ages closer to the midplane, indicating
that disk heating-or cooling-is a ubiquitous phenomenon.
