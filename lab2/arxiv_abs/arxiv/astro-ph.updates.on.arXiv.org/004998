While the evolution of superbubbles driven by clustered supernovae (SNe) has been studied by numerous
authors, the resulting radial momentum yield is uncertain by as much as an order of magnitude depending
on the computational methods and the assumed properties of the surrounding interstellar medium
(ISM). In this work, we study the origin of these discrepancies, and seek to determine the correct
momentum budget. We carry out 3D hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of clustered
supernova explosions, using a Lagrangian method and checking for convergence as we increase the
resolution. We find that the terminal momentum of a shell driven by clustered supernovae is dictated
almost entirely by the rate of mixing across the contact discontinuity between the hot and cold phases,
and that this mixing rate is dominated by numerical diffusion even at the highest resolution we can
achieve, 0.03 $M_\odot$. Magnetic fields also reduce the mixing rate, so that MHD simulations produce
higher momentum yields than HD ones at equal resolution. As a result, we obtain only a lower limit
on the momentum yield from clustered supernovae. Combining this with our previous 1D results, which
provide an upper limit because they allow almost no mixing across the contact discontinuity, we
conclude that the momentum yield per SN from clustered SNe is bounded between $2\times 10^5$ and
$3\times 10^6$ $M_\odot$ km s$^{-1}$. We urge that published claims to provide a converged value
for this quantity, which are based on simulations with substantially higher rates of numerical
diffusion than ours, be treated with caution.
