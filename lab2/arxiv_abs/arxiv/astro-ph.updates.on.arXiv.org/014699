We present the STARS library, a grid of tidal disruption event (TDE) simulations interpolated to
provide the mass fallback rate ($dM/dt$) to the black hole for a main-sequence star of any stellar
mass, stellar age, and impact parameter. We use a 1D stellar evolution code to construct stars with
accurate stellar structures and chemical abundances, then perform tidal disruption simulations
in a 3D adaptive-mesh hydrodynamics code with a Helmholtz equation of state, in unprecedented resolution:
from 131 to 524 cells across the diameter of the star. The interpolated library of fallback rates
is publicly available and one can query the library for any stellar mass, stellar age, and impact
parameter. We provide new fitting formulae for important disruption quantities ($\beta_{\rm
crit}, \Delta M, \dot M_{\rm peak}, t_{\rm peak}, n_\infty$) as a function of stellar mass, stellar
age, and impact parameter. Each of these quantities vary significantly with stellar mass and stellar
age, but we are able to reduce all of our simulations to a single relationship that depends only on
stellar structure, characterized by a single parameter $\rho_c/\bar\rho$, and impact parameter
$\beta$. We also find that in general, more centrally concentrated stars have steeper $dM/dt$ rise
slopes and shallower decay slopes. For the same $\Delta M$, the shape of the $dM/dt$ varies significantly
with stellar mass, promising the potential determination of stellar properties from the TDE light
curve alone. The shape of the fallback-rate curves depends strongly on stellar structure and to
a certain extent stellar mass, meaning that fitting TDEs using this library offers a better opportunity
to determine the nature of the disrupted star and the black hole.
