We detect bright emission in the far infrared fine structure [O III] 88$\mu$m line from a strong lensing
candidate galaxy, H-ATLAS J113526.3-014605, hereafter G12v2.43, at z=3.127, using the $\rm 2^{nd}$
generation Redshift (z) and Early Universe Spectrometer (ZEUS-2) at the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment
Telescope (APEX). This is only the fifth detection of this far-IR line from a sub-millimeter galaxy
at the epoch of galaxy assembly. The observed [O III] luminosity of $7.1\times10^{9}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{L_{\odot}}\,$
likely arises from HII regions around massive stars, and the amount of Lyman continuum photons required
to support the ionization indicate the presence of $(1.2-5.2)\times10^{6}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})$
equivalent O5.5 or higher stars; where $\mu$ would be the lensing magnification factor. The observed
line luminosity also requires a minimum mass of $\sim 2\times 10^{8}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$
in ionized gas, that is $0.33\%$ of the estimated total molecular gas mass of $6\times10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$.
We compile multi-band photometry tracing rest-frame UV to millimeter continuum emission to further
constrain the properties of this dusty high redshift star-forming galaxy. Via SED modeling we find
G12v2.43 is forming stars at a rate of 916 $\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,\rm{yr^{-1}}$
and already has a stellar mass of $8\times 10^{10}\,\rm(\frac{10}{\mu})\,\rm{M_{\odot}}\,$.
We also constrain the age of the current starburst to be $\leqslant$ 5 million years, making G12v2.43
a gas rich galaxy lying above the star-forming main sequence at z$\sim$3, undergoing a growth spurt
and, could be on the main sequence within the derived gas depletion timescale of $\sim$66 million
years.
