UV and optically selected candidates for stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) often exhibit broad
spectral features (HeII emission, H$\alpha$ emission, or absorption lines) on a blackbody-like
continuum (1e4K<T<1e5K). The lines presumably emit from TDE debris or circumnuclear clouds photoionized
by the flare. Line velocities however are much lower than expected from a stellar disruption by supermassive
black hole (SMBH), and are somewhat faster than expected for the broad line region (BLR) clouds of
a persistently active galactic nucleus (AGN). The distinctive spectral states are not strongly
related to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use exhaustive photoionization
modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud properties that yield (e.g.) a He-overbright state
where a large HeII(4686A)/H$\alpha$ line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment. Although
observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like illumination can not reproduce
the observed equivalent widths. We therefore propose to explain these properties by a light-echo
photoionization model: the initial flash of a hot blackbody (detonation) excites BLR clouds, which
are then seen superimposed on continuum from a later, expanded, cooled stage of the central luminous
source. The implied cloud mass is substellar, which may be inconsistent with a TDE. Given these and
other inconsistencies with TDE models (e.g. host-galaxies distribution) we suggest to also consider
alternative origins for these nuclear flares, which we briefly discuss (e.g. nuclear supernovae
and starved/subluminous AGNs).
