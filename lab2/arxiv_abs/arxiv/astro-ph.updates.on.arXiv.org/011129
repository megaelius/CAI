Context. Binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) provide several opportunities for research of fundamental
physics. However, finding them can be challenging. Several subdwarf B (sdB) binary systems with
possible neutron star companions have been identified, allowing us to perform a targeted search
for MSPs within these systems. Aims. We aim to find MSPs in sdB binary systems. Methods. Six sdBs with
companions in the neutron star mass range, as determined from their optical light curves, were observed
with the Green Bank and Westerbork radio telescopes. The data were searched for periodic signals
as well as single pulses. Results. No radio pulsations from sdB systems were detected, down to an
average sensitivity limit of 0.11 mJy. We did, however, detect a pulsar in the field of sdB HE0532-4503.
The absence of orbital acceleration excludes its association with the sdB. Follow-up observations
with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope showed that this pulsar, J0533-4524, is indeed not exactly
spatially coincident with the sdB system. The pulsar has a relatively low magnetic field but still
emits giant pulses. Conclusions. We place an upper limit of three to the number of radio pulsars in
the six sdB systems. The non-detections may be explained by a combination of the MSP beaming fraction,
luminosity, and a recycling fraction <0.5. Alternatively, the assumption of co-rotation between
the MSP and sdB may break down, which implies the systems are more edge-on than previously thought.
This would shift the predicted companion masses into the white dwarf range. It would also explain
the relative lack of edge-on sdB systems with massive companions.
