The new generation of broad-band radio continuum surveys will provide large data sets with polarization
information. New algorithms need to be developed to extract reliable catalogs of linearly polarized
sources that can be used to characterize those sources and produce a dense rotation measure (RM)
grid to probe magneto-ionized structures along the line of sight via Faraday rotation. The aim of
the paper is to develop a computationally efficient and rigorously defined source-finding algorithm
for linearly polarized sources. We used a calibrated data set from the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR)
at 150 MHz centered on the nearby galaxy M51 to search for polarized background sources. With a new
imaging software, we re-imaged the field at a resolution of 18''x15'' and cataloged a total of about
3000 continuum sources within 2.5 degrees of the center of M51. We made small Stokes Q and U images
centered on each source brighter than 100 mJy in total intensity (201 sources) and used RM synthesis
to create corresponding Faraday cubes that were analyzed individually. For each source, the noise
distribution function was determined from a subset of measurements at high Faraday depths where
no polarization is expected; the peaks in polarized intensity in the Faraday spectrum were identified
and the p-value of each source was calculated. Finally, the false discovery rate method was applied
to the list of p-values to produce a list of polarized sources and quantify the reliability of the
detections. We also analyzed sources fainter than 100 mJy but that were reported as polarized in
the literature at at least another radio frequency. Of the 201 sources that were searched for polarization,
6 polarized sources were detected confidently (with a false discovery rate of 5 percent). This corresponds
to a number density of 1 polarized source per 3.3 square degrees, or 0.3 source/square degree. [Abridged]
