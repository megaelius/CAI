Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio bursts with a time scale of approximately milliseconds.
Two populations of FRB, namely repeating and non-repeating FRBs, are observationally identified.
However, the differences between these two and their origins are still cloaked in mystery. Here
we show the time-integrated luminosity-duration ($L_{\nu}$-$w_{\rm int,rest}$) relations
and luminosity functions (LFs) of repeating and non-repeating FRBs in the FRB Catalogue project.
These two populations are obviously separated in the $L_{\nu}$-$w_{\rm int,rest}$ plane with
distinct LFs, i.e., repeating FRBs have relatively fainter $L_{\nu}$ and longer $w_{\rm int,rest}$
with a much lower LF. In contrast with non-repeating FRBs, repeating FRBs do not show any clear correlation
between $L_{\nu}$ and $w_{\rm int,rest}$. These results suggest essentially different physical
origins of the two. The faint ends of the LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are higher than volumetric
occurrence rates of neutron-star mergers and accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs,
and are consistent with those of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), type Ia supernovae, magnetars,
and white-dwarf mergers. This indicates two possibilities: either (i) faint non-repeating FRBs
originate in neutron-star mergers or AIC and are actually repeating during the lifetime of the progenitor,
or (ii) faint non-repeating FRBs originate in any of SGRs, type Ia supernovae, magnetars, and white-dwarf
mergers. The bright ends of LFs of repeating and non-repeating FRBs are lower than any candidates
of progenitors, suggesting that bright FRBs are produced from a very small fraction of the progenitors
regardless of the repetition. Otherwise, they might originate in unknown progenitors.
