We investigate here the effect of the selection function on the metallicity distribution function
(MDF) and on the vertical metallicity gradient by studying similar lines of sight using four different
spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE, and Gaia-ESO), which have different targeting strategies
and therefore different selection functions. We use common fields between the spectroscopic surveys
of APOGEE, LAMOST, RAVE (ALR) and APOGEE, RAVE, Gaia-ESO (AGR) and use two stellar population synthesis
models, GALAXIA and TRILEGAL, to create mock fields for each survey. We apply the selection function
in the form of colour and magnitude cuts of the respective survey to the mock fields to replicate the
observed source sample. We make a basic comparison between the models to check which best reproduces
the observed sample distribution. We carry out a quantitative comparison between the synthetic
MDF from the mock catalogues using both models to understand the effect of the selection function
on the MDF and on the vertical metallicity gradient. Using both models, we find a negligible effect
of the selection function on the MDF for APOGEE, LAMOST, and RAVE. We find a negligible selection
function effect on the vertical metallicity gradients as well, though GALAXIA and TRILEGAL have
steeper and shallower slopes, respectively, than the observed gradient. After applying correction
terms on the metallicities of RAVE and LAMOST with respect to our reference APOGEE sample, our observed
vertical metallicity gradients between the four surveys are consistent within 1-sigma. We also
find consistent gradient for the combined sample of all surveys in ALR and AGR. We estimated a mean
vertical metallicity gradient of -0.241+/-0.028 dex kpc-1. There is a significant scatter in the
estimated gradients in the literature, but our estimates are within their ranges.
