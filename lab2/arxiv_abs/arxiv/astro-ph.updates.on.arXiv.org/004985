The X-ray emission from the jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) carries important information
on the distributions of relativistic electrons and magnetic fields on large scales. We reanalyze
archival Chandra observations on the jet of M87 from 2000 to 2016 with a total exposure of 1460 kiloseconds
to explore the X-ray emission characteristics along the jet. We investigate the variability behaviours
of the nucleus and the inner jet component HST-1, and confirm indications for day-scale X-ray variability
in the nucleus contemporaneous to the 2010 high TeV gamma-ray state. HST-1 shows a general decline
in X-ray flux over the last few years consistent with its synchrotron interpretation. We extract
the X-ray spectra for the nucleus and all knots in the jet, showing that they are compatible with a
single power-law within the X-ray band. There are indications of the resultant X-ray photon index
to exhibit a trend, with slight but significant index variations ranging from $\simeq 2.2$ (e.g.
in knot D) to $\simeq 2.4-2.6$ (in the outer knots F, A, and B). When viewed in a multi-wavelength context,
a more complex situation is arising. Fitting the radio to X-ray spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
assuming a synchrotron origin, we show that a broken power-law electron spectrum with break energy
$E_b$ around $1~(300\mu G/B)^{1/2}$ TeV allows a satisfactorily description of the multi-band
SEDs for most of the knots. However, in the case of knots B, C and D we find indications that an additional
high energy component is needed to adequately reproduce the broadband SEDs. We discuss the implications
and suggest that a stratified jet model may account for the differences.
