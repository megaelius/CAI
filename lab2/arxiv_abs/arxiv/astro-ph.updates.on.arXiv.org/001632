We re-evaluate the roles of different dust sources in dust production as a function of metallicity
in late-type dwarf galaxies, with the goal of understanding the relation between dust content and
metallicity. The dust content of late-type dwarf galaxies with episodic star formation is studied
with a multicomponent model of dust evolution, which includes dust input from AGB stars, type II
SNe and dust mass growth by accretion of gas species in the ISM. Dust growth in the ISM becomes an important
dust source in dwarf galaxies, on the timescale of 0.1 - few Gyrs. It increases the dust-to-gas ratio
(DGR) during post-burst evolution, unlike type II SNe, which eject grains into the ISM only during
starbursts. Before the dust growth in the ISM overtakes the dust production, AGB stars can be major
sources of dust in metal-poor dwarf galaxies. Our models reproduce the relation between the DGR
and oxygen abundance, derived from observations of a large sample of dwarf galaxies. The steep decrease
in the DGR at low O values is explained by the relatively low efficiency of dust condensation in stars.
The scatter observed at higher O values is determined mainly by different critical metallicities
for the transition from stardust- to ISM-growth dominated dust production, depending on the star
formation history. In galaxies with episodic star formation, additional dispersion in the DGR
is introduced by grain destruction during starbursts, followed by an increase of the dust mass due
to dust growth in the ISM during post-burst evolution. We find that the carbon-to-silicate ratio
changes dramatically, when the ISM growth becomes the dominant dust source, therefore this ratio
can be used as an indicator of the transition. The observed DGR-O relation in dwarf galaxies favours
low condensation efficiencies in type II SNe, together with an increase in the total dust mass by
means of dust growth in the ISM.
