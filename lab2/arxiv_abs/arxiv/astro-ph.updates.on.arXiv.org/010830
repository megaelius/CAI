The period 2035-50 considered in the ESA Voyage long-term plan will coincide with a series of foreseeable
advances in the characterization of the stellar content of the Milky Way. The Gaia mission, combined
with large-scale spectroscopic surveys, is helping to build an unprecedented census in terms of
the astrometric, kinematic and chemical properties of Galactic stellar populations. Within a
decade, precise measurements of such properties will be available for hundreds of millions of stars
over a large portion of the Galaxy. Meanwhile, time-domain surveys initiated with CoRoT and Kepler/K2
and carried on by space missions such as TESS and PLATO or ground-based projects like the LSST, will
have brought asteroseismology to a high level of maturity. The combination of precise ages from
asteroseismology with astrometric and spectroscopic data, on large stellar samples, is allowing
Galactic archaeologists to gain new insight into the assembly history of the Milky Way. Recent breakthroughs
--- based on the detection of solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of red-giant stars ---
demonstrate the potential of such approach. Therefore, we are convinced that an all-sky, high-cadence,
long-duration stellar variability survey will become a scientific priority in the 2035-50 period.
The Chronos concept presented here consists in a time-domain extension to Gaia. It will allow for
mass and age estimates for half a million red giants within 1.7 kpc from the Sun and hence shed a new
light on our understanding of the Galactic dynamics and archaeology. In terms of the targeted pulsators,
Chronos will bridge the gap between PLATO and the LSST by surveying stars all the way from the subgiant
branch to the early AGB. Finally, it will surpass all previous time-domain surveys in terms of sky
coverage (100%) and duration of the observations (2 $\times$ 3.75 months within the 5-year nominal
mission).
