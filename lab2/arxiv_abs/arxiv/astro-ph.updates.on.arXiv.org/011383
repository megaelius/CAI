The carbon content of protoplanetary disks is an important parameter to characterize planets formed
at different disk radii. There is some evidence from far-infrared and submillimeter observations
that gas in the outer disk is depleted in carbon, with a corresponding enhancement of carbon-rich
ices at the disk midplane. Observations of the carbon content inside of the inner sublimation rim
could confirm how much carbon remains locked in kilometer size bodies in the disk. Using near-infrared
spectra, I self-consistently determine the stellar, extinction, veiling, and accretion properties
of the 26 stars in my sample. From these values, I extract the inner disk excess of the target stars
and identify a series of C^0 recombination lines in 18 of these disks and use the CHIANTI atomic line
database with an optically thin slab model to constrain the average n_e, T_e, and n_C for these lines
in the five disks with a complete set of lines. By comparing these values with other slab models of
the inner disk using the Cloudy photoionization code, I also constrain n_H and the carbon abundance,
X_C, and hence the amount of carbon `missing' from the slab. The inner disks are extremely dense (n_H~10^{16}
cm^{-3}), warm (T_e~4500 K), and moderately ionized (logX_e~3.3). Three of the five modeled disks
show robust carbon depletion <=42 relative to the solar value. I discuss multiple ways in which the
`missing' carbon could be locked out of the accreting gas. Given the high-density inner disk gas,
evidence for radial drift, and lack of obvious gaps in these three systems, their carbon depletion
is most consistent with the `missing' carbon being sequestered in kilometer size bodies. For DR
Tau, nitrogen and silicon are also depleted by factors of 45 and 4, respectively, suggesting that
the kilometer size bodies into which the grains are locked were formed beyond the N_2 snowline.
