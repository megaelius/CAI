We present the results of a new epoch of a long-term photometric monitoring of the variable planetary
nebula IC~4997. The integral $UBV$ light curves display a continuing brightening of 0.$^{m}15$
in $V$, a slight rise (<0.$^{m}1$) in $B$, and constancy in $U$. The $B-V$ color has got redder from
0.$^{m}4$ in 2000 to 0.$^{m}7$ in 2019, whereas the $U-B$ color has not changed significantly. New
$JHKL$ photometry was obtained in 2019. We found the source to be fainter by 0.$^{m}4$ in $L$ and bluer
by 0.$^{m}2$ in the $K-L$ color if compared to the data of 1999-2006. The long-term brightness variations
are due mostly to the changing input of emission lines to the integral light. Low-dispersion spectroscopic
observations carried out in 2010-2019 revealed a continuing decrease in the $\lambda4363/\lambda4340$
ratio: it decreased by a factor of $\sim3$ in 30 years and reached the level of 1960-1970. The absolute
intensities of [OIII] nebualr lines increased by a factor of $>2$ from 1990 to 2019, whereas the [OIII]
$\lambda$4363 line had weakened by a factor of 2 comparing to the maximum value observed in 2000.
The variation of H$\beta$ absolute intensity in 1960-2019 was shown to be similar to that of [OIII]
nebular lines, but of smaller amplitude. The electron density in the outer part of the nebula was
estimated from the [SII] and [ClIII] lines. Basing on the data on absolute intensities we propose
a possible scenario describing the change of $N_e,T_e$ in 1970-2019. The spectral variability
of IC~4997 could be explained by a variation of electron temperature in the nebula caused by not so
much the change in ionizing flux from the central star as the variable stellar wind and related processes.
The photometric and spectral changes observed for IC~4997 in 1960-2019 may be interpreted as an
observable consequence of a single episode of enhanced mass loss from the variable central star.
