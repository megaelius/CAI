We measured new abundances of so-called light neutron-capture of first peak elements using local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) 1D analysis; this analysis resulted in a sample of 11 very metal-poor
stars, from [Fe/H]=-2.5 to [Fe/H]=-3.4, and one carbon-rich star, CS 22949-037 with [Fe/H]=-4.0.
The abundances were compared to those observed in two classical metal-poor stars: the typical r-rich
star CS 31082-001 ([Eu/Fe] > +1.0) and the r-poor star HD 122563 ([Eu/Fe] < 0.0), which are known to
present a strong enrichment of the first peak neutron-capture elements relative to the second peak.
Within the first peak, the abundances are well correlated in analogy to the well-known correlation
inside the abundances of the second-peak elements. In contrast, there is no correlation between
any first peak element with any second peak element. We show that the scatter of the ratio of the first
peak abundance over second peak abundance increases when the mean abundance of the second peak elements
decreases from r-rich to r-poor stars. We found two new r-poor stars that are very similar to HD 122563.
A third r-poor star, CS 22897-008, is even more extreme; this star shows the most extreme example
of first peak elements enrichment to date. On the contrary, another r-poor star (BD-18 5550) has
a pattern of first peak elements that is similar to the typical r-rich stars CS 31082-001, however
this star has some Mo enrichment. The distribution of the neutron-capture elements in our very metal-poor
stars can be understood as the combination of at least two mechanisms: one that enriches the forming
stars cloud homogeneously through the main r-process and leads to an element pattern similar to
the r-rich stars, such as CS 31082-001; and another that forms mainly lighter, first peak elements.
