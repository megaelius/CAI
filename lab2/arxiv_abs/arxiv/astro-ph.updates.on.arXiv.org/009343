The HST UV Survey of Globular Clusters (GCs) has investigated GCs and their stellar populations.
In previous papers of this series we have introduced a pseudo two-color diagram, "chromosome map"
(ChM), that maximises the separation between the multiple populations. We have identified two
main classes of GCs: Type I (~83% of the objects) and Type II, both hosting two main groups of stars,
referred to in this series as first (1G) and second generation (2G). Type II clusters exhibit two
or more parallel sequences of 1G and 2G stars in their ChMs. We exploit elemental abundances from
literature to assign the chemical composition to the distinct populations as identified on the
ChMs of 29 GCs. We find that stars in different regions of the ChM have different composition: 1G stars
share the same light-element content as field stars, while 2G stars are enhanced in N, Na and depleted
in O. Stars enhanced in Al and depleted in Mg populate the extreme regions of the ChM. We investigate
the color spread among 1G stars observed in many GCs, and find no evidence for variations in light
elements, whereas either a 0.1 dex Fe spread or a variation in He remain to be verified. In the attempt
of analysing the global properties of the multiple populations, we have constructed a universal
ChM, which highlights that, though variegate, the phenomenon has some common pattern. The universal
ChM reveals a tight connection with Na, for which we have provided an empirical relation. The additional
ChM sequences typical of Type II GCs are enhanced in metallicity and, often, in s elements. Omega
Cen can be classified as an extreme Type II GC, with a ChM displaying three main streams, each with
its own variations in chemical abundances. One of the most noticeable differences is between the
lower and upper streams, with the latter (associated with higher He) having higher Fe and lower Li.
We publicly release ChMs.
