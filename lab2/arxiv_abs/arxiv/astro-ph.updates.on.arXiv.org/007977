In this paper JK_s data from the VISTA Magellanic Cloud (VMC) survey are used to investigate the tip
of the red giant branch (TRGB) as a distance indicator. A linear fit to recent theoretical models
is used which reads M_{K_s} = -4.196 -2.013 (J-K_s), valid in the colour range 0.75 < (J-K_s) < 1.3
mag and in the 2MASS system. The observed TRGB is found based on a classical first-order and a second-order
derivative filter applied to the binned luminosity function using the "sharpened" magnitude that
takes the colour term into account. Extensive simulations are carried out to investigate any biases
and errors in the derived distance modulus (DM). Based on these simulations criteria are established
related to the number of stars per bin in the 0.5 magnitude range below the TRGB and related to the significance
with which the peak in the filter response curve is determined such that the derived distances are
unbiased. The DMs based on the second-order derivative filter are found to be more stable and are
therefore adopted, although this requires twice as many stars per bin. The TRGB method is applied
to specific lines-of-sight where independent distance estimates exist, based on detached eclipsing
binaries in the LMC and SMC, classical Cepheids in the LMC, RR Lyrae stars in the SMC, and fields in
the SMC where the star formation history (together with reddening and distance) has been derived
from deep VMC data. The analysis shows that the theoretical calibration is consistent with the data,
that the systematic error on the DM is approximately 0.045 mag, and that random errors of 0.015 mag
are achievable. Reddening is an important element in deriving the distance: we find mean DMs ranging
from 18.92 (for a typical E(B-V) of 0.15 mag) to 19.07 mag (E(B-V) about 0.04) for the SMC, and ranging
from 18.48 (E(B-V) about 0.12 mag) to 18.57 mag (E(B-V) about 0.05) for the LMC.
