We present spherically symmetric (1D) and axisymmetric (2D) supernova simulations for a convection-dominated
9 Msun and a 20 Msun progenitor that develops violent activity by the standing-accretion-shock
instability (SASI). We compare in detail the Aenus-Alcar code, which uses fully multidimensional
two-moment neutrino transport with an M1 closure, with a ray-by-ray-plus (RbR+) version of this
code and with the Prometheus-Vertex code that employs RbR+ two-moment transport with a Boltzmann
closure. Besides testing consequences of ignored non-radial neutrino-flux components in the
RbR+ approximation, we also discuss the influence of various transport ingredients applied or
not applied in recent literature, namely simplified neutrino-pair processes, neutrino-electron
scattering, velocity-dependent and gravitational-redshift terms, and strangeness and many-body
corrections for neutrino-nucleon scattering. Alcar and Vertex show excellent agreement in 1D
and 2D despite a slightly but systematically smaller radius (~1km) and stronger convection of the
proto-neutron star with Alcar. As found previously, the RbR+ approximation is conducive to explosions,
but much less severely in the convection-dominated 9 Msun case than in the marginally exploding
20 Msun model, where the onset time of explosion also exhibits big stochastic variations, and the
RbR+ approximation has no distinctly stronger supportive effect than simplified pair processes
or strangeness and many-body corrections. Neglecting neutrino-electron scattering has clearly
unfavorable effects for explosions, while ignoring velocity and gravitational-redshift effects
can both promote or delay the explosion. The ratio of advection timescale to neutrino-heating timescale
in 1D simulations is a sensitive indicator of the influence of physics ingredients on explosions
also in multidimensional simulations.
