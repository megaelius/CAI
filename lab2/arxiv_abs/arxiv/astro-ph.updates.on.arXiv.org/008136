The nuclear starburst within the central $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim 250$ pc; $1^{\prime\prime}
\simeq 17$ pc) of NGC253 has been extensively studied as a prototype for the starburst phase in galactic
evolution. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaging within receiver Bands
6 and 7 have been used to investigate the dense gas structure, kinetic temperature, and heating processes
which drive the NGC253 starburst. Twenty-nine transitions from fifteen molecular species/isotopologues
have been identified and imaged at $1.^{\prime\prime}5$ to $0.^{\prime\prime}4$ resolution,
allowing for the identification of five of the previously-studied giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
within the central molecular zone (CMZ) of NGC253. Ten transitions from the formaldehyde (H$_2$CO)
molecule have been used to derive the kinetic temperature within the $\sim 0.^{\prime\prime}5$
to $5^{\prime\prime}$ dense-gas structures imaged. On $\sim 5^{\prime\prime}$ scales we measure
$T_K \gtrsim 50$ K, while on size scales $\lesssim 1^{\prime\prime}$ we measure $T_K \gtrsim 300$
K. These kinetic temperature measurements further delineate the association between potential
sources of dense gas heating. We have investigated potential heating sources by comparing our measurements
to models which predict the physical conditions associated with dense molecular clouds that possess
a variety of heating mechanisms. This comparison has been supplemented with tracers of recently-formed
massive stars (Br$\gamma$) and shocks ([FeII]). Derived molecular column densities point to a
radially-decreasing abundance of molecules with sensitivity to cosmic ray and mechanical heating
within the NGC253 CMZ. These measurements are consistent with radio spectral index calculations
which suggest a higher concentration of cosmic ray producing supernova remnants within the central
10 pc of NGC253.
