The aim of this paper is to present the first data set obtained with SOAR Adaptive Module-Fabry-Parot
(SAM-FP), a Fabry-Perot instrument mounted inside the SOAR telescope Adaptive-Optics Module.
This is the only existing imaging Fabry-Perot interferometer using laser-assisted ground-layer
adaptive optics. SAM-FP was used to observe the ionized gas, traced by Halpha, in the centre of the
30 Doradus starburst (the Tarantula Nebula) in the Large Magellanic Cloud, with high spatial (~0.6"
or 0.15 pc) and spectral (R=11200) resolution. Radial velocity, velocity dispersion and monochromatic
maps were derived. The region displays a mix of narrow, sigma ~ 20 km/s profiles and multiple broader
profiles with sigma ~ 70-80 km/s, indicating the complex nature of the nebula kinematics. A comparison
with previously obtained VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy demonstrates that the data agree well in the
regions of overlap, but the Fabry-Perot data are superior in spatial coverage. A preliminary analysis
of the observations finds a new expanding bubble south of R136, with a projected radius of r=5.6 pc
and an expansion velocity of 29 +/- 4 km/s. In addition, the first-time detailed kinematic maps derived
here for several complexes and filaments of 30 Doradus allow identification of kinematically independent
structures. These data exemplify the power of the combination of a high-order Fabry-Perot with
a wide-field imager (3' x 3' GLAO-corrected field of view) for high-resolution spatial and spectral
studies. In particular, SAM-FP data cubes are highly advantageous over multifibre or long-slit
data sets for nebula structure studies and to search for small-scale bubbles, given their greatly
improved spatial coverage. For reference, this paper also presents two appendices with detailed
descriptions of the usage of Fabry-Perot devices, including formulae and explanations for understanding
Fabry-Perot observations.
