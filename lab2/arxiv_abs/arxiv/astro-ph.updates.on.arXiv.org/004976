In this paper we introduce the SEAGLE (i.e. Simulating EAGLE LEnses) program, that approaches the
study of galaxy formation through strong gravitational lensing, using a suite of high-resolution
hydrodynamic simulations, Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE)
project. We introduce the simulation and analysis pipeline and present the first set of results
from our analysis of early-type galaxies. We identify and extract an ensemble of simulated lens
galaxies and use the GLAMER ray-tracing lensing code to create mock lenses similar to those observed
in the SLACS and SL2S surveys, using a range of source parameters and galaxy orientations, including
observational effects such as the Point-Spread-Function (PSF), pixelization and noise levels,
representative of single-orbit observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the ACS-F814W
filter. We subsequently model these mock lenses using the code LENSED, treating them in the same
way as observed lenses. We also estimate the mass model parameters directly from the projected surface
mass density of the simulated galaxy, using an identical mass model family. We perform a three-way
comparison of all the measured quantities with real lenses. We find the average total density slope
of EAGLE lenses, $t=2.26\; (0.25\; \rm{rms})$ to be higher than SL2S, $t=2.16$ or SLACS, $t=2.08$.
We find a very strong correlation between the external shear ($\gamma$) and the complex ellipticity
($\epsilon$), with $\gamma \sim \epsilon/4$. This correlation indicates a degeneracy in the lens
mass modeling. We also see a dispersion between lens modeling and direct fitting results, indicating
systematical biases.
