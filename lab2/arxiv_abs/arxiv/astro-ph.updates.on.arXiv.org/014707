The presentation of the light curves of the novae on the logarithmic scale of the radius of the shell
ejected during the outburst and in the scale of the amplitude of the outburst simplified the review
of the light curves of all the known, about 500, classical novae of our Galaxy and the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds. As a result, the modified light curves about of 250 classical novae were grouped
into 7 typical groups with subgroups defined by the light curves of prototypes. The largest group
is the DQ Her group with V1280 Sco as the main prototype and the key to grouping. Novae of this group
have three or four variants of a dust condensation. Novae of the small GQ Mus group may be a bright X-ray
source during an outburst. CP Pup, CP Lac, V1974 Cyg, and V1493 Aql are prototypes for 4 groups with
close tilts of the initial brightness decline phase of the light curves. The group with RR Pic as prototype,
including the HR Del subgroup, has a prolonged state of maximal brightness with the presence of several
brightness variations before the final decline phase. The relationship of groups of novae, or form
of the light curve, with processes in the circumstellar and circum-binary system environment is
shortly discussed. The material ejected during an outburst forms expanding shells of a generally
ellipsoidal shape. In the Lac, Pup, and Cyg groups, the shells do not show a pronounced regular structure,
except for their ellipsoidal shape. Shells of novae with a dust condensation (the DQ Her group) have
an ellipsoidal shape with an equatorial belt. The unique shell of CK Vul, Nova Vul 1670, gives an idea
about the possible shape of the shells of other members in the V1493 Sql group. Each of groups has own
position along the well-known "absolute maximal magnitude, rate of brightness decline" relation.
