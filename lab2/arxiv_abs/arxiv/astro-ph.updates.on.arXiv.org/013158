We analyse the transmission spectra of KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b to search for possible thermal inversion
agents. The data consist of three transits obtained using HARPS-N and one using CARMENES. We removed
stellar and telluric lines before cross-correlating the residuals with spectroscopic templates
produced using a 1D plane-parallel model assuming an isothermal atmosphere and chemical equilibrium
at solar metallicity. Using a likelihood-mapping method, we detect Fe\,{\sc i} at $>$ 13-$\sigma$,
Ca\,{\sc ii} H$\&$K at $>$ 6-$\sigma$ and confirm the previous detections of Fe\,{\sc ii}, Ca\,{\sc
ii} IRT and Na\,{\sc i} D. The detected signal of Fe\,{\sc i} is shifted by -3.35$\pm$0.40 km s$^{-1}$
from the planetary rest frame, which indicates a strong day-night wind. Our likelihood-mapping
technique also reveals that the detected species originate at different altitudes in the planet's
atmosphere. Assuming that the line lists are accurate, we do not detect other potential thermal
inversion agents (NaH, MgH, AlO, SH, CaO, VO, FeH and TiO) suggesting that non-chemical equilibrium
mechanisms (e.g. a cold-trap) might have removed Ti- and V-bearing species from the upper atmosphere.
Our results, therefore, shows that KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b cannot possess an inversion layer caused
by a TiO/VO-related mechanism. The presence of an inversion layer would therefore likely be caused
by metal atoms such as Fe\,{\sc i} and Fe\,{\sc ii}. Finally, we report a `double-peak' structure
in the Fe\,{\sc i} signal in all of our data-sets that could be a signature of atmospheric dynamics.
However, further investigation is needed to robustly determine the origin of the signal.
