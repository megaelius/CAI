We present analysis of the normalised 21-cm bispectrum from fully-numerical simulations of IGM
heating by stellar sources and high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB) during the cosmic dawn. Wouthuysen-Field
coupling is assumed to be saturated and ionizations are negligible, we therefore probe the nature
of non-Gaussianities produced by X-ray heating processes. We find the evolution of the normalised
bispectrum to be very different from that of the power spectrum. It exhibits a turnover whose peak
moves from large to small scales with decreasing redshift, corresponding to the typical separation
of emission regions. This characteristic scale reduces as more and more regions move into emission
with time. Ultimately, small-scale fluctuations within heated regions come to dominate the normalised
bispectrum, which at the end of the simulation is driven by fluctuations in the density field. To
establish how generic the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum we see in the stellar
+ HMXB simulation is, we examine several other simulations - two fully-numerical simulations that
include QSO sources, and two with contrasting source properties produced with the semi-numerical
simulation 21cmFAST. We find the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum during X-ray
heating to be generic, unless the sources of X-rays are, as with QSOs, less numerous and so exhibit
more distinct isolated heated profiles. Assuming mitigation of foreground and instrumental effects
are ultimately effective, we find that we should be sensitive to the normalised bispectrum during
the epoch of heating, so long as the spin temperature has not saturated by $z \approx 19$.
