We analyse cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters to study the X-ray scaling
relations between total masses and observable quantities such as X-ray luminosity, gas mass, X-ray
temperature, and $Y_{X}$. Three sets of simulations are performed with an improved version of the
smoothed particle hydrodynamics GADGET-3 code. These consider the following: non-radiative
gas, star formation and stellar feedback, and the addition of feedback by active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We select clusters with $M_{500} > 10^{14} M_{\odot} E(z)^{-1}$, mimicking the typical
selection of Sunyaev-Zeldovich samples. This permits to have a mass range large enough to enable
robust fitting of the relations even at $z \sim 2$. The results of the analysis show a general agreement
with observations. The values of the slope of the mass-gas mass and mass-temperature relations
at $z=2$ are 10 per cent lower with respect to $z=0$ due to the applied mass selection, in the former
case, and to the effect of early merger in the latter. We investigate the impact of the slope variation
on the study of the evolution of the normalization. We conclude that cosmological studies through
scaling relations should be limited to the redshift range $z=0-1$, where we find that the slope,
the scatter, and the covariance matrix of the relations are stable. The scaling between mass and
$Y_X$ is confirmed to be the most robust relation, being almost independent of the gas physics. At
higher redshifts, the scaling relations are sensitive to the inclusion of AGNs which influences
low-mass systems. The detailed study of these objects will be crucial to evaluate the AGN effect
on the ICM.
