The Quintuplet is one of the most massive galactic clusters known, but appears to host a diverse stellar
population that is difficult to reconcile with an instantaneous formation event. We present HST
photometry and VLT spectroscopy in order to improve observational constraints, finding the Quintuplet
to be far more homogeneous than previously thought. O7-8 Ia and O9-B0 Ia supergiants form a smooth
morphological sequence with a cohort of seven early-B hypergiants and six luminous blue variables
and WN9-11h stars, which together comprise the richest population of such stars of any known stellar
aggregate. No further H-free Wolf-Rayets were found, resulting in a 13:1 ratio for WC/WN stars.
However a small population of late-O hypergiants and WN8-9ha stars was identified, while a subset
of the supergiants are unexpectedly faint, suggesting they are both less massive and older than
the greater cluster population. We find an impressive coincidence between cluster members preceding
the H-free WR phase and the evolutionary predictions for a 60Msun star, suggesting an age of ~3.0-3.6Myr
for the Quintuplet. Neither the late-O hypergiants nor the low luminosity supergiants are predicted;
we suggest that the former either result from rapid rotators or are the products of binary driven
mass-stripping, while the latter may be interlopers. The H-free WRs must have had initial masses
>60Msun, but it is difficult to reconcile their observational properties with theoretical expectations.
Since the WRs represent an evolutionary phase directly preceding core-collapse, they are are crucial
to understanding both this process and the nature of the resultant relativistic remnants, providing
unique constraints on the evolution and death of the most massive stars forming in the local, high
metallicity Universe (Abridged).
