We investigate the relationship between star formation activity and outflow properties on kiloparsec
scales in a sample of 28 star forming galaxies at $z\sim$ 2-2.6, using adaptive optics assisted integral
field observations from SINFONI on the VLT. The narrow and broad components of the H$\alpha$ emission
are used to simultaneously determine the local star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$), and the outflow velocity $v_{\rm out}$ and mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$, respectively.
We find clear evidence for faster outflows with larger mass loading factors at higher $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$. The outflow velocities scale as $v_{\rm out} \propto \Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.28 \pm 0.10}$,
which suggests that the outflows may be driven by a combination of mechanical energy released by
supernova explosions and stellar winds, as well as radiation pressure acting on dust grains. The
majority of the outflowing material does not have sufficient velocity to escape from the galaxy
halos, but will likely be re-accreted and contribute to the chemical enrichment of the galaxies.
The outflow component contains on average $\sim$35% of the H$\alpha$ flux at $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}
\gtrsim~1.3~{\rm M}_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}~{\rm kpc}^{-2}$, but becomes less prominent at lower
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. The mass loading factor, $\eta$ = $\dot{M}_{\rm out}$/SFR, is positively
correlated with the $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ but is relatively low even at the highest $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$
($\eta<~0.3$, assuming $n_e~=~380~{\rm cm}^{-3}$). This may be in tension with the high $\eta$
values ($\gtrsim$1) required by cosmological simulations, unless a significant fraction of the
outflowing mass is in other gas phases and is able to escape the galaxy halos.
