We investigate the behavior of the fifth force in voids in chameleon models using the spherical collapse
method. Contrary to Newtonian gravity, we find the fifth force is repulsive in voids. The strength
of the fifth force depends on the density inside and outside the void region as well as its radius.
It can be many times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle unbound. This
is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force is no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution
of voids is governed by the Newtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force.
While the first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth force is unique
to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force, individual voids in chameleon models
expand faster and grow larger than in a LCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can
be 20% to 30% larger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by ~10%. These
differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. We compare void statistics using excursion
set theory; for voids of the same size, their number density is larger in chameleon models. The fractional
difference increases with void size. The chance of having voids of radius ~25 Mpc/h can be 2.5 times
larger. This difference is about 10 times larger than that in the halo mass function. We find strong
environmental dependence of void properties in chameleon models. The differences in size and expansion
velocity with GR are both larger for small voids in high density regions. In general, the difference
between chameleon models and LCDM in void properties (size, expansion velocity and distribution
function) are larger than the corresponding quantities for halos. This suggests that voids might
be better candidates than halos for testing gravity.
