The emission line spectra of cyanoacetylene and methanol reveal chemical and physical heterogeneity
on very small (< 0.1 pc) scales toward the peak in cyanopolyyne emission in the Taurus Molecular Cloud,
TMC-1 (CP). We generate grids of homogeneous chemical models using a three-phase rate equation
approach to obtain all time-dependent abundances spanning the physical conditions determined
from molecular tracers of compact and extended regions of emission along this line of sight. Each
time-dependent abundance is characterized by one of four features: a maximum/minimum, a monotonic
increase/decrease, oscillatory behavior, or inertness. We similarly classify the time-dependent
agreement between modeled and observed abundances by calculating both the root-mean-square logarithm
difference and root-mean-square deviation between the modeled and observed abundances at every
point in our grid models for three groups of molecules: (i) a composite group of all species present
in both the observations and our chemical network G, (ii) the cyanopolyynes C = {HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N,
HC$_7$N, HC$_9$N}, and (iii) the oxygen-containing organic species methanol and acetaldehyde
S = {CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO}. We discuss how the Bayesian uncertainties in the observed abundances
constrain solutions within the grids of chemical models. The calculated best fit times at each grid
point for each group are tabulated to reveal the minimum solution space of the grid models and the
effects the Bayesian uncertainties have on the grid model solutions. The results of this approach
separate the effect different physical conditions and model-free parameters have on reproducing
accurately the abundances of different groups of observed molecular species.
