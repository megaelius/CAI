The measurement of diffuse PeV gamma-ray emission from the Galactic plane would provide information
about the energy spectrum and propagation of Galactic cosmic rays, and the detection of a point-like
source of PeV gamma rays would be strong evidence for a Galactic source capable of accelerating cosmic
rays up to at least a few PeV. This paper presents several un-binned maximum likelihood searches
for PeV gamma rays in the Southern Hemisphere using 5 years of data from the IceTop air shower surface
detector and the in-ice array of the IceCube Observatory. The combination of both detectors takes
advantage of the low muon content and deep shower maximum of gamma-ray air showers, and provides
excellent sensitivity to gamma rays between $\sim$0.6 PeV and 100 PeV. Our measurements of point-like
and diffuse Galactic emission of PeV gamma rays are consistent with background, so we constrain
the angle-integrated diffuse gamma-ray flux from the Galactic Plane at 2 PeV to $2.61 \times 10^{-19}$
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ at 90% confidence, assuming an E$^{-3}$ spectrum, and we estimate
90% upper limits on point-like emission at 2 PeV between 10$^{-21}$ - 10$^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
TeV$^{-1}$ for an E$^{-2}$ spectrum, depending on declination. Furthermore, we exclude unbroken
power-law emission up to 2 PeV for several TeV gamma-ray sources observed by H.E.S.S., and calculate
upper limits on the energy cutoffs of these sources at 90% confidence. We also find no PeV gamma rays
correlated with neutrinos from IceCube's high-energy starting event sample. These are currently
the strongest constraints on PeV gamma-ray emission.
