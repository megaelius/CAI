Temperature is a crucial parameter in circumstellar disk evolution and planet formation, because
it governs the resistance of the gas to gravitational instability and sets the chemical composition
of the planet-forming material. We set out to determine the gas temperature of the young disk-like
structure around the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422A. We use Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) observations of multiple H$_2$CS $J=7-6$ and $J=10-9$ lines from the Protostellar
Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) to create a temperature map for the inner $\sim$200 AU of the
disk-like structure. This molecule is a particularly useful temperature probe because transitions
between energy levels with different $K_{\rm{a}}$ quantum numbers operate only through collisions.
Based on the H$_2$CS line ratios, the temperature is between $\sim$100$-$175 K in the inner $\sim$150
AU, and drops to $\sim$75 K at $\sim$200 AU. At the current resolution (0.5$^{\prime\prime} \sim$70
AU), no jump is seen in the temperature at the disk-envelope interface. The temperature structure
derived from H$_2$CS is consistent with envelope temperature profiles that constrain the temperature
from 1000 AU scales down to $\sim$100 AU, but does not follow the temperature rise seen in these profiles
at smaller radii. Higher angular resolution observations of optically thin temperature tracers
are needed to establish whether cooling by gas-phase water, the presence of a putative disk or the
dust optical depth influences the gas temperature at $\lesssim$100 AU scales. The temperature
at 100 AU is higher in IRAS 16293A than in the embedded Class 0/I disk L1527, consistent with the higher
luminosity of the former.
