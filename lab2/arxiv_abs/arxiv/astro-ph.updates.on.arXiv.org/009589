The zodiacal dust complex, a population of dust and small particles that pervades the Solar System,
provides important insight into the formation and dynamics of planets, comets, asteroids, and
other bodies. Here we present a new set of data obtained using a novel technique: direct measurements
of momentum transfer to a spacecraft from individual particle impacts. This technique is made possible
by the extreme precision of the instruments flown on the LISA Pathfinder spacecraft, a technology
demonstrator for a future space-based gravitational wave observatory that operated near the first
Sun-Earth Lagrange point from early 2016 through Summer of 2017. Using a simple model of the impacts
and knowledge of the control system, we show that it is possible to detect impacts and measure properties
such as the transferred momentum (related to the particle's mass and velocity), direction of travel,
and location of impact on the spacecraft. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic search
for impacts during 4348 hours of Pathfinder data. We report a total of 54 candidates with momenta
ranging from 0.2$\,\mu\textrm{Ns}$ to 230$\,\mu\textrm{Ns}$. We furthermore make a comparison
of these candidates with models of micrometeoroid populations in the inner solar system including
those resulting from Jupiter-family comets, Oort-cloud comets, Hailey-type comets, and Asteroids.
We find that our measured population is consistent with a population dominated by Jupiter-family
comets with some evidence for a smaller contribution from Hailey-type comets. This is in agreement
with consensus models of the zodiacal dust complex in the momentum range sampled by LISA Pathfinder.
