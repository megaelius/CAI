The speed of sound greatly exceeds typical flow velocities in many stellar and planetary interiors.
To follow the slow evolution of subsonic motions, various sound-proof models attempt to remove
fast acoustic waves whilst retaining stratified convection and buoyancy dynamics. In astrophysics,
anelastic models typically receive the most attention in the class of sound-filtered stratified
models. Generally, anelastic models remain valid in nearly adiabatically stratified regions
like stellar convection zones, but may break down in strongly sub-adiabatic, stably stratified
layers common in stellar radiative zones. However, studying stellar rotation, circulation, and
dynamos requires understanding the complex coupling between convection and radiative zones,
and this requires robust equations valid in both regimes. Here we extend the analysis of equation
sets begun in Brown Vasil & Zweibel 2012, which studied anelastic models, to two types of pseudo-incompressible
models. This class of models has received attention in atmospheric applications, and more recently
in studies of white-dwarf supernovae progenitors. We demonstrate that one model conserves energy
but the other does not. We use Lagrangian variational methods to extend the energy conserving model
to a general equation of state, and dub the resulting equation set the Generalized Pseudo-Incompressible
(GPI) model. We show that the GPI equations suitably capture low frequency phenomena in both convection
and radiative zones in stars and other stratified systems, and we provide recommendations for converting
low-Mach number codes to this equation set.
