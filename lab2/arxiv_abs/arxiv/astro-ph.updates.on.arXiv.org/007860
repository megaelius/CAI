We present long baseline Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of
the 870$\,\mu$m dust continuum emission and CO (3-2) from the protoplanetary disk around the Herbig
Ae/Be star HD 100546, which is one of the few systems claimed to have two young embedded planets. These
observations achieve a resolution of 4 au (3.8 mas), an rms noise of 66$\mu$Jy/beam, and reveal an
asymmetric ring between $\sim$20-40 au with largely optically thin dust continuum emission. This
ring is well fit by two concentric and overlapping Gaussian rings of different widths and a Vortex.
In addition, an unresolved component is detected at a position consistent with the central star,
which may trace the central inner disk ($<$2au in radius). We report a lack of compact continuum emission
at the positions of both claimed protoplanets. We use this result to constrain the circumplanetary
disk (CPD) mass and size of 1.44M$_{\rm Earth}$ and 0.44au in the optically thin and thick regime,
respectively, for the case of the previously directly imaged protoplanet candidate at $\sim$55
au (HD100546 b). We compare these empirical CPD constraints to previous numerical simulations.
This suggests that HD100546 b is inconsistent with several planet accretion models, while gas-starved
models are also still compatible. We estimate the planetary mass as 1.65 M$_J$ by using the relation
between planet, circumstellar, and circumplanetary masses derived from numerical simulations.
Finally, the CO integrated intensity map shows a possible spiral arm feature that would match the
spiral features identified in Near-Infrared scattered light polarized emission, which suggests
a real spiral feature in the disk surface that needs to be confirmed with further observations.
