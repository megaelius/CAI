We investigate dwarf irregular(dIrr) galaxies as a new category of targets for indirect Dark Matter(DM)
searches with gamma-rays. In the framework of point-like analysis, dwarf spheroidal(dSph) galaxies
are usually considered as one of the best category of targets for indirect DM searches. Nonetheless,
as a result of their uncertain kinematics, the DM content and astrophysical J-factors of dSphs are
usually affected by significant errors. In this paper, we study a sample of 36 dIrrs as prospective
targets of interest. In the framework of the universal rotation curve, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies
provides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution and, consequently, of their astrophysical
J-factors. We calculate the J-factors for these 36 dIrr galaxies. We find a range of values comparable
with the J-factors of dSph galaxies. However, differently from dSphs an extra astrophysical gamma-ray
background component is expected in dIrrs, that is due to their star-formation activity. In this
paper, we show via a theoretical approach that for galaxies in our sample the extra astrophysical
background component is negligible. Therefore, we conclude that dIrr galaxies can be potentially
considered as additional point-like targets for DM searches with gamma-rays. As a first application
of this study, we show the sensitivity limits of the Fermi-LAT telescope to these objects and we calculate
constraints on the DM particle mass and annihilation cross-section. We conclude that the results
of the individual study of several dIrr galaxies are not yet competitive with respect to the analysis
of one of the most promising dSph galaxies, ie SEGUE1. However, taking into account SEGUE1's symmetry-related
uncertainties in the J-factor calculation might alter this conclusion. Additionally, we calculate
constraints for the combined analysis of the 7 most promising dIrr galaxies of our sample.
