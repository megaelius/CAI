Multimessenger observations may hold the key to learn about the most energetic sources in the universe.
The recent construction of large scale observatories opened new possibilities in testing non thermal
cosmic processes with alternative probes, such as high energy neutrinos and gravitational waves.
We propose to combine information from gravitational wave detections, neutrino observations
and electromagnetic signals to obtain a comprehensive picture of some of the most extreme cosmic
processes. Gravitational waves are indicative of source dynamics, such as the formation, evolution
and interaction of compact objects. These compact objects can play an important role in astrophysical
particle acceleration, and are interesting candidates for neutrino and in general high-energy
astroparticle studies. In particular we will concentrate on the most promising gravitational
wave emitter sources: compact stellar remnants. The merger of binary black holes, binary neutron
stars or black hole-neutron star binaries are abundant gravitational wave sources and will likely
make up the majority of detections. However, stellar core collapse with rapidly rotating core may
also be significant gravitational wave emitter, while slower rotating cores may be detectable
only at closer distances. The joint detection of gravitational waves and neutrinos from these sources
will probe the physics of the sources and will be a smoking gun of the presence of hadrons in these objects
which is still an open question. Conversely, the non-detection of neutrinos or gravitational waves
from these sources will be fundamental to constrain the hadronic content.
