The National Academy Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science (CAPS) made a recommendation
to study a large/medium-class dedicated space telescope for planetary science, going beyond the
Discovery-class dedicated planetary space telescope endorsed in Visions and Voyages. Such a telescope
would observe targets across the entire solar system, engaging a broad spectrum of the science community.
It would ensure that the high-resolution, high-sensitivity observations of the solar system in
visible and UV wavelengths revolutionized by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) could be extended.
A dedicated telescope for solar system science would: (a) transform our understanding of time-dependent
phenomena in our solar system that cannot be studied currently under programs to observe and visit
new targets and (b) enable a comprehensive survey and spectral characterization of minor bodies
across the solar system, which requires a large time allocation not supported by existing facilities.
The time-domain phenomena to be explored are critically reliant on high spatial resolution UV-visible
observations. This paper presents science themes and key questions that require a long-lasting
space telescope dedicated to planetary science that can capture high-quality, consistent data
at the required cadences that are free from effects of the terrestrial atmosphere and differences
across observing facilities. Such a telescope would have excellent synergy with astrophysical
facilities by placing planetary discoveries made by astrophysics assets in temporal context,
as well as triggering detailed follow-up observations using larger telescopes. The telescope
would support future missions to the Ice Giants, Ocean Worlds, and minor bodies across the solar
system by placing the results of such targeted missions in the context of longer records of temporal
activities and larger sample populations.
