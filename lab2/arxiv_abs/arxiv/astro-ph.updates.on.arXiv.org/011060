While planets are commonly discovered around main-sequence stars, the processes leading to their
formation are still far from being understood. Current planet population synthesis models, which
aim at describing the planet formation process from the protoplanetary disk phase to the time exoplanets
are observed, rely on prescriptions for the underlying properties of protoplanetary disks where
planets form and evolve. The recent development in measuring disk masses and disk-star interaction
properties, i.e. mass accretion rates, in large samples of young stellar objects demand a more careful
comparison between the models and the data. Here we perform a first critical assessment of the assumptions
made by planet synthesis population models by looking at the relation between mass accretion rates
and disk masses in the models and in the currently available data. We find that the currently used
disk models predict mass accretion rate in line with what is measured, but with a much lower spread
of values than observed. This difference is mainly due to the fact that the models have a smaller spread
of viscous timescales than what is needed to reproduce the observations. We also find an overabundance
of weakly accreting disks in the models where giant planets have formed with respect to observations
of typical disks. We suggest that either fewer giant planets have formed in the reality or that the
prescription for planet accretion predicts too high accretion on the planets. Finally, the comparison
of the properties of transition disks with large cavities confirms that in many of these objects
the observed accretion rates are higher than those predicted by the models. On the other hand, PDS70,
a transition disk with two detected giant planets in the cavity, shows mass accretion rates well
in line with model predictions.
