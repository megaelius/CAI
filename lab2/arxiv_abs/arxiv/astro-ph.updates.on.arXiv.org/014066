Recent observations suggest that magnetic flux cancellation may play a crucial role to heat the
Sun's upper atmosphere (chromosphere, transition region, corona). Here, we intended to validate
an analytic model for magnetic reconnection and consequent coronal heating, driven by a pair of
converging and cancelling magnetic flux sources of opposite polarities. For this test, we analyzed
photospheric magnetic field and multi-wavelength UV/EUV observations of a small-scale flux cancellation
event in a quiet-Sun internetwork region over a target interval of 5.2 hr. The observed cancellation
event exhibits a converging motion of two opposite-polarity magnetic patches on the photosphere
and red-shifted Doppler velocities (downflows) therein consistently over the target interval,
with a decrease in magnetic flux of both polarities at a rate of 10$^{15}$ Mx s$^{-1}$. Several impulsive
EUV brightenings, with DEM values peaked at 1.6-2.0 MK, are also observed in the shape of arcades
with their two footpoints anchored in the two patches. The rate of magnetic energy released as heat
at the flux cancellation region is estimated to be in the range of (0.2-1)$\times$10$^{24}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ over the target interval, which can satisfy the requirement of previously reported heating
rates for the quiet-Sun corona. Finally, both short-term (a few to several tens of minutes) variations
and long-term (a few hours) trends in the magnetic energy release rate are clearly shown in the estimated
rate of radiative energy loss of electrons at temperatures above 2.0 MK. All these observational
findings support the validity of the investigated reconnection model for plasma heating in the
upper solar atmosphere by flux cancellation.
