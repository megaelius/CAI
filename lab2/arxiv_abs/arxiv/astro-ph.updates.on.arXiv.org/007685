In this paper we compare the molecular gas depletion times and mid-plane hydrostatic pressure in
turbulent, star forming disk galaxies to internal properties of these galaxies. For this analysis
we use 17 galaxies from the DYNAMO sample of nearby ($z\sim0.1$) turbulent disks. We find a strong
correlation, such that galaxies with lower molecular gas depletion time (t_{dep}) have higher
gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma$). Within the scatter of our data, our observations are consistent
with the prediction that depletion time is inversely proportionate to velocity dispersion made
in theories of feedback-regulated star formation. We also show a strong, single power-law correlation
between mid-plane pressure (P) and star formation rate surface density (Sigma_{SFR}), which extends
for 6 orders of magnitude in pressure. Disk galaxies with lower pressure are found to be roughly in
agreement with theoretical predictions. However, in galaxies with high pressure we find P/Sigma_{SFR}
values that are significantly larger than theoretical predictions. Our observations could be
explained with any of the following: (1) the correlation of \Sigma_{SFR}-P is significantly sub-linear;
(2) the momentum injected from star formation feedback (so-called p*/m*) is not a single, universal
value; or (3) alternate sources of pressure support are important in gas-rich disk galaxies. Finally
using published survey results, we find that our results are consistent with the cosmic evolution
of t_{dep}(z) and velocity dispersion. Our interpretation of these results is that the cosmic evolution
of t_{dep} may be regulated not just by the supply of gas, but also the internal regulation of star
formation via feedback.
