The gas content of galaxies is a key factor for their growth, starting from star formation and black
hole accretion to galaxy mergers. Thus, characterising its properties via observations of tracers
like the CO emission line is of big importance in order to understand the bigger picture of galaxy
evolution. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of dust
continuum, CO(5-4) and CO(8-7) line emission in the quasar--star-forming companion system SMM
J04135+10277 (z=2.84). Earlier low-$J$ CO studies of this system found a huge molecular gas reservoir
associated to the companion galaxy, while the quasar appeared gas-poor. Our CO observations revealed
that the host galaxy of the quasar is also gas-rich, with an estimated molecular gas mass of $\sim(0.7-2.3)\times10^{10}$
M$_{\odot}$. The CO line profiles of the companion galaxy are broad ($\sim1000$ km s$^{-1}$), and
show signs of rotation of a compact, massive system. In contrast to previous far-infrared observations,
we resolve the continuum emission and detect both sources, with the companion galaxy dominating
the dust continuum and the quasar having a $\sim25\%$ contribution to the total dust emission. By
fitting the infrared spectral energy distribution of the sources with \textsc{MR-MOOSE} and empirical
templates, the infrared luminosities of the quasar and the companion are in the range of $L_{\rm
IR, QSO}\sim(2.1-9.6)\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$ and $L_{\rm IR, Comp.}\sim(2.4-24)\times10^{12}$
L$_{\odot}$, while the estimated star formation rates are $\sim210-960$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
and $\sim240-2400$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Our results demonstrate that non-detection
of low-$J$ CO transition lines in similar sources does not necessarily imply the absence of massive
molecular gas reservoir but that the excitation conditions favour the excitation of high-$J$ transitions.
