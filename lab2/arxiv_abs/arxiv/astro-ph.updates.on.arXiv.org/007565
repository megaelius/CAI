The photospheric response to solar flares, also known as coronal back reaction, is often observed
as sudden flare-induced changes in vector magnetic field and sunspot motions. However, it remains
obscure whether evolving flare ribbons, the flare signature closest to the photosphere, are accompanied
by changes in vector magnetic field therein. Here we explore the relationship between the dynamics
of flare ribbons in the chromosphere and variations of magnetic fields in the underlying photosphere,
using high-resolution off-band H-alpha images and near-infrared vector magnetograms of the M6.5
flare on 2015 June 22 observed with the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope. We find that changes of photospheric
fields occur at the arrival of the flare ribbon front, thus propagating analogously to flare ribbons.
In general, the horizontal field increases and the field lines become more inclined to the surface.
When ribbons sweep through regions that undergo a rotational motion, the fields transiently turn
more vertical with decreased horizontal field and inclination angle, and then restore and/or become
more horizontal than before the ribbon arrival. The ribbon propagation decelerates near the sunspot
rotation center, where the vertical field becomes permanently enhanced. Similar magnetic field
changes are discernible in magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), and an
inward collapse of coronal magnetic fields is inferred from the time sequence of non-linear force-free
field models extrapolated from HMI magnetograms. We conclude that photospheric fields respond
nearly instantaneously to magnetic reconnection in the corona.
