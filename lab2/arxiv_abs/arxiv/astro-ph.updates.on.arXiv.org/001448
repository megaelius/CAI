The design of an interstellar digital communication system at radio wavelengths and interstellar
distances is considered, with application to communication with starships and extraterrestrial
civilizations. The distances involved are large, resulting in a need for large transmitted power
and/or large antennas. In light of a fundamental tradeoff between wider signal bandwidth and lower
signal energy per bit delivered to the receiver, the design uses unconstrained bandwidth and thus
minimizes delivered energy. One major challenge for communication with civilizations is the initially
uncoordinated design and, if the distances are greater, new impairments introduced by the interstellar
medium. Unconstrained bandwidth results in a simpler design, helping overcome the absence of coordination.
An implicit coordination strategy is proposed based on approaching the fundamental limit on energy
delivered to the receiver in the face of jointly observable impairments due to the interstellar
medium (dispersion, scattering, and scintillation) and motion. It is shown that the cosmic background
radiation is the only fundamental limitation on delivered energy per bit, as the remaining impairments
can be circumvented by appropriate signal design and technology. A simple design that represents
information by the sparse location of bundles of energy in time and frequency can approach that fundamental
energy limit as signal bandwidth grows. Individual energy bundles should fall in an interstellar
coherence hole, which is a time-duration and bandwidth limitation on waveforms rendering them
impervious to medium and motion impairments.
