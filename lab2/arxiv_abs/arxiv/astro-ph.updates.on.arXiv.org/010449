Potential microbial contamination of Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, which can be brought about
by transportation of Mars ejecta produced by meteoroid impacts on the Martian surface, has been
comprehensively assessed in a statistical approach, based on the most probable history of recent
major gigantic meteoroid collisions on the Martian surface. This article is the first part of our
study to assess potential microbial density in Mars ejecta departing from the Martian atmosphere,
as a source of the second part where statistical analysis of microbial contamination probability
is conducted. Potential microbial density on the Martian surface as the source of microorganisms
was estimated by analogy to the terrestrial areas having the similar arid and cold environments,
from which a probabilistic function was deduced as the asymptotic limit. Microbial survival rate
during hypervelocity meteoroid collisions was estimated by numerical analysis of impact phenomena
with and without taking internal friction and plastic deformation of the colliding meteoroid and
the target ground into consideration. Trajectory calculations of departing ejecta through the
Martian atmosphere were conducted with taking account of aerodynamic deceleration and heating
by the aid of computational fluid dynamic analysis. It is found that Mars ejecta smaller than 0.03
m in diameter hardly reach the Phobos orbit due to aerodynamic deceleration, or mostly sterilized
due to significant aerodynamic heating even though they can reach the Phobos orbit and beyond. Finally,
the baseline dataset of microbial density in Mars ejecta departing for Martian moons has been presented
for the second part of our study.
