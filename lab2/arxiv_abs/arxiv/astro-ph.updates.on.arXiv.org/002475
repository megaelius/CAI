Violent stochastic collisional events have been invoked as a possible explanation for some debris
discs displaying pronounced asymmetries or having a great luminosity excess. So far, no thorough
modelling of the consequences of such events has been carried out, mainly because of the extreme
numerical challenge of coupling the dynamical and collisional evolution of dust. We perform the
first fully self-consistent modelling of the aftermath of massive breakups in debris discs. We
follow the collisional and dynamical evolution of dust released after the breakup of a Ceres-sized
body at 6 AU from its central star. We investigate the duration, magnitude and spatial structure
of the signature left by such a violent event, as well as its observational detectability. We use
the recently developed LIDT-DD code (Kral et al., 2013), which handles the coupled collisional
and dynamical evolution of debris discs. The main focus is placed on the complex interplay between
destructive collisions, Keplerian dynamics and radiation pressure forces. We use the GRaTer package
to estimate the system's luminosity at different wavelengths. The breakup of a Ceres-sized body
at 6 AU creates an asymmetric dust disc that is homogenized, by the coupled action of collisions and
dynamics, on a timescale of a few $10^5$ years. The luminosity excess in the breakup's aftermath
should be detectable by mid-IR photometry, from a 30 pc distance, over a period of $\sim 10^6$ years
that exceeds the duration of the asymmetric phase of the disc (a few $10^5$ years). As for the asymmetric
structures, we derive synthetic images for the SPHERE/VLT and MIRI/JWST instruments, showing
that they should be clearly visible and resolved from a 10 pc distance. Images at 1.6$\mu$m (marginally),
11.4 and 15.5$\mu$m would show the inner disc structures while 23$\mu$m images would display the
outer disc asymmetries.
