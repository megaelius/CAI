The physics of star formation and the deposition of mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar
medium by massive stars (`feedback') are the main uncertainties in modern cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation and evolution. These processes determine the properties of galaxies, but are
poorly understood on the $\lesssim$100 pc scale of individual giant molecular clouds (GMCs) resolved
in modern galaxy formation simulations. The key question is why the timescale for depleting molecular
gas through star formation in galaxies ($t_{\rm dep}\approx 2$ Gyr) exceeds the dynamical timescale
of GMCs by two orders of magnitude. Either most of a GMC's mass is converted into stars over many dynamical
times, or only a small fraction turns into stars before the GMC is dispersed on a dynamical timescale.
Here we report our observation that molecular gas and star formation are spatially de-correlated
on GMC scales in the nearby flocculent spiral galaxy NGC300, contrary to their tight correlation
on galactic scales. We demonstrate that this de-correlation implies rapid evolutionary cycling
between GMCs, star formation, and feedback. We apply a novel statistical method to quantify the
evolutionary timeline and find that star formation is regulated by efficient stellar feedback,
driving GMC dispersal on short timescales (~1.5 Myr) due to radiation and stellar winds, prior to
supernova explosions. This feedback limits GMC lifetimes to about one dynamical timescale (~10
Myr), with integrated star formation efficiencies of only 2-3%. Our findings reveal that galaxies
consist of building blocks undergoing vigorous, feedback-driven lifecycles, that vary with the
galactic environment and collectively define how galaxies form stars. Systematic applications
of this multi-scale analysis to large galaxy samples will provide key input for a predictive, bottom-up
theory of galaxy formation and evolution.
