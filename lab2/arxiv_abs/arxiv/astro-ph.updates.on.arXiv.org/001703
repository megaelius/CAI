Transition disks are protoplanetary disks with inner depleted dust cavities and excellent candidates
to investigate the dust evolution under the existence of a pressure bump. A pressure bump at the outer
edge of the cavity allows dust grains from the outer regions to stop their rapid inward migration
towards the star and efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. Dynamical interactions with planet(s)
have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearing of the inner disk. We look for evidence
of the presence of millimetre dust particles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index
with new and available photometric data. We investigate the influence of the size of the dust depleted
cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. We present the 3mm photometric observations
carried out with PdBI of four transition disks: LkHa330, UXTauA, LRLL31, and LRLL67. We use available
values of their fluxes at 345GHz to calculate their spectral index, as well as the spectral index
for a sample of twenty transition disks. We compare the observations with two kind of models. In the
first set of models, we consider coagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity
is formed by a massive planet located at different positions. The second set of models assumes disks
with truncated inner parts at different radius and with power-law dust size distributions, where
the maximum size of grains is calculated considering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions.
We show that the integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks than for regular protoplanetary
disks. For transition disks, the probability that the measured spectral index is positively correlated
with the cavity radius is 95%. High angular resolution imaging of transition disks is needed to distinguish
between the dust trapping scenario and the truncated disk case.
