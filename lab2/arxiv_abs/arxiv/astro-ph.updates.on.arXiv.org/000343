(Abridged)We investigate mass losses via stellar winds from sun-like main sequence stars with
a wide range of activity levels by forward-type magnetohydrodynamical numerical experiments
for Alfven wave-driven stellar winds from the photosphere. Increasing the magnetic field strength
and the turbulent velocity at the stellar photosphere from the current solar level, the mass loss
rate rapidly increases at first owing to the suppression of the reflection of the Alfven waves. The
surface materials are lifted up by the magnetic pressure associated with the Alfven waves, and the
cool dense chromosphere is intermittently extended to 10-20% of the stellar radius. The densities
of the corona and transition region above the chromosphere is also high, which leads to efficient
radiative losses. Eventually most of the input Poynting energy from the stellar surface escapes
by the radiation. As a result, there is no more sufficient energy remained for the kinetic energy
of the wind; the stellar wind saturates in very active stars, as observed in Wood et al. The saturation
level is positively correlated with B_{r,0}f_0, where B_{r,0} and f_0 are the magnetic field strength
and the filling factor of open flux tubes at the photosphere. If B_{r,0}f_0 is relatively large \greatsim
5 G, the mass loss rate could be as high as 1000 times. If such a strong mass loss lasts for ~1 billion
years, the stellar mass itself is affected, which could be a solution to the faint young sun paradox.
Our simulations show that 0.1-10% of the input Poynting flux is transferred to the final kinetic
energy of the stellar winds, from which we derive a Reimers-type scaling relation that estimates
the mass loss rate of sun-like stars. Finally, we derive the evolution of the mass loss rates, \dot{M}
t^{-1.23}, of our simulations, combining with an observed time evolution of X-ray flux from sun-like
stars.
