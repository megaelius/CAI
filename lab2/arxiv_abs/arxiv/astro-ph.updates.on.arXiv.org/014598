The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) is a major facility to carry
out spectroscopic surveys for cosmology and galaxy evolution studies. The seventh data release
of the LAMOST ExtraGAlactic Survey (LEGAS) is currently available and including redshifts of 193\,361
galaxies. These sources are spread over $\sim 11\,500$ deg$^2$ of the sky, largely overlapping
with other imaging (SDSS, HSC) and spectroscopic (BOSS) surveys. The estimated depth of the galaxy
sample, $r\sim17.8$, the high signal-to-noise ratio, and the spectral resolution $R=1800$, make
the LAMOST spectra suitable for galaxy velocity dispersion measurements, which are invaluable
to study the structure and formation of galaxies and to determine their central dark matter (DM)
content. We present the first estimates of central velocity dispersion of $\sim86\,000$ galaxies
in LAMOST footprint. We have used a wrap-up procedure to perform the spectral fitting using \textsc{pPXF},
and derive velocity dispersion measurements. Statistical errors are also assessed by comparing
LAMOST velocity dispersion estimates with the ones of SDSS and BOSS over a common sample of $\sim51\,000$
galaxies. The two datasets show a good agreement, within the statistical errors, in particular
when velocity dispersion values are corrected to 1 effective radius aperture. We also present a
preliminary Mass-$\sigma$ relation and find consistency with previous analyses based on local
galaxy samples. These first results suggest that LAMOST spectra are suitable for galaxy velocity
dispersion measurements to complement the available catalogs of galaxy internal kinematics in
the northern hemisphere. We plan to expand this analysis to next LAMOST data releases.
