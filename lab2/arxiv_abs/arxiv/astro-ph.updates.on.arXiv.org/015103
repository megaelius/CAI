Two repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources, rFRB180916 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, 2020) and
rFRB121102 (Rajwade, et al., 2020) display periodic windowed behavior (PWB) in the times of FRB
detections. In PWB, events occur only within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the period,
but in rFRB121102, no events are detected during many of the periods. During 2020 May, coincident
soft gamma bursts and FRBs from SGR1935+2154 (GCN 27675) established a clear link between at least
some FRBs and magnetars, the apparent source of soft gamma repeater (SGR) bursts. A periodic folding
analysis of gamma-ray burst data on SGR1935+2154 from 2014 through 2020 from IPN (Interplanetary
Network) instruments also shows PWB. For the largest data sample, 174 bursts, a window fraction
of 56% covered all bursts at a 232 day period. The data are inhomogeneous, with various biases, and
cover only 6 bursting episodes; discovering one or a few events outside of our proposed window and
period could seriously impact these conclusions. Simulations and instrument properties show
this to be very unlikely, however: For several sub-samples of the data, the same period is found,
and for all sub-samples, this period yielded among the lowest window fractions. Random data yield
equally small window fractions with vanishingly small probability. In addition, the ensemble
of IPN instruments has excellent time coverage, and is unlikely to miss any bursts outside of these
windows at similar sensitivity. Finally, random events in the same period and number of windows
as our data show that for more than about 70 events, errors in the period and window fraction are very
small. These checks suggest a robust result, not due to a data set that is too small. The presence of
some kind of periodicity in the bursts of this SGR should therefore provide useful hints as to the
mechanism behind SGR bursts, and by association, FRBs.
