Recent improvements on the sensitivity and spectral resolution of X-ray observations have led
to a better understanding of the properties of matter in the vicinity of High Mass X-ray Binaries
hosting a supergiant star and a compact object. However the geometry and physical properties of
their environment at larger scales are currently only predicted by simulations. We aim at exploring
the environment of Vela X-1 at a few stellar radii of the supergiant using spatially resolved observations
in the near-infrared and at studying its dynamical evolution along the 9-day orbital period of the
system. We observed Vela X-1 in 2010 and 2012 using long baseline interferometry at VLTI, respectively
with the AMBER instrument in the K band and the PIONIER instrument in the H band. The PIONIER observations
span through one orbital period to monitor possible evolutions in the geometry of the system. We
resolved a structure of $8\pm3~R_\star$ from the AMBER data and $2.0\,_{-1.2}^{+0.7}~R_\star$
from the PIONIER data. From the closure phase we found that the environment of Vela X-1 is symmetrical.
We observed comparable measurements between the continuum and the spectral lines in the K band,
meaning that both emissions originate from the same forming region. From the monitoring of the system
over one period in 2012, we found the signal to be constant with the orbital phase within the error
bars. We propose three scenarios for the discrepancy between the two measurements: either there
is a strong temperature gradient in the supergiant wind leading to a hot component much more compact
than the cool part of the wind observed in the K band, or we observed a diffuse shell in 2010 possibly
triggered by an off-state in the accretion rate of the pulsar that was dissolved in the interstellar
medium in 2012, or the structure observed in the H band was the stellar photosphere instead of the
supergiant wind.
