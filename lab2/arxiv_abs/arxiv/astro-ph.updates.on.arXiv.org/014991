To reach a deeper understanding of the origin of elements in the periodic table, we construct Galactic
chemical evolution (GCE) models for all stable elements from C (A=12) to U (A=238) from first principles,
i.e., using theoretical nucleosynthesis yields and event rates of all chemical enrichment sources.
This enables us to predict the origin of elements as a function of time and environment. In the solar
neighborhood, we find that stars with initial masses of M>30M_\odot can become failed supernovae
if there is a significant contribution from hypernovae (HNe) at M~20-50M_\odot. The contribution
to GCE from super asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (with M~8-10M_\odot at solar metallicity)
is negligible, unless hybrid white dwarfs from low-mass super-AGB stars explode as so-called Type
Iax supernovae, or high-mass super-AGB stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe).
Among neutron-capture elements, the observed abundances of the second (Ba) and third (Pb) peak
elements are well reproduced with our updated yields of the slow neutron-capture process (s-process)
from AGB stars. The first peak elements, Sr, Y, and Zr, are sufficiently produced by ECSNe together
with AGB stars. Neutron star mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) elements
up to Th and U, but the timescales are too long to explain observations at low metallicities. The observed
evolutionary trends, such as for Eu, can well be explained if ~3% of 25-50 M_\odot hypernovae are
magneto-rotational supernovae producing r-process elements. Along with the solar neighborhood,
we also predict the evolutionary trends in the halo, bulge, and thick disk for future comparison
with galactic archaeology surveys.
