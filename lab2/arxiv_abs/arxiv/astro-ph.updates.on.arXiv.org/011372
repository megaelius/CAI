We explore here the prospects for detection of both giant circumbinary exoplanets, and brown dwarfs
orbiting Galactic double white dwarfs binaries (DWDs) with the LISA mission. By assuming an occurrence
rate of 50%, motivated by white dwarf pollution observations, we build a Galactic synthetic population
of P-type giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs orbiting DWDs. We do so by injecting different sub-stellar
populations, with various mass and orbital separation characteristics, into the DWD population
used in the LISA mission proposal. We then perform a Fisher matrix analysis to measure how many of
these three body systems show a periodic Doppler-shifted gravitational wave perturbation detectable
by LISA. We report the number of circumbinary planets (CBPs) and brown dwarfs (BD) that can be detected
by LISA for different combinations of mass and semi-major axis distributions. We identify a pessimistic
and optimistic scenario corresponding respectively to 3 and 83 (14 and 2218) detections of CBPs
(BDs), observed during the length of the nominal LISA mission. These detections are distributed
all over the Galaxy following the underling DWD distribution, and they are biased towards DWDs with
higher LISA signal-to-noise ratio and shorter orbital period. Finally, we show that, if LISA were
to be extended for 4 more years, the number of systems detected will be more than doubled in both optimistic
and pessimistic scenarios. Our results present promising prospects for the detection of post-main
sequence exoplanets and brown dwarfs, showing that gravitational waves can prove the existence
of these populations over the totality of the Milky Way. LISA detections will deepen our knowledge
on the life of exoplanets subsequent to the most extreme evolution phases of their hosts, clarifying
whether new phases of planetary formation take place later in the life of the stars.
