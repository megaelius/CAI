In order to test planetary accretion and differentiation scenarios, we integrated a multistage
core-mantle differentiation model with N-body accretion simulations. Impacts between embryos
and planetesimals result in magma ocean formation and episodes of core formation. The core formation
model combines rigorous chemical mass balance with metal-silicate element partitioning data.
The primary constraint on the combined model is the composition of the Earth's primitive mantle,
the composition of the Martian mantle, and the mass fractions of the metallic cores of Earth and Mars.
The model is refined by least squares minimization with up to five fitting parameters that consist
of the metal-silicate equilibrium pressure and 1-4 parameters that define the starting compositions
of primitive bodies. This integrated model has been applied to 6 Grand Tack simulations. Investigations
of a broad parameter space indicate that: accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, metal-silicate
equilibration pressures increase as accretion progresses and are 60-70% of core-mantle boundary
pressures at the time of each impact, and a large fraction (70-100%) of the metal of impactor cores
equilibrates with a small fraction of the silicate mantles of protoplanets during each core formation
event. Acceptable fits to the Earth's mantle composition are obtained only when bodies that originated
close to the Sun, at <0.9-1.2 AU, are highly reduced and those beyond this distance are increasingly
oxidized. The FeO content of the Martian mantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance
at which the Mars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth's core is predicted to contain
8-9 wt% silicon, 2-4 wt% oxygen and 10-60 ppm hydrogen, whereas the Martian core is predicted to contain
low concentrations (<1 wt%) of Si and O.
