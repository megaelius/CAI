We used new ALMA $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O(3-2) observations obtained at high angular resolution
($\sim$0.2") together with previous CO(3-2) and (6-5) ALMA data and continuum maps at 1.3 and 0.8
mm in order to determine the gas properties (temperature, density, and kinematics) in the cavity
and to a lesser extent in the outer disk of GG Tau A, the prototype of a young triple T Tauri star that
is surrounded by a massive and extended Keplerian outer disk. By deprojecting, we studied the radial
and azimuthal gas distribution and its kinematics. We also applied a new method to improve the deconvolution
of the CO data and in particular better quantify the emission from gas inside the cavity. We perform
local and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium studies in order to determine the excitation conditions
and relevant physical parameters inside the ring and in the central cavity. Residual emission after
removing a smooth-disk model indicates unresolved structures at our angular resolution, probably
in the form of irregular rings or spirals. The outer disk is cold, with a temperature $<20$ K beyond
250 au that drops quickly (r$^{-1}$). The kinematics of the gas inside the cavity reveals infall
motions at about 10% of the Keplerian speed. We derive the amount of gas in the cavity, and find that
the brightest clumps, which contain about 10% of this mass, have kinetic temperatures 40$-$80 K,
CO column densities of a few 10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$, and H$_2$ densities around 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$.
Although the gas in the cavity is only a small fraction of the disk mass, the mass accretion rate throughout
the cavity is comparable to or higher than the stellar accretion rate. It is accordingly sufficient
to sustain the circumstellar disks on a long timescale.
