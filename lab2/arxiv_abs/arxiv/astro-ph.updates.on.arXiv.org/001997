We present a new catalogue of spectrophotometric distances and line-of-sight systemic velocities
to 103 HII regions between 90$^{\circ}\leq \ell \leq~$195$^{\circ}$ (longitude quadrants II
and part of III). Two new velocities for each region are independently measured using 1-arcminute
resolution 21~cm HI and 2.6~mm $^{12}$CO line maps (from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and
FCRAO Outer Galaxy Surveys) that show where gaseous shells are observed around the periphery of
the ionized gas. Known and neighbouring OB-type stars with published UBV photometry and MK classifications
are overlaid onto 21~cm continuum maps, and those stars observed within the boundary of the HII emission
(and whose distance is not more than 3 times the standard deviation of the others) are used to calculate
new mean stellar distances to each of the 103 nebulae. Using this approach of excluding distance
outliers from the mean distance to a group of many stars in each HII region lessens the impact of anomalous
reddening for certain individuals. Final mean distances of 9 common objects with VLBI parallax
distances show a 1:1 correspondence. Further, comparison with previous catalogues of HII regions
in these quadrants shows a 50% reduction in scatter for the distance to Perseus spiral arm objects
in the same region, and a reduction by $\sim$1/$\sqrt{2}$ in scatter around a common angular velocity
relative to the Sun $\Omega-\Omega_0$(km~s$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-1}$). The purpose of the catalogue
is to provide a foundation for more detailed large-scale Galactic spiral structure and dynamics
(rotation curve, density wave streaming) studies in the 2$^{\textrm{nd}}$ and 3$^{\textrm{rd}}$
quadrants, which from the Sun's location is the most favourably viewed section of the Galaxy.
