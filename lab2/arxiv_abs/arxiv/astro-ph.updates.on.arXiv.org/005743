Mars is the only planet, other than Earth, for which there are several evidences that liquid water
was abundant at the surface. Among them, one of the best evidence is that the ancient terrains of Mars
are covered with fluvial and lacustrine features such as valley networks, longitudinal valleys
and basin lakes. In addition, spectroscopic data have shown the widespread presence of aqueous
alteration minerals on the Martian surface, including clays composed by phyllosilicates and hydrated
salts. The main subject of my PhD is the study of these specific features (such as valley networks
and paleolakes) on Mars surface, both from the geological and spectroscopic point of view through
mapping, sediment transport modelling and CRISM spectra analyses. There are, in fact, no doubts
that these structures were carved by liquid water, but several questions remain about the mechanisms
of their formation and the climatic conditions under which this formation occurred. In this context,
the study of these structures along with the identification of hydrated minerals, are a key in the
investigation of the past climatic conditions of the planet which can have, in turn, important astrobiological
implications. I updated previous global maps of Martian valleys using a new photomosaic of the Martian
surface and data at higher resolution with respect to those used in the previous works. Furthermore,
I selected a subset of the mapped valleys which includes 63 large fluvial systems and evaluated their
formation timescales on the basis of sediment transport modelling. In addition, analyses of CRISM
spectral data were performed on a sample of open/closed basin lakes (associated with the mapped
valleys) detecting the possible presence of hydrated minerals, in particular (Fe/Mg-smectite),
sometimes in association with mafic materials (olivine).
