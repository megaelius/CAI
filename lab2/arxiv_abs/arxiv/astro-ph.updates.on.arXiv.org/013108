Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies from Planck have estimated
a lower value of the optical depth to reionization ($\tau$) compared to WMAP. A significant period
in the reionization history would then fall within $6<z< 10$, where detection of galaxies with Hubble
Frontier Fields program and independent estimation of neutral hydrogen in the inter galactic medium
by Lyman-$\alpha$ observations are also available. This overlap allows an analysis of cosmic reionization
which utilizes a direct combination of CMB and these astrophysical measurements and potentially
breaks degeneracies in parameters describing the physics of reionization. For the first time we
reconstruct reionization histories by assuming photo-ionization and recombination rates to
be free-form and by allowing underlying cosmological parameters to vary with CMB (temperature
and polarization anisotropies and lensing) data from Planck 2018 release and a compilation of astrophysical
data. We find an excellent agreement between the low-$\ell$ Planck 2018 HFI polarization likelihood
and astrophysical data in determining the integrated optical depth. By combining both data, we
report for a minimal reconstruction $\tau=0.051^{+0.001+0.002}_{-0.0012-0.002}$ at 68\% and
95\% CL, which, for the errors in the current astrophysical measurements quoted in the literature,
is nearly twice better than the projected cosmic variance limited CMB measurements. For the duration
of reionization, redshift interval between 10\% and complete ionization, we get $2.9^{+0.12+0.29}_{-0.16-0.26}$
at 68\% and 95\% CL, which improves significantly on the corresponding result obtained by using
Planck 2015 data. By a Bayesian analysis of the combined results we do not find evidence beyond monotonic
reionization histories, therefore multi-phase reionization scenario is disfavored compared
to minimal alternatives.
