Glitches are rare spin-up events that punctuate the smooth slow-down of the rotation of pulsars.
For the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, the glitch sizes and the times between consecutive events
have clear preferred scales, contrary to the handful of other pulsars with enough glitches for such
a study. Moreover, PSR J0537-6910 is the only pulsar showing a strong positive correlation between
the size of each glitch and the waiting time until the following one. We attempt to understand this
behavior through a detailed study of the distributions and correlations of glitch properties for
the eight pulsars with at least ten detected glitches. We model the distributions of glitch sizes
and times between consecutive glitches for this sample and perform Monte Carlo simulations to explore
two hypotheses that could explain why the correlation is so much weaker in other pulsars than in PSR
J0537-6910. We confirm the above results for the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, and verify that
the latter is the only pulsar with a strong correlation between glitch size and waiting time to the
following glitch. For the remaining six pulsars, the waiting time distributions are best fitted
by exponentials, and the size distributions either by power laws, exponentials, or log-normal
functions. Some pulsars in the sample yield significant Pearson and Spearman coefficients ($r_p$
and $r_s$) for the aforementioned correlation. Moreover, for all except the Crab, both coefficients
are positive. Our simulations show that the weaker correlations in pulsars other than PSR J0537$-$6910
cannot be due to missing glitches too small to be detected. We also tested the hypothesis that each
pulsar may have two kinds of glitches, namely large, correlated ones and small, uncorrelated ones.
We found for all pulsars that their glitches are not consistent with a pure uncorrelated population
either.
