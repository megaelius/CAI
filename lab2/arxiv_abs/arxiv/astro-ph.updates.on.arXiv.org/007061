The completeness limit is a key quantity to measure the reliability of an impact monitoring system.
It is the impact probability threshold above which every virtual impactor has to be detected. A goal
of this paper is to increase the completeness without increasing the computational load. We propose
a new method to sample the Line Of Variations (LOV) with respect to the previously one used in NEODyS.
The step-size of the sampling is not uniform in the LOV parameter, since the probability of each LOV
segment between consecutive points is kept constant. Moreover, the sampling interval has been
extended to the larger interval [-5,5] in the LOV parameter and a new decomposition scheme in sub-returns
is provided to deal with the problem of duplicated points in the same return. The impact monitoring
system CLOMON-2 has been upgraded with all these features, resulting in a decrease of the generic
completeness limit IP* by a factor $\simeq 4$ and in an increase of the computational load by a factor
$\simeq 2$. Moreover, we statistically investigate the completeness actually reached by the system
with two different methods: a direct comparison with the results of the independent system Sentry
at JPL and an empirical power-law to model the number of virtual impactors as a function of the impact
probability. We found empirically that the number of detected virtual impactors with $IP>IP^*$
appears to grow according to a power-law, proportional to $IP^{-2/3}$. An analytical model explaining
this power-law is currently an open problem, but we think it is related to the way the number of virtual
impactors within a time $t_{rel}$ from the first observed close approach accumulates, for which
we prove the existence of a power-law proportional to $t_{rel}^3$. The power-law allows us to detect
a loss of efficiency in the virtual impactors search for impact probabilities near the generic completeness
limit.
