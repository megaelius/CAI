Exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs present a valuable opportunity for their detection and atmospheric
characterisation. This is evident from recent inferences of H$_2$O in such atmospheres, including
that of the habitable-zone exoplanet K2-18b. With a bulk density between Earth and Neptune, K2-18b
may be expected to possess a H/He envelope. However, the extent of such an envelope and the thermodynamic
conditions of the interior remain unexplored. In the present work, we investigate the atmospheric
and interior properties of K2-18b based on its bulk properties and its atmospheric transmission
spectrum. We constrain the atmosphere to be H$_2$-rich with a H$_2$O volume mixing ratio of $0.02-14.8$%,
consistent with previous studies, and find a depletion of CH$_4$ and NH$_3$, indicating chemical
disequilibrium. We do not conclusively detect clouds/hazes in the observable atmosphere. We use
the bulk parameters and retrieved atmospheric properties to constrain the internal structure
and thermodynamic conditions in the planet. The constraints on the interior allow multiple scenarios
between rocky worlds with massive H/He envelopes and water worlds with thin envelopes. We constrain
the mass fraction of the H/He envelope to be $\lesssim 6$%; spanning $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ for a predominantly
water world to $\sim6$% for a pure iron interior. The thermodynamic conditions at the surface of
the H$_2$O layer range from the super-critical to liquid phases, with a range of solutions allowing
for habitable conditions on K2-18b. Our results demonstrate that the potential for habitable conditions
is not necessarily restricted to Earth-like rocky exoplanets.
