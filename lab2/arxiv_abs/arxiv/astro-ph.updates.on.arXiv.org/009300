Elemental abundances of CH stars can provide observational constraints for theoretical studies
on the nucleosynthesis and evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. However, available
abundance data in literature are quite scanty. In our pursuit to generate a homogeneous database
of elemental abundances of CH stars we have performed a detailed chemical abundance study for a sample
of 12 potential CH star candidates based on high resolution spectroscopy. We present first time
abundance analysis for the objects HE 0308-1612, CD-28 1082, HD 30443, and HD 87853. For the other
objects, although limited information is available, detailed chemical composition studies are
missing. Our analysis shows CD-28 1082 to be a very metal-poor object with [Fe/H] = -2.45 and enriched
in carbon with [C/Fe] = 2.19. With a ratio of [Ba/Eu] ~ 0.02 the star satisfies the classification
criteria of a CEMP-r/s star. The objects CD-38 2151 with [Fe/H] = -2.03 and HD 30443 with [Fe/H] ~ -1.68
are found to show the characteristic properties of CH stars. HE 0308-1612 and HD 87853 are found to
be moderately metal-poor with [Fe/H]~ -0.73; while HE 0308-1612 is moderately enhanced with carbon
([C/Fe] ~ 0.78) and shows the spectral properties of CH stars, the abundance of carbon could not be
estimated for HD 87853. Among the two moderately metal-poor objects, HD 87080 ([Fe/H] = -0.48) shows
near solar carbon abundance, and HD 176021 ([Fe/H] = -0.63) is mildly enhanced in carbon with [C/Fe]
= 0.52. HD 176021 along with HD 202020 a known binary, exhibit the characteristic properties of CH
stars as far as the heavy element abundances are concerned. Five objects in our sample show spectral
properties that are normally seen in barium stars.
