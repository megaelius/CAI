Dust lanes bisect the plane of a typical edge-on spiral galaxy as a dark optical absorption feature.
Their appearance is linked to the gravitational stability of spiral disks; the fraction of edge-on
galaxies that displays a dust lane is a direct indicator of the typical vertical balance between
gravity and turbulence; a balance struck between the energy input from star-formation and the gravitational
pull into the plane of the disk. Based on morphological classifications by the Galaxy~Zoo project
on the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) imaging data in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) fields, we explore
the relation of dust lanes to the galaxy characteristics, most of which were determined using the
{\sc magphys} spectral energy distribution fitting tool: stellar mass, total and specific star-formation
rates, and several parameters describing the cold dust component. We find that the fraction of dust
lanes does depend on the stellar mass of the galaxy; they start to appear at $M^* \sim 10^9 M_\odot$.
A dust lane also implies strongly a dust mass of at least $10^5 M_\odot$, but otherwise does not correlate
with cold dust mass parameters of the {\sc magphys} spectral energy distribution analysis, nor
is there a link with star-formation rate, specific or total. Dust lane identification does not depend
on disk ellipticity (disk thickness) or Sersic profile but correlates with bulge morphology; a
round bulge favors dust lane votes. The central component along the line of sight that produces the
dust lane is not associated with either one of the components fit by {\sc magphys}, the cold diffuse
component or the localized, heated component in HII regions, but a mix of these two.
