Galaxies exhibit different clustering and quenching properties in clusters, filaments, and the
field, but it is still uncertain whether such differences are imprints of the tidal environment
on galaxy formation, or if they reflect the variation of the underlying halo mass function across
the cosmic web. We measure the dependence of galaxy clustering and quenching on the cosmic web in
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, characterized by the combination of spherical overdensity $\delta_8$
and tidal anisotropy $\alpha_5$ centred on each galaxy. We find that galaxy clustering is a strong
function of either $\delta_8$ or $\alpha_5$, and the large-scale galaxy bias shows complex and
rich behaviour on the $\delta_8$ vs. $\alpha_5$ plane. Using the mean galaxy colour as a proxy for
the average quenched level of galaxies, we find that galaxy quenching is primarily a function of
$\delta_8$, with some subtle yet non-trivial dependence on $\alpha_5$ at fixed $\delta_8$. The
quenched galaxies generally show stronger small-scale clustering than the star-forming ones
at fixed $\delta_8$ or $\alpha_5$, while the characteristic scale at which the amplitude of clustering
becomes comparable for both galaxy populations varies with $\delta_8$ and $\alpha_5$. We compare
these observed cosmic web dependences of galaxy clustering and quenching with a mock galaxy catalogue
constructed from the iHOD model, which places quenched and star-forming galaxies inside dark matter
haloes based on the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the halo quenching model --- the $\delta_8$
and $\alpha_5$ dependences of iHOD galaxies are thus solely derived from the cosmic web modulation
of the halo mass function. The main observed trends are accounted for extremely well by the iHOD model.
Thus any additional direct effect of the large-scale~(${>}5\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) tidal field on
galaxy formation must be extremely weak. [Abridged]
