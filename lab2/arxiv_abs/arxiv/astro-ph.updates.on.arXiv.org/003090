We study the nature of feedback mechanisms in the 11 CLASH brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) that
exhibit extended ultraviolet and nebular line emission features. We estimate star formation rates
(SFRs), dust masses, and starburst durations using a Bayesian photometry-fitting technique that
accounts for both stellar and dust emission from the UV through far IR. By comparing these quantities
to intracluster medium (ICM) cooling times and free-fall times derived from X-ray observations
and lensing estimates of the cluster mass distribution, we discover a tight relationship between
the BCG SFR and the ICM cooling time to free-fall time ratio, $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$, with an upper limit
on the intrinsic scatter of 0.15 dex. Furthermore, starburst durations may correlate with ICM cooling
times at a radius of $0.025R_{500}$, and the two quantities converge upon reaching the Gyr regime.
Our results provide a direct observational link between the thermodynamical state of the ICM and
the intensity and duration of BCG star formation activity, and appear consistent with a scenario
where active galactic nuclei (AGN) induce condensation of thermally unstable ICM overdensities
that fuel long-duration ($>$ 1 Gyr) BCG starbursts. This scenario can explain (a) how gas with a low
cooling time is depleted without causing a cooling flow and (b) the scaling relationship between
SFR and $t_{cool}/t_{ff}$. We also find that the scaling relation between SFR and dust mass in BCGs
with SFRs $<100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is similar to star-forming field galaxies; BCGs with large
($>100$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) SFRs have dust masses comparable to extreme starbursts.
