We use numerical simulations to explore whether direct collapse can lead to the formation of supermassive
black hole (SMBH) seeds at high redshifts. We follow the evolution of gas within slowly tumbling
DM halos of 2 x 10^8 Mo and 1 kpc. We adopt cosmologically motivated density profiles and j-distributions.
Our goal is to understand how the collapsing flow overcomes the centrifugal barrier and whether
it is subject to fragmentation. We find that the collapse leads either to a central runaway or to off-center
fragmentation. A disk-like configuration is formed inside the centrifugal barrier. For more cuspy
DM distribution, the gas collapses more and experiences a bar-like perturbation and a central runaway.
We have followed this inflow down to ~10^{-4} pc. The flow remains isothermal and the specific angular
momentum is efficiently transferred by gravitational torques in a cascade of nested bars. This
cascade supports a self-similar, disk-like collapse. In the collapsing phase, virial supersonic
turbulence develops and fragmentation is damped. For larger initial DM cores the timescales become
longer. In models with more organized initial rotation, a torus forms and appears to be supported
by turbulent motions. The evolution depends on the competition between two timescales, corresponding
to the onset of the central runaway and off-center fragmentation. For less organized rotation,
the torus is greatly weakened, the central accretion timescale is shortened, and off-center fragmentation
is suppressed --- triggering the central runaway even in previously `stable' models. The resulting
SMBH masses lie in the range 2 x 10^4 Mo - 2 x 10^6 Mo, much higher than for Population III remnants. Corollaries
of this model include a possible correlation between SMBH and DM halo masses, and similarity between
the SMBH and halo mass functions, at time of formation.
