Among astrophysical sources in the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' frequency band
are rotating non-axisymmetric neutron stars emitting long-lasting, almost-monochromatic gravitational
waves. Searches for these continuous gravitational-wave signals are usually performed in long
stretches of data in a matched-filter framework e.g., the F-statistic method. In an all-sky search
for a priori unknown sources, large number of templates is matched against the data using a pre-defined
grid of variables (the gravitational-wave frequency and its derivatives, sky coordinates), subsequently
producing a collection of candidate signals, corresponding to the grid points at which the signal
reaches a pre-defined signal-to-noise threshold. An astrophysical signature of the signal is
encoded in the multi-dimensional vector distribution of the candidate signals. In the first work
of this kind, we apply a deep learning approach to classify the distributions. We consider three
basic classes: Gaussian noise, astrophysical gravitational-wave signal, and a constant-frequency
detector artifact ("stationary line"), the two latter injected into the Gaussian noise. 1D and
2D versions of a convolutional neural network classifier are implemented, trained and tested on
a broad range of signal frequencies. We demonstrate that these implementations correctly classify
the instances of data at various signal-to-noise ratios and signal frequencies, while also showing
concept generalization i.e., satisfactory performance at previously unseen frequencies. In
addition we discuss the deficiencies, computational requirements and possible applications
of these implementations.
