V582 Aur is an FU Ori-type young eruptive star in outburst since $\sim$1985. The eruption is currently
in a relatively constant plateau phase, with photometric and spectroscopic variability superimposed.
Here we will characterize the progenitor of the outbursting object, explore its environment, and
analyse the temporal evolution of the eruption. We are particularly interested in the physical
origin of the two deep photometric dips, one occurred in 2012, and one is ongoing since 2016. We collected
archival photographic plates, and carried out new optical, infrared, and millimeter wave photometric
and spectroscopic observations between 2010 and 2017, with high sampling rate during the current
minimum. Beside analysing the color changes during fading, we compiled multiepoch spectral energy
distributions, and fitted them with a simple accretion disk model. Based on pre-outburst data and
a millimeter continuum measurement, we suggest that the progenitor of the V582 Aur outburst is a
low-mass T Tauri star with average properties. The mass of an unresolved circumstellar structure,
probably a disk, is 0.04 M$_{\odot}$. The optical and near-infrared spectra demonstrate the presence
of hydrogen and metallic lines, show the CO bandhead in absorption, and exhibit a variable H$\alpha$
profile. The color variations strongly indicate that both the $\sim$1 year long brightness dip
in 2012, and the current minimum since 2016 are caused by increased extinction along the line of sight.
According to our accretion disk models, the reddening changed from $A_V$=4.5 mag to 12.5 mag, while
the accretion rate remained practically constant. Similarly to the models of the UXor phenomenon
of intermediate and low-mass young stars, orbiting disk structures could be responsible for the
eclipses.
