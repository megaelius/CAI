Small planets around low-mass stars often show orbital periods in a range that corresponds to the
temperate zones of their host stars which are therefore of prime interest for planet searches. Surface
phenomena such as spots and faculae create periodic signals in radial velocities and in observational
activity tracers in the same range, so they can mimic or hide true planetary signals. We aim to detect
Doppler signals corresponding to planetary companions, determine their most probable orbital
configurations, and understand the stellar activity and its impact on different datasets. We analyze
22\,years of data of the M1.5\,V-type star Gl\,49 (BD+61\,195) including HARPS-N and CARMENES
spectrographs, complemented by APT2 and SNO photometry. Activity indices are calculated from
the observed spectra, and all datasets are analyzed with periodograms and noise models. We investigate
how the variation of stellar activity imprints on our datasets. We further test the origin of the
signals and investigate phase shifts between the different sets. To search for the best-fit model
we maximize the likelihood function in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. As a result of this study,
we are able to detect the super-Earth Gl\,49b with a minimum mass of 5.6\,M$_{\oplus}$. It orbits
its host star with a period of 13.85\,d at a semi-major axis of 0.090\,au and we calculate an equilibrium
temperature of 350\,K and a transit probability of 2.0\,\%. The contribution from the spot-dominated
host star to the different datasets is complex, and includes signals from the stellar rotation at
18.86\,d, evolutionary time-scales of activity phenomena at 40--80\,d, and a long-term variation
of at least four years.
