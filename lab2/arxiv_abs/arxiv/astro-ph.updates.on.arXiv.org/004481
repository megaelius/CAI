In this paper we study the statistical properties of weak lensing peaks in light-cones generated
from numerical simulations. We focus on interacting Dark Energy cosmological models, characterised
by a coupling term between dark energy and dark matter which allows us to study in detail how such an
interaction affects a particular second-order weak lensing statistics. Cosmological models
characterised by a larger population of massive clusters tend to also have more numerous high signal-to-noise
peaks; however structural properties like e.g. the halo concentration play an important role:
models characterised by the same number of haloes possess more weak lensing peaks if their haloes
are more concentrated. The various cosmological models exhibit large differences in peaks for
high values of the signal-to-noise ratio, due to intervening massive haloes along the line-of-sight,
demonstrating a clear connection between peaks in the convergence field and galaxy clusters with
$M_{200}\geq10^{14}M_{\odot}/h.$ The most extreme model under investigation shows a difference
of about 20% with respect to the reference {\Lambda}CDM model and a clearly different behavior with
respect to the a {\Lambda}CDM model with the same power spectrum normalization, proving that different
expansion histories and growth rates produce a clear signature on peak properties. Our analysis
underscores the point that weak lensing peak statistics represent an important tool for disentangling
dark energy models by accurately tracing the structure formation processes as a function of the
cosmic time. We stress its complementary to cosmic shear measurements. [Abridged]
