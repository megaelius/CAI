NGC 4815 is a populous ~500 Myr open cluster at a Galactocentric radius of 7 kpc observed in the first
six months of the Gaia-ESO Survey. Located in the inner Galactic disk, NGC 4815 is an important tracer
of the abundance gradient, where few intermediate age open clusters are found. We use the survey
derived radial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elemental abundances
for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry out an analysis of cluster properties.
The radial velocity distribution of stars in the cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic
velocity and derive likely cluster membership for stars observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey. We investigate
the distributions of Fe and Fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, and the light elements Na and Al and
characterize the cluster's internal chemical homogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial
velocity non-member stars. Utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude
diagram is analyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening, distance,
and age. NGC 4815 is found to have a mean [Fe/H]=+0.03. Elemental abundances of cluster members show
typically small internal variation, with internal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [Ca/Fe] and [Si/Fe]
show solar ratios, but [Mg/Fe] is moderately enhanced, while [Ti/Fe] appears slightly deficient.
As with many open clusters, [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] are enhanced, [Na/Fe] significantly so, although
the role of internal mixing and the assumption of LTE in the analysis remain to be investigated. From
isochrone fits to color-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 Gyr, a reddening
of E(B-V) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-M) = 11.95 to 12.20, depending on the choice
of theoretical models, leading to a Galactocentric distance of 6.9 kpc.
