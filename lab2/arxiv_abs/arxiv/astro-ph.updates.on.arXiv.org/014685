Following our study of the radio and high-energy properties of $\gamma$-ray-emitting radio galaxies,
here we investigate the kinematic and spectral properties of the parsec-scale jets of radio galaxies
that have not yet been detected by Fermi-LAT. We take advantage of the regular VLBI observations
provided by the TANAMI monitoring program, and explore the kinematic properties of six $\gamma$-ray-faint
radio galaxies. We include publicly available VLBI kinematics of $\gamma$-ray-quiet radio galaxies
monitored by the MOJAVE program and perform a Fermi-LAT analysis, deriving upper limits. We combine
these results with those from our previous paper to construct the largest sample of radio galaxies
with combined VLBI and $\gamma$-ray measurements to date. We find superluminal motion up to $\beta_\mathrm{app}=3.6$
in the jet of PKS 2153$-$69. We find a clear trend of higher apparent speed as a function of distance
from the jet core on scales of $\sim10^5\,R_s$, corresponding to the end of the collimation and acceleration
zone in nearby radio galaxies. We find evidence of subluminal apparent motion in the jets of PKS 1258$-$321
and IC 4296, and no measurable motion for PKS 1549$-$79, PKS 1733$-$565 and PKS 2027$-$308. We compare
the VLBI properties of $\gamma$-ray-detected and undetected radio galaxies, and find significantly
different distributions of median core flux density, and, possibly, of median core brightness
temperature. We find a significant correlation between median core flux density and $\gamma$-ray
flux, but no correlation with typical Doppler boosting indicators such as median core brightness
temperature and core dominance. Our study suggests that high-energy emission from radio galaxies
is related to parsec-scale radio emission from the inner jet, but is not driven by Doppler boosting
effects, in contrast to the situation in their blazar counterparts.
