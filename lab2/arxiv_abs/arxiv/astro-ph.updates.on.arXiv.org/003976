The fragmentation of filaments in molecular clouds has attracted a lot of attention as there seems
to be a relation between the evolution of filaments and star formation. The study of the fragmentation
process has been motivated by simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies
have analysed the evolution of filaments using numerical simulations where the filaments form
self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the early evolution of pc-scale filaments
that form within individual clouds. We focus on three questions: How do the line masses of filaments
evolve? How and when do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line masses
of the filaments? We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in kpc-scale numerical simulations
performed with the FLASH code. We compare the properties of the identified filaments with the predictions
of analytic filament stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the identified
filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity. The first fragments appear early
when the line masses lie well below the critical line mass of Ostriker's hydrostatic equilibrium
solution. The average line masses of filaments identified in 3D density cubes increases far more
quickly than those identified in 2D column density maps. Our results suggest that hydrostatic or
dynamic compression from the surrounding cloud has a significant impact on the early dynamical
evolution of filaments. A simple model of an isolated, isothermal cylinder may not provide a good
approach for fragmentation analysis. Caution must be exercised in interpreting distributions
of properties of filaments identified in column density maps, especially in the case of low-mass
filaments. Comparing or combining results from studies that use different filament finding techniques
is strongly discouraged.
