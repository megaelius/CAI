Recent transmission spectroscopy has revealed that clouds and hazes are common in the atmospheres
of close-in exoplanets. In this study, using the photochemical, microphysical, and transmission
spectrum models for close-in warm ($\lesssim$ 1000 K) exoplanet atmospheres that we newly developed
in our preceding paper (Kawashima & Ikoma 2018), we investigate the vertical distributions of haze
particles and gaseous species and the resultant transmission spectra over wide ranges of the model
parameters including UV irradiation intensity, metallicity, carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O),
eddy diffusion coefficient, and temperature. The sensitivity to metallicity is of particular
interest. We find that a rise in metallicity leads basically to reducing the photodissociation
rates of the hydrocarbons and therefore the haze monomer production rates. This is due to an enhanced
photon-shielding effect by the major photon absorbers such as $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$,
$\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\mathrm{O_2}$, existing at higher altitudes than the hydrocarbons. We
also find that at relatively short wavelengths ($\lesssim$ 2-3 $\mu$m), the absorption features
in transmission spectra are most pronounced for moderate metallicities such as 100 times the solar
metallicity, whereas the lower the metallicity the stronger the absorption features at relatively
long wavelengths ($\gtrsim$ 2-3 $\mu$m), where the contribution of haze is small. These are because
of the two competing effects of reduced haze production rate and atmospheric scale height for higher
metallicities. For the other model parameters, we show that stronger absorption features appear
in transmission spectra of the atmospheres with lower UV irradiation, lower C/O ratio, higher eddy
diffusion coefficient, and higher temperature.
