The variety of observed protoplanetary disks in polarimetric light motivates a taxonomical study
to constrain their evolution and establish the current framework of this type of observations.
We classified 58 disks with available polarimetric observations into six major categories (Ring,
Spiral, Giant, Rim, Faint, and Small disks) based on their appearance in scattered light. We re-calculated
the stellar and disk properties from the newly available GAIA DR2 and related these properties with
the disk categories. More than a half of our sample shows disk sub-structures. For the remaining
sources, the absence of detected features is due to their faintness, to their small size, or to the
disk geometry. Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically host no cavity.
There is a possible dichotomy in the near-IR excess of sources with spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks
(low). Like spirals, shadows are associated with a high near-IR excess. If we account for the pre-main
sequence evolutionary timescale of stars with different mass, spiral arms are likely associated
to old disks. We also found a loose, shallow declining trend for the disk dust mass with time. Protoplanetary
disks may form sub-structures like rings very early in their evolution but their detectability
in scattered light is limited to relatively old sources (more than 5 Myr) where the recurrently detected
disk cavities allow to illuminate the outer disk. The shallow decrease of disk mass with time might
be due to a selection effect, where disks observed thus far in scattered light are typically massive,
bright transition disks with longer lifetime than most disks. Our study points toward spirals and
shadows being generated by planets of fraction-to-few Jupiter masses that leave their (observed)
imprint on both the inner disk near the star and the outer disk cavity.
