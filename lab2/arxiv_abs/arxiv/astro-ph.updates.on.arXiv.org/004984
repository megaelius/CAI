Variations and spatial distributions of bright and dark material on dwarf planet Ceres play a key
role in understanding the processes that have led to its present surface composition. We define
limits for bright and dark material in order to distinguish them consistently, based on the reflectance
of the average surface using Dawn Framing Camera data. A systematic classification of four types
of bright material is presented based on their spectral properties, composition, spatial distribution,
and association with specific geomorphological features. We found obvious correlations of reflectance
with spectral shape (slopes) and age; however, this is not unique throughout the bright spots. Although
impact features show generally more extreme reflectance variations, several areas can only be
understood in terms of inhomogeneous distribution of composition as inferred from Dawn Visible
and Infrared Spectrometer data. Additional material with anomalous composition and spectral
properties are rare. The identification of the composition and origin of the dark, particularly
the darkest material, remains to be explored. The spectral properties and the morphology of the
dark sites suggest an endogenic origin, but it is not clear whether they are more or less primitive
surficial exposures or excavated subsurface but localized material. The reflectance, spectral
properties, inferred composition, and geologic context collectively suggest that the bright
and dark material tends to gradually change toward the average surface over time. This could be because
of multiple processes, i.e., impact gardening/space weathering, and lateral mixing, including
thermal and aqueous alteration, accompanied by changes in composition and physical properties
such as grain size, surface temperature, and porosity (compaction).
