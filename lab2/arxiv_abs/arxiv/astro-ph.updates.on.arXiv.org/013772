During the New Horizons spacecraft's encounter with Pluto, the Alice ultraviolet spectrograph
conducted a series of observations that detected emissions from both the interplanetary medium
(IPM) and Pluto. In the direction of Pluto, the IPM was found to be 133.4$\pm$0.6R at Lyman $\alpha$,
0.24$\pm$0.02R at Lyman $\beta$, and <0.10R at He I 584{\AA}. We analyzed 3,900s of data obtained
shortly before closest approach to Pluto and detect airglow emissions from H I, N I, N II, N$_2$, and
CO above the disk of Pluto. We find Pluto's brightness at Lyman $\alpha$ to be $29.3\pm1.9$R, in good
agreement with pre-encounter estimates. The detection of the N II multiplet at 1085{\AA} marks
the first direct detection of ions in Pluto's atmosphere. We do not detect any emissions from noble
gasses and place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.14 R on the brightness of the Ar I 1048{\AA} line. We compare
pre-encounter model predictions and predictions from our own airglow model, based on atmospheric
profiles derived from the solar occultation observed by New Horizons, to the observed brightness
of Pluto's airglow. Although completely opaque at Lyman $\alpha$, Pluto's atmosphere is optically
thin at wavelengths longer than 1425{\AA}. Consequently, a significant amount of solar FUV light
reaches the surface, where it can participate in space weathering processes. From the brightness
of sunlight reflected from Pluto, we find the surface has a reflectance factor (I/F) of 17% between
1400-1850{\AA}. We also report the first detection of an C$_3$ hydrocarbon molecule, methylacetylene,
in absorption, at a column density of ~5$\times10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, corresponding to a column-integrated
mixing ratio of $1.6\times10^{-6}$.
