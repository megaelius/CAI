We present near-infrared spectroscopic analysis of 12 red giant members of the Galactic open cluster
NGC 6940. High-resolution (R$\simeq$45000) and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100) near-infrared
H and K band spectra were gathered with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on
the 2.7m Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory. We obtained abundances of H-burning (C, N, O),
${\alpha}$ (Mg, Si, S, Ca), light odd-Z (Na, Al, P, K), Fe-group (Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni) and neutron-capture
(Ce, Nd, Yb) elements. We report the abundances of S, P, K, Ce, and Yb in NGC 6940 for the first time.
Many OH and CN features in the H band were used to obtain O and N abundances. C abundances were measured
from four different features: CO molecular lines in the K band, high excitation C I lines present
in both near-infrared and optical, CH and $C_2$ bands in the optical region. We have also determined
$^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios from the R-branch band heads of first overtone (2-0) and (3-1) $^{12}CO$
(2-0) $^{13}CO$ lines near 23440 $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$ and (3-1) $^{13}CO$
lines at about 23730 $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$. We have also investigated the
HF feature at 23358.3 $\overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$, finding solar fluorine abundances
without ruling out a slight enhancement. For some elements (such as the ${\alpha}$ group), IGRINS
data yield more internally self-consistent abundances. We also revisited the CMD of NGC 6940 by
determining the most probable cluster members using Gaia DR2. Finally, we applied Victoria isochrones
and MESA models in order to refine our estimates of the evolutionary stages of our targets.
