In the MW bulge, metal-rich stars form a strong bar and are more peanut-shaped than metal-poor stars.
It has been recently claimed that this behavior is driven by the initial in-plane radial velocity
dispersion of these populations, rather than by their initial vertical random motions. This has
led to the suggestion that a thick disc is not necessary to explain the characteristics of the MW bulge.
We rediscuss this issue by analyzing two dissipationless N-body simulations of boxy/peanut (b/p)-shaped
bulges formed from composite stellar discs, made of kinematically cold and hot stellar populations,
and we conclude that initial vertical random motions are as important as in-plane random motions
in determining the relative contribution of cold and hot disc populations with height above the
plane, the metallicity and age trends. Previous statements emphasizing the dominant role of in-plane
motions in determining these trends are not confirmed. However, differences exist in the morphology
and strength of the resulting b/p-shaped bulges: a model where disc populations have initially
only different in-plane random motions, but similar thickness, results into a b/p bulge where all
populations have a similar peanut shape, independently on their initial kinematics, or metallicity.
We discuss the reasons behind these differences, and also predict the signatures that these two
extreme initial conditions would leave on the vertical age and metallicity gradients of disc stars,
outside the bulge region. We conclude that a metal-poor, kinematically (radial and vertical) hot
component, that is a thick disc, is necessary in the MW before bar formation, supporting the scenario
traced in previous works. [abridged]
