Small-scale waves were observed along the boundary between Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt and
North Tropical Zone, ~16.5{\deg} N planetographic latitude in Hubble Space Telescope data in 2012
and throughout 2015 to 2018, observable at all wavelengths from the UV to the near IR. At peak visibility,
the waves have sufficient contrast (~10%) to be observed from ground-based telescopes. They have
a typical wavelength of about 1.2{\deg} (1400 km), variable-length wave trains, and westward phase
speeds of a few m/s or less. New analysis of Voyager 2 data shows similar wave trains over at least 300
hours. Some waves appear curved when over cyclones and anticyclones, but most are straight, but
tilted, shifting in latitude as they pass vortices. Based on their wavelengths, phase speeds, and
faint appearance at high-altitude sensitive passbands, the observed NEB waves are consistent
with inertia-gravity waves at the 500-mbar pressure level, though formation altitude is not well
constrained. Preliminary General Circulation Model simulations generate inertia-gravity waves
from vortices interacting with the environment and can reproduce the observed wavelengths and
orientations. Several mechanisms can generate these waves, and all may contribute: geostrophic
adjustment of cyclones; cyclone/anticyclone interactions; wind interactions with obstructions
or heat pulses from convection; or changing vertical wind shear. However, observations also show
that the presence of vortices and/or regions of convection are not sufficient by themselves for
wave formation, implying that a change in vertical structure may affect their stability, or that
changes in haze properties may affect their visibility.
