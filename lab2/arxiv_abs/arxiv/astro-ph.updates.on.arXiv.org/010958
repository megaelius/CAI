Unveiling the evolution of toroidal field instability, known as Tayler instability, is essential
to understand the strength and topology of the magnetic fields observed in early-type stars, in
the isothermal core of the red giants, or in any stellar radiative zone. We want to study the non-linear
evolution of the instability of a toroidal field stored in a stably stratified stellar interior
in spherical symmetry in the absence of rotation. In particular, we intend to quantify the suppression
of the instability as a function of the Brunt-V\"ais\"ala ($\omega_{\rm BV}$) and the Alfv\'en
($\omega_{\rm A}$) frequencies. We use the MHD equations as implemented in the anelastic approximation
in the EULAG-MHD code and perform a large series of high-resolution numerical simulations of the
instability exploring the parameter space for the $\omega_{\rm BV}$ and $\omega_{\rm A}$. We show
that beyond a critical value gravity strongly suppress the instability, in agreement with the linear
analysis. The intensity of the initial field also plays an important role, as weaker fields show
much slower growth rates. Moreover, in the case of very low gravity, the fastest growing modes have
a large characteristic radial scale, at variance with the case of strong gravity, where modes with
small radial scale are excited too. In particular, the number of growing radial modes ranges from
$k_r\approx 1$ to $k_r\approx 18$ depending on the gravity and the magnetic field strength. Our
results illustrate that the anelastic approximation can efficiently describe the evolution of
toroidal field instability in realistic stellar interiors. Moreover, the suppression of the instability
as a consequence of increasing values of $\omega_{\rm BV}$ might play a role to explain the magnetic
desert in Ap/Bp stars, since weak fields are only marginally unstable in the case of strong gravity.
