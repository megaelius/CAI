The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) presents the opportunity to transform our understanding
of planets and the origins of life by revealing the atmospheric compositions, structures, and dynamics
of transiting exoplanets in unprecedented detail. However, the high-precision, time-series
observations required for such investigations have unique technical challenges, and prior experience
with other facilities indicates that there will be a steep learning curve when JWST becomes operational.
In this paper we describe the science objectives and detailed plans of the Transiting Exoplanet
Community Early Release Science (ERS) Program, which is a recently approved program for JWST observations
early in Cycle 1. The goal of this project, for which the obtained data will have no exclusive access
period, is to accelerate the acquisition and diffusion of technical expertise for transiting exoplanet
observations with JWST, while also providing a compelling set of representative datasets that
will enable immediate scientific breakthroughs. The Transiting Exoplanet Community ERS Program
will exercise the time-series modes of all four JWST instruments that have been identified as the
consensus highest priorities, observe the full suite of transiting planet characterization geometries
(transits, eclipses, and phase curves), and target planets with host stars that span an illustrative
range of brightnesses. The observations in this program were defined through an inclusive and transparent
process that had participation from JWST instrument experts and international leaders in transiting
exoplanet studies. Community engagement in the project will be centered on a two-phase Data Challenge
that culminates with the delivery of planetary spectra, time-series instrument performance reports,
and open-source data analysis toolkits in time to inform the agenda for Cycle 2 of the JWST mission.
