Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to cover an extremely broad range of radio luminosities
and the spread of their radio-loudness is very large at any value of the Eddington ratio. This implies
very diverse jet production efficiencies which can result from the spread of the black hole spins
and magnetic fluxes. Magnetic fluxes can be developed stochastically in the innermost zones of
accretion discs, or can be advected to the central regions prior to the AGN phase. In the latter case
there could be systematic differences between the properties of galaxies hosting radio-loud (RL)
and radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs. In the former case the differences should be negligible for objects having
the same Eddington ratio. To study the problem we decided to conduct a comparison study of host galaxy
properties of RL and RQ AGNs. In this study we selected type II AGNs from SDSS spectroscopic catalogues.
Our RL AGN sample consists of the AGNs appearing in the Best & Heckman (2012) catalogue of radio galaxies.
To compare RL and RQ galaxies that have the same AGN parameters we matched the galaxies in black hole
mass, Eddington ratio and redshift. We compared several properties of the host galaxies in these
two groups of objects like galaxy mass, colour, concentration index, line widths, morphological
type and interaction signatures. We found that in the studied group RL AGNs are preferentially hosted
by elliptical galaxies while RQ ones are hosted by galaxies of later type. We also found that the fraction
of interacting galaxies is the same in both groups of AGNs. These results suggest that the magnetic
flux in RL AGNs is advected to the nucleus prior to the AGN phase.
