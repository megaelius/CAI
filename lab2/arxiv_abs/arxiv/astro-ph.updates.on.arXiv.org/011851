Mass-radius relationships for water-rich terrestrial planets are usually calculated assuming
most water is present in condensed (either liquid or solid) form. Planet density estimates are then
compared to these mass-radius relationships even when these planets are more irradiated than the
runaway greenhouse irradiation limit (around 1.06x the Earth irradiation for planets orbiting
a Sun-like star), for which water has been shown to be unstable in condensed form and should rather
form a thick H2O-dominated atmosphere. Here we use the LMD Generic numerical climate model to derive
new mass-radius relationships appropriate for water-rich terrestrial planets located beyond
the runaway greenhouse limit, i.e. planets endowed with a steam, water-dominated atmosphere.
These new mass-radius relationships significantly differ from those traditionnally used in the
literature. For a given water-to-rock mass ratio, these new mass-radius relationships lead to
planet bulk densities much lower than calculated when water is assumed to be in condensed form. In
other words, using traditional mass-radius relationships for planets that are more irradiated
than the runaway greenhouse limit tends to dramatically overestimate their bulk water content.
In particular, this result applies to TRAPPIST-1b, c and d, that should not have more (assuming planetary
core with a terrestrial composition) than 2, 0.3 and 0.08% of water, respectively. In addition,
we show with the example of the TRAPPIST-1 multiplanetary system that the jumps in mass-radius relationships
(related to the runaway greenhouse transition) can be used to remove usual composition degeneracies
in mass-radius relationships. Finally, we provide an empirical formula for the H2O steam atmosphere
thickness that can easily be used to construct mass-radius relationships for water-rich, terrestrial
planets located beyond the runaway greenhouse limit.
