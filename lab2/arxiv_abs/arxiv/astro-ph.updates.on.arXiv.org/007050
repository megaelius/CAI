Minkowski functionals and Shapefinders shed light on the connectedness of large-scale structure
by determining its topology and morphology. We use a sophisticated code, SURFGEN2, to measure the
Minkowski functionals and Shapefinders of individual clusters by modelling cluster surfaces
using the 'Marching Cube 33' triangulation algorithm. In this paper, we study the morphology of
simulated neutral hydrogen (HI) density fields using Shapefinders at various stages of reionization
from the excursion set approach. Accompanying the Shapefinders, we also employ the 'largest cluster
statistic' (LCS) to understand the percolation process. Percolation curves demonstrate that
the non-Gaussianity in the HI field increases as reionization progresses. The large clusters in
both the HI overdense and underdense excursion sets possess similar values of "thickness" ($T$),
as well as "breadth" ($B$), but their third Shapefinder - "length" ($L$) - becomes almost proportional
to their volume. The large clusters in both HI overdense and underdense segments are overwhelmingly
filamentary. The 'cross-section' of a filamentary cluster can be estimated using the product of
the first two Shapefinders, $T \times B$. Hence the cross sections of the large clusters at the onset
of percolation do not vary much with volume and their sizes only differ in terms of their lengths.
This feature appears more vividly in HI overdense regions than in underdense regions and is more
pronounced at lower redshifts which correspond to an advanced stage of reionization. These geometrical
properties of our reionization model can be compared with that of the future observations with the
upcoming low-frequency radio interferometers.
