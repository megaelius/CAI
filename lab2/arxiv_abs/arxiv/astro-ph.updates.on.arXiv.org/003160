Ionized outflows in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to influence their nuclear and local
galactic environment. However, the distance of the outflows with respect to the central engine
is poorly constrained, which limits our understanding of their kinetic power as a cosmic feedback
channel. Therefore, the impact of AGN outflows on their host galaxies is uncertain. However, when
the density of the outflows is known, their distance can be immediately obtained from their modelled
ionization parameter. With the new self-consistent PhotoIONization (PION) model in the SPEX code,
we are able to calculate detailed level populations, including the ground and metastable levels.
This enables us to determine under what physical conditions the metastable levels are significantly
populated. We then identify characteristic lines from these metastable levels in the 1 -- 2000 \AA
wavelength range. In the large density range of n_H \in (10^6, 10^{20) m^{-3}, the metastable levels
2s 2p (^3P_{0-2}) in Be-like ions can be significantly populated. For B-like ions, merely the first
excited level 2s^2 2p (^2P_{3/2}) can be used as a density probe. For C-like ions, the first two excited
levels 2s^2 2p^2 (^3P_1 and ^3P_2) are better density probes than the next two excited levels 2s^2
2p^2 (^1S_0 and ^1D_2). Different ions in the same isoelectronic sequence cover not only a wide range
of ionization parameter, but also a wide range of density. On the other hand, within the same isonuclear
sequence, less ionized ions probe lower density and smaller ionization parameter. Finally, we
re-analyzed the high-resolution grating spectra of NGC 5548 observed with Chandra in January 2002,
using a set of PION components to account for the ionized outflow. We derive lower (or upper) limits
of plasma density in five out of six PION components, based on the presence (or absence) of the metastable
absorption lines.
