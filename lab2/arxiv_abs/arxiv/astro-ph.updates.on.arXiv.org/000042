Nova Mon 2012 was the first classical nova to be detected as a high energy $\gamma$-ray transient,
by Fermi-LAT, before its optical discovery. We study a time sequence of high resolution optical
echelle spectra (Nordic Optical Telescope) and contemporaneous NOT, STIS UV, and CHIRON echelle
spectra (Nov 20/21/22). We use [O III] and H$\beta$ line fluxs to constrain the properties of the
ejecta. We derive the structure from the optical and UV line profiles and compare our measured line
fluxes for with predictions using Cloudy with abundances from other ONe novae. Mon 2012 is confirmed
as an ONe nova. We find E(B-V)=0.85$\pm$0.05 and hydrogen column density $\approx 5\times 10^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$. The corrected continuum luminosity is nearly the same in the entire observed energy
range as V1974 Cyg, V382 Mon, and Nova LMC 2000 at the same epoch after outburst. The distance, about
3.6 kpc, is quite similar to V1974 Cyg. The line profiles can be modeled using an axisymmetric bipolar
geometry for the ejecta with various inclinations of the axis to the line of sight, 60 \le i \le 80 degrees,
an opening angle of \approx$70 deg, inner radius $\Delta R/R(t)\approx 0.4$ for permitted lines
and less filled for forbidden lines. The filling factor $f\approx 0.1-0.3$ implying M(ejecta)
$\leq 6\times 10^{-5}$M$_\odot$. The ONe novae appear to comprise a single physical class with
bipolar high mass ejecta, similarly enhanced abundances, and a common spectroscopic evolution
within a narrow range of luminosities. The detected $\gamma$-ray emission may be a generic phenomenon,
common to all ONe novae, possibly to all classical novae, and connected with acceleration and emission
processes within the ejecta (abstract severely truncated).
