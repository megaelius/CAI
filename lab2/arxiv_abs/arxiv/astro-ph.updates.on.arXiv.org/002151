We present the Gigaparsec WiggleZ (GiggleZ) simulation suite and use this resource to characterise
the effects of galaxy bias and its scale dependence on the two point correlation function of dark
matter halos for a range of redshifts (z~1.2) and dark matter halo masses (100[km/s]<V_max<700[km/s])
in a standard cosmology. Under the ansatz that bias converges to a scale independent form at large
scales, we develop an 8-parameter model which fully expresses the mass and redshift dependence
of bias and its scale dependence in real or redshift space. Lastly, we use this fitting formula to
illustrate how scale-dependent bias can systematically skew measurements of the growth-rate
of cosmic structure as obtained from redshift-space distortion measurements. When data is fit
only to scales less than k_max=0.1 [h/Mpc], we find that scale dependent bias effects are significant
only for large biases (b>~3) at large redshifts (z>~1). However, when smaller scales are
incorporated (k_max>~0.2 [h/Mpc]), the combination of reduced statistical uncertainties
and increased scale dependent bias effects can result in highly significant systematics for most
large halos across all redshifts. We identify several new interesting aspects of scale dependent
bias, including a significant halo bias boost for small halos at low-redshifts due to substructure
effects (approximately 20% for Milky Way-like systems) and a halo mass that is nearly independent
of redshift (corresponding to a redshift-space bias of approximately 1.5 at all redshifts) for
which halo bias has no scale dependence on scales greater than 3 [Mpc/h]. This suggests an optimal
strategy of targeting bias ~1.5 systems for clustering studies which are dominated more by systematic
effects than statistical precision, such as cosmological measurements of neutrino masses. Code
for generating our fitting formula has been made publicly available.
