Recently, relations connecting the SMBH mass of central galaxies and global properties of the hosting
cluster, such as temperature and mass, were observed. We investigate the correlation between SMBH
mass and cluster mass and temperature, their establishment and evolution. We compare their scatter
to that of the classical $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ relation. We study how gas accretion and BH-BH
mergers contribute to SMBH growth across cosmic time. We employed 135 groups and clusters with a
mass range $1.4\times 10^{13}M_{\odot}-2.5\times 10^{15} M_{\odot}$ extracted from a set of
29 zoom-in cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations where the baryonic physics is treated with
various sub-grid models, including feedback by AGN. In our simulations we find that $M_{\rm BH}$
correlates well with $M_{500}$ and $T_{500}$, with the scatter around these relations compatible
within $2\sigma$ with the scatter around $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ at $z=0$. The $M_{\rm BH}-M_{500}$
relation evolves with time, becoming shallower at lower redshift as a direct consequence of hierarchical
structure formation. On average, in our simulations the contribution of gas accretion to the total
SMBH mass dominates for the majority of the cosmic time ($z>0.4$), while in the last 2 Gyr the BH-BH
mergers become a larger contributor. During this last process, substructures hosting SMBHs are
disrupted in the merger process with the BCG and the unbound stars enrich the diffuse stellar component
rather than increase BCG mass. From the results obtained in our simulations with simple sub-grid
models we conclude that the scatter around the $M_{\rm BH}-T_{500}$ relation is comparable to the
scatter around the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm BCG}$ relation and that, given the observational difficulties
related to the estimation of the BCG mass, clusters temperature and mass can be a useful proxy for
the SMBHs mass, especially at high redshift.
