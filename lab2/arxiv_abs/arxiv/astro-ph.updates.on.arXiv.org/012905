S stars are late-type giants with overabundances of s-process elements. They come in two flavours
depending on the presence or not of technetium (Tc), an element without stable isotopes. Intrinsic
S stars are Tc-rich and genuine asymptotic giant branch (AGB)stars while extrinsic S stars owe their
s-process overabundances to the pollution from a former AGB companion, now a white dwarf(WD). In
addition to Tc, another distinctive feature between intrinsic and extrinsic S stars is the overabundance
of niobium (Nb) in the latter class. We discuss the case of the S stars BD+79 156 and o1Ori whose specificity
is to share the distinctive features of both intrinsic and extrinsic S stars, namely the presence
of Tc along with a Nb overabundance. BD+79 156 is the first clear case of a bitrinsic star, i.e. a doubly
s-process-enriched object, first through mass transfer in a binary system, and then through internal
nucleosynthesis (responsible for the Tc-enrichment in BD+79 156 which must therefore have reached
the AGB phase of its evolution). This hybrid nature of the s-process pattern in BD+79 156 is supported
by its binary nature and its location in the HR diagram just beyond the onset of the third dredge-up
on the AGB. The Tc-rich, binary S-star o1Ori with a WD companion was another long-standing candidate
for a similar hybrid s-process enrichment. However the marginal overabundance of Nb derived ino1Ori
does not allow to trace unambiguously the evidence of a large pollution coming from the AGB progenitor
of its current WD companion. As a side product, the current study offers a new way of detecting binary
AGB stars with WD companions by identifying their Tc-rich nature along with a Nb overabundance.
