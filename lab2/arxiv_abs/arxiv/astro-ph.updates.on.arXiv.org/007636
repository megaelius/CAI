In the present study we analyse the effect of the density dependence of the symmetry energy on the
hyperonic content of neutron stars within a relativistic mean field description of stellar matter.
For the $\Lambda$-hyperon, we consider parametrizations calibrated to $\Lambda$-hypernuclei.
For the $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$-hyperons uncertainties that reflect the present lack of experimental
information on $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$-hypernuclei are taken into account. We perform our study considering
nuclear equations of state that predict two solar mass stars, and satisfy other well settled nuclear
matter properties. The effect of the presence of hyperons on the radius, the direct Urca processes,
and the cooling of accreting neutron stars are discussed. We show that some star properties are affected
in a similar way by the density dependence of the symmetry energy and the hyperon content of the star.
To disentangle these two effects it is essential to have a good knowledge of the equation of state
at supra-saturation densities. The density dependence of the symmetry energy affects the order
of appearance of the different hyperons, which may have direct implications on the neutron star
cooling as different hyperonic neutrino processes processes may operate at the center of massive
stars. For models which allow for the direct Urca process to operate, hyperonic and purely nucleonic
ones are shown to have a similar luminosity when hyperons are included in agreement with modern experimental
data. It is shown that for a density dependent hadronic model constrained by experimental, theoretical
and observational data, the low-luminosity of SAX J$1808.4-3658$ can only be modelled for a hyperonic
NS, suggesting that hyperons could be present in its core.
