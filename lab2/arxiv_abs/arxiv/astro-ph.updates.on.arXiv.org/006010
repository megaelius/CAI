We construct a model for cosmic ray acceleration from protostellar accretion shocks and calculate
the resulting cosmic ray ionization rate within star-forming molecular clouds. We couple a protostar
cluster model with an analytic accretion shock model to calculate the cosmic ray acceleration from
protostellar surfaces. We present the cosmic ray flux spectrum from keV to GeV energies for a typical
low-mass protostar. We find that at the shock surface the spectrum follows a power-law trend across
6 orders of magnitude in energy. After attenuation, the spectrum at high energies steepens, while
at low energies it is relatively flat. We calculate the cosmic ray pressure and cosmic ray ionization
rate from relativistic protons at the protostellar surface and at the edge of the core. We present
the cosmic ray ionization rate for individual protostars as a function of their instantaneous mass
and final mass. The protostellar cosmic ray ionization rate is $\zeta \approx 0.01 - 1$ s$^{-1}$
at the accretion shock surface. However, at the edge of the core, the cosmic ray ionization rate drops
substantially to between $\zeta \approx 10^{-20}$ to $10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. There is a large spatial
gradient in the cosmic ray ionization rate, such that inner regions may experience cosmic ray ionization
rates larger than the often assumed fiducial rate, $\zeta = 3\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. Finally,
we calculate the cosmic ray ionization rate for protostellar clusters over 5 orders of magnitude
of cluster size. We find that clusters with more than approximately 200 protostars produce a higher
cosmic ray ionization rate within their natal cloud than the fiducial galactic value.
