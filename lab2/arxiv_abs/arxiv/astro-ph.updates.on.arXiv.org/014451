Quasars are the most luminous of active galactic nuclei (AGN), and are perhaps responsible for quenching
star formation in their hosts. The Stripe 82X catalog covers 31.3 deg$^2$ of the Stripe 82 field,
of which the 15.6 deg$^2$ covered with XMM-Newton is also covered by Herschel/SPIRE. We have 2500
X-ray detected sources with multi-wavelength counterparts, and 30% of these are unobscured quasars,
with $L_X > 10^{44}\,$erg/s and $M_B < -23$. We define a new population of quasars which are unobscured,
have X-ray luminosities in excess of $10^{44}\,$erg/s, have broad emission lines, and yet are also
bright in the far-infrared, with a 250$\mu$m flux density of $S_{\rm 250}>30$mJy. We refer to these
Herschel-detected, unobscured quasars as "Cold Quasars". A mere 4% (21) of the X-ray- and optically-selected
unobscured quasars in Stripe 82X are detected at 250$\mu$m. These Cold Quasars lie at $z\sim1-3$,
have $L_{\rm IR}>10^{12}\,L_\odot$, and have star formation rates of $\sim200-1400\,M_\odot$/yr.
Cold Quasars are bluer in the mid-IR than the full quasar population, and 72% of our Cold Quasars have
WISE W3 $<$ 11.5 [Vega], while only 19% of the full quasar sample meets this criteria. Crucially,
Cold Quasars have on average $\sim9\times$ as much star formation as the main sequence of star forming
galaxies at similar redshifts. Although dust-rich, unobscured quasars have occasionally been
noted in the literature before, we argue that they should be considered as a separate class of quasars
due to their high star formation rates. This phase is likely short-lived, as the central engine and
immense star formation consume the gas reservoir. Cold Quasars are type-1 blue quasars that reside
in starburst galaxies.
