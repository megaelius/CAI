Based on the SDSS and SDSS-WISE quasar datasets, we put forward two schemes to estimate photometric
redshifts of quasars. The schemes are based on the idea that the samples are firstly classified into
subsamples by a classifier and then photometric redshift estimation of different subsamples is
performed by a regressor, respectively. Random forest is adopted as the core algorithm of the classifiers,
random forest and kNN are applied as the key algorithms of regressors. The samples are divided into
two subsamples and four subsamples depending on the redshift distribution. The performance based
on different samples, different algorithms and different schemes are compared. The experimental
results show that the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for the two schemes generally
improve to some extent compared to the original scheme in terms of the percents in $\frac{|\Delta
z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.1$ and $\frac{|\Delta z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.2$ and mean absolute error. Only given
the running speed, kNN shows its superiority to random forest. The performance of random forest
is a little better than or comparable to that of kNN with the two datasets. The accuracy based on the
SDSS-WISE sample outperforms that based on the SDSS sample no matter by kNN or by random forest. More
information from more bands are considered and helpful to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift
estimation. Evidently it can be found that our strategy to estimate photometric redshift is applicable
and may be applied to other datasets or other kinds of objects. Only talking about the percent in $\frac{|\Delta
z|}{1+z_{i}}<0.3$, there is still a large room to be further improved for the photometric redshift
estimation.
