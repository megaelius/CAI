In previous work, we introduced a new framework to treat large scale backreaction effects due to
small scale inhomogeneities in general relativity. We considered one-parameter families of spacetimes
for which such backreaction effects can occur, and we proved that, provided the weak energy condition
on matter is satisfied, the leading effect of small scale inhomogeneities on large scale dynamics
is to produce a traceless effective stress-energy tensor that itself satisfies the weak energy
condition. In this work, we illustrate the nature of our framework by providing two explicit examples
of one-parameter families with backreaction. The first, based on previous work of Berger, is a family
of polarized vacuum Gowdy spacetimes on a torus, which satisfies all of the assumptions of our framework.
As the parameter approaches its limiting value, the metric uniformly approaches a smooth background
metric, but spacetime derivatives of the deviation of the metric from the background metric do not
converge uniformly to zero. The limiting metric has nontrivial backreaction from the small scale
inhomogeneities, with an effective stress-energy that is traceless and satisfies the weak energy
condition, in accord with our theorems. Our second one-parameter family consists of metrics which
have a uniform Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker limit. This family satisfies all of our assumptions
with the exception of the weak energy condition for matter. In this case, the limiting metric has
an effective stress-energy tensor which is not traceless. We emphasize the importance of imposing
energy conditions on matter in studies of backreaction.
