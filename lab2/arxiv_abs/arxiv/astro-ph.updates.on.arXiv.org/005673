Recent spectroscopic and photometric surveys are providing a comprehensive view of the MW bulge
stellar population properties with unprecedented accuracy. This in turn allows us to explore the
correlation between kinematics and stellar density distribution, crucial to constraint the models
of Galactic bulge formation. GIBS revealed the presence of a velocity dispersion peak in the central
few degrees of the Galaxy by consistently measuring high velocity dispersion in three central most
fields. Due to suboptimal distribution of these fields, all being at negative latitudes and close
to each other, the shape and extension of the sigma peak is poorly constrained. In this study we address
this by adding new observations distributed more uniformly and in particular including fields
at positive latitudes that were missing in GIBS.MUSE observations were collected in four fields
at (l,b)=(0,+2),(0,-2),(+1,-1),(-1,+2). Individual stellar spectra were extracted for a number
of stars comprised between ~500 and ~1200, depending on the seeing and the exposure time. Velocity
measurements are done by cross-correlating observed stellar spectra in the CaT region with a synthetic
template, and velocity errors obtained through Monte Carlo simulations, cross-correlating synthetic
spectra with a range of different metallicities and different noise characteristics. We measure
the central velocity dispersion peak within a projected distance from the Galactic center of ~280pc,
reaching sigma~140 km/s at b=-1. This is in agreement with the results obtained previously by GIBS
at negative longitude. The central sigma peak is symmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, with
a longitude extension at least as narrow as predicted by GIBS. As a result of the Monte Carlo simulations
we present analytical equations for the Rvel measurement error as a function of metallicity and
SNR for giant and dwarf stars.
