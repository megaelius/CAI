The Milky Way, when viewed in the neutral hydrogen line emission, presents large structures called
Galactic supershells (GSs). The origin of these structures is still a subject of debate. The most
common scenario invoked is the combined action of strong winds from massive stars and their subsequent
explosion as supernova. The aim of this work is to determine the origin of 490 GSs that belong to the
Catalog of HI supershell candidates in the outer part of the Galaxy. To know the physical processes
that took place to create these expanding structures, it is necessary to determine their kinetic
energies. To obtain all the GS masses, we developed and used an automatic algorithm, which was tested
on 95 GSs whose masses were also estimated by hand. The estimated kinetic energies of the GSs vary
from $1\times10^{47}$ to $3.4\times10^{51}$ erg. Considering an efficiency of 20% for the conversion
of mechanical stellar wind energy into the kinetic energy of the GSs, the estimated values of the
GS energies could be reached by stellar OB associations. For the GSs located at high Galactic latitudes,
the possible mechanism for their creation could be attributed to collision with high velocity clouds
(HVC). We have also analysed the distribution of GSs in the Galaxy, showing that at low Galactic latitudes,
$|b|<2^\circ$, most of the structures in the third Galactic quadrant seem to be projected onto the
Perseus Arm. The detection of GSs at very high distances from the Galactic centre may be attributed
to diffuse gas associated with the circumgalactic medium of M31 and to intra-group gas in the Local
Group filament.
