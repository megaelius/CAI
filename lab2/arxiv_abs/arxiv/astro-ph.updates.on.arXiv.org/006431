The estimate of the magnetospheric radius in a disk-fed neutron star X-ray binary is a long standing
problem in high energy Astrophysics. We review the magnetospheric radius calculations in the so-called
magnetically threaded disk model, comparing the simplified approach originally proposed by Ghosh
& Lamb (1979) with the revised version proposed by Wang (1987), Wang (1995), and Wang (1997). We show
that for a given set of fixed parameters (assuming also a comparable screening factor of the neutron
star magnetic field by the currents induced on the disk surface) the revised magnetically threaded
disk model predicts a magnetospheric radius that is significantly smaller than that derived from
the Ghosh & Lamb (1979) treatment. For a fixed value of the neutron star magnetic field and a wide range
of mass accretion rates, the inclusion of a large inclination angle between the neutron star rotation
and magnetic field axes ($\chi$$\gtrsim$60 deg) leads to a further decrease of the magnetospheric
radius. To illustrate the relevance of these calculations, we consider, as an example, the case
of the transitional pulsars. During the so-called "high mode" of their sub-luminous accretion
disk state, these sources have shown X-ray pulsations interpreted as due to accretion at an unprecedented
low luminosity level compared to other neutron stars in X-ray binaries. In the context of the magnetic
threaded disk model, we show that accretion at luminosities of $\sim$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (and
thus accretion-driven X-ray pulsations) can be more easily explained when the prescription of
the magnetospheric radius provided by Wang (1997) is used. This avoids the need of invoking very
strong propeller outflows in the transitional pulsars, as proposed in other literature works.
