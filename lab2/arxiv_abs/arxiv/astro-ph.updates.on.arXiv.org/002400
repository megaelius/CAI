Context. Gamma-ray burst (GRBs) afterglows probe sightlines to star-forming regions in distant
star-forming galaxies. Here we present a study of the peculiar afterglow spectrum of the z = 0.889
Swift GRB 140506A. Aims. Our aim is to understand the origin of the very unusual properties of the
absorption along the line-of-sight. Methods. We analyse spectroscopic observations obtained
with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO/VLT at two epochs 8.8 h and 33 h after the burst
as well as imaging from the GROND instrument. We also present imaging and spectroscopy of the host
galaxy obtained with the Magellan telescope. Results. The underlying afterglow appears to be a
typical afterglow of a long-duration GRB. However, the material along the line-of- sight has imprinted
very unusual features on the spectrum. Firstly, there is a very broad and strong flux drop below 8000
AA (4000 AA in the rest frame), which seems to be variable between the two spectroscopic epochs. We
can reproduce the flux-drops both as a giant 2175 AA extinction bump and as an effect of multiple scattering
on dust grains in a dense environment. Secondly, we detect absorption lines from excited H i and He
i. We also detect molecular absorption from CH+ . Conclusions. We interpret the unusual properties
of these spectra as reflecting the presence of three distinct regions along the line-of-sight:
the excited He i absorption originates from an H ii-region, whereas the Balmer absorption must originate
from an associated photodissociation region. The strong metal line and molecular absorption and
the dust extinction must originate from a third, cooler region along the line-of-sight. The presence
of (at least) three separate regions is reflected in the fact that the different absorption components
have different velocities relative to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy.
