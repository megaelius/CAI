Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation show an apparent tension
with the present value of the Hubble parameter inferred from local observations of supernovae,
which look closer, i.e. brighter, than what is expected in a homogeneous model with a value of $H_0$
equal to the one estimated from CMB observations. We examine the possibility that such a discrepancy
is the consequence of the presence of a local inhomogeneity seeded by primordial curvature perturbations,
finding that a negative peak of the order of less than two standard deviations could allow to fit low
red-shift supernovae observations without the need of using a value of the Hubble parameter different
from $H_0^{CMB}$. The type of inhomogeneity we consider does not modify the distance to the last
scattering, making it compatible with the constraints of the PLANCK mission data. The effect on
the luminosity distance is in fact localized around the region in space where the transition between
different values of the curvature perturbations occurs, producing a local decrease, while the
distance outside the inhomogeneity is not affected. Our calculation is fully relativist and non
perturbative, and for this reason is showing important effects which were missed in the previous
investigations using relativist perturbations or newtonian approximations, because the structures
seeded by primordial curvature perturbations can be today highly non linear. Due to non the linear
regime of these structures, the correction to the luminosity distance necessary to explain observations
can happen both in under or over dense regions.
