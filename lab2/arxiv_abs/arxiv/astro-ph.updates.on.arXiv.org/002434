Measuring the volume weighted velocity power spectrum suffers from a severe systematic error,
due to imperfect sampling of the velocity field from inhomogeneous distribution of dark matter
particles/halos in simulations or galaxies with velocity measurement. This "sampling artifact"
depends on both the mean particle number density $\bar{n}_P$ and the intrinsic large scale structure
(LSS) fluctuation in the particle distribution. (1) We report robust detection of this sampling
artifact in N-body simulations. It causes $\sim 12%$ nderestimation of the velocity power spectrum
at $k=0.1$h/Mpc for samples with $\bar{n}_P=6\times10^{-3}$ (Mpc/h)$^{-3}$. This systematic
underestimation increases with decreasing $\bar{n}_P$ and increasing $k$. Its dependence on
the intrinsic LSS fluctuations is also robustly detected. (2) All these findings are expected by
our theoretical modelling in paper I \cite{Zhang14}. In particular, the leading order theoretical
approximation agrees quantitatively well with simulation result for $\bar{n}_P\gtrsim6\times
10^{-4}$(Mpc/h)$^{-3}$. Furthermore, we provide an ansatz to take high order terms into account.
It improves the model accuracy to $\lesssim1%$ at $k\lesssim0.1h$/Mpc over 3 orders of magnitude
in $\bar{n}_P$ and over typical LSS clustering from $z=0$ to $z=2$. (3) The sampling artifact is
determined by the deflection ${\bf D}$ field, which is straightforwardly available in both simulations
and data of galaxy velocity. Hence the sampling artifact in the velocity power spectrum measurement
can be self-calibrated within our framework. By applying such self-calibration in simulations,
it becomes promising to determine the {\it real} large scale velocity bias of $10^{13}M_\odot$
halos with $\sim 1%$ accuracy, and that of lower mass halos by better accuracy.
