EZ Canis Majoris is a classical Wolf-Rayet star whose binary nature has been debated for decades.
It was recently modeled as an eccentric binary with a periodic brightening at periastron of the emission
originating in a shock heated zone near the companion. The focus of this paper is to further test the
binary model and to constrain the nature of the unseen close companion by searching for emission
arising in the shock-heated region. We analyze over 400 high resolution the International Ultraviolet
Explorer spectra obtained between 1983 and 1995 and XMM-Newton observations obtained in 2010.
The light curve and radial velocity (RV) variations were fit with the eccentric binary model and
the orbital elements were constrained. We find RV variations in the primary emission lines with
a semi-amplitude K$_1\sim$30 km/s in 1992 and 1995, and a second set of emissions with an anti-phase
RV curve with K$_2\sim$150 km/s. The simultaneous model fit to the RVs and the light curve yields
the orbital elements for each epoch. Adopting a Wolf-Rayet mass M$_1\sim$20 M$_\odot$ leads to
M$_2\sim$3-5 M$_\odot$, which implies that the companion could be a late B-type star. The eccentric
(e=0.1) binary model also explains the hard X-ray light curve obtained by XMM-Newton and the fit
to these data indicates that the duration of maximum is shorter than the typical exposure times.
The anti-phase RV variations of two emission components and the simultaneous fit to the RVs and the
light curve are concrete evidence in favor of the binary nature of EZ Canis Majoris. The assumption
that the emission from the shock-heated region closely traces the orbit of the companion is less
certain, although it is feasible because the companion is significantly heated by the WR radiation
field and impacted by the WR wind.
