Exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all 5 CANDELS fields, and accurate redshift information
provided by 3D-HST, we investigate the relation between structure and stellar populations for
a mass-selected sample of 6764 galaxies above 10^10 Msun, spanning the redshift range 0.5 < z
< 2.5. For the first time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single Sersic fit and two-component
(i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H-band light distributions, but also to the stellar
mass maps reconstructed from resolved stellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased
bulge prominence among quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical observations,
remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar mass. Moreover, we observe an increase
of the typical Sersic index and bulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming
galaxies above 10^11 Msun. Given that quenching for these most massive systems is likely to be imminent,
our findings suggest that significant bulge growth precedes a departure from the star-forming
main sequence. We demonstrate that the bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass)
is a more reliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than the total
stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model by Somerville
et al. In the latter, bulges and black holes grow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities,
and AGN-feedback shuts off star formation. Further observations will be required to pin down star
formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply they must be internal to the galaxies and
closely associated with bulge growth.
