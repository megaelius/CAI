Chemical disequilibrium in exoplanetary atmospheres (detectable with remote spectroscopy)
can indicate life. The modern Earth's atmosphere-ocean system has a much larger chemical disequilibrium
than other solar system planets with atmospheres because of oxygenic photosynthesis. However,
no analysis exists comparing disequilibrium on lifeless, prebiotic planets to disequilibrium
on worlds with primitive chemotrophic biospheres that live off chemicals and not light. Here, we
use a photochemical-microbial ecosystem model to calculate the atmosphere-ocean disequilibria
of Earth with no life and with a chemotrophic biosphere. We show that the prebiotic Earth likely had
a relatively large atmosphere-ocean disequilibrium due to the coexistence of water and volcanic
H2, CO2, and CO. Subsequent chemotrophic life probably destroyed nearly all of the prebiotic disequilibrium
through its metabolism, leaving a likely smaller disequilibrium between N2, CO2, CH4, and liquid
water. So, disequilibrium fell with the rise of chemotrophic life then later rose with atmospheric
oxygenation due to oxygenic photosynthesis. We conclude that big prebiotic disequilibrium between
H2 and CO2 or CO and water is an anti-biosignature because these easily metabolized species can be
eaten due to redox reactions with low activation energy barriers. However, large chemical disequilibrium
can also be a biosignature when the disequilibrium arises from a chemical mixture with biologically
insurmountable activation energy barriers, and clearly identifiable biogenic gases. Earth's
modern disequilibrium between O2, N2, and liquid water along with minor CH4 is such a case. Thus,
the interpretation of disequilibrium requires context. With context, disequilibrium can be used
to infer dead or living worlds.
