We present detailed studies of a $z=2.12$ submillimeter galaxy, ALESS67.1, using sub-arcsecond
resolution ALMA, AO-aided VLT/SINFONI, and HST/CANDELS data to investigate the kinematics and
spatial distributions of dust emission (870 $\mu$m continuum), $^{12}$CO($J$=3-2), strong optical
emission lines, and visible stars. Dynamical modelling of the optical emission lines suggests
that ALESS67.1 is not a pure rotating disk but a merger, consistent with the apparent tidal features
revealed in the HST imaging. Our sub-arcsecond resolution dataset allow us to measure half-light
radii for all the tracers, and we find a factor of 4-6 smaller sizes in dust continuum compared to all
the other tracers, including $^{12}$CO, and UV and H$\alpha$ emission is significantly offset
from the dust continuum. The spatial mismatch between UV continuum and the cold dust and gas reservoir
supports the explanation that geometrical effects are responsible for the offset of dusty galaxy
on the IRX-$\beta$ diagram. Using a dynamical method we derive an $\alpha_{\rm CO}=1.8\pm1.0$,
consistent with other SMGs that also have resolved CO and dust measurements. Assuming a single $\alpha_{\rm
CO}$ value we also derive resolved gas and star-formation rate surface densities, and find that
the core region of the galaxy ($\lesssim5$ kpc) follows the trend of mergers on the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relationship, whereas the outskirts ($\gtrsim5$ kpc) lie on the locus of normal star-forming galaxies,
suggesting different star-formation efficiencies within one galaxy. Our results caution against
using single size or morphology for different tracers of the star-formation activity and gas content
of galaxies, and therefore argue the need to use spatially-resolved, multi-wavelength observations
to interpret the properties of SMGs, and perhaps even for $z>1$ galaxies in general.
