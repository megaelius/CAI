The vital importance of composition-dependent low-temperature opacity in low-mass (M < 3Msun)
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar models of metallicity Z > 0.001 has recently been demonstrated
(e.g. Marigo 2002; Ventura & Marigo 2010). Its significance to more metal-poor, intermediate
mass (M > 2.5Msun) models has yet to be investigated. We show that its inclusion in lower-metallicity
models ([Fe/H] < -2) is essential, and that there exists no threshold metallicity below which
composition-dependent molecular opacity may be neglected. We find it to be crucial in all intermediate-mass
models investigated ([Fe/H] < -2 and 2.5 < M/Msun < 5), because of the evolution of the surface
chemistry, including the orders of magnitude increase in the abundance of molecule-forming species.
Its effect on these models mirrors that previously reported for higher-metallicity models - increase
in radius, decrease in Teff, faster mass loss, shorter thermally pulsing AGB lifetime, reduced
enrichment in third dredge-up products (by a factor of three to ten), and an increase in the mass limit
for hot bottom burning. We show that the evolution of low-metallicity models with composition-dependent
low-temperature opacity is relatively independent of initial metal abundance because its contribution
to the opacity is far outweighed by changes due to dredge-up. Our results imply a significant reduction
in the expected number of nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor stars, which may help explain their observed
paucity. We note that these findings are partially a product of the macrophysics adopted in our models,
in particular the Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) mass loss rate which is strongly dependent on radius.
