KIC 08626021 is a pulsating DB white dwarf of considerable recent interest, and first of its class
to be extensively monitored by Kepler for its pulsation properties. Fitting the observed oscillation
frequencies of KIC 08626021 to a model can yield insights into its otherwise-hidden internal structure.
Template-based white dwarf models choose a luminosity profile where the luminosity is proportional
to the enclosed mass, $L_r \propto M_r$, independent of the effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$.
Evolutionary models of young white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim$ 25,000 K suggest neutrino
emission gives rise to luminosity profiles with $L_r$ $\not\propto$ $M_r$. We explore this contrast
by comparing the oscillation frequencies between two nearly identical white dwarf models: one
with an enforced $L_r \propto M_r$ luminosity profile and the other with a luminosity profile determined
by the star's previous evolution history. We find the low order g-mode frequencies differ by up to
$\simeq$ 70 $\mu$Hz over the range of Kepler observations for KIC 08626021. This suggests that by
neglecting the proper thermal structure of the star (e.g., accounting for the effect of plasmon
neutrino losses), the model frequencies calculated by using an $L_r \propto M_r$ profile may have
uncorrected, effectively-random errors at the level of tens of $\mu$Hz. A mean frequency difference
of 30 $\mu$Hz, based on linearly extrapolating published results, suggests a template model uncertainty
in the fit precision of $\simeq$ 12% in white dwarf mass, $\simeq$ 9% in the radius, and $\simeq$ 3%
in the central oxygen mass fraction.
