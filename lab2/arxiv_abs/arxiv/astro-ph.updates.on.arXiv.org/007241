The outer solar system provides a unique, quiet vantage point from which to observe the universe
around us, where measurements could enable several niche astrophysical science cases that are
too difficult to perform near Earth. NASA's New Horizons mission comprises an instrument package
that provides imaging capability from ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (near-IR) wavelengths
with moderate spectral resolution located beyond the orbit of Pluto. A carefully designed survey
with New Horizons can optimize the use of expendable propellant and the limited data telemetry bandwidth
to allow several measurements, including a detailed understanding of the cosmic extragalactic
background light; studies of the local and extragalactic UV background; measurements of the properties
of dust and ice in the outer solar system; confirmation and characterization of transiting exoplanets;
determinations of the mass of dark objects using gravitational microlensing; and rapid follow-up
of transient events. New Horizons is currently in an extended mission designed to focus on Kuiper
Belt science that will conclude in 2021. The astrophysics community has a unique, generational
opportunity to use this mission for astronomical observation at heliocentric distances beyond
50 au in the next decade. In this paper, we discuss the potential science cases for such an extended
mission, and provide an initial assessment of the most important operational requirements and
observation strategies it would require. We conclude that New Horizons is capable of transformative
science, and that it would make a valuable and unique asset for astrophysical science that is unlikely
to be replicated in the near future.
