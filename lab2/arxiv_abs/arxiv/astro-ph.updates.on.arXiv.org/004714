We explore cosmological constraints on the sum of the three active neutrino masses $M_{\nu}$ in
the context of dynamical dark energy (DDE) models with equation of state (EoS) parametrized as a
function of redshift $z$ by $w(z)=w_0+w_a\,z/(1+z)$, and satisfying $w(z)\geq-1$ for all $z$.
We perform a Bayesian analysis and show that, within these models, the bounds on $M_{\nu}$ \textit{do
not degrade} with respect to those obtained in the $\Lambda$CDM case; in fact the bounds are slightly
tighter, despite the enlarged parameter space. We explain our results based on the observation
that, for fixed choices of $w_0\,,w_a$ such that $w(z)\geq-1$ (but not $w=-1$ for all $z$), the upper
limit on $M_{\nu}$ is tighter than the $\Lambda$CDM limit because of the well-known degeneracy
between $w$ and $M_{\nu}$. The Bayesian analysis we have carried out then integrates over the possible
values of $w_0$-$w_a$ such that $w(z)\geq-1$, all of which correspond to tighter limits on $M_{\nu}$
than the $\Lambda$CDM limit. We find a 95\% confidence level (C.L.) upper bound of $M_{\nu}<0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$.
This bound can be compared with $M_{\nu}<0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ at 95\%~C.L., obtained within the
$\Lambda$CDM model, and $M_{\nu}<0.41\,\mathrm{eV}$ at 95\%~C.L., obtained in a DDE model with
arbitrary EoS (which allows values of $w < -1$). Contrary to the results derived for DDE models with
arbitrary EoS, we find that a dark energy component with $w(z)\geq-1$ is unable to alleviate the
tension between high-redshift observables and direct measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.
Finally, in light of the results of this analysis, we also discuss the implications for DDE models
of a possible determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy by laboratory searches. (abstract abridged)
