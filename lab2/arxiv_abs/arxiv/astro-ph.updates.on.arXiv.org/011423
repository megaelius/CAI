The detection of clumps(cores) in molecular clouds is an important issue in sub-millimetre astronomy.
However, the completeness of the identification and the accuracy of the returned parameters of
the automated clump identification algorithms are still not clear by now. In this work, we test the
performance and bias of the GaussClumps, ClumpFind, Fellwalker, Reinhold, and Dendrograms algorithms
in identifying simulated clumps. By designing the simulated clumps with various sizes, peak brightness,
and crowdedness, we investigate the characteristics of the algorithms and their performance.
In the aspect of detection completeness, Fellwalker, Dendrograms, and Gaussclumps are the first,
second, and third best algorithms, respectively. The numbers of correct identifications of the
six algorithms gradually increase as the size and SNR of the simulated clumps increase and they decrease
as the crowdedness increases. In the aspect of the accuracy of retrieved parameters, Fellwalker
and Dendrograms exhibit better performance than the other algorithms. The average deviations
in clump parameters for all algorithms gradually increase as the size and SNR of clumps increase.
Most of the algorithms except Fellwalker exhibit significant deviation in extracting the total
flux of clumps. Taken altogether, Fellwalker, Gaussclumps, and Dendrograms exhibit the best performance
in detection completeness and extracting parameters. The deviation in virial parameter for the
six algorithms is relatively low. When applying the six algorithms to the clump identification
for the Rosette molecular cloud, ClumpFind1994, ClumpFind2006, Gaussclumps, Fellwalker, and
Reinhold exhibit performance that is consistent with the results from the simulated test.
