Based on the dynamical black hole (BH) mass estimates, NGC3115 hosts the closest billion solar mass
BH. Deep studies of the center revealed a very underluminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) immersed
in an old massive nuclear star cluster. Recent $1$~Ms \textit{Chandra} X-ray visionary project
observations of the NGC3115 nucleus resolved hot tenuous gas, which fuels the AGN. In this paper
we connect the processes in the nuclear star cluster with the feeding of the supermassive BH. We model
the hot gas flow sustained by the injection of matter and energy from the stars and supernova explosions.
We incorporate electron heat conduction as the small-scale feedback mechanism, the gravitational
pull of the stellar mass, cooling, and Coulomb collisions. Fitting simulated X-ray emission to
the spatially and spectrally resolved observed data, we find the best-fitting solutions with $\chi^2/dof=1.00$
for $dof=236$ both with and without conduction. The radial modeling favors a low BH mass $<1.3\times10^{9}M_\odot$.
The best-fitting supernova rate and the best-fitting mass injection rate are consistent with their
expected values. The stagnation point is at $r_{\rm st}\lesssim1$arcsec, so that most of gas, including
the gas at a Bondi radius $r_B=2-4$arcsec, outflows from the region. We put an upper limit on the accretion
rate at $2\times10^{-3}M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a shallow density profile $n\propto r^{-\beta}$
with $\beta\approx1$ over a large dynamic range. This density profile is determined in the feeding
region $0.5-10$arcsec as an interplay of four processes and effects: (1) the radius-dependent
mass injection, (2) the effect of the galactic gravitational potential, (3) the accretion flow
onset at $r\lesssim1$arcsec, and (4) the outflow at $r\gtrsim1$arcsec. The gas temperature is
close to the virial temperature $T_v$ at any radius.
