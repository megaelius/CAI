Observations of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) fluorescence are a potentially useful tool for measuring
the H$_2$ abundance in exoplanet atmospheres. This emission was previously observed in M$\;$dwarfs
with planetary systems. However, low signal-to-noise prevented a conclusive determination of
its origin. Possible sources include exoplanetary atmospheres, circumstellar gas disks, and
the stellar surface. We use observations from the "Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics
of Low-mass Exoplanet Host Stars" (MUSCLES) Treasury Survey to study H$_2$ fluorescence in M$\;$dwarfs.
We detect fluorescence in Hubble Space Telescope spectra of 8/9 planet-hosting and 5/6 non-planet-hosting
M$\;$dwarfs. The detection statistics, velocity centroids, and line widths of the emission suggest
a stellar origin. We calculate H$_2$-to-stellar-ion flux ratios to compare flux levels between
stars. For stars with planets, we find an average ratio of 1.7$\,\pm\,$0.9 using the fluxes of the
brightest H$_2$ feature and two stellar C IV lines. This is compared to 0.9$\,\pm\,$0.4 for stars
without planets, showing that the planet-hosting M$\;$dwarfs do not have significant excess H$_{2}$
emission. This claim is supported by the direct FUV imaging of GJ 832, where no fluorescence is observed
at the expected star-planet separation. Additionally, the 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of 4.9$\,\times\,$10$^{-17}$
erg$\;$cm$^{-2}\;$s$^{-1}$ from these observations is two orders of magnitude below the spectroscopically-observed
H$_2$ flux. We constrain the location of the fluorescing H$_2$ using 1D radiative transfer models
and find that it could reside in starspots or a $\sim$2500-3000$\;$K region in the lower chromosphere.
The presence of this emission could complicate efforts to quantify the atmospheric abundance of
H$_2$ in exoplanets orbiting M$\;$dwarfs.
