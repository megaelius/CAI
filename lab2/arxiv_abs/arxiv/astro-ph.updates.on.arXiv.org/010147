The wide binary orbit of Proxima Centauri around $\alpha$ Centauri A and B differs significantly
between Newtonian and Milgromian dynamics (MOND). By combining previous calculations of this
effect with mock observations generated using a Monte Carlo procedure, we show that this prediction
can be tested using high precision astrometry of Proxima Centauri. This requires ${\approx 10}$
years of observations at an individual epoch precision of $0.5 \, \mu$as, within the design specifications
of the proposed Theia mission. In general, the required duration should scale as the 2/5 power of
the astrometric precision. A long-period planet could produce a MOND-like astrometric signal,
but only if it has a particular ratio of mass to separation squared and a sky position close to the line
segment connecting Proxima Centauri with $\alpha$ Centauri. Uncertainties in perspective effects
should be small enough for this test if the absolute radial velocity of Proxima Centauri can be measured
to within ${\approx 10}$ m/s, better than the present accuracy of 32 m/s. We expect the required improvement
to become feasible using radial velocity zero points estimated from larger samples of close binaries,
with the Sun providing an anchor. We demonstrate that possible astrometric microlensing of Proxima
Centauri is unlikely to affect the results. We also discuss why it should be possible to find sufficiently
astrometrically stable reference stars. Adequately addressing these and other issues would enable
a decisive test of gravity in the currently little explored low acceleration regime relevant to
the dynamical discrepancies in galactic outskirts.
