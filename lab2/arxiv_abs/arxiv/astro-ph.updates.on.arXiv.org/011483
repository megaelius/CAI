The atmospheres of close-in planets are strongly influenced by mass loss driven by the high-energy
(X-ray and extreme ultraviolet, EUV) irradiation of the host star, particularly during the early
stages of evolution. We recently developed a framework to exploit this connection and enable us
to recover the past evolution of the stellar high-energy emission from the present-day properties
of its planets, if the latter retains some remnants of their primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres.
Furthermore, the framework can also provide constraints on planetary initial atmospheric mass
fractions. The constraints on the output parameters improve when more planets can be simultaneously
analysed. This makes the Kepler-11 system, which hosts six planets with bulk densities between
0.66 and 2.45g cm^{-3}, an ideal target. Our results indicate that the star has likely evolved as
a slow rotator (slower than 85\% of the stars with similar masses), corresponding to a high-energy
emission at 150 Myr of between 1-10 times that of the current Sun. We also constrain the initial atmospheric
mass fractions for the planets, obtaining a lower limit of 4.1% for planet c, a range of 3.7-5.3% for
planet d, a range of 11.1-14% for planet e, a range of 1-15.6% for planet f, and a range of 4.7-8.7% for
planet g assuming a disc dispersal time of 1 Myr. For planet b, the range remains poorly constrained.
Our framework also suggests slightly higher masses for planets b, c, and f than have been suggested
based on transit timing variation measurements. We coupled our results with published planet atmosphere
accretion models to obtain a temperature (at 0.25 AU, the location of planet f) and dispersal time
of the protoplanetary disc of 550 K and 1 Myr, although these results may be affected by inconsistencies
in the adopted system parameters.
