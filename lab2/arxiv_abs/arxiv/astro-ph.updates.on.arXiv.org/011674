We present spectroscopic observations obtained at the {\it Large Binocular Telescope} in the field
of the cluster XLSSJ0223-0436 at $z=1.22$. We confirm 12 spheroids cluster members and determine
stellar velocity dispersion for 7 of them. We combine these data with those in the literature for
clusters RXJ0848+4453 at $z=1.27$ (8 galaxies) and XMMJ2235-2557 at $z=1.39$ (7 galaxies) to determine
the Fundamental Plane of cluster spheroids. We find that the FP at $z\sim1.3$ is offset and { rotated
($\sim3\sigma$)} with respect to the local FP. The offset corresponds to a mean evolution $\Delta$\rm{log}(M$_{dyn}$/L$_B$)=(-0.5$\pm$0.1)$z$.
High-redshift galaxies follow a steeper mass-dependent M$_{dyn}$/L$_B$-M$_{dyn}$ relation
than local ones. Assuming $\Delta$ log$(M_{dyn}/L_B)$=$\Delta$ log$(M^*/L_B)$, higher-mass
galaxies (log(M$_{dyn}$/M$_\odot$)$\geq$11.5) have a higher-formation redshift ($z_f\geq$6.5)
than lower-mass ones ($z_f\leq$2 for log(M$_{dyn}$/M$_\odot$$\leq$10)), with a median $z_f\simeq2.5$
for the whole sample. Also, galaxies with higher stellar mass density host stellar populations
formed earlier than those in lower density galaxies. At fixed IMF, M$_{dyn}$/M$^*$ varies systematically
with mass and mass density. It follows that the evolution of the stellar populations (M$^*/L_B$)
accounts for the observed evolution of M$_{dyn}/L_B$ for M$_{dyn}$$>10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies,
while accounts for $\sim$85\% of the evolution at M$_{dyn}$$<10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. We find no evidence
in favour of structural evolution of individual galaxies, while we find evidences that spheroids
later added to the population account for the observed discrepancy at masses $<10^{11}$ M$_\odot$.
