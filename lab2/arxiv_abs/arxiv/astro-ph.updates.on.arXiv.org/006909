A component of space weather, electron beams are routinely accelerated in the solar atmosphere
and propagate through interplanetary space. Electron beams interact with Langmuir waves resulting
in type III radio bursts. Electron beams expand along the trajectory, and using kinetic simulations,
we explore the expansion as the electrons propagate away from the Sun. Specifically, we investigate
the front, peak and back of the electron beam in space from derived radio brightness temperatures
of fundamental type III emission. The front of the electron beams travelled at speeds from 0.2c--0.7c,
significantly faster than the back of the beam that travelled between 0.12c--0.35c. The difference
in speed between the front and the back elongates the electron beams in time. The rate of beam elongation
has a 0.98 correlation coefficient with the peak velocity; in-line with predictions from type III
observations. The inferred speeds of electron beams initially increase close to the acceleration
region and then decrease through the solar corona. Larger starting densities and harder initial
spectral indices result in longer and faster type III sources. Faster electron beams have higher
beam energy densities, produce type IIIs with higher peak brightness temperatures and shorter
FWHM durations. Higher background plasma temperatures also increase speeds, particularly at
the back of the beam. We show how our predictions of electron beam evolution influences type III bandwidth
and drift-rates. Our radial predictions of electron beam speed and expansion can be tested by the
upcoming in situ electron beam measurements made by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe.
