The abundance and narrow magnitude dispersion of Red Clump (RC) stars make them a popular candidate
for mapping the morphology of the bulge region of the Milky Way. Using a semi-analytic derivation
of the RC's intrinsic luminosity function, we extracted the three-dimensional density distribution
of the RC from deep photometric catalogues of the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey.
We employed a joint approach of parametric modelling and maximum entropy based non-parametric
deconvolution to extract the spatial distribution of the bulge from Ks-band star counts. Assuming
two-fold symmetry over the Galactic plane, we obtained our non-parametric model of the bulge over
the inner 40 by 40 degrees squared region centred on the Galactic centre with curvature minimising
inpainting overcrowded and high extinction regions. Our reconstruction also naturally matches
onto a parametric fit to the bulge outside the VVV region. We incorporated into our background model
an apparent feature behind the bar previously observed in the VVV survey. We found a range of bulge
properties consistent with other recent investigations based on the VVV data. However, our base
model does have less dense X-arms than previous analysis and also retains an asymmetry between the
near and far arms of the X-bulge. Studies of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray Galactic
centre excess suggest that the excess may be traced by Galactic Bulge distributed sources. Building
on the view that the RC sufficiently traces the Galactic bulge morphology, we applied our deconvolved
density in a template fitting analysis of this Fermi-LAT GeV excess and found an improvement in the
fit compared to previous parametric based templates.
