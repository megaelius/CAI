During their formation and early evolution, rocky planets undergo multiple global melting events
due to accretionary collisions with other protoplanets. The detection and characterization of
their post-collision afterglows (magma oceans) can yield important clues about the origin and
evolution of the solar and extrasolar planet population. Here, we quantitatively assess the observational
prospects to detect the radiative signature of forming planets covered by such collision-induced
magma oceans in nearby young stellar associations with future direct imaging facilities. We have
compared performance estimates for near- and mid-infrared instruments to be installed at ESO's
Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), and a potential space-based mission called Large Interferometer
for Exoplanets (LIFE). We modelled the frequency and timing of energetic collisions using \textit{N}-body
models of planet formation for different stellar types, and determine the cooling of the resulting
magma oceans with an insulating atmosphere. We find that the probability of detecting at least one
magma ocean planet depends on the observing duration and the distribution of atmospheric properties
among rocky protoplanets. However, the prospects for detection significantly increase for young
and close stellar targets, which show the highest frequencies of giant impacts. For intensive reconnaissance
with a K band (2.2 $\mu m$) ELT filter or a 5.6 $\mu m$ LIFE filter, the $\beta$ Pictoris, Columba, TW
Hydrae, and Tucana-Horologium associations represent promising candidates for detecting a molten
protoplanet. Our results motivate the exploration of magma ocean planets using the ELT and underline
the importance of space-based direct imaging facilities to investigate and characterize planet
formation and evolution in the solar vicinity.
