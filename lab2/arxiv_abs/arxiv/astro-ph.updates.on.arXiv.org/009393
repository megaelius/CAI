Aerosols appear to be ubiquitous in close-in gas giant atmospheres, and disequilibrium chemistry
likely impacts the emergent spectra of these planets. Lofted aerosols and disequilibrium chemistry
are caused by vigorous vertical mixing in these heavily irradiated atmospheres. Here we numerically
and analytically investigate how vertical mixing should change over the parameter space of spin-synchronized
gas giants. We develop an analytic theory to predict vertical velocities and mixing rates ($K_{zz}$).
We find that both our theory and numerical simulations predict that, if the vertical mixing is described
by an eddy diffusivity, then this eddy diffusivity $K_{zz}$ should increase with increasing equilibrium
temperature, decreasing frictional drag strength, and increasing chemical loss timescales.
We conduct numerical simulations to investigate how vertical mixing depends on planetary parameters
with two types of passive tracers, one representing chemical relaxation and one representing particles
that settle. We find that the transition in our numerical simulations between circulation dominated
by a superrotating jet and that with solely day-to-night flow causes a marked change in the vertical
velocity structure and tracer distribution. The mixing ratio of passive tracers is greatest for
intermediate drag strengths that corresponds to this transition between a superrotating jet with
columnar vertical velocity structure and day-to-night flow with upwelling on the dayside and downwelling
on the nightside. Lastly, we present analytic solutions for $K_{zz}$ as a function of planetary
effective temperature, chemical loss timescales, and other parameters, for use as input to one-dimensional
chemistry models of spin-synchronized gas giant atmospheres.
