The rotation states of small asteroids are affected by a net torque arising from an anisotropic sunlight
reflection and thermal radiation from the asteroids' surfaces. On long timescales, this so-called
YORP effect can change asteroid spin directions and their rotation periods. We analyzed lightcurves
of four selected near-Earth asteroids with the aim of detecting secular changes in their rotation
rates that are caused by YORP. We use the lightcurve inversion method to model the observed lightcurves
and include the change in the rotation rate $\mathrm{d} \omega / \mathrm{d} t$ as a free parameter
of optimization. We collected more than 70 new lightcurves. For asteroids Toro and Cacus, we used
thermal infrared data from the WISE spacecraft and estimated their size and thermal inertia. We
also used the currently available optical and radar astrometry of Toro, Ra-Shalom, and Cacus to
infer the Yarkovsky effect. We detected a YORP acceleration of $\mathrm{d}\omega / \mathrm{d}
t = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad}\,\mathrm{d}^{-2}$ for asteroid Cacus. For Toro,
we have a tentative ($2\sigma$) detection of YORP from a significant improvement of the lightcurve
fit for a nonzero value of $\mathrm{d}\omega / \mathrm{d} t = 3.0 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{rad}\,\mathrm{d}^{-2}$.
For asteroid Eger, we confirmed the previously published YORP detection with more data and updated
the YORP value to $(1.1 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad}\,\mathrm{d}^{-2}$. We also updated
the shape model of asteroid Ra-Shalom and put an upper limit for the change of the rotation rate to
$|\mathrm{d}\omega / \mathrm{d} t| \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-8}\,\mathrm{rad}\,\mathrm{d}^{-2}$.
Ra-Shalom has a greater than $3\sigma$ Yarkovsky detection with a theoretical value consistent
with observations assuming its size and/or density is slightly larger than the nominally expected
values.
