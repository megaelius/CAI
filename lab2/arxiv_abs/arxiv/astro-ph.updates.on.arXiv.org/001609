The main criterium for the selection of active objects in the First Byurakan Survey was the presence
of uv-excess on low-dispersion spectra registered on photographic plates obtained with the 1m
Shmidt type Byurakan telescope. Using the presence of emission lines as the second criterium became
possible during the Second Byurakan Survey due to its improved technique. Through this criterium
a majority of objects, extended by morphology, were selected into the separate "sample of galaxies".
Certainly, there were cases of untrue selection, particularly, on faint magnitudes, when absorption
lines were taken for emission ones and so on. Study of SBS galaxies, including evaluation of an effectivity
of selection criteria, was undertaken by means of complex investigation of their very representative
part, pooled in our basic sample. The completion of the follow-up slit spectroscopy of these about
500 objects formed the main stage of implementation of this program. Also, the scheme was developed
to provide homogeneous classification, directed, in particular, to separate galaxies of AGN activity,
of known types, and starforming, SfG, activity. For starforming galaxies, which constitute more
than 80% of the basic sample, we provided two classes, SfGcontinual and SfGnebular. Averaged statistics
of our SfG galaxies show, that every fifth of them is in more active, nebular phase of starforming
activity, most of which are known as blue compact galaxies. However, it must be noted, that, by the
analysis, namely for the latter objects, the effectiveness of the survey is the highest, so that
BCGs represent the best product of SBS among extended objects. Aimed on further specifications
in classification of SfG galaxies, other generalizations and statistics in frames of ongoing investigation,
detailed studies of individual galaxies are currently beeing held, based on data of panoramic spectroscopy.
