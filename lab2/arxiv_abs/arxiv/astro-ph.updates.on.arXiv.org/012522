Context: In our Paper I, by using statistical deconvolution methods, extended kinematics maps
of Gaia-DR2 data have been produced in a range of heliocentric distances that are a factor of two to
three larger than those analyzed previously by the Gaia Collaboration with the same data. It added
the range of Galactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20 kpc to the previous maps. Aims: Here,
we investigate the dynamical effects produced by different mechanisms that can explain the radial
and vertical components of these extended kinematic maps, including a decomposition of bending
and breathing of the vertical components. This paper as a whole tries to be a compendium of different
dynamical mechanisms whose predictions can be compared to the kinematic maps. Methods: Using analytical
methods or simulations, we are able to predict the main dynamical factors and compare them to the
predictions of the extended kinematic maps of Gaia-DR2. Results: The gravitational influence
of Galactic components that are different from the disk, such as the long bar or bulge, the spiral
arms, or a tidal interaction with Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, may explain some features of the velocity
maps, especially in the inner parts of the disk. However, they are not sufficient in explaining the
most conspicuous gradients in the outer disk. Vertical motions might be dominated by external perturbations
or mergers, although a minor component may be due to a warp whose amplitude evolves with time. Here,
we show with two different methods, which analyze the dispersion of velocities, that the mass distribution
of the disk is flared. Despite these partial explanations, the main observed features can only be
explained in terms of out-of-equilibrium models, which are either due to external perturbers or
to the fact that the disk has not had time to reach equilibrium since its formation.
