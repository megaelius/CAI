We have shown that Lyman-$\alpha$ blobs (LABs) may still exist even at $z\sim0.3$, about 7 billion
years later than most other LABs known (Schirmer et al. 2016). Their luminous Ly$\alpha$ and [OIII]
emitters at $z\sim0.3$ offer new insights into the ionization mechanism. This paper focuses on
the two X-ray brightest LABs at $z\sim0.3$, SDSS J0113$+$0106 (J0113) and SDSS J1155$-$0147 (J1155),
comparable in size and luminosity to `B1', one of the best-studied LABs at $z \gtrsim$ 2. Our NuSTAR
hard X-ray (3--30 keV) observations reveal powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) with $L_{2-10{\;\rm
keV}}=(0.5$--$3)\times10^{44}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. J0113 also faded by a factor of $\sim
5$ between 2014 and 2016, emphasizing that variable AGN may cause apparent ionization deficits
in LABs. Joint spectral analyses including Chandra data constrain column densities of $N_{\rm
H}=5.1^{+3.1}_{-3.3}\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ (J0113) and $N_{\rm H}=6.0^{+1.4}_{-1.1}\times10^{22}$
cm$^{-2}$ (J1155). J0113 is likely buried in a torus with a narrow ionization cone, but ionizing
radiation is also leaking in other directions as revealed by our Gemini/GMOS 3D spectroscopy. The
latter shows a bipolar outflow over $10$ kpc, with a peculiar velocity profile that is best explained
by AGN flickering. X-ray analysis of J1155 reveals a weakly absorbed AGN that may ionize over a wide
solid angle, consistent with our 3D spectra. Extinction corrected [OIII] log-luminosities are
high, $\sim43.6$. The velocity dispersions are low, $\sim100$--$150$ km s$^{-1}$, even at the
AGN positions. We argue that this is a combination of high extinction hiding the turbulent gas, and
previous outflows that have cleared the escape paths for their successors.
