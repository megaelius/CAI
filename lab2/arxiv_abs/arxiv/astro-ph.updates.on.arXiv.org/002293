If the neutrino luminosity from the protoneutron star formed during a massive star core collapse
exceeds a critical threshold, a supernova (SN) results. The normalization of this critical threshold
and its dependencies on the parameters of the system remain uncertain. Using spherical quasi-static
evolutionary sequences for many hundreds of progenitors over a wide range of metallicities, we
study how the explosion threshold maps onto observables - (1) fraction of successful explosions,
(2) remnant neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) mass functions, (3) explosion energies (E_SN),
(4) nickel yields (M_Ni) - and their mutual correlations. We show that the neutrino mechanism can
in principle explain the observed properties of SNe and the compact objects they produce. Successful
explosions are intertwined with failures in a complex but well-defined pattern that is not well
described by the progenitor initial mass and is not simply related to compactness. In the context
of single-star progenitors, we show that the neutrino mechanism predicts that at solar metallicity,
initial masses of 15+/-1, 19+/-1, and 21-26 M_Sun are most likely to form BHs, that the BH formation
probability is significantly higher for low metallicity progenitors, and that low luminosity,
low M_Ni SNe come from progenitors close to success/failure interfaces. We qualitatively reproduce
the correlation between E_SN and M_Ni and we predict a correlation between both the mean and width
of the NS mass distribution and E_SN distribution. We use the observed properties of NSs, BHs, and
SN explosions to study the likelihood of many parameterizations of the neutrino mechanism. We find
a distinct region of high probability favoring the existence of failed supernovae. We argue that
the rugged landscape of progenitor structures mandates performing internally consistent simulations
for large sets of progenitors. (Abridged)
