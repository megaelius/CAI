We perform long-term general relativistic neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations (in
axisymmetry) for a massive neutron star (MNS) surrounded by a torus, which is a canonical remnant
formed after the binary neutron star merger. We take into account the effects of viscosity, which
is likely to arise in the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. As the initial
condition, we employ the azimuthally averaged data of the MNS-torus system derived in a three-dimensional,
numerical-relativity simulation for the binary neutron star merger. The viscous effect plays
key roles for the remnant evolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the
first $t\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to a rigidly rotating
state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently becomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity
of the MNS due to the variation of the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS. The shock wave induces significant
mass ejection of mass $\sim(0.5-2.0)\times 10^{-2}M_\odot$ for the alpha viscosity parameter
of $0.01-0.04$. For the longer-term evolution with $\sim 0.1-10$ s, a significant fraction of the
torus material is ejected. The ejecta mass is likely to be of order $10^{-2}M_\odot$, so that the
total mass of the viscosity-driven ejecta could dominate that of the dynamical ejecta of mass $\lesssim
10^{-2}M_\odot$. The electron fraction, $Y_e$, of the ejecta is always high enough ($Y_e\gtrsim0.25$)
that this post-merger ejecta is lanthanide-poor; hence, the opacity of the ejecta is likely to be
$\sim 10-100$ times lower than that of the dynamical ejecta. This indicates that the electromagnetic
signal from the ejecta would be rapidly evolving, bright, and blue if it is observed from a small viewing
angle ($\lesssim 45^\circ$) for which the effect of the dynamical ejecta is minor.
