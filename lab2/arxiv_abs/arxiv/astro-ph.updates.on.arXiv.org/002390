Nuclear stellar cluster (NSCs) are known to exist around massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic
nuclei. Two formation scenarios were suggested for their origin: (1) Build-up of NSCs from consecutive
infall of stellar cluster and (2) Continuous in-situ star-formation. Though the cluster-infall
scenario has bees extensively studied in recent years, the in-situ formation scenario have been
hardly explored. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) calculations to study the effects of star formation
on the build-up of NSCs and its implications for their long term evolution and their resulting structure.
We use the FP equation to describe the evolution of several stellar populations, and add appropriate
source terms to account for the effects of newly formed stars. We show that continuous star-formation
even 1-2 pc away from the MBH can lead to the build-up of an NSC with properties similar to those of the
Milky-way NSC. We also find that the general structure of the old stellar population in the NSC with
in-situ star-formation could be very similar to the steady-state Bahcall-Wolf cuspy structure.
However, its younger stellar population do not yet achieve a steady state. In particular, formed/evolved
NSCs with in-situ star-formation contain differential age-segregated stellar populations which
are not yet fully mixed. Younger stellar populations formed in the outer regions of the NSC have a
cuspy structure towards the NSC outskirts, while showing a core-like distribution inwards; with
younger populations having larger core sizes. In principal, such a structure can give rise to an
apparent core-like radial distribution of younger (up to 2-3 Gyrs) stars, as observed in the Galactic
center. Such an NSC still preserves an underlying stellar cusp of older stars, that can be potentially
be missed by current observations of red-giants.
