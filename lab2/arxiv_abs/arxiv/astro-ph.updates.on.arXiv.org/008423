Optical and infrared continuum polarization from the interstellar medium is known to generally
be due to irregular dust grains aligned with the magnetic field. This provides an important tool
to probe the geometry and strength of those fields, particularly if the variations in the grain alignment
efficiencies can be understood. Here, we examine polarization variations observed throughout
the wall of the Local Bubble, using a large polarization survey of the North Galactic cap (\textit{b}$>30^\circ$)
from \citet{berdyugin2014}. These data are analyzed together with archival photometric and spectroscopic
data along with the mapping of the Local Bubble by \citet{lallement2003}. We can model the observational
data by assuming that the alignment driving mechanism is due to the radiation from the surrounding
star field. In particular we find that the fractional polarization is dominated by the light from
the OB associations within 150 pc of the sun, but is largely insensitive to the radiation field from
red field stars. This behavior is consistent with the expected wavelength dependence of radiative
grain alignment theory. We also probe the relative strength of the magnetic field in the wall of the
Local Bubble using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. We find evidence for a systematically
varying field strength distribution, where the variations in the field are correlated with the
variations in grain alignment efficiency, indicating that the relatively higher field strength
regions might represent a compression of the wall by the interaction of the outflow in the Local Bubble
and the opposing flows by the surrounding OB associations.
