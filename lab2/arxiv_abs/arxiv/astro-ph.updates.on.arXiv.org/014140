Astrophysical simulations of convection frequently impose different thermal boundary conditions
at the top and the bottom of the domain in an effort to more accurately model natural systems. In this
work, we study Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) under the Boussinesq approximation. We examine
simulations with mixed temperature boundary conditions in which the flux is fixed at the bottom
boundary and the temperature is fixed at the top ("FT"). We aim to understand how FT boundaries change
the nature of the convective solution compared to the traditional choice of thermal boundaries,
in which the temperature is fixed at the top and bottom of the domain ("TT"). We demonstrate that the
timescale of thermal relaxation for FT simulations is dependent upon the initial conditions. "Classic"
initial conditions which employ a hydrostatically -- and thermally -- balanced linear temperature
profile exhibit a long thermal relaxation. This long relaxation is not seen in FT simulations which
use a TT simulation's nonlinear state as initial conditions ("TT-to-FT"). In the thermally relaxed,
statistically stationary state, the mean behavior of an FT simulation corresponds to an equivalent
simulation with TT boundaries, and time- and volume-averaged flow statistics like the Nusselt
number and the Peclet number are indistinguishable between FT and TT simulations. FT boundaries
are fundamentally asymmetric, and we examine the asymmetries that these boundaries produce in
the flow. We find that the fixed-flux boundary produces more extreme temperature events than the
fixed-temperature boundary. However, these near-boundary asymmetries do not measurably break
the symmetry in the convective interior. We briefly explore rotating RBC to demonstrate that our
findings with respect to thermal relaxation carry over to this more complex case, and to show the
power of TT-to-FT initial conditions.
