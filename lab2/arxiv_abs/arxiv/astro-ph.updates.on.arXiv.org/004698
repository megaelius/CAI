Flare-prolific active region NOAA 12673 produced consecutive X2.2 and X9.3 flares on 06/09/2017.
To scrutinize the morphological, magnetic, and horizontal flow properties associated with these
flares, a 7-hour time-series was used consisting of continuum images, line-of-sight/vector magnetograms,
and 1600 {\AA} UV images. These data were acquired with the SDO HMI and AIA. The white-light flare
emission differed for both flares, while the X2.2 flare displayed localized, confined flare kernels,
the X9.3 flare exhibited a two-ribbon structure. In contrast, the excess UV emission exhibited
a similar structure for both flares, but with larger areal extent for the X9.3 flare. These two flares
represented a scenario, where the first confined flare acted as precursor, setting up the stage
for the more extended flare. Difference maps for continuum and magnetograms revealed locations
of significant changes, i.e., penumbral decay and umbral strengthening. The curved magnetic polarity
inversion line in the {\delta}-spot was the fulcrum of most changes. Horizontal proper motions
were computed using the DAVE4VM. Persistent flow features included (1) strong shear flows along
the polarity inversion line, where the negative, parasitic polarity tried to bypass the majority,
positive-polarity part of the {\delta}-spot in the north, (2) a group of positive-polarity spots,
which moved around the {\delta}-spot in the south, moving away from the {\delta}-spot with significant
horizontal flow speeds, and (3) intense moat flows partially surrounding the penumbra of several
sunspots, which became weaker in regions with penumbral decay. The enhanced flare activity has
its origin in the head-on collision of newly emerging flux with an already existing regular, {\alpha}-spot.
