Both dark energy models and modified gravity theories could lead to cosmological evolutions different
from either the recollapse into a Big Crunch or exponential de Sitter expansion. The newly arising
singularities may represent true endpoints of the evolution or allow for the extension of geodesics
through them. In the latter case the components of the Riemann tensor representing tidal forces
diverge. Sudden Future Singularities (SFS) occur at finite time, finite scale factor and finite
Hubble parameter, only the deceleration parameter diverges. The energy density of a perfect fluid
is regular and its pressure diverges at the SFS. A particular SFS, the Big Brake occurs when the energy
density vanishes and the expansion arrives at a full stop at the singularity. Such scenarios are
generated by either a particular scalar field (the tachyon field) or the anti-Chaplygin gas. By
adding matter to these models, an unwanted feature appears: at the finite scale factor of the SFS
the energy density of matter remains finite, implying (for a spatially flat universe) a finite Hubble
parameter, hence finite expansion rate, rather then full stop. The universe would further expand
through the singularity, this nevertheless seems forbidden as the energy density of the tachyonic
field / anti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined. This paradox is relieved in the case of the
anti-Chaplygin gas by redefining its energy density and pressure in terms of distributions peaked
on the singularity. The regular cosmological quantities, continuous across the SFS are the energy
density and the square of the Hubble parameter; those allowing for a jump at the SFS are the Hubble
parameter and expansion rate (both being mirror-symmetric). The pressure and the decelaration
parameter will contain Dirac delta-function contributions peaked on the SFS, however they anyhow
would diverge at the singularity.
