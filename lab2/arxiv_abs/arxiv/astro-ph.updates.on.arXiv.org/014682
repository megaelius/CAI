We present Magellan observations of the Swift short GRB 161104A and its host galaxy at $z=0.793 \pm
0.003$. We model the multi-band photometry and spectroscopy with the stellar population inference
code Prospector, and explore the posterior using nested sampling. We find a that the mass-weighted
age $t_m = 2.12^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ Gyr, stellar mass $\log{(M/M_\odot)} = 10.21 \pm 0.04$, metallicity
$\log{(Z/Z_\odot)} = 0.08^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$, dust extinction $A_V = 0.08^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$,
and the star formation rate $\text{SFR} = 7 \times 10^{-2} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. These properties,
along with a prominent 4000 Angstrom break and optical absorption lines classify this host as an
early-type, quiescent galaxy. Using Dark Energy Survey (DES) galaxy catalogues, we demonstrate
that the host of GRB 161104A resides on the outskirts of a galaxy cluster at $z\approx 0.8$, situated
$\approx 1$ Mpc from the likely BCG. We also present new modeling for 20 additional short GRB hosts
($\approx33\%$ of which are early-type galaxies), finding population medians of $\log(M/M_\odot)
= 9.94^{+0.88}_{-0.98}$ and $t_m = 1.07^{+1.98}_{-0.67}$ Gyr ($68\%$ confidence). We further
find that the host of GRB 161104A is more distant, less massive and younger than the four other short
GRB hosts known to be associated with galaxy clusters. Cluster short GRBs have faint afterglows,
in the lower $\approx 11\%$ ($\approx 30\%$) of observed X-ray (optical) luminosities. We place
a lower limit on the fraction of short GRBs in galaxy clusters versus those in the field of $\approx
5-13\%$, consistent with the fraction of stellar mass $\approx 10-20\%$ in galaxy clusters at redshifts
$0.1 \leq z \leq 0.8$. Future studies which take advantage of wider-field and deeper cluster surveys
are needed to understand the true rate of short GRBs in clusters and their effect on heavy element
enrichment in the intracluster medium.
