$\Lambda$-Warm Dark Matter (WDM) has been proposed as alternative scenario to $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter (CDM), motivated by discrepancies at the scale of dwarf galaxies, with less small-scale
power and realized by collisionless particles with energies in the range $1-3$ keV. We present a
new approach to constrain the viability of such WDM models using star formation histories of the
dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Local Group. We compare their high time-resolution star
formation histories (SFHs) obtained with HST-based color magnitude diagrams with the range of
possible collapse redshifts of their dark matter halos expected in CDM and in different WDM scenarios.
The collapse redshift is inferred after determining a plausible infall mass of the subhalo. This
is based on the current mass of individual dwarf inferred from stellar kinematics combined with
results of cosmological simulations providing information on the subhalo evolution. Since WDM
subhalos close to the filtering mass scale form significantly later than CDM, we show that they are
in the first place difficult to reconcile with a truncation of star formation occurring as early
as $z\geq 3$. The Ultra-Faint Dwarfs (UFDs) provide the most stringent constraints. Using 6 UFDs
with the best determination of the SFHs, we show that we can exclude a 1 keV warm particle to a 2-$\sigma$
confidence interval consistently with other methods reported in the literature. For some objects
the $2$ keV model is also excluded. We discuss the various caveats of the method, most notably the
low number of dwarfs with accurately determined star formation histories and the uncertainties
in the determination of the infall mass of the subhalos. Our preliminary analysis serves as a pathfinder
for future investigations that will combine upcoming accurate SFHs for more local dSphs with direct
analysis of WDM cosmological simulations with baryons.
