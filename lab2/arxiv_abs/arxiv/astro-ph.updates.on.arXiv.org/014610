We present an analysis of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 with archive data from SINFONI-VLT, in the
HK bands with pixel scales of 0.1 (data set 1 - DS1) and 0.025 (DS2) arcsec. The data are revisited with
a sophisticated data treatment, such as the differential atmospheric refraction correction and
the application of a Butterworth filtering and deconvolution. The gain in the process is quantified
by a significant improvement in the Strehl ratio and it shows that an unprecedented high spatial
resolution is achieved. For DS1, a detailed study of the H$_{2}$, [Fe II] and [Si VI] emission lines
reveals a three-phase gas morphology: (1) the low-velocity [Fe II] emission representing the glowingwall
of an hourglass structure, (2) the high-velocity compact blobs of low and high ionization emissions
filling the hourglass volume and (3) the distribution of H$_{2}$ molecular gas defines the thick
and irregular walls of a bubble surrounding a cavity. Both the hourglass and the molecular emissions
have an asymmetry caused by the fragmentation of the north-eastern molecular wall, closest to the
active galactic nucleus, resulting in highvelocity compact blobs of ionized gas outside the bubble.
The south-western part of the bubble is excavated by the jet, where the blobs remain confined and
are blown along the bubble's inner boundary. We propose that those blobs are driven by a hot "secondary
wind" coming from the spot where the jet interacts and injects its energy in the molecular gas. The
combination of a primary wind launched by the central source and the secondary wind is what we call
a two-stage outflow. For DS2, we detected a [Si VI] outflow nearly coplanar to the maser disc and orthogonal
to the CO outflow found by a previous study. Such unexpected scenario is interpreted as the interaction
between the central radiation field and a two-phase gas density torus.
