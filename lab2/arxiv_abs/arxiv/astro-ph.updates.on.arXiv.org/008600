In this paper we provide a comprehensive description of the internal dynamics of G0.253+0.016 (a.k.a.
'the Brick'); one of the most massive and dense molecular clouds in the Galaxy to lack signatures
of widespread star formation. As a potential host to a future generation of high-mass stars, understanding
largely quiescent molecular clouds like G0.253+0.016 is of critical importance. In this paper,
we reanalyse Atacama Large Millimeter Array cycle 0 HNCO $J=4(0,4)-3(0,3)$ data at 3 mm, using two
new pieces of software which we make available to the community. First, scousepy, a Python implementation
of the spectral line fitting algorithm scouse. Secondly, acorns (Agglomerative Clustering for
ORganising Nested Structures), a hierarchical n-dimensional clustering algorithm designed
for use with discrete spectroscopic data. Together, these tools provide an unbiased measurement
of the line of sight velocity dispersion in this cloud, $\sigma_{v_{los}, {\rm 1D}}=4.4\pm2.1$
kms$^{-1}$, which is somewhat larger than predicted by velocity dispersion-size relations for
the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). The dispersion of centroid velocities in the plane of the sky are
comparable, yielding $\sigma_{v_{los}, {\rm 1D}}/\sigma_{v_{pos}, {\rm 1D}}\sim1.2\pm0.3$.
This isotropy may indicate that the line-of-sight extent of the cloud is approximately equivalent
to that in the plane of the sky. Combining our kinematic decomposition with radiative transfer modelling
we conclude that G0.253+0.016 is not a single, coherent, and centrally-condensed molecular cloud;
'the Brick' is not a \emph{brick}. Instead, G0.253+0.016 is a dynamically complex and hierarchically-structured
molecular cloud whose morphology is consistent with the influence of the orbital dynamics and shear
in the CMZ.
