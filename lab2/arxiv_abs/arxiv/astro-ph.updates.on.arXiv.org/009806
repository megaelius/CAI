One of the main science goals of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is to uncover the nature
of cosmic acceleration. In the base analysis, possible deviations from the Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter
($\Lambda$CDM) background evolution will be probed by fitting a $w(z)$CDM model, which allows
for a redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state with $w(z)$, within general relativity
(GR). A rich array of other phenomena can arise due to deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM+GR
model though, including modifications to the growth rate of structure and lensing, and novel screening
effects on non-linear scales. Concrete physical models are needed to provide consistent predictions
for these (potentially small) effects, to give us the best chance of detecting them and separating
them from astrophysical systematics. A complex plethora of possible models has been constructed
over the past few decades, with none emerging as a particular favorite. This document prioritizes
a subset of these models along with rationales for further study and inclusion into the LSST Dark
Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) data analysis pipelines, based on their observational viability,
theoretical plausibility, and level of theoretical development. We provide references and theoretical
expressions to aid the integration of these models into DESC software and simulations, and give
justifications for why other models were not prioritized. While DESC efforts are free to pursue
other models, we provide here guidelines on which theories appear to have higher priority for collaboration
efforts due to their perceived promise and greater instructional value.
