Recent ALMA surveys of protoplanetary disks have shown that for most disks the extent of the gas emission
is greater than the extent of the thermal emission of the millimeter-sized dust. Both line optical
depth and the combined effect of radially dependent grain growth and radial drift may contribute
to this observed effect. For a sample of 10 disks from the Lupus survey we investigate how well dust-based
models without radial dust evolution reproduce the observed 12CO outer radius, and determine whether
radial dust evolution is required to match the observed gas-dust size difference. We used the thermochemical
code DALI to obtain 12CO synthetic emission maps and measure gas and dust outer radii (Rco, Rmm) using
the same methods as applied to the observations, which were compared to observations on a source-by-source
basis. For 5 disks we find that the observed gas-dust size difference is larger than the gas-dust
size difference due to optical depth, indicating that we need both dust evolution and optical depth
effects to explain the observed gas-dust size difference. For the other 5 disks the observed gas-dust
size difference can be explained using only line optical depth effects. We also identify 6 disks
not included in our initial sample but part of a survey of the same star-forming region that show significant
12CO emission beyond 4 x Rmm. These disks, for which no Rco is available, likely have gas-dust size
differences greater than 4 and are difficult to explain without substantial dust evolution. Our
results suggest that radial drift and grain growth are common features among both bright and fain
disks. The effects of radial drift and grain growth can be observed in disks where the dust and gas
radii are significantly different, while more detailed models and deeper observations are needed
to see this effect in disks with smaller differences.
