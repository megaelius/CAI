Several observations of stellar jets show evidence of X-ray emitting shocks close to the launching
site. In some cases, the shocked features appear to be stationary, also for YSOs at different stages
of evolution. We study the case of HH 154, the jet originating from the embedded binary Class 0/I protostar
IRS 5, and the case of the jet associated to DG Tau, a more evolved Class II disk-bearing source or Classical
T Tauri star (CTTS), both located in the Taurus star-forming region. We aim at investigating the
effect of perturbations in X-ray emitting stationary shocks in stellar jets; the stability and
detectability in X-rays of these shocks; and explore the differences in jets from Class 0 to Class
II sources. We performed a set of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations
that modelled supersonic jets ramming into a magnetized medium. The jet is formed by two components:
a continously driven component that forms a quasi-stationary shock at the base of the jet; and a pulsed
component constituted by blobs perturbing the shock. We explored different parameters for both
components. We studied two cases: a jet less dense than the ambient medium (light jet), representing
the case of HH 154; and a jet denser than the ambient (heavy jet), associated with DG Tau. We synthesized
the count rate from the simulations and compared with available Chandra observations. Our model
explains the formation of X-ray emitting quasi-stationary shocks observed at the base of jets in
a natural way, being able to reproduce the observed jet properties at different evolutionary phases
(in particular, for HH 154 and DG Tau). The jet is collimated by the magnetic field forming a quasi-stationary
shock at the base which emits in X-rays even when perturbations formed by a train of blobs are present.
We found similar collimation mechanisms dominating in both heavy and light jets...
