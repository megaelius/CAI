We investigate the potential sources of theoretical systematics in the anisotropic Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) distance scale measurements from the clustering of galaxies in configuration
space using the final Data Release (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).
We perform a detailed study of the impact on BAO measurements from choices in the methodology such
as fiducial cosmology, clustering estimators, random catalogues, fitting templates, and covariance
matrices. The theoretical systematic uncertainties in BAO parameters are found to be 0.002 in the
isotropic dilation $\alpha$ and 0.003 in the quadrupolar dilation $\epsilon$. The leading source
of systematic uncertainty is related to the reconstruction techniques. Theoretical uncertainties
are sub-dominant compared with the statistical uncertainties for BOSS survey, accounting $0.2\sigma_{stat}$
for $\alpha$ and $0.25\sigma_{stat}$ for $\epsilon$ ($\sigma_{\alpha,stat} \sim$0.010 and
$\sigma_{\epsilon,stat}\sim$ 0.012 respectively). We also present BAO-only distance scale
constraints from the anisotropic analysis of the correlation function. Our constraints on the
angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, including both statistical
and theoretical systematic uncertainties, are 1.5\% and 2.8\% at $z_{\rm eff}=0.38$, 1.4\% and
2.4\% at $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$, and 1.7\% and 2.6\% at $z_{\rm eff}=0.61$. This paper is part of a set
that analyzes the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods
presented here are cross-checked with other BAO analysis in \citet{Acacia16}. The systematic
error budget concerning the methodology on post-reconstruction BAO analysis presented here is
used in \citet{Acacia16} to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.
