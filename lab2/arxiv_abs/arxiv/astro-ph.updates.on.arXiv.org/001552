We explore the internal structure of red sequence galaxies in the Coma cluster across a wide range
of luminosities ($-17>M_g>-22$) and cluster-centric radii ($0<r_{\rm{cluster}}<1.3
r_{200}$). We present the 2D bulge-disc decomposition of galaxies in deep Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope $u,g,i$ imaging using GALFIT. Rigorous filtering is applied to identify an analysis
sample of 200 galaxies which are well described by an `archetypal' S0 structure (central bulge +
outer disc). We consider internal bulge and/or disc colour gradients by allowing component sizes
to vary between bands. Gradients are required for $30\%$ of analysis sample galaxies. Bulge half-light
radii are found to be uncorrelated with galaxy luminosity ($R_e \sim 1$ kpc, $n\sim2$) for all but
the brightest galaxies ($M_g<-20.5$). The S0 discs are brighter (at fixed size, or smaller at
fixed luminosity) than those of star-forming spirals. A similar colour-magnitude relation is
found for both bulges and discs. The global red sequence for S0s in Coma hence results from a combination
of both component trends. We measure an average bulge $-$ disc colour difference of $0.09\pm0.01$
mag in $g-i$, and $0.16\pm0.01$ mag in $u-g$. Using simple stellar population models, bulges are
either $\sim2$-$3\times$ older, or $\sim2\times$ more metal-rich than discs. The trend towards
bluer global S0 colours observed further from Coma's core is driven by a significant correlation
in disc colour with cluster-centric radius. An equivalent trend is detected in bulge colours at
a marginal significance level. Our results therefore favour environment-mediated mechanisms
of disc fading as the dominant factor in S0 formation.
