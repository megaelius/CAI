Events GW170817 and GRB 170817A provide the best confirmation so far that compact binary mergers
where at least one of the companions is a neutron star (NS) can be the progenitors of short gamma-ray
bursts (sGRBs). An open question for GW170817 remains the impact of the initial NS spins, which can
strongly affect the remnant black hole (BH) mass and spin, the remnant disk and the formation and
lifetime of a jet and its outgoing Poynting luminosity. Here we summarize our general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spinning, NS binaries undergoing merger and delayed collapse
to a BH. The binaries consist of two identical NSs, modeled as $\Gamma=2$ polytropes, in quasicircular
orbit, each with spins $\chi_{\rm{NS}}=-0.053,\,0,\,0.24$, or $0.36$. The stars are endowed
initially with a dipolar magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a radio
pulsar. Following merger, the redistribution of angular momentum by magnetic braking and magnetic
turbulent viscosity in the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant, along with the loss of angular
momentum due to gravitational radiation, induce the formation of a massive, nearly uniformly rotating
inner core surrounded by a magnetized Keplerian disk-like envelope. The HMNS eventually collapses
to a BH, with spin $a/M_{\rm BH} \simeq 0.78$ independent of the initial spin of the NSs, surrounded
by a magnetized accretion disk. The larger the initial NS spin the heavier the disk. After $\Delta
t\sim 3000-4000 M \sim 45-60(M_{\rm NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm ms$ following merger, a mildly relativistic
jet is launched. The lifetime of the jet [$\Delta t\sim 100-140(M_{\rm NS}/1.625M_\odot)\rm ms$]
and its outgoing Poynting luminosity [$L_{\rm EM}\sim 10^{51.5\pm 1}\rm erg/s$] are consistent
with typical sGRBs, as well as with the Blandford--Znajek mechanism for launching jets and their
associated Poynting luminosities.
