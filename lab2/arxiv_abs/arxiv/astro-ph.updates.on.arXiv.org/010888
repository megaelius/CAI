Fundamental parameters are determined for three bright, nearby K-giants, {\beta} Gem (K0 III),
{\mu} Leo (K2 III), and {\alpha} Tau (K5 III). It is notable that around all three stars the giant planets
have been found. Our results are compared with published high-precision data for benchmark stars
included in the Gaia project. Very good agreement was obtained for all three giants with these data
for the basic parameters Teff, logg, and M. Special attention was devoted to analysis of the Fe I lines
which are the basis of a simultaneous determination of the metallicity index [Fe/H] and microturbulent
parameter Vt. The equivalent widths W of the Fe I lines are automatically measured from published
spectra for the benchmark stars. An analysis of Fe I lines from the list of "golden lines" selected
in a study of benchmark stars led to the conclusion that the excitation potential El of the low level
of the lines plays an substantial role in determining [Fe/H] and Vt. It is shown that in the case of
the early K-giants {\beta} Gem and {\mu} Leo for lines in the range of W from 100 to 300 m{\AA} there
is a dependence of the [Fe/H] and Vt values on El. It is shown that a correct accounting for it leads
an ambiguity in the determination of [Fe/H] and Vt for {\beta} Gem and {\mu} Leo. In the case of the
coolest K-giant {\alpha} Tau (Aldebaran) with a temperature Teff = 3920K, this effect seems to be
less pronounced. Recommendations are given for the Fe I lines selection for [Fe/H] and Vt determination.
It is sonfirmed for the example of the three stars studied here that the non-LTE effects in the Fe I
lines for the K-giants with normal metallicity are very minor, so they cannot be the reason of the
revealed ambiguity in [Fe/H] and Vt values. The low ratios of the carbon 12C/13C and oxygen 16O/17O
isotopes confirm that all three giants passed the phase of deep convective mixing.
