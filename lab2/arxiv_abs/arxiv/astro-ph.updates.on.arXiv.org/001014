Several lines of argument support the existence of a link between activity at the nuclei of galaxies,
in the form of an accreting supermassive black hole, and star-formation activity in these galaxies.
The exact nature of this link is still under debate. Radio jets have long been argued to be an ideal
mechanism that allows AGN to interact with their host galaxy and regulate star-formation. In this
context, we are using a sample of radio sources in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field to study the
nature of the putative link between AGN activity and star-formation. This is done by means of spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting. We use the excellent spectral coverage of the AKARI infrared
space telescope together with the rich ancillary data available in the NEP to build SEDs extending
from UV to far-IR wavelengths. Through SED fitting we constrain both the AGN and host galaxy components.
We find a significant AGN component in our sample of relatively faint radio-sources ($<$mJy),
that increases in power with increasing radio-luminosity. At the highest radio-luminosities,
the presence of powerful jets dominates the radio emission of these sources. A positive correlation
is found between the luminosity of the AGN component and that of star-formation in the host galaxy,
independent of the radio luminosity. By contrast, for a given redshift and AGN luminosity, we find
that increasing radio-luminosity leads to a decrease in the specific star-formation rate. The
most radio-loud AGN are found to lie on the main sequence of star-formation for their respective
redshifts. For the first time, such a two-sided feedback process is seen in the same sample. We conclude
that radio jets do suppress star-formation in their host galaxies but appear not to totally quench
it. Our results therefore support the maintenance nature of "radio-mode" feedback from radio-AGN
jets.
