We present high resolution (~ 30 au) ALMA Band 6 dust polarization observations of VLA 1623. The VLA
1623 data resolve compact ~ 40 au inner disks around the two protobinary sources, VLA 1623-A and VLA
1623-B, and also an extended ~ 180 au ring of dust around VLA 1623-A. This dust ring was previously
identified as a large disk in lower-resolution observations. We detect highly structured dust
polarization toward the inner disks and the extended ring with typical polarization fractions
~ 1.7% and ~ 2.4%, respectively. The two components also show distinct polarization morphologies.
The inner disks have uniform polarization angles aligned with their minor axes. This morphology
is consistent with expectations from dust scattering. By contrast, the extended dust ring has an
azimuthal polarization morphology not previously seen in lower-resolution observations. We
find that our observations are well fit by a static, oblate spheroid model with a flux-frozen, poloidal
magnetic field. We propose that the polarization traces magnetic grain alignment likely from flux
freezing on large scales and magnetic diffusion on small scales. Alternatively, the azimuthal
polarization may be attributed to grain alignment by the anisotropic radiation field. If the grains
are radiatively aligned, then our observations indicate that large (~ 100 um) dust grains grow quickly
at large angular extents. Finally, we identify significant proper motion of VLA 1623 using our observations
and those in the literature. This result indicates that the proper motion of nearby systems must
be corrected for when combining ALMA data from different epochs.
