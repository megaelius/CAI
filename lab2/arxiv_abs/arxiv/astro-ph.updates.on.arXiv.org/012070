We construct a SCUBA-2 450-$\mu$m map in the COSMOS field that covers an area of 300 arcmin$^{2}$
and reaches a 1$\sigma$ noise level of 0.65 mJy in the deepest region. We extract 256 sources detected
at 450 $\mu$m with signal-to-noise ratio $>$ 4.0 and analyze the physical properties of their multi-wavelength
counterparts. We find that most of the sources are at $z\lesssim3$, with a median of $z = 1.79^{+0.03}_{-0.15}$.
About $35^{+32}_{-25}$% of our sources are classified as starburst galaxies based on their total
star-formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses ($M_{\ast}$). By fitting the far-infrared spectral
energy distributions, we find that our 450-$\mu$m-selected sample has a wide range of dust temperatures
(20 K $ \lesssim T_{\rm d} \lesssim$ 60 K), with a median of ${T}_{\rm d} = 38.3^{+0.4}_{-0.9}$ K.
We do not find a redshift evolution in dust temperature for sources with $L_{\rm IR}$ > $10^{12}$
$\rm L_\odot$ at $z<3$. However, we find a moderate correlation where dust temperature increases
with the deviation from the SFR-$M_{\ast}$ relation. The increase in dust temperature also correlates
with optical morphology, which is consistent with merger-triggered starbursts in sub-millimeter
galaxies. Our galaxies do not show the tight IRX-$\beta_{\rm UV}$ correlation that has been observed
in the local Universe. We construct the infrared luminosity functions of our 450-$\mu$m sources
and measure their comoving SFR densities. The contribution of the $L_{\rm IR}$ > $10^{12}$ $\rm
L_\odot$ population to the SFR density rises dramatically from $z$ = 0 to 2 ($\propto$ ($1+z$)$^{3.9\pm1.1}$)
and dominates the total SFR density at $z \gtrsim 2$.
