About one fifth of Ph.D's across all STEM disciplines secure a tenure track position in academia.
It is also the case that science and engineering have evolved significantly and so has the nature
of the labor market and the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of the greatest scientific challenges.
These realities, however, have not altered the main objective of graduate STEM education: the training
of unidisciplinary academic researchers. There is therefore a gap between what the students and
society need and what graduate STEM education offers. At root of the problem is not only the lack of
information regarding actual career opportunities but the lack of formation because, as the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recognized in its recent report entitled "Graduate
STEM Education for the 21st Century", "many graduate programs do not adequately prepare students
to translate their knowledge into impact in multiple careers". In that report, the National Academies
of Sciences sets new standards for graduate STEM education, describes the actions required by each
stakeholder, and urges all to strongly commit to this paradigm change. Astro2020 represents an
opportunity for the astronomy and astrophysics community to show this commitment by issuing recommendations
on the redesign of astronomy graduate education following the new guidelines set by the National
Academies of Sciences. By "minding the gap" between expectations and opportunities, keeping in
mind the evolving needs of the STEM workforce, we can better justify the use of tax-payers money with
an investment that allows to do transformative science while conscientiously training highly
qualified STEM professionals able to apply the power of science to problems and opportunities of
generations to come, as envisioned by Vannevar Bush's science as the endless frontier.
