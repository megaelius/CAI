Aims. We aim to determine far-infrared fluxes at 70, 100, and 160$\mu$m of the five major Uranus satellites
Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel and Miranda, based on observations with the photometer PACS-P
aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Methods. The bright image of Uranus is subtracted using
a scaled Uranus point spread function (PSF) reference established from all maps of each wavelength
in an iterative process removing the superimposed moons. Photometry of the satellites is performed
by PSF photometry. Thermophysical models of the icy moons are fitted to the photometry of each measurement
epoch and auxilliary data at shorter wavelengths. Results. The best fitting thermophysical models
provide constraints for important thermal properties of the moons like surface roughness and thermal
inertia. We present the first thermal infrared radiometry longward of 50$\mu$m of the four largest
Uranian moons, Titania, Oberon, Umbriel and Ariel, at epochs with equator-on illumination. Due
to this inclination geometry there was heat transport to the night side so that thermal inertia played
a role, allowing us to constrain that parameter. Also some indication for differences in the thermal
properties of leading and trailing hemispheres is found. We specify precisely the systematic error
of the Uranus flux by its moons, when using Uranus as a far-infrared prime flux calibrator. Conclusions.
We have successfully demonstrated an image processing technique for PACS photometer data allowing
to remove a bright central source. We have established improved thermophysical models of the five
major Uranus satellites. Derived thermal inertia values resemble more those of TNO dwarf planets
Pluto and Haumea than those of smaller TNOs and Centaurs.
