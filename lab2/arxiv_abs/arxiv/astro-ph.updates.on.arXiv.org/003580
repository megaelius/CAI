A Type IIn supernova (SN) is dominated by the interaction of SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium
(CSM). Some SNe IIn (e.g., SN 2006jd) have episodes of re-brightening ("bumps") in their light curves.
We present iPTF13z, a SN IIn discovered by the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and
characterised by several bumps in its light curve. We analyse this peculiar behaviour trying to
infer the properties of the CSM and of the SN explosion, as well as the nature of its progenitor star.
We obtained multi-band optical photometry for over 1000 days after discovery with the P48 and P60
telescopes at Palomar Observatory. We obtained low-resolution optical spectra in the same period.
We did an archival search for progenitor outbursts. We analyse our photometry and spectra, and compare
iPTF13z to other SNe IIn. A simple analytical model is used to estimate properties of the CSM. iPTF13z
was a SN IIn showing a light curve with five bumps during its decline phase. The bumps had amplitudes
between 0.4 and 0.9 mag and durations between 20 and 120 days. The most prominent bumps appeared in
all our different optical bands. The spectra showed typical SN IIn characteristics, with emission
lines of H$\alpha$ (with broad component FWHM ~$10^{3}-10^{4} ~{\rm ~km ~s^{-1}}$ and narrow component
FWHM ~$10^2 \rm ~km ~s^{-1}$) and He I, but also with Fe II, Ca II, Na I D and H$\beta$ P-Cygni profiles
(with velocities of ~$10^{3}$ ${\rm ~km ~s^{-1}}$). A pre-explosion outburst was identified lasting
$\gtrsim 50$ days, with $M_r \approx -15$ mag around 210 days before discovery. Large, variable
progenitor mass-loss rates (~> 0.01 $M_{\odot} \rm ~yr^{-1}$) and CSM densities (~> 10$^{-16}$
g cm$^{-3}$) are derived. We suggest that the light curve bumps of iPTF13z arose from SN ejecta interacting
with denser regions in the CSM, possibly produced by the eruptions of a luminous blue variable star.
