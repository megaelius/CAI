Most time-series models assume that the data come from observations that are equally spaced in time.
However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance,
and climatology, among others. There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series,
such as the continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models are
defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not uncommon in astronomical
time series, that the time gaps between observations are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable
approach to modeling astronomical time series with large gaps between observations should be based
on the solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we propose a novel model
to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented
directly as a discrete-time process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be
represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood estimation based
on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo simulations that the finite sample
performance of the parameter estimation is accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light
curves from periodic variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor
adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been accurately estimated
or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we show how the CIAR model, through its state
space representation, allows unobserved measurements to be forecast.
