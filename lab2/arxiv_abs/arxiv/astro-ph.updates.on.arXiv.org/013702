VV 655, a dwarf irregular galaxy with HI tidal debris, is a companion to the lenticular luminous infrared
galaxy (LIRG) NGC 4418. NGC 4418 stands out among nearby LIRGs due to its dense central concentration
of molecular gas and the dusty, bi-polar structures along its minor axis suggestive of a wind driven
by a central starburst and possible nuclear activity. We seek to understand the consequences of
the ongoing minor interaction between VV 655 and NGC 4418 for the evolution of the LIRG, including
the origin of the gas supply responsible for its unusual nuclear properties. We investigate the
structural, kinematic, and chemical properties of VV 655 and NGC 4418 by analyzing archival imaging
data and optical spectroscopic observations from the SDSS-III and new spectra from SALT-RSS. We
characterize their gas-phase metal abundances and spatially resolved, ionized gas kinematics,
and demonstrate that the gas-phase metallicity in NGC 4418 significantly exceeds that in VV 655.
No kinematic disturbances in the ionized gas are observed along the minor axis of NGC 4418, but we
see evidence for ionized gas outflows from VV 655 that may increase the cross-section for gas stripping
in grazing collisions. A faint, asymmetric outer arm is detected in NGC 4418 of the type normally
associated with galaxy-galaxy interactions. The simplest model suggests that the minor interaction
between VV 655 and NGC 4418 produced the unusual nuclear properties of the LIRG via tidal torquing
of the interstellar medium of NGC 4418 rather than through a significant gas transfer event. In addition
to inducing a central concentration of gas in NGC 4418, this interaction also produced an enhanced
star formation rate and an outer tidal arm in the LIRG. The VV 655-NGC 4418 system offers an example
of the potential for minor collisions to alter the evolutionary pathways of giant galaxies.
