Cosmological models where dark matter and dark energy interact with each other are the general ones
in compared to the non-interacting models since the later can be obtained setting no interaction
in the field equations. The current astronomical data prefer an interaction in the dark regime as
shown in a series of investigations by different research teams. However, a drawback of such models
which we cannot disagree, is that, no one knows how dark matter and dark energy interact with each
other. Thus, there is a complete freedom to choose any specific interaction model by hand but with
the ease of astronomical data we can test their viabilities and finally rule out if they do not fit
with the expansion history. In this work, allowing an exponential interaction between dark matter
and dark energy in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker background, we
explore the dynamical history of the universe through the constraints of the free parameters. Our
analysis shows that although the interaction is exponential, but the observational data allow
a very small coupling strength and can recover the non-interaction scenario within 68\% confidence
level. The dark energy state parameter has been found to be very close to the cosmological constant
boundary `$-1$'. The overall results show that at the background level, our model cannot be distinguished
from the non-interacting $w_{x}$CDM model and the $\Lambda $CDM model while the analysis at the
perturbative level clearly show that the model is distinguished from the $w_{x}$CDM model as well
as from the $\Lambda $CDM model. The notable point in this work that we would like to highlight is that,
the observational data do not seem to allow a strong interaction in the dark sector even if we allow
the dark fluids to interact with each other in an exponential manner.
