At present, tracking data for planetary missions largely consists of radio observables: range-rate
range and angular position. Future planetary missions may use Interplanetary Laser Ranging (ILR)
as a tracking observable. Two-way ILR will provide range data that are about 2 orders of magnitude
more accurate than radio-based range data. ILR does not produce Doppler data, however. In this article,
we compare the relative strength of radio Doppler and laser range data for the retrieval of parameters
of interest in planetary missions, to clarify and quantify the science case of ILR, with a focus on
geodetic observables. We first provide an overview of the near-term attainable quality of ILR,
in terms of both the realization of the observable and the models used to process the measurements.
Subsequently, we analyze the sensitivity of radio-Doppler and laser-range measurements in representative
mission scenarios. We use both an analytical approximation and numerical analyses of the relative
sensitivity of ILR and radio Doppler observables for more general cases. We show that mm-precise
range normal points are feasible for ILR, but mm-level accuracy and stability is unlikely to be attained,
due to a combination of instrumental and model errors. ILR has the potential for superior performance
in observing signatures in the data with a characteristic period of greater than 0.33-1.65 hours
This indicates that Doppler tracking will typically remain the method of choice for gravity field
determination and spacecraft orbit determination in planetary missions. Laser ranging data,
however, are shown to have a significant advantage for the retrieval of rotational and tidal characteristics
from landers. Similarly, laser ranging data will be superior for the construction of planetary
ephemerides and the improvement of solar system tests of gravitation.
