We perform a high-cadence transient survey with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), which we call the
Subaru HSC survey Optimized for Optical Transients (SHOOT). We conduct HSC imaging observations
with time intervals of about one hour on two successive nights, and spectroscopic and photometric
follow-up observations. A rapidly declining blue transient SHOOT14di at $z=0.4229$ is found in
observations on two successive nights with an image subtraction technique. The rate of brightness
change is $+1.28^{+0.40}_{-0.27}~{\rm mag~day^{-1}}$ ($+1.83^{+0.57}_{-0.39}~{\rm mag~day^{-1}}$)
in the observer (rest) frame and the rest-frame color between $3400$ and $4400~\unicode[.8,0]{x212B}$
is $M_{\rm 3400\unicode[.8,0]{x212B}}-M_{\rm 4400\unicode[.8,0]{x212B}}=-0.4$. The nature
of the object is investigated by comparing its peak luminosity, decline rate, and color with those
of transients and variables previously observed, and those of theoretical models. None of the transients
or variables share the same properties as SHOOT14di. Comparisons with theoretical models demonstrate
that, while the emission from the cooling envelope of a Type IIb supernova shows a slower decline
rate than SHOOT14di, and the explosion of a red supergiant star with a dense circumstellar wind shows
a redder color than SHOOT14di, the shock breakout at the stellar surface of the explosion of a $25M_{\odot}$
red supergiant star with a small explosion energy of $\leq0.4\times10^{51}$ erg reproduces the
multicolor light curve of SHOOT14di. This discovery shows that a high-cadence, multicolor optical
transient survey at intervals of about one hour, and continuous and immediate follow-up observations,
is important for studies of normal core-collapse supernovae at high redshifts.
