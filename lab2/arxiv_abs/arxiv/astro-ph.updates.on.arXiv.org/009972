Analysis of the Planck 2018 data set indicates that the statistical properties of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) temperature anisotropies are in excellent agreement with previous studies using
the 2013 and 2015 data releases. In particular, they are consistent with the Gaussian predictions
of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, yet also confirm the presence of several so-called "anomalies"
on large angular scales. The novelty of the current study, however, lies in being a first attempt
at a comprehensive analysis of the statistics of the polarization signal over all angular scales,
using either maps of the Stokes parameters, $Q$ and $U$, or the $E$-mode signal derived from these
using a new methodology (which we describe in an appendix). Although remarkable progress has been
made in reducing the systematic effects that contaminated the 2015 polarization maps on large angular
scales, it is still the case that residual systematics (and our ability to simulate them) can limit
some tests of non-Gaussianity and isotropy. However, a detailed set of null tests applied to the
maps indicates that these issues do not dominate the analysis on intermediate and large angular
scales (i.e., $\ell \lesssim 400$). In this regime, no unambiguous detections of cosmological
non-Gaussianity, or of anomalies corresponding to those seen in temperature, are claimed. Notably,
the stacking of CMB polarization signals centred on the positions of temperature hot and cold spots
exhibits excellent agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, and also gives a clear
indication of how Planck provides state-of-the-art measurements of CMB temperature and polarization
on degree scales.
