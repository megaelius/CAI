Cosmological surveys aim at answering fundamental questions about our Universe, including the
nature of dark matter or the reason of unexpected accelerated expansion of the Universe. In order
to answer these questions, two important ingredients are needed: 1) data from observations and
2) a theoretical model that allows fast comparison between observation and theory. Most of the cosmological
surveys observe galaxies, which are very difficult to model theoretically due to the complicated
physics involved in their formation and evolution; modeling realistic galaxies over cosmological
volumes requires running computationally expensive hydrodynamic simulations that can cost millions
of CPU hours. In this paper, we propose to use deep learning to establish a mapping between the 3D galaxy
distribution in hydrodynamic simulations and its underlying dark matter distribution. One of
the major challenges in this pursuit is the very high sparsity in the predicted galaxy distribution.
To this end, we develop a two-phase convolutional neural network architecture to generate fast
galaxy catalogues, and compare our results against a standard cosmological technique. We find
that our proposed approach either outperforms or is competitive with traditional cosmological
techniques. Compared to the common methods used in cosmology, our approach also provides a nice
trade-off between time-consumption (comparable to fastest benchmark in the literature) and the
quality and accuracy of the predicted simulation. In combination with current and upcoming data
from cosmological observations, our method has the potential to answer fundamental questions
about our Universe with the highest accuracy.
