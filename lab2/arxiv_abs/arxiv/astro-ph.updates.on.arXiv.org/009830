Observations of various molecular lines toward a disk region of a nearby galaxy are now feasible,
and they are being employed as diagnostic tools to study star-formation activities there. However,
the spatial resolution attainable for a nearby galaxy with currently available radio telescopes
is $10-1000$ pc, which is much larger than the scales of individual star-forming regions and molecular
cloud cores. Hence, it is of fundamental importance to elucidate which part of an interstellar medium
such spatially-unresolved observations are tracing. Here we present sensitive measurements
of the H$_2$CO ($1_{01}-0_{00}$) line at 72 GHz toward giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the spiral
arm of M51 using the NRO 45 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes. In conjunction with the previously observed
H$_2$CO ($2_{02}-1_{01}$) and CS ($2-1$ and $3-2$) lines, we derive the H$_2$ density of the emitting
regions to be $(0.6-2.6)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $(2.9-12)\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ for H$_2$CO
and CS, respectively, by the non-LTE analyses, where we assume the source size of $0.8-1$ kpc and
the gas kinetic temperature of $10-20$ K. The derived H$_2$ density indicates that the emission
of H$_2$CO and CS is not localized to star-forming cores, but is likely distributed over an entire
region of GMCs. Such widespread distributions of H$_2$CO and CS are also supported by models assuming
lognormal density distributions over the 1 kpc region. Thus, contributions from the widespread
less-dense components should be taken into account for interpretation of these molecular emission
observed with a GMC-scale resolution. The different H$_2$ densities derived for H$_2$CO and CS
imply their different distributions. We discuss this differences in terms of the formation processes
of H$_2$CO and CS.
