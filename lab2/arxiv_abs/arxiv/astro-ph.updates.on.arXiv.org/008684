We derive direct measurement gas-phase metallicities of $7.4 < 12 + \log(O/H) < 8.4$ for 14 low-mass
Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) at $0.3 < z < 0.8$ identified in the Faint Infrared Grism Survey (FIGS).
We use deep slitless G102 grism spectroscopy of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), dispersing light
from all objects in the field at wavelengths between 0.85 and 1.15 microns. We run an automatic search
routine on these spectra to robustly identify 71 emission line sources, using archival data from
VLT/MUSE to measure additional lines and confirm redshifts. We identify 14 objects with $0.3 < z
< 0.8$ with measurable O[III]$\lambda$4363 \AA\ emission lines in matching VLT/MUSE spectra.
For these galaxies, we derive direct electron-temperature gas-phase metallicities with a range
of $7.4 < 12 + \log(O/H) < 8.4$. With matching stellar masses in the range of $10^{7.9} M_{\odot} <
M_{\star} < 10^{10.4} M_{\odot}$, we construct a mass-metallicity (MZ) relation and find that
the relation is offset to lower metallicities compared to metallicities derived from alternative
methods (e.g.,$R_{23}$, O3N2, N2O2) and continuum selected samples. Using star formation rates
(SFR) derived from the $H\alpha$ emission line, we calculate our galaxies' position on the Fundamental
Metallicity Relation (FMR), where we also find an offset toward lower metallicities. This demonstrates
that this emission-line-selected sample probes objects of low stellar masses but even lower metallicities
than many comparable surveys. We detect a trend suggesting galaxies with higher Specific Star Formation
(SSFR) are more likely to have lower metallicity. This could be due to cold accretion of metal-poor
gas that drives star formation, or could be because outflows of metal-rich stellar winds and SNe
ejecta are more common in galaxies with higher SSFR.
