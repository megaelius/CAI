Many studies of high-multiplicity, tightly-packed planetary systems, similar to those observed
in the Kepler sample, suggest that dynamical instabilities are common and affect both the orbits
and planet structures. The compact orbits and typically low densities make physical collisions
likely outcomes of these instabilities. Since the structure of many of these planets is such that
the mass is dominated by a rocky core, but the volume is dominated by a tenuous gas envelope, the sticky-sphere
prescription, used in dynamical integrators, may be a poor approximation for these collisions.
We perform five sets of collision calculations, including detailed hydrodynamics, sampling mass
ratios and core mass fractions typical in Kepler Multis. We use an N-body code, Mercury 6.2, to dynamically
integrate initially unstable systems and study the resultant planet-planet collisions in detail.
We use these collisions, focusing on grazing collisions, in combination with realistic planet
models created using the gas profiles from Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)
and equations of state from Seager et al. (2007), to perform detailed hydrodynamic calculations,
finding several distinct outcomes including scatterings, mergers, and even a potential planet-planet
binary. We dynamically integrate the remnant systems, examine the stability, and estimate the
final densities. We find the remnant densities are very sensitive to the core masses and collisions
result in generally more stable systems. Finally, we provide prescriptions for predicting the
outcomes and modeling the changes in mass and orbits following planet-planet collisions for general
use in dynamical integrators, improving on the sticky-sphere approximation.
