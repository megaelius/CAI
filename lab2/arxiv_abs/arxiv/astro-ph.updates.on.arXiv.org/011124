Recent observations show cool, oscillating prominence threads fading when observed in cool spectral
lines and appearing in warm spectral lines. A proposed mechanism to explain this evolution is that
the threads were heated by turbulence driven by the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability that developed
as a result of wave-driven shear flows on the surface of the thread. As the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability
is an instability that works to mix the fluids, in the solar corona it can be expected to work by mixing
the cool prominence material with that of the hot corona to form a warm boundary layer. In this paper
we develop a simple phenomenological model of nonlinear Kelvin--Helmholtz mixing, using it to
determine the characteristic density and temperature of the mixing layer, which for the case under
study with constant pressure across the two fluids are $\rho_{\rm mixed}=\sqrt{\rho_1\rho_2}$
and $T_{\rm mixed}=\sqrt{T_1T_2}$. One result from the model is that it provides an accurate, as
determined by comparison with simulation results, determination of the kinetic energy in the mean
velocity field. A consequence of this is that the magnitude of turbulence, and with it the energy
that can be dissipated on fast time-scales, as driven by this instability can be determined. For
the prominence-corona system, the mean temperature rise possible from turbulent heating is estimated
to be less than 1\% of the characteristic temperature (which is found to be $10^5$\,K). These results
highlight that mixing, and not heating, are likely to be the cause of the observed transition between
cool to warm material in Okamoto et. al (2015). One consequence of this result is that the mixing creates
a region with higher radiative loss rates on average than either of the original fluids, meaning
that this instability could contribute a net loss of thermal energy from the corona, i.e. coronal
cooling.
