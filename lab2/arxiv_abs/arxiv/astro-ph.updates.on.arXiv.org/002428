The generation of the asymmetric cosmic baryon abundance requires a departure from thermal equilibrium
in the early universe. In a large class of baryogenesis models, the baryon asymmetry results from
the out-of-equilibrium decay of a new, massive particle. We highlight that in the interesting scenario
where this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition requires a proper
decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within reach of the LHC, at which they can be pair
produced leaving a distinctive, displaced-vertex signature. This scenario is realized in the
recently proposed mechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the
freeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive particle ("WIMP baryogenesis").
In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP dark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these
new long-lived particles responsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex
channel. In our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP baryogenesis
from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS with 8 TeV LHC data. We also estimate
the LHC reach at 13 TeV using current strategies, and demonstrate that up to a factor of 100 improvement
in cross-section limits can be achieved by requiring two displaced vertices while lowering kinematic
thresholds. For meta-stable WIMPs produced through electroweak interactions, the high luminosity
LHC is sensitive to masses up to 2.5 TeV for lifetimes around 1 cm, while for singlets pair-produced
through the off-shell-Higgs portal, the LHC is sensitive to production cross sections of O(10)
ab for benchmark masses around 150 GeV. Our analysis and proposals also generally apply to displaced
vertex signatures from other new physics such as hidden valley models, twin Higgs models and displaced
supersymmetry.
