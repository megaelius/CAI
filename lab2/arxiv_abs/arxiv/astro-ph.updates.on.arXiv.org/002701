Ca-rich transients (CRTs, 2005E-like supernovae) exhibit unusually strong Ca features during
their nebular phase, and their distribution in their host galaxies indicates that they belong to
a metal-poor old population. We carried out a series of binary population synthesis and presented
four different channels of forming CO WD + He WD pairs. We selected the systems fulfilling the constraints
of the old population and the birth rate from all the CO WD + He WD pairs by constraining the component
mass of the WD pairs. For the four channels, the stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) could have a significant
influence on the formation of the WD + WD pairs. Based on their position on the $M_{\rm CO}$-$M_{\rm
He}$ plane, the mass-transfer between the components for most of the CO WD + He WD pairs is neither
always unstable nor always stable. We found that it is necessary that the CO WDs are less massive than
0.6 $M_{\odot}$ and the He WDs are less massive than 0.25 $M_{\odot}$ if CO WD + He WD pairs fulfill
the constraints from both the old population and the birth rate of CRTs. However, the He WD mass is
lower than, while the total mass of the low-mass WD pairs is larger than{\bf ,} the ejecta mass of the
CRTs derived from observations. Our results imply that the CO WDs participate in CRT explosions
and at the same time, a bound remnant could be left after the CRT explosion if the low-mass WD pairs
are the progenitors of CRTs. Therefore, whether or not the helium detonation on a low-mass CO WD may
lead to the second detonation in the center of the CO WDs, and whether or not the binding remnant is
left after the thermonuclear explosion should be examined carefully in the future.
