We present a novel theory of a unified dark sector, where late-time cosmic acceleration emerges
from the dark matter superfluid framework. The system is described by a superfluid mixture consisting
of two distinguishable states with a small energy gap, such as the ground state and an excited state
of dark matter. Given their contact in the superfluid, interaction between those states can happen,
converting one state into the other. This long range interaction within the superfluid couples
the two superfluid phonon species through a Josephson/Rabi cosine potential. As a consequence
of this potential, a new dynamics of late-time accelerated expansion emerges in this system, without
the need of dark energy, coming from a universe containing only this two-state DM superfluid. The
superfluid nature of the interacting species offers a number of advantages. First, because the
phonon kinetic term is non-canonical, the decay constant appearing in the potential can be sub-Planckian,
unlike the super-Planckian decay constants required in axion models of dark energy. Second, because
the superfluid species are non-relativistic, their sound speeds remain suitably small throughout
the evolution. We calculate the expansion history and growth of linear perturbations, and compare
the results to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. For the fiducial parameters studied here, the predicted
expansion and growth function are close to those of $\Lambda$CDM, but the difference in the predicted
growth rate is significant at late times. The present theory nicely complements the recent proposal
of dark matter superfluidity to explain the empirical success of MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)
on galactic scales, thus offering a unified framework for dark matter, dark energy, and MOND phenomenology.
