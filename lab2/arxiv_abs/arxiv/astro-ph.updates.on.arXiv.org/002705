The post main-sequence evolution of massive stars is very sensitive to many parameters of the stellar
models. Key parameters are the mixing processes, the metallicity, the mass-loss rate and the effect
of a close companion. We study how the red supergiant lifetimes, the tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russel
diagram (HRD), the positions in this diagram of the pre-supernova progenitor as well as the structure
of the stars at that time change for various mass-loss rates during the red supergiant phase (RSG),
and for two different initial rotation velocities. The surface abundances of RSGs are much more
sensitive to rotation than to the mass-loss rates during that phase. A change of the RSG mass-loss
rate has a strong impact on the RSG lifetimes and therefore on the luminosity function of RSGs. At
solar metallicity, the enhanced mass-loss rate models do produce significant changes on the populations
of blue, yellow and red supergiants. When extended blue loops or blue ward excursions are produced
by enhanced mass-loss, the models predict that a majority of blue (yellow) supergiants are post
RSG objects. These post RSG stars are predicted to show much smaller surface rotational velocities
than similar blue supergiants on their first crossing of the HR gap. The position in the HRD of the
end point of the evolution depends on the mass of the hydrogen envelope. More precisely, whenever,
at the pre-supernova stage, the H-rich envelope contains more than about 5\% of the initial mass,
the star is a red supergiant, and whenever the H-rich envelope contains less than 1\% of the total
mass the star is a blue supergiant. For intermediate situations, intermediate colors/effective
temperatures are obtained. Yellow progenitors for core collapse supernovae can be explained by
the enhanced mass-loss rate models, while the red progenitors are better fitted by the standard
mass-loss rate models.
