Titan's abundant lakes and seas exchange methane vapor and energy with the atmosphere via a process
generally known as air-sea interaction. This turbulent exchange process is investigated with
an atmospheric mesoscale model coupled to a slab model representation of an underlying lake. The
impact of lake size, effective lake mixed layer depth, background wind speed, air-lake temperature
differential, atmospheric humidity, and diabatic heating of the atmosphere on air-sea interaction
processes is studied through 67 two-dimensional simulations. The general, quasi-steady solution
is a non-linear superposition of a plume circulation driven by the buoyancy of evaporated methane
and an opposing thermally direct (sea breeze) circulation driven by the thermal contrast between
the cold marine layer over the lake and the warmer inland air. The specific solution depends on the
value of selected atmosphere and lake property parameters and ranges from a persistent and strong
methane-rich plume circulation over the lake with little to no sea breeze, or a rapidly developing
sea breeze with a highly suppressed plume circulation. The solutions that appear most consistent
with limited observational constraints are those where a sea breeze circulation is able to offset
the opposing plume circulation. This scenario results in a cool, moist, and statically stable shallow
marine layer with nearly calm winds and small turbulent flux exchanges with an underlying lake that
is at least 2 K colder than the atmosphere. Other configurations produced extreme scenarios with
strong surface winds that could trigger waves, supersaturated layers at the top of the plume circulation
that would be conducive to cloud formation, and lakes cold enough to freeze. These extreme scenarios
are unlikely to be realistic based on limited observational constraints.
