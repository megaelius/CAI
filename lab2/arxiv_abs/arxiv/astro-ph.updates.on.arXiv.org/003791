From our recent catalog based on the first Gaia data release (TGAS), we select wide binaries in which
both stars have been observed by the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) or the Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Using RAVE and LAMOST metallicities and RAVE Mg, Al, Si,
Ti, and Fe abundances, we find that the differences in the metallicities and elemental abundances
of components of wide binaries are consistent with being due to observational uncertainties, in
agreement with previous results for smaller and more restricted samples. The metallicity and elemental
abundance consistency between wide binary components presented in this work confirms their common
origin and bolsters the status of wide binaries as "mini-open clusters." Furthermore, this is evidence
that wide binaries are effectively co-eval and co-chemical, supporting their use for e.g., constraining
age-activity-rotation relations, the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs, and M-dwarf
metallicity indicators. Additionally, we demonstrate that the common proper motion, common parallax
pairs in TGAS with the most extreme separations (s $\gtrsim$ 0.1 pc) typically have inconsistent
metallicities, radial velocities or both and are therefore likely to be predominantly comprised
of random alignments of unassociated stars with similar astrometry, in agreement with our previous
results. Finally, we propose that wide binaries form an ideal data set with which to test chemical
tagging as a method to identify stars of common origin, particularly because the stars in wide binaries
span a wide range of metallicities, much wider than that spanned by nearby open clusters.
