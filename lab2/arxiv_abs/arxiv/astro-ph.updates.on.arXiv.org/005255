Laser altimetry is a powerful tool for addressing the major objectives of planetary physics and
geodesy, and have been applied in planetary explorations of the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and the asteroids
Eros, and Itokawa. The JUpiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), led by European Space Agency (ESA), has
started development to explore the emergence of habitable worlds around gas giants. The Ganymede
Laser Altimeter (GALA) will be the first laser altimeter for icy bodies, and will measure the shape
and topography of the large icy moons of Jupiter, (globally for Ganymede, and using flyby ground-tracks
for Europa and Callisto). Such information is crucial for understanding the formation of surface
features and can tremendously improve our understanding of the icy tectonics. In addition, the
GALA will infer the presence or absence of a subsurface ocean by measuring the tidal and rotational
responses. Furthermore, it also improves the accuracy of gravity field measurements reflecting
the interior structure, collaborating with the radio science experiment. In addition to range
measurements, the signal strength and the waveform of the laser pulses reflected from the moon's
surface contain information about surface reflectance at the laser wavelength and small scale
roughness. Therefore we can infer the degrees of chemical and physical alterations, e.g., erosion,
space weathering, compaction and deposition of exogenous materials, through GALA measurements
without being affected by illumination conditions. JUICE spacecraft carries ten science payloads
including GALA. They work closely together in a synergistic way with GALA being one of the key instruments
for understanding the evolution of the icy satellites Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto.
