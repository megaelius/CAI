Directly comparing the 6 expansion rates measured by type Ia supernovae data and the lower bound
on the expansion rate set by the strong energy conditions or the null hypothesis that there never
exists cosmic acceleration, we see $3\sigma$ direct evidence of cosmic acceleration and the $Rh=ct$
model is strongly excluded by the type Ia supernovae data. We also use Gaussian process method to
reconstruct the expansion rate and the deceleration parameter from the 31 cosmic chronometers
data and the 6 data points on the expansion rate measured from type Ia supernoave data, the direct
evidence of cosmic acceleration is more than $3\sigma$ and we find that the transition redshift
$z_t=0.60_{-0.12}^{+0.21}$ at which the expansion of the Universe underwent the transition from
acceleration to deceleration. The Hubble constant inferred from the cosmic chronometers data
with the Gaussian process method is $H_0=67.46\pm4.75$ Km/s/Mpc. By fitting two different two-parameter
models to the observational data, we find that the constraints on the model parameters from either
the full distance modulus data by the Pantheon compilation or the compressed expansion rate data
are very similar, and the derived Hubble constants are consistent with the Planck 2018 result. Our
results confirm that the 6 compressed expansion rate data can replace the full 1048 distance modulus
data from the Pantheon compilation. We derive the transition redshift $z_t=0.61_{-0.16}^{+0.24}$
by fitting a simple $q(z)$ model to the combination of cosmic chronometers data and the Pantheon
compilation, the result is consistent with that obtained from the reconstruction with Gaussian
process.
