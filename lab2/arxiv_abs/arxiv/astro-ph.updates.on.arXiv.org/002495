The Kreutz family of sungrazing comets contains over 2~000 known members, many of which are believed
to be under $\sim 100$~m sizes (\textit{mini~comets}) and have only been studied at small heliocentric
distances ($r_\mathrm{H}$) with space-based SOHO/STEREO spacecraft. To understand the brightening
process of mini Kreutz comets, we conducted a survey using CFHT/MegaCam at moderate $r_\mathrm{H}$
guided by SOHO/STEREO observations. We identify two comets that should be in our search area but
are not detected, indicating that the comets have either followed a steeper brightening rate within
the previously-reported rapid brighten stage (the \textit{brightening~burst}), or the brightening
burst starts earlier than expected. We present a composite analysis of pre-perihelion light-curves
of five Kreutz comets that covered to $\sim 1$~AU. We observe a significant diversity in the light-curves
that can be used to grossly classify them into two types: C/Ikeya-Seki and C/SWAN follow the canonical
$r_\mathrm{H}^{-4}$ while the others follow $r_\mathrm{H}^{-7}$. In particular, C/SWAN seems
to have undergone an outburst ($\Delta m>5$~mag) or a rapid brightening ($n\gtrsim11$) between
$r_\mathrm{H}=1.06$~AU to $0.52$~AU, and shows hints of structural/compositional differences
compared to other bright Kreutz comets. We also find evidence that the Kreutz comets as a population
lose their mass less efficiently than the dynamically new comet, C/ISON, and are relatively devoid
of species that drive C/ISON's activity at large $r_\mathrm{H}$. Concurrent observations of C/STEREO
in different wavelengths also suggest that a blue-ward species such as CN may be the main driver for
brightening burst instead of previously-thought sodium.
