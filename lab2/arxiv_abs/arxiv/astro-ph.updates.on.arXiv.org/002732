[ABRIDGED] We present results from an HST lensing analysis of the complete Cluster Lensing And Supernova
survey with Hubble (CLASH) cluster sample. We identify various new multiple-images previously
undiscovered, allowing improved or first constraints on the cluster inner mass distributions
and profiles. We combine these strong-lensing constraints with weak lensing shape measurements
within the HST FOV to jointly constrain the mass distributions. The analysis is performed in two
different common parameterizations (one adopts light-traces-mass for both galaxies and dark
matter while the other adopts an analytical, elliptical NFW form for the dark matter), to provide
a better assessment of the underlying systematics - which is most important for deep lensing surveys
such as CLASH and the Hubble Frontier Fields, especially when studying high-redshift magnified
objects. We find that the typical (median), relative systematic differences throughout the central
FOV are $\sim40\%$ in the (dimensionless) mass density, $\kappa$, and $\sim20\%$ in the magnification,
$\mu$. For the Einstein radii, we find that all typically agree within $10\%$ between the two models,
and Einstein masses agree, typically, within $\sim15\%$. At larger radii, the total projected,
2D integrated mass profiles of the two models within $r\sim2'$, differ by $\sim30\%$. Stacking
the surface-density profiles of the sample from the two methods together, we obtain an average slope
of $d\log (\Sigma)/d\log(r)\sim-0.64\pm0.1$, in the radial range [5,350] kpc. Lastly, we examine
the behavior of the average magnification, surface density, and shear differences between the
two models, as a function of both the radius and the best-fit values of these quantities, uncovering
some interesting trends. Our lens models are made publicly available.
