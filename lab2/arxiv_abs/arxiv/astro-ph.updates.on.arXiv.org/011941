One of the most effective ways to test stellar evolutionary models is to measure dynamical masses
for binary systems at a range of temperatures. In this paper, we present orbits of three young K+M
binary systems in Taurus (Hubble~4, FF~Tau, and HP~Tau/G3) with VLBI parallaxes. We obtained precision
astrometry with Keck-II/NIRC2, optical photometry with HST/WFC3, and low-resolution optical
spectra with WIFeS on the ANU 2.3 m telescope. We fit orbital solutions and dynamical masses with
uncertainties of 1-5% for the three binary systems. The spectrum, photometry, and mass for Hubble~4
are inconsistent with a binary system, suggesting that it may be a triple system where the primary
component consists of two stars. For HP~Tau/G3 and FF~Tau, model masses derived from SED determined
component temperatures and luminosities agree with the dynamical masses, with a small offset towards
larger model masses. We find model ages for the primary components of these systems of $\sim$3 Myr,
but find that the secondaries appear younger by a factor of two. These estimates also disagree with
the age of the physically associated G-type star HP~Tau/G2, which is older ($\sim$5 Myr) according
to the same models. This discrepancy is equivalent to a luminosity under-prediction of 0.1-0.2
dex, or a temperature over-prediction of 100-300 K, for K/M-type stars at a given model age. We interpret
this as further evidence for a systematic error in pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks for convective
stars. Our results reinforce that the ages of young populations determined from the locus of M-type
members on the HR-diagram may require upward revision.
