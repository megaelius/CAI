We have performed survey-type observations in 1 mm continuum and molecular lines toward dense cores
(32 prestellar + 7 protostellar) with an average density of $\gtrsim$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ in the Taurus
molecular clouds using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array-Atacama Compact Array
(ALMA-ACA) stand-alone mode with an angular resolution of 6.$''$5 ($\sim$900 au). The primary
purpose of this study is to investigate the innermost part of dense cores toward understanding the
initial condition of star formation. In the protostellar cores, contributions from protostellar
disks dominate the observed continuum flux with a range of 35-90% except for the very low-luminosity
object. For the prestellar cores, we have successfully confirmed continuum emission from dense
gas with a density of $\gtrsim$3 $\times$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$ toward approximately one-third of the
targets. Thanks to the lower spatial frequency coverage with the ACA-7 m array, the detection rate
is significantly higher than that of the previous surveys, which have 0 or 1 continuum detected sources
among large number of starless samples using the ALMA Main array. The statistical counting method
tells us that the lifetime of the prestellar cores until protostar formation therein approaches
the free-fall time as the density increases. Among the prestellar cores, at least two targets have
possible internal substructures, which are detected in continuum emission with the size scale
of $\sim$1000 au if we consider the molecular line (C$^{18}$O and N$_2$D$^{+}$) distributions.
These results suggest that small-scale fragmentation/coalescence processes occur in a region
smaller than 0.1 pc, which may determine the final core mass associated with individual protostar
formation before starting the dynamical collapse of the core with central density of $\sim$(0.3-1)
$\times$ 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$.
