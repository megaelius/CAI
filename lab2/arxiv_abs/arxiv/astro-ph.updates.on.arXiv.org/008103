Giant gaseous layers (termed "superdisk") have been hypothesized in the past to account for the
strip-like radio emission gap (or straight-edged central brightness depression) observed between
the twin radio lobes, in over a dozen relatively nearby powerful Fanaroff-Riley Class II radio galaxies.
They could also provide a plausible alternative explanation for a range of observations. Although
a number of explanations have been proposed for the origin of the superdisks, little is known about
their material content. Some X-ray observations of superdisk candidates indicate the presence
of hot gas, but a cool dusty medium also seems to be common in them. If they are made of entirely or partly
neutral gas, it may be directly detectable and we report here a first attempt to detect/image any
neutral hydrogen gas present in the superdisks that are inferred to be present in four nearby radio
galaxies. We have not found a positive HI signal in any of the four sources, resulting in tight upper
limits on the HI number density in the postulated superdisks, estimated directly from the central
rms noise values of the final radio continuum subtracted image. The estimated ranges of the upper
limit on neutral hydrogen number density and column density are $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ atoms per cm$^3$
and $10^{19}-10^{20}$ atoms per cm$^{2}$, respectively. No positive HI signal is detected even
after combining all the four available HI images (with inverse variance weighting). This clearly
rules out an HI dominated superdisk as a viable model to explain these structures, however, the possibility
of superdisk being made of warm/hot gas still remains open.
