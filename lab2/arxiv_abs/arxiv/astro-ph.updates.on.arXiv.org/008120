We detect the accreting low-mass companion HD142527B at a separation of 73 mas (11.4 au) from the
star. No other companions with mass greater than 10 MJ are visible in the field of view of IFS (\sim
100 au centered on the star) or in the IRDIS field of view (\sim 400 au centered on the star). Measurements
from IFS, SAM IFS, and IRDIS suggest an M6 spectral type for HD142527B, with an uncertainty of one
spectral subtype, compatible with an object of M=0.11 \pm 0.06 MSun and R=0.15 \pm 0.07 RSun. The
determination of the mass remains a challenge using contemporary evolutionary models, as they
do not account for the energy input due to accretion from infalling material. We consider that the
spectral type of the secondary may also be earlier than the type we derived from IFS spectra. From
dynamical considerations, we further constrain the mass to 0.26^{+0.16}_{-0.14} MSun , which
is consistent with both our spectroscopic analysis and the values reported in the literature. Following
previous methods, the lower and upper dynamical mass values correspond to a spectral type between
M2.5 and M5.5 for the companion. By fitting the astrometric points, we find the following orbital
parameters: a period of P=35-137 yr; an inclination of i=121-130 deg.; , a value of Omega=124-135
deg for the longitude of node, and an 68% confidence interval of \sim 18 - 57 au for the separation at
periapsis. Eccentricity and time at periapsis passage exhibit two groups of values: \sim0.2-0.45
and \sim0.45-0.7 for e, and \sim 2015-2020 and \sim2020-2022 for T_0. While these orbital parameters
might at first suggest that HD142527B is not the companion responsible for the outer disk truncation,
a previous hydrodynamical analysis of this system showed that they are compatible with a companion
that is able to produce the large cavity and other observed features.
