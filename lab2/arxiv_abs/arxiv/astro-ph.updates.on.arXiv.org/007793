The LMC hosts a rich variety of star clusters seen in close projected proximity. Ages have been derived
for few of them showing differences up to few million years, hinting at being binary star clusters.
However, final confirmation needs to be done through spectroscopic analysis. Here we focus on the
LMC cluster pair NGC2006-SL538 and aim to determine whether the star cluster pair is a bound entity
(binary star cluster) or a chance alignment. Using the MIKE echelle spectrograph at LCO we have acquired
integrated-light spectra for each cluster. We have measured radial velocities by two methods:
a) direct line profile measurement yields v$_r=300.3\pm5\pm6$ km/s for NGC2006 and $v_r=310.2\pm4\pm6$
km/s for SL538. b) By comparing observed spectra with synthetic bootstrapped spectra yielding
$v_r=311.0\pm0.6$ km/s for NGC2006 and $v_r=309.4\pm0.5$ km/s for SL538. Finally when spectra
are directly compared, we find a ${\Delta}v=1.08\pm0.47$ km/s. Full-spectrum SED fits reveal
that the stellar population ages lie in the range 13-21 Myr with a metallicity of Z=0.008. We find
indications for differences in the chemical abundance patterns as revealed by the helium absorption
lines between the two clusters. The dynamical analysis shows that the two clusters are likely to
merge within the next $\sim$150 Myr. The NGC2006-SL538 cluster pair shows radial velocities, stellar
population and dynamical parameters consistent with a gravitational bound entity. We conclude
that this is a genuine binary cluster pair, and we propose that their differences in ages and stellar
population chemistry is most likely due to variances in their chemical enrichment history within
their environment. We suggest that their formation may have taken place in a loosely bound star-formation
complex which saw initial fragmentation but then had its clusters become a gravitationally bound
pair by tidal capture.
