We present the measurements and modelling of the projected and redshift-space clustering of CMASS
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release
11. For a volume-limited luminous red galaxy sample in the redshift range of $0.48<z<0.55$,
we perform halo occupation distribution modelling of the small- and intermediate-scale ($0.1$--$60h^{-1}{\rm
{Mpc}}$) projected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions, with an accurate model
built on high resolution $N$-body simulations. To interpret the measured redshift-space distortions,
the distribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matter inside haloes of $\sim
10^{13}$--$10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$, i.e. the data require the existence of galaxy velocity
bias. Most notably, central galaxies on average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host
haloes (defined by the inner 25% of particles around the halo potential minimum), but rather move
around it with a 1D velocity dispersion of $0.22^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ times that of the dark matter,
implying a spatial offset from the centre at the level of $\lesssim$1% of the halo virial radius.
The luminous satellite galaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities $0.86^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$
times those of the dark matter, which suggests that the velocity and spatial distributions of these
satellites cannot both be unbiased. The constraints mainly arise from the Fingers-of-God effect
at nonlinear scales and the smoothing to the Kaiser effect in the translinear regime; the robustness
of the results is demonstrated by a variety of tests. In addition, no clear evidence is found for a
strong luminosity dependence of the velocity bias. We discuss the implications of the existence
of galaxy velocity bias for investigations of galaxy formation and cosmology.
