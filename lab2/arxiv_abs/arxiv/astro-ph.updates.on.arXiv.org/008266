In recent years, coronal loops have been the focus of studies related to the damping of different
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) surface waves and their connection with coronal seismology and wave
heating. For a better understanding of wave heating, we need to take into account the effects of different
dissipation coefficients such as resistivity and viscosity, the importance of the loop physical
characteristics, and the ways gravity can factor into the evolution of these phenomena. We aim to
map the sites of energy dissipation from transverse waves in coronal loops in the presence and absence
of gravitational stratification and to compare ideal, resistive, and viscous MHD. Using the PLUTO
code, we performed 3D MHD simulations of kink waves in single, straight, density-enhanced coronal
flux tubes of multiple temperatures. We see the creation of spatially expanded Kelvin-Helmholtz
eddies along the loop, which deform the initial monolithic loop profile. For the case of driven oscillations,
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops despite physical dissipation, unless very high values
of shear viscosity are used. Energy dissipation gets its highest values near the apex, but is present
all along the loop. We observe an increased efficiency of wave heating once the kinetic energy saturates
at the later stages of the simulation and a turbulent density profile has developed. The inclusion
of gravity greatly alters the dynamic evolution of our systems and should not be ignored in future
studies. Stronger physical dissipation leads to stronger wave heating in our set-ups. Finally,
once the kinetic energy of the oscillating loop starts saturating, all the excess input energy turns
into internal energy, resulting in more efficient wave heating.
