Context. 55 Cnc e is a transiting super-Earth orbiting a solar-like star with an orbital period of
17.7 hours. In 2011, using the MOST space telescope, a quasi-sinusoidal modulation in flux was detected
with the same period as the planetary orbit. The amplitude of this modulation was too large to be explained
as the change in light reflected or emitted by the planet. Aims. The MOST telescope continued to observe
55 Cnc e for a few weeks per year over five years, covering 143 individual transits. This paper presents
the analysis of the observed phase modulation throughout these observations and a search for the
secondary eclipse of the planet. Methods. The most important source of systematic noise in MOST
data is due to stray-light reflected from the Earth, which is modulated with both the orbital period
of the satellite and the Earth's rotation period. We present a new technique to deal with this source
of noise, which we combined with standard detrending procedures for MOST data. We then performed
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses of the detrended light curves, modeling the planetary transit
and phase modulation. Results. We find phase modulations similar to those seen in 2011 in most of
the subsequent years; however, the amplitude and phase of maximum light are seen to vary from 113
to 28 ppm and from 0.1 to 3.8 rad. The secondary eclipse is not detected, but we constrain the geometric
albedo of the planet to less than 0.47 (2$\sigma$). Conclusions. While we cannot identify a single
origin of the observed optical modulation, we propose a few possible scenarios. Those include star-planet
interaction or the presence of a transiting circumstellar torus of dust. However, a detailed interpretation
of these observations is limited by their photometric precision. Additional observations at optical
wavelengths could contribute to uncovering the underlying physical processes.
