The Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory EChO is a space mission concept studied by the European
Space Agency in the context of the M3 selection process. Through direct measurement of the atmospheric
chemical composition of hundreds of exoplanets, EChO would address fundamental questions such
as: What are exoplanets made of? How do planets form and evolve? What is the origin of exoplanet diversity?
More specifically, EChO is a dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable
of observing a large, diverse and well-defined planetary sample within its four to six year mission
lifetime. In this paper we use the end-to-end instrument simulator EChOSim to model the currently
discovered targets, to gauge which targets are observable and assess the EChO performances obtainable
for each observing tier and time. We show that EChO would be capable of observing a large and diverse
sample of planets even if it were launched today, and the wealth of optimal targets for EChO expected
to be discovered in the next 5 years by space and ground-based facilities is simply overwhelming.
In addition, we build on previous molecular detectability studies to show what molecules and abundances
will be detectable by EChO for a selection of real targets with various molecular compositions and
abundances. EChO's unique contribution to exoplanetary science will be in identifying the main
constituents of hundreds of exoplanets in various mass/temperature regimes, meaning that we will
be looking no longer at individual cases but at populations. Such a universal view is critical if
we truly want to understand the processes of planet formation and evolution in various environments.
