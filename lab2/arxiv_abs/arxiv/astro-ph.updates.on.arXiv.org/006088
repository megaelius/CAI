Many of the characteristics of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), such as high Photon Detection
Efficiency (PDE), are well matched to the requirements of the cameras of the Small Sized Telescopes
(SSTs) proposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array in fact the double mirror Schwarzschild Couder
configuration provides a much better Point Spread Function over large field of view compared to
a single mirror. It allows better correction of aberrations at large off axis angles and facilitates
the construction of compact telescopes. Moreover, the small plate scale of the dual mirror SSTs
allows the use of SiPM detectors despite their small pixel sizes. However, one area in which SiPM
performance has required improvement is Optical Cross Talk (OCT), where multiple avalanches are
induced by a single impinging photon. OCT, coupled with the typical night sky background rate of
25 MCnts/s per pixel during Cherenkov observations, can place severe constraints on the triggering
capability of the cameras. An OCT probability lower than 10 % meets the SST requirement. This paper
describes the performance of novel Low Voltage Reverse (LVR) 2nd and 3rd generation Multi Pixel
Photon Counters manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics. These are designed to have both enhanced
PDE and reduced OCT. Two 7 x 7 mm2 S14520 LVR2 MPPCs with 75 {\mu}m microcells are tested and compared
with detectors of the same pixel size with 50 {\mu}m microcells. A comparative analysis of a 3 x 3 mm2
S14520 LVR2 and a S14520 LVR3 devices is also carried out, demonstrating that the LVR3 gives better
photon detection in the 240 - 380 nm wavelength range. Finally, the effect on the OCT of an infrared
filter is analysed.
