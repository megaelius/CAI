We present new HST/COS G130M spectroscopy which we have obtained for a sightline towards a filament
projected 1.9 kpc from the nucleus of M87. We propose that the filament is composed of many cold clumps,
each surrounded by an FUV-emitting boundary layer, with the filament having a radius $r_c \sim 10$
pc and the clumps filling the cylinder with a low volume filling factor. The observed velocity dispersion
in emission lines from the filament results from the random motions of these clumps within the filament.
We measure fluxes and kinematics for emission lines of Ly$\alpha$, C II $\lambda$1335, and N V $\lambda1238$.
We associate these latter three lines, as well as archival measurements of H$\alpha$, C IV $\lambda$1549,
and He II $\lambda$1640, with a multitemperature boundary layer around clumps which are moving
with supersonic random motions in the filament. This boundary layer is a significant coolant of
the hot gas. We show that the [C II] $\lambda$158$\mu$m flux observed by Herschel/PACS from this
region implies the existence of a massive cold ($T \sim 10^3$ K) component in the filament which contains
significantly more mass than the FUV-emitting boundary layer. It has about the same bulk velocity
and velocity dispersion as the boundary layer. We also detect [Fe XXI] $\lambda$1354 in emission
at $4.1-5.1\sigma$. This line is emitted from 1 keV ($T \approx 10^7$ K) plasma, and we use it to measure
the bulk radial velocity and velocity dispersion of the plasma at this temperature. In contrast
to the intermediate-temperature FUV lines, [Fe XXI] is blueshifted relative to M87 and matches
the bulk velocity of a nearby filament to the S. We hypothesize that this line arises from the approaching
face of the radio bubble expanding through this sightline, while the filament lies on the receding
side of the bubble. (Abstract is abridged)
