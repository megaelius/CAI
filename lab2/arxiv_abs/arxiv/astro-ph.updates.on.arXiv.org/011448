Context: Planets in accretion disks can excite spiral shocks, and---if massive enough---open
gaps in their vicinity. Both of these effects can influence the overall disk thermal structure.
Aims: We model planets of different masses and semimajor axes in disks of various viscosities and
accretion rates to examine their impact on disk thermodynamics and highlight the mutable, non-axisymmetric
nature of icelines in systems with massive planets. Methods: We conduct a parameter study using
numerical hydrodynamics simulations where we treat viscous heating, thermal cooling and stellar
irradiation as additional source terms in the energy equation, with some runs including radiative
diffusion. Our parameter space consists of a grid containing different combinations of planet
and disk parameters. Results: Both gap opening and shock heating can displace the iceline, with
the effects being amplified for massive planets in optically thick disks. The gap region can split
an initially hot (T>170 K) disk into a hot inner disk and a hot ring just outside of the planet's location,
while shock heating can reshape the originally axisymmetric iceline into water-poor islands along
spirals. We also find that radiative diffusion does not alter the picture significantly in this
context. Conclusions: Shock heating and gap opening by a planet can effectively heat up optically
thick disks and in general move and/or reshape the water iceline. This can affect the gap structure
and migration torques. It can also produce azimuthal features that follow the trajectory of spiral
arms, creating hot zones, "islands" of vapor and ice around spirals which could affect the accretion
or growth of icy aggregates.
