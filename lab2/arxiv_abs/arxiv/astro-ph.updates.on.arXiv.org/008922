Cool, evolved stars are the main source of chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM),
and understanding their mass loss and structure offers a unique opportunity to study the cycle of
matter in the Universe. Pulsation, convection, and other dynamic processes in cool evolved stars
create an atmosphere where molecules and dust can form, including those necessary to the formation
of life (e.g.~Carbon-bearing molecules). Understanding the structure and composition of these
stars is thus vital to several aspects of stellar astrophysics, ranging from ISM studies to modeling
young galaxies and exoplanet research. Recent modeling efforts and increasingly precise observations
now reveal that our understanding of cool stars photospheric, chromospheric, and atmospheric
structures is limited by inadequate knowledge of the dynamic and chemical processes at work. Here
we outline promising scientific opportunities for the next decade. We identify and discuss the
following main opportunities: (1) identify and model the physical processes that must be included
in current 1D and 3D atmosphere models of cool, evolved stars; (2) refine our understanding of photospheric,
chromospheric, and outer atmospheric regions of cool evolved stars, their properties and parameters,
through high-resolution spectroscopic observations, and interferometric observations at high
angular resolution; (3) include the neglected role of chromospheric activity in the mass loss process
of red giant branch and red super giant stars, and understand the role played by their magnetic fields;
(4) identify the important shaping mechanisms for planetary nebulae and their relation with the
parent asymptotic giant branch stars.
