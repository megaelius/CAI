Superclusters form from the largest enhancements in the primordial density perturbation field
and extend for tens of Mpc, tracing the large-scale structure of the Universe. We characterise XLSSsCN01,
a rich supercluster at z~0.3 detected in the XXL Survey, composed of X-ray clusters of different
virial masses and luminosities. As one of the first studies on this topic, we investigate the stellar
populations of galaxies in different environments in the supercluster region. We study a magnitude-limited
(r<=20) and a mass-limited sample (log(M*/M_sun)>10.8) of galaxies in the virialised region and
in the outskirts of 11 XLSSsCN01 clusters, in high- and low-density field. We compute the stellar
population properties of galaxies using spectral energy distribution and spectral fitting techniques,
and study the dependence of star formation rates (SFR), colours, and stellar ages on environment.
For r<20, the fraction of SFing/blue galaxies, computed either from the specific-SFR (sSFR) or
rest-frame(rf) colour, shows depletion within the cluster virial radii, where the number of galaxies
with log(sSFR/yr^-1)>-12 and with (g-r)_rf<0.6 is lower than in the field. For log(M*/M_sun)>10.8,
no trends with environment emerge, as massive galaxies are mostly already passive in all environments.
No differences among low- and high-density field members and cluster members emerge in the sSFR-mass
relation. The luminosity-weighted age-mass relation of the passive populations within cluster
virial radii show signatures of recent environmental quenching. The study of luminous and massive
galaxies in this supercluster shows that while environment has a prominent role in determining
the fractions of SFing/blue galaxies, its effects on the star formation activity in SFing galaxies
are negligible.
