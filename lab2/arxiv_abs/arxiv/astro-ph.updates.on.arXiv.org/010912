Characterisation of the long-term variations of the broad line region in a luminous blazar, where
Comptonization of broad line emission within a relativistic jet is the standard scenario for production
of gamma-ray emission that dominates the spectral energy distribution. We analyse 10 years of optical
spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory for the blazar 3C 454.3, as well as gamma-ray data
from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The optical spectra are dominated by a highly variable non-thermal
synchrotron continuum with a prominent Mg II broad emission line. The line flux is obtained by spectral
decomposition including significant contribution from the Fe II pseudo-continuum. Three methods
are used to characterise variations of the line flux: (1) stacking of the continuum-subtracted
spectra, (2) subtracting the running mean light curves calculated for different time scales, (3)
Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) for evaluating potential time delays. Despite very large
variations of the gamma-ray and optical continua, the line flux changes only moderately (< 0.1 dex).
The data suggest that the line flux responds to a dramatic change of the blazar activity from a very
high state in 2010 to a deep low state in 2012. Two interpretations are possible: either the line flux
is anti-correlated with the continuum, or increase in the line luminosity is delayed by ~600 days.
If this time delay results from reverberation of poorly constrained accretion disk emission in
both the broad line region (BLR) and the synchrotron emitting blazar zone within a relativistic
jet, we would obtain natural estimates for the BLR radius [R_{BLR,MgII} >~ 0.28 pc] and for the supermassive
black hole mass [M_SMBH ~ 8.5x10^8 M_sun]. We have not identified additional examples of short-term
'flares' of the line flux, besides the case of MJD 55512 reported by Le\'on-Tavares et al. (2013).
