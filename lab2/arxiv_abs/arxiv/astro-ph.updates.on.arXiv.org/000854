The population of dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies in the Local Group has emerged as a powerful
probe of dark matter clustering on small spatial scales and of cosmic reionization. The dwarf spheroidals
are also interesting in view of the continuity of structural and chemical properties they share
with each other, with dwarf irregular galaxies in the field, and with the more massive spheroidal
galaxies in high-density environments. By connecting empirical constraints derived for star
formation at low gas column densities and metallicities in the local universe with a model for dark
matter and baryonic mass assembly, we provide an analytical description of how the dwarf spheroidals
acquired their stellar content. Their progenitors formed stars until their gas content, initially
reduced from the cosmic average by the thermal pressure of the reionized intergalactic medium,
is finally ram pressure stripped during the progenitors' accretion onto the host galaxy. Dwarf
spheroidal satellites of differing luminosities seem to share very similar most massive progenitor
histories that reach thresholds for gas cooling by atomic line emission at epochs at which the Lagrangian
volume of the Local Group should have been reionized. We hypothesize that it is the star formation
in a reionized universe, rather than preceding reionization, that defines their properties. This
model provides an explanation for the "common mass scale" relation of Strigari et al. (2008) and
reproduces the empirical luminosity-size and luminosity-metallicity relations if assuming
that star formation was quiescent and confined to the cold atomic phase stochastically condensing
in partially rotationally supported HI disks.
