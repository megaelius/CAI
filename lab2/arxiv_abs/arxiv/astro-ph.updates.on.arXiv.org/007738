CO plays an important role in interstellar molecular clouds, both as a coolant, and as a diagnostic
molecule. However, a proper evaluation of the cooling rate due to CO requires a determination of
the populations of many levels, the spontaneous and stimulated radiative de-excitation rates
between these levels, and the transfer of the emitted multi-line radiation; additionally, this
must be done for three isotopologues. It would be useful to have a simple analytic formulation that
avoided these complications; this could then be used in situations where CO plays an important role
as a coolant, but the details of this role are not the main concern. We derive such a formulation here,
by first considering the two asymptotic forms that obtain in the limits of (a) low volume-density
and optical depth, and (b) high volume-density and optical depth. These forms are then combined
in such a way as to fit the detailed numerical results from Goldsmith \& Langer (1978), which cover
low temperatures, and a range of physical conditions where the interplay of thermal and sub-thermal
excitation, optical-depth effects, and the contributions from rare isotopologues, are all important.
The fit is obtained using the Metropolis-Hastings method, and reproduces the results of GL78 well.
It is a purely local and analytic function of state --- specifically a function of the density, $\rho$,
isothermal sound speed, $a$, CO abundance, $X_{_{\rm CO}}$, and velocity divergence, $\nabla\cdot{\boldsymbol\upsilon}$.
As an application, we consider the cooling layer following a slow steady non-magnetic planar J-shock.
We show that, if the post-shock cooling is dominated by CO and its isotopologues, the thickness of
the post-shock cooling layer is very small and approximately independent of the pre-shock velocity,
$\upsilon_o$, or pre-shock isothermal sound speed, $a_o$.
