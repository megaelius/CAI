We present an overview and description of the eMERLIN Galaxy Evolution survey (eMERGE) Data Release
1 (DR1), a large program of high-resolution 1.5 GHz radio observations of the GOODS-N field comprising
$\sim140$ hours of observations with eMERLIN and $\sim40$ hours with the Very Large Array (VLA).
We combine the long baselines of eMERLIN (providing high angular resolution) with the relatively
closely-packed antennas of the VLA (providing excellent surface brightness sensitivity) to produce
a deep 1.5 GHz radio survey with the sensitivity ($\sim 1.5\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$), angular resolution
($0.2"$--$0.7"$) and field-of-view ($\sim15' \times 15'$) to detect and spatially resolve star-forming
galaxies and AGN at $z\gtrsim 1$. The goal of eMERGE is to provide new constraints on the deep, sub-arcsecond
radio sky which will be surveyed by SKA1-mid. In this initial publication, we discuss our data analysis
techniques, including steps taken to model in-beam source variability over a $\sim20$ year baseline
and the development of new point spread function/primary beam models to seamlessly merge eMERLIN
and VLA data in the $uv$ plane. We present early science results, including measurements of the luminosities
and/or linear sizes of $\sim500$ galaxes selected at 1.5 GHz. In combination with deep Hubble Space
Telescope observations, we measure a mean radio-to-optical size ratio of $r_{\rm eMERGE}/r_{\rm
HST}\sim1.02\pm0.03$, suggesting that in most high-redshift galaxies, the $\sim$GHz continuum
emission traces the stellar light seen in optical imaging. This is the first in a series of papers
which will explore the $\sim$kpc-scale radio properties of star-forming galaxies and AGN in the
GOODS-N field observed by eMERGE DR1.
