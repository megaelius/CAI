Aims. To present the new novel statistical clustering tool 'INDICATE' which assesses and quantifies
the degree of spatial clustering of each object in a dataset, discuss its applications as a tracer
of morphological stellar features in star forming regions, and to look for these features in the
Carina Nebula (NGC 3372). Results. We successfully recover known stellar structure of the Carina
Nebula, including the 5 young star clusters in this region. Members of 4 sub-clusters identified
by Kuhn et al. (2014) as stellar overdensities contain no, or very few, stars with a degree of association
above random which suggests they may be fluctuations in the field rather than real clusters. In addition
we find: (1) Stars in the NW and SE regions have significantly different clustering tendencies,
which is reflective of differences in the apparent star formation activity in these regions. Further
study is required to ascertain the physical origin of the difference; (2) The different clustering
properties between these two regions are even more pronounced for OB stars; (3) There are no signatures
of classical mass segregation present in the SE region - massive stars here are not spatially concentrated
together above random; (4) Stellar concentrations are more frequent around massive stars than
typical for the general population, particularly in the Tr14 cluster; (5) There is a relation between
the concentration of OB stars and the concentration of (lower mass) stars around OB stars in the centrally
concentrated Tr14 and Tr15, but no such relation exists in Tr16. We conclude this is due to the highly
sub-structured nature of Tr16. Conclusions. INDICATE is a powerful new tool employing a novel approach
to quantify the clustering tendencies of individual objects in a dataset within a user-defined
parameter space. As such it can be used in a wide array of data analysis applications.
