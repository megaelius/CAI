A population of globular clusters (GCs) has been recently established by the Fermi-LAT telescope
as a new class of GeV $\gamma$-ray sources. Leptons accelerated to TeV energies, in the inner magnetospheres
of MSPs or in their wind regions, should produce $\gamma$-rays through the inverse Compton scattering
in the dense radiation field from the huge population of stars. We have conducted deep observations
of the globular cluster M15 with the MAGIC telescopes and used 165 hrs in order to search for $\gamma$-ray
emission. A strong upper limit on the TeV $\gamma$-ray flux $<3.2\times 10^{-13}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$
above 300 GeV ($<0.26\%$ of the Crab nebula flux) has been obtained. We interpret this limit as a constraint
on the efficiency of the acceleration of leptons in the magnetospheres of the MSPs. We constrain
the injection rate of relativistic leptons, $\eta_{\rm e}$, from the MSPs magnetospheres and their
surrounding. We conclude that $\eta_{\rm e}$ must be lower than expected from the modelling of high
energy processes in MSP inner magnetospheres. For leptons accelerated with the power law spectrum
in the MSP wind regions, $\eta_{\rm e}$ is constrained to be much lower than derived for the wind regions
around classical pulsars. These constraints are valid for the expected range of magnetic field
strengths within the GC and for the range of likely energies of leptons injected from the inner magnetospheres,
provided that the leptons are not removed from the globular cluster very efficiently due to advection
process. We discuss consequences of these constraints for the models of radiation processes around
millisecond pulsars.
