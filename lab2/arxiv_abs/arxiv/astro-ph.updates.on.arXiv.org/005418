Visualisation of data is critical to understanding astronomical phenomena. Today, many instruments
produce datasets that are too big to be downloaded to a local computer, yet many of the visualisation
tools used by astronomers are deployed only on desktop computers. Cloud computing is increasingly
used to provide a computation and simulation platform in astronomy, but it also offers great potential
as a visualisation platform. Virtual hosted desktops, with graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
allow interactive, graphics-intensive desktop applications to operate co-located with astronomy
datasets stored in remote data centres. By combining benchmarking and user experience testing,
with a cohort of 20 astronomers, we investigate the viability of replacing physical desktop computers
with virtual hosted desktops. In our work, we compare two Apple MacBook computers (one old and one
new, representing hardware and opposite ends of the useful lifetime) with two virtual hosted desktops:
one commercial (Amazon Web Services) and one in a private research cloud (the Australian Nectar
Research Cloud). For two-dimensional image-based tasks and graphics-intensive three-dimensional
operations -- typical of astronomy visualisation workflows -- we found that benchmarks do not necessarily
provide the best indication of performance. When compared to typical laptop computers, virtual
hosted desktops can provide a better user experience, even with lower performing graphics cards.
We also found that virtual hosted desktops are equally simple to use, provide greater flexibility
in choice of configuration, and may actually be a more cost-effective option for typical usage profiles.
