The present work contains light curve, spectroscopic and asteroseismic analyses for KIC 04851217
and KIC 10686876. These systems are detached eclipsing binaries hosting a pulsating component
of delta Scuti type and have been observed with the unprecedented accuracy of the Kepler space telescope.
Using ground based spectroscopic observations, the spectral types of the primary components of
the systems were estimated as A6V and A5V for KIC 04851217 and KIC 10686876, respectively, with an
uncertainty of one subclass. The present spectral classification together with literature radial
velocities curves were used to model the light curves of the systems and, therefore, to calculate
the absolute parameters of their components with higher certainty. The photometric data were analysed
using standard eclipsing binary modeling techniques, while their residuals were further analysed
using Fourier transformation techniques in order to extract the pulsation frequencies of their
host delta Scuti stars. The oscillation modes of the independent frequencies were identified using
theoretical models of delta Scuti stars. The distances of the systems were calculated using the
relation between the luminosity and the pulsation period for delta Scuti stars. The physical and
the oscillation properties of the pulsating components of these systems are discussed and compared
with others of the same type. Moreover, using all the currently known cases of delta Scuti stars in
detached binaries, updated correlations between orbital and dominant pulsation periods and between
log g and pulsation periods were derived. It was found that the proximity of the companion plays significant
role to the evolution of the pulsational frequencies.
