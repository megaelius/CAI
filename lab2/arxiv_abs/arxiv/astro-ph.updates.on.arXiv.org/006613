We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of
the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base $\Lambda$CDM"
in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A
combined analysis gives dark matter density $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.120\pm 0.001$, baryon density $\Omega_b
h^2 = 0.0224\pm 0.0001$, scalar spectral index $n_s = 0.965\pm 0.004$, and optical depth $\tau =
0.054\pm 0.007$ (in this abstract we quote $68\,\%$ confidence regions on measured parameters
and $95\,\%$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to $0.03\,\%$ precision,
with $100\theta_*=1.0411\pm 0.0003$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological
model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions.
Assuming the base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble
constant $H_0 = (67.4\pm 0.5)$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter $\Omega_m = 0.315\pm 0.007$;
and matter fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.811\pm 0.006$. We find no compelling evidence for
extensions to the base-$\Lambda$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra
relativistic degrees of freedom to be $N_{\rm eff} = 2.99\pm 0.17$, and the neutrino mass is tightly
constrained to $\sum m_\nu< 0.12$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes
than predicted in base -$\Lambda$CDM at over $2\,\sigma$, which pulls some parameters that affect
the lensing amplitude away from the base-$\Lambda$CDM model; however, this is not supported by
the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. (Abridged)
