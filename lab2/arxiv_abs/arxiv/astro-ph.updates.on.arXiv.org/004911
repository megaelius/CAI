We examine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), dust and atomic/molecular emission toward
the Galactic bulge using Spitzer Space Telescope observations of four fields: C32, C35, OGLE and
NGC 6522. These fields are approximately centered on (l, b) = (0.0{\deg}, 1.0{\deg}), (0.0{\deg},
-1.0{\deg}), (0.4{\deg}, -2.1{\deg}) and (1.0{\deg}, -3.8{\deg}), respectively. Far-infrared
photometric observations complement the Spitzer/IRS spectroscopic data and are used to construct
spectral energy distributions. We find that the dust and PAH emission are exceptionally similar
between C32 and C35 overall, in part explained due to their locations---they reside on or near boundaries
of a 7 Myr-old Galactic outflow event and are partly shock-heated. Within the C32 and C35 fields,
we identify a region of elevated H{\alpha} emission that is coincident with elevated fine-structure
and [O IV] line emission and weak PAH feature strengths. We are likely tracing a transition zone of
the outflow into the nascent environment. PAH abundances in these fields are slightly depressed
relative to typical ISM values. In the OGLE and NGC 6522 fields, we observe weak features on a continuum
dominated by zodiacal dust. SED fitting indicates that thermal dust grains in C32 and C35 have comparable
temperatures to those of diffuse, high-latitude cirrus clouds. Little variability is detected
in the PAH properties between C32 and C35, indicating that a stable population of PAHs dominates
the overall spectral appearance. In fact, their PAH features are exceptionally similar to that
of the M82 superwind, emphasizing that we are probing a local Galactic wind environment.
