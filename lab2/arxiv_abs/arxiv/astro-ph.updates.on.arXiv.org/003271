In recent years, multiple studies have reported substantial populations of large, low-surface-brightness
galaxies in local galaxy clusters. Various theories that aim to explain the presence of such ultra-diffuse
galaxies (UDGs) have since been proposed. A key question that will help to differentiate between
models is whether UDGs have counterparts in lower-mass host haloes, and what their abundance as
a function of halo mass is. In this study we extend our previous study of UDGs in galaxy clusters to
galaxy groups. We measure the abundance of UDGs in 325 spectroscopically-selected groups from
the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We make use of the overlapping imaging from the ESO Kilo-Degree
Survey (KiDS), from which we can identify galaxies with mean surface brightnesses within their
effective radii down to ~25.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the r-band. We are able to measure a significant
overdensity of UDGs (with sizes r_eff > 1.5 kpc) in galaxy groups down to M200=10^12 Msun, a regime
where approximately only 1 in 10 groups contains a UDG that we can detect. We combine measurements
of the abundance of UDGs in haloes that cover three orders of magnitude in halo mass, finding that
their numbers scale quite steeply with halo mass; N_UDG (R<R200) $\propto$ M200^(1.11+/-0.07).
To better interpret this, we also measure the mass-richness relation for brighter galaxies down
to $M^*_r$+2.5 in the same GAMA groups, and find a much shallower relation of N_Bright (R<R200) $\propto$
M200^(0.78+/-0.05). This shows that UDGs are relatively more abundant, compared to bright galaxies,
in massive clusters than in groups. We discuss implications, but whether this difference is related
to a higher destruction rate of UDGs in groups, or whether massive haloes have a positive effect on
their formation, is not yet clear.
