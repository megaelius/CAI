We present a method to produce mock galaxy catalogues with efficient perturbation theory schemes,
which match the number density, power spectra and bispectra in real and in redshift space from N-body
simulations. The essential contribution of this work is the way in which we constrain the bias parameters
in the PATCHY-code. In addition of aiming at reproducing the two-point statistics, we seek the set
of bias parameters, which constrain the univariate halo probability distribution function (PDF)
encoding higher-order correlation functions. We demonstrate that halo catalogues based on the
same underlying dark matter field with a fix halo number density, and accurately matching the power
spectrum (within 2%), can lead to very different bispectra depending on the adopted halo bias model.
A model ignoring the shape of the halo PDF can lead to deviations up to factors of 2. The catalogues
obtained additionally constraining the shape of the halo PDF can significantly lower the discrepancy
in the three-point statistics, yielding closely unbiased bispectra both in real and in redshift
space; which are in general compatible with those corresponding to an N-body simulation within
10% (deviating at most up to 20%). Our calculations show that the constant linear bias of ~2 for Luminous
Red Galaxy (LRG) like galaxies seen in the power spectrum, mainly comes from sampling halos in high
density peaks, choosing a high density threshold rather than from a factor multiplying the dark
matter density field. Our method contributes towards an efficient modelling of the halo/galaxy
distribution required to estimate uncertainties in the clustering measurements from galaxy redshift
surveys. We have also demonstrated that it represents a powerful tool to test various bias models.
