The Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) is currently in its final Acceptance & Testing stages. GPI is
an XAO system based on a tweeter & woofer architecture (43 & 9 actuators respectively across
the pupil), with the tweeter being a Boston Michromachines $64^2$ MEMS device. The XAO AO system
is tightly integrated with a Lyot apodizing coronagraph. Acceptance testing started in February
2013 at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A conclusive acceptance review was held in July
2013 and the instrument was found ready for shipment to the Gemini South telescope on Cerro Pachon,
Chile. Commissioning at the telescope will take place by the end of 2013, matching the summer window
of the southern hemisphere. According to current estimates the 3 year planet finding campaign (890
allocated hours) might discover, image, and spectroscopically analyze 20 to 40 new exo-planets.
Final acceptance testing of the integrated instrument can always bring up surprises when using
cold chamber and flexure rig installations. The latest developments are reported. Also, we will
give an overview of GPI's lab performance, the interplay between subsystems such as the calibration
unit (CAL) with the AO bench. We report on-going optimizations on the AO controller loop to filter
vibrations and last but not least achieved contrast performance applying speckle nulling. Furthermore,
we will give an outlook of possible but challenging future upgrades as the implementation of a predictive
controller or exchanging the conventional 48x48 SH WFS with a pyramid. With the ELT era arising,
GPI will proof as a versatile and path-finding testbed for AO technologies on the next generation
of ground-based telescopes.
