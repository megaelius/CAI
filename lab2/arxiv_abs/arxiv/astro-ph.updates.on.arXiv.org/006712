RATIONALE: The investigation of cryogenic planetary environments as potential harbors for extant
life and/or contemporary sites of organic synthesis represents an emerging focal point in planetary
exploration. Next generation instruments need to be capable of unambiguously determining elemental
and/or molecular stoichiometry via highly accurate mass measurements and the separation of isobaric
interferences. METHODS: An OrbitrapTM analyzer adapted for spaceflight (referred to as the CosmOrbitrap),
coupled with a commercial pulsed UV laser source (266 nm), is shown to successfully characterize
a variety of planetary analog samples via ultrahigh resolution laser desorption/ablation mass
spectrometry. The materials analyzed in this study include: jarosite (a hydrous sulfate detected
on Mars); magnesium sulfate (a potential component of the subsurface ocean on Europa); uracil (a
nucleobase of RNA); and a variety of amino acids. RESULTS: The instrument configuration tested
here enables: measurement of major elements and organic molecules with ultrahigh mass resolution
(m/{\Delta}m higher than 120,000, FWHM); quantification of isotopic abundances with 1.0% (2{\sigma})
precision; and, identification of highly accurate masses within 3.2 ppm of absolute values. The
analysis of a residue of a dilute solution of amino acids demonstrates the capacity to detect twelve
amino acids in positive ion mode at concentrations as low as 1 pmol/mm2 while maintaining mass resolution
and accuracy requirements. CONCLUSIONS: The CosmOrbitrap mass analyzer is highly sensitive and
delivers mass resolution/accuracy unmatched by any instrument sent into orbit or launched into
deep space. This prototype instrument, which maps to a spaceflight implementation, represents
a missionenabling technology capable of advancing planetary exploration for decades to come.
