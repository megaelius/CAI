We produce simulations of emission of the atomic CII line in large sky fields in order to determine
the current prospects for mapping this line during the high redshift Epoch of Reionization. We estimate
the CII line intensity, redshift evolution and spatial fluctuations using observational relations
between CII emission and the SFR in a galaxy for the frequency range of 200 GHz to 300 GHz. We obtained
a frequency averaged intensity of CII emission of ${\rm I_{\rm CII}=(4 \pm 2)\times10^{2}\, Jy\,
\rm sr^{-1}}$ in the redshift range $z\, \sim\, 5.3\, -\, 8.5$. Observations of CII emission in this
frequency range will suffer contamination from emission lines at lower redshifts, in particular
from the CO rotation lines. For the relevant frequency range we estimated the CO contamination (originated
in emission from galaxies at $z\, <\, 2.5$), using simulations, to be ${\rm I_{\rm CO} \approx
10^{3}\, Jy \, sr^{-1}}$ and independently confirmed the result based in observational relations.
We generated maps as a function of angle and frequency using detailed simulations of the CII and CO
emission across several redshifts in order to properly take into account the observational pipeline
and light cone effects. In order to reduce the foreground contamination we found that we should mask
galaxies below redshifts $\sim 2.5$ with a CO flux in one of the CO(J:2-1) to CO(J:6-5) lines higher
than ${\rm 5\times 10^{-22}\, W\ m^{-2}}$ or a AB magnitude lower than ${\rm m_{\rm K}\, =\, 22}$.
We estimate that the additional continuum contamination is of the order of ${\rm 10^{-1}\, Jy\,
sr^{-1}}$ and so a lot lower than the predicted CII signal. It is also considered the possibility
of cross correlating foreground lines with galaxies in order to probe the intensity of the foregrounds.
