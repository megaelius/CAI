Habitable planets are often defined as terrestrial worlds capable of maintaining surface liquid
water. As a result, atmospheric water vapor can be a critical indicator of habitability. Thus, habitability-themed
exoplanet investigations emphasize detection of water vapor signatures for their targets. A variety
of concept missions for exoplanet direct imaging in reflected light have seen recent study, including
the HabEx and LUVOIR concepts. Here, it is important to understand how direct imaging in reflected
light --- coupled with moderate-resolution spectroscopy --- could be used to detect various water
vapor amounts in Earth-like exoplanetary atmospheres. To investigate water vapor detection for
terrestrial exoplanets, we generated reflectance spectra over a grid of water vapor column masses
and used an instrument model to explore requisite integration times for spectral feature detection
at either visible or near-infrared wavelengths. Lower-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy
is generally optimal for detecting water vapor in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets when
using direct imaging in reflected light. This holds true for dry or cold terrestrial planets, whose
atmospheres would contain relatively little water vapor. Atmospheres richer in water vapor, such
as planets undergoing a moist or runaway greenhouse, could have water vapor efficiently detected
at visible wavelengths. Understanding details like an exoplanet's size, temperature, and location
relative to the habitable zone can aid in determining appropriate wavelength ranges for atmospheric
characterization. Overall, water vapor detection for Earth-like exoplanets is quite feasible
for future direct imaging missions.
