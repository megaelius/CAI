We report the results of searching pulsar-like candidates from the unidentified objects in the
$3^{\rm rd}$ Catalog of Hard Fermi-LAT sources (3FHL). Using a machine-learning based classification
scheme with a nominal accuracy of $\sim98\%$, we have selected 27 pulsar-like objects from 200 unidentified
3FHL sources for an identification campaign. Using archival data, X-ray sources are found within
the $\gamma-$ray error ellipses of 10 3FHL pulsar-like candidates. Within the error circles of
the much better constrained X-ray positions, we have also searched for the optical/infrared counterparts
and examined their spectral energy distributions. Among our short-listed candidates, the most
secure identification is the association of 3FHL J1823.3-1339 and its X-ray counterpart with the
globular cluster Mercer 5. The $\gamma-$rays from the source can be contributed by a population
of millisecond pulsars residing in the cluster. This makes Mercer 5 as one of the slowly growing hard
$\gamma-$ray population of globular clusters with emission $>10$ GeV. Very recently, another
candidate picked by our classification scheme, 3FHL J1405.1-6118, has been identified as a new
$\gamma-$ray binary with an orbital period of $13.7$ days. Our X-ray analysis with a short Chandra
observation has found a possible periodic signal candidate of $\sim1.4$ hrs and a putative extended
X-ray tail of $\sim20$ arcsec long. Spectral energy distribution of its optical/infrared counterpart
conforms with a blackbody of $T_{\rm bb}\sim40000$ K and $R_{\rm bb}\sim12R_{\odot}$ at a distance
of 7.7 kpc. This is consistent with its identification as an early O star as found by infrared spectroscopy.
