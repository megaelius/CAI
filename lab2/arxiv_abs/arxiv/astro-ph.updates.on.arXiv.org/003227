We present measurements of the anisotropic galaxy clustering from the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS
sample of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We analyze the broad-range
shape of the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions to obtain constraints, at the effective
redshift $z=0.57$ of the sample, on the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$, the angular-diameter distance
$D_A(z)$, the normalized growth rate $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, the physical matter density $\Omega_m
h^2$, and the biased amplitude of matter fluctuation b\sigma_8(z). We obtain {$H(0.57)$, $D_A(0.57)$,
$f(0.57)\sigma_8(0.57)$, $\Omega_m h^2$, $b\sigma_8(0.57)$} = {$87.6_{-6.8}^{+6.7}$, $1396\pm73$,
$0.126_{-0.010}^{+0.008}$, $1.19\pm0.14$, $0.428\pm0.066$} and their covariance matrix as
well. The parameters which are not well constrained by our of galaxy clustering analysis are marginalized
over with wide flat priors. Since no priors from other data sets (i.e., CMB) are adopted and no dark
energy models are assumed, our results from BOSS CMASS galaxy clustering alone may be combined with
other data sets, i.e. CMB, SNe, lensing or other galaxy clustering data to constrain the parameters
of a given cosmological model. We show that the major power on constraining dark energy from the anisotropic
galaxy clustering signal, as compared to the angular-averaged one (monopole), arises from including
the normalized growth rate $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$. In the case of the wCDM cosmological model our single-probe
CMASS constraints, combined with CMB (WMAP9+SPT), yield a value for the dark energy equation of
state parameter of $w=-0.90\pm0.11$. Therefore, it is important to include $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$
while investigating the nature of dark energy with current and upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys.
