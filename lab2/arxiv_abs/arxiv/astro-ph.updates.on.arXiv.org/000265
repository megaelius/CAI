In this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of a sample of \gamma-ray bursts
complete in redshift. The selection criteria of the sample are based on observational high-energy
parameters of the prompt emission and therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines.
It is therefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population of \gamma-ray bursts.
Our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinction of \gamma-ray burst afterglows in
our sample does not follow a single distribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag,
and 50% suffer from less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. The remaining 13% of the afterglows are highly
absorbed. The true percentage of \gamma-ray burst afterglows showing high absorption could be
even higher since a fair fraction of the events without reliable redshift measurement are probably
part of this class. These events may be due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions
associated with the \gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or to
massive dusty host galaxies. No clear evolution in the dust extinction properties is evident within
the redshift range of our sample, although the largest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected
peak of the star formation rate. Those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,
by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. A correlation between optical/near-infrared
extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density based on X-ray studies is shown although the
observed NH appears to be well in excess compared to those observed in the Local Group. Dust extinction
does not seem to correlate with GRB energetics or luminosity.
