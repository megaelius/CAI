We evaluate the capabilities of Schwarzschild's orbit-superposition method by applying it to
galaxies from the large scale, high resolution Illustris simulation. Nine early-type galaxies
with a range of triaxiality are selected, and we create mock integral field unit data for five line-of-sight
projections of each galaxy. Each of the 45 mock data sets is taken as an independent observed galaxy.
Using van den Bosch's 2008 triaxial Schwarzschild implementation, we assess model estimates of
various galaxy properties, covering mass profiles, intrinsic shapes, stellar orbit distributions
and velocity anisotropies. Total mass within $\overline{R_{\rm e}}$ is recovered well with average
deviations within $\pm15$ percent. Stellar mass is underestimated by $\sim24$ percent and dark
matter overestimated by $\sim38$ percent (assuming an NFW dark matter profile and allowing for
degeneracy between stellar mass and dark matter mass). Using a gNFW profile, these values improve
to $\sim13$ percent for stellar mass and $\sim18$ percent for dark matter. Axis ratio estimates
show a moderate bias of $\Delta (b/a)=0.07$ and $\Delta (c/a)=0.14$ ($a\ge b\ge c$). Distributions
of the orbit circularities $\lambda_z$ and $\lambda_x$, representing rotation about the minor
and major axes, are well reconstructed. Separating orbits into thermal categories, our models
match the average fractions of these categories to within $10$ percent. Velocity anisotropy is
well estimated with values matching in the inner regions but becoming slightly radially biased
in the outer regions. Overall, the galaxy property estimates we obtained using Schwarzschild modelling
are not implausible and are representative of the simulated galaxies we modelled.
