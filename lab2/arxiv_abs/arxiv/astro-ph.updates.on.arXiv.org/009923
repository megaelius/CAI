The ESA PLATO space mission is devoted to unveiling and characterizing new extrasolar planets and
their host stars. This mission will encompass a very large field of view, granting it the potential
to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget
of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at
the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction
is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is
thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered
three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask
giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. An innovative criterion
was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing
the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined
the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing
events. Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher
noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency
in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant
stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than
weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to $\sim$30\% less false transit signatures
at $7.1\sigma$. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for
the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially
reduced occurrence of false positives.
