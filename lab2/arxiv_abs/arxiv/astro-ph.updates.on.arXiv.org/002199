We model the solar horizontal velocity power spectrum at scales larger than granulation using a
two-component approximation to the mass continuity equation. The model takes four times the density
scale height as the integral (driving) scale of the vertical motions at each depth. Scales larger
than this decay with height from the deeper layers. Those smaller are assumed to follow a Kolomogorov
turbulent cascade, with the total power in the vertical convective motions matching that required
to transport the solar luminosity in a mixing length formulation. These model components are validated
using large scale radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We reach two primary conclusions: 1. The
model predicts significantly more power at low wavenumbers than is observed in the solar photospheric
horizontal velocity spectrum. 2. Ionization plays a minor role in shaping the observed solar velocity
spectrum by reducing convective amplitudes in the regions of partial helium ionization. The excess
low wavenumber power is also seen in the fully nonlinear three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic
simulations employing a realistic equation of state. This adds to other recent evidence suggesting
that the amplitudes of large scale convective motions in the Sun are significantly lower than expected.
Employing the same feature tracking algorithm used with observational data on the simulation output,
we show that the observed low wavenumber power can be reproduced in hydrodynamic models if the amplitudes
of large scale modes in the deep layers are artificially reduced. Since the large scale modes have
reduced amplitudes, modes on the scale of supergranulation and smaller remain important to convective
heat flux even in the deep layers, suggesting that small scale convective correlations are maintained
through the bulk of the solar convection zone.
