We describe a likelihood analysis using MasterCode of variants of the MSSM in which the soft supersymmetry-breaking
parameters are assumed to have universal values at some scale $M_{in}$ below the supersymmetric
grand unification scale $M_{GUT}$, as can occur in mirage mediation and other models. In addition
to $M_{in}$, such `sub-GUT' models have the 4 parameters of the CMSSM, namely a common gaugino mass
$m_{1/2}$, a common soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar mass $m_0$, a common trilinear mixing
parameter $A$ and the ratio of MSSM Higgs vevs $\tan\beta$, assuming that the Higgs mixing parameter
$\mu > 0$. We take into account constraints on strongly- and electroweakly-interacting sparticles
from $\sim 36$/fb of LHC data at 13 TeV and the LUX and 2017 PICO, XENON1T and PandaX-II searches for
dark matter scattering, in addition to the previous LHC and dark matter constraints as well as full
sets of flavour and electroweak constraints. We find a preference for $M_{in} \sim 10^5$ to $10^9$
GeV, with $M_{in} \sim M_{GUT}$ disfavoured by $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 3$ due to the ${\rm BR}(B_{s,
d} \to \mu^+\mu^-)$ constraint. The lower limits on strongly-interacting sparticles are largely
determined by LHC searches, and similar to those in the CMSSM. We find a preference for the LSP to be
a Bino or Higgsino with $\tilde{\chi^0_1} \sim 1$ TeV, with annihilation via heavy Higgs bosons
$H/A$ and stop coannihilation, or chargino coannihilation, bringing the cold dark matter density
into the cosmological range. We find that spin-independent dark matter scattering is likely to
be within reach of the planned LUX-Zeplin and XENONnT experiments. We probe the impact of the $(g-2)_\mu$
constraint, finding similar results whether or not it is included.
