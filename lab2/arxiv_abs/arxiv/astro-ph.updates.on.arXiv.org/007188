We present a multi-wavelength analysis based on archival radio, optical and X-ray data of the complex
radio source 3C 196.1, whose host is the brightest cluster galaxy of a $z=0.198$ cluster. HST data
show H$\alpha$+[N II] emission aligned with the jet 8.4 GHz radio emission. An H$\alpha$+[N II]
filament coincides with the brightest X-ray emission, the northern hotspot. Analysis of the X-ray
and radio images reveals cavities located at galactic- and cluster- scales. The galactic-scale
cavity is almost devoid of 8.4 GHz radio emission and the south-western H$\alpha$+[N II] emission
is bounded (in projection) by this cavity. The outer cavity is co-spatial with the peak of 147 MHz
radio emission, and hence we interpret this depression in X-ray surface brightness as being caused
by a buoyantly rising bubble originating from an AGN outburst $\sim$280 Myrs ago. A \textit{Chandra}
snapshot observation allowed us to constrain the physical parameters of the cluster, which has
a cool core with a low central temperature $\sim$2.8 keV, low central entropy index $\sim$13 keV
cm$^2$ and a short cooling time of $\sim$500 Myr, which is $<0.05$ of the age of the Universe at this
redshift. By fitting jumps in the X-ray density we found Mach numbers between 1.4 and 1.6, consistent
with a shock origin. We also found compelling evidence of a past merger, indicated by a morphology
reminiscent of gas sloshing in the X-ray residual image. Finally, we computed the pressures, enthalpies
$E_{cav}$ and jet powers $P_{jet}$ associated with the cavities: $E_{cav}\sim7\times10^{58}$
erg, $P_{jet}\sim1.9\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the inner cavity and $E_{cav}\sim3\times10^{60}$
erg, $P_{jet}\sim3.4\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the outer cavity.
