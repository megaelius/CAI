We consider a static, axially symmetric spacetime describing the superposition of a Schwarzschild
black hole (BH) with a thin and heavy accretion disk. The BH-disk configuration is a solution of the
Einstein field equations within the Weyl class. The disk is sourced by a distributional energy-momentum
tensor and it is located at the equatorial plane. It can be interpreted as two streams of counter-rotating
particles, yielding a total vanishing angular momentum. The phenomenology of the composed system
depends on two parameters: the fraction of the total mass in the disk, $m$, and the location of the
inner edge of the disk, $a$. We start by determining the sub-region of the space of parameters wherein
the solution is physical, by requiring the velocity of the disk particles to be sub-luminal and real.
Then, we study the null geodesic flow by performing backwards ray-tracing under two scenarios.
In the first scenario the composed system is illuminated by the disk and in the second scenario the
composed system is illuminated by a far-away celestial sphere. Both cases show that, as $m$ grows,
the shadow becomes more prolate. Additionally, the first scenario makes clear that as $m$ grows,
for fixed $a$, the geometrically thin disk appears optically enlarged, i.e., thicker, when observed
from the equatorial plane. This is to due to light rays that are bent towards the disk, when backwards
ray traced. In the second scenario, these light rays can cross the disk (which is assumed to be transparent)
and may oscillate up to a few times before reaching the far away celestial sphere. Consequently,
an almost equatorial observer sees different patches of the sky near the equatorial plane, as a chaotic
"mirage". As $m\rightarrow 0$ one recovers the standard test, i.e., negligible mass, disk appearance.
