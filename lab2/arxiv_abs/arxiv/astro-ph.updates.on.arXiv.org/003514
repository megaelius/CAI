The dearth of dwarf galaxies in the local universe is hard to reconcile with the large number of low
mass haloes expected within the concordance $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this paper we perform a systematic
evaluation of the uncertainties affecting the measurement of DM halo abundance using galaxy kinematics.
Using a large sample of dwarf galaxies with spatially resolved kinematic data we derive a correction
to obtain the observed abundance of galaxies as a function of their halo maximum circular velocity
from the line-of-sight velocity function in the Local Volume. This estimate provides a direct means
of comparing the predictions of theoretical models and simulations (including nonstandard cosmologies
and novel galaxy formation physics) to the observational constraints. The new "galactic $V_{max}$"
function is steeper than the line-of-sight velocity function but still shallower than the theoretical
CDM expectation, showing that some unaccounted physical process is necessary to reduce the abundance
of galaxies and/or drastically modify their density profiles compared to CDM haloes. Using this
new galactic $V_{max}$ function, we investigate the viability of baryonic solutions such as feedback-powered
outflows and photoevaporation of gas from an ionising radiation background. At the 3-$\sigma$
confidence level neither energetic feedback nor photoevaporation are effective enough to reconcile
the disagreement. In the case of maximum baryonic effects, the theoretical estimate still deviates
significantly from the observations for $V_{max} < 60$ km/s. CDM predicts at least 1.8 times more
galaxies with $V_{max} = 50$ km/s and 2.5 times more than observed at $30$ km/s. Recent hydrodynamic
simulations seem to resolve the discrepancy but disagree with the properties of observed galaxies
with resolved kinematics. (abridged)
