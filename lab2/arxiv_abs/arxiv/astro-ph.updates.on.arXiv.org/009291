The large-scale CMB B-mode polarization is the direct probe to the low frequency primordial gravitational
wave signal. However, unambiguous measurement of this signal requires a precise understanding
of the possible contamination. One such potential contamination arises from the patchiness in
the spatial distribution of free electrons during the epoch of reionization. We estimate the B-mode
power spectrum due to patchy reionization using a combination of \emph{photon-conserving} semi-numerical
simulation and analytical calculation, and compare its amplitude with the primordial B-mode signal.
For a reionization history which is in agreement with several latest observations, we find that
a stronger secondary B-mode polarization signal is produced when the reionization is driven by
the sources in massive halos and its amplitude can be comparable to the recombination bump for tensor
to scalar ratio $(r) \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. If contamination from patchy reionization is neglected
in the analysis of B-mode polarization data, then for the models of reionization considered in this
analysis, we find a maximum bias of about $30\%$ in the value of $r=\,10^{-3}$ when spatial modes
between $\ell \in [50, 200]$ are used with a delensing efficiency of $50\%$. The inferred bias from
patchy reionization is not a severe issue for the upcoming ground-based CMB experiment Simons Observatory,
but can be a potential source of confusion for proposed CMB experiments which target to detect the
value of $r< 10^{-3}$. However, this obstacle can be removed by utilizing the difference in the shape
of the power spectrum from the primordial signal.
