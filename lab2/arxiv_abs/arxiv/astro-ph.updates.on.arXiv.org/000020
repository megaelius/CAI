We investigate the non-linear evolution of the relic cosmic neutrino background by running large
box-size, high resolution N-body simulations. Our set of simulations explore the properties of
neutrinos in a reference $\Lambda$CDM model with total neutrino masses between 0.05-0.60 eV in
cold dark matter haloes of mass $10^{11}-10^{15}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$, over a redshift range
$z=0-2$. We compute the halo mass function and show that it is reasonably well fitted by the Sheth-Tormen
formula. More importantly, we focus on the CDM and neutrino properties of the density and peculiar
velocity fields in the cosmological volume, inside and in the outskirts of virialized haloes. The
dynamical state of the neutrino particles depends strongly on their momentum: whereas neutrinos
in the low velocity tail behave similarly to CDM particles, neutrinos in the high velocity tail are
not affected by the clustering of the underlying CDM component. We find that the neutrino (linear)
unperturbed momentum distribution is modified and mass and redshift dependent deviations from
the expected Fermi-Dirac distribution are in place both in the cosmological volume and inside haloes.
The neutrino density profiles around virialized haloes have been carefully investigated and a
simple fitting formula is provided. The neutrino profile, unlike the cold dark matter one, is found
to be cored with core size and central density that depend on the neutrino mass, redshift and mass
of the halo, for halos of masses larger than $\sim 10^{13.5}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. For lower masses
the neutrino profile is best fitted by a simple power-law relation in the range probed by the simulations.
Our findings are particularly important in view of upcoming large-scale structure surveys, like
Euclid, that are expected to probe the non-linear regime at the percent level with lensing and clustering
observations.
