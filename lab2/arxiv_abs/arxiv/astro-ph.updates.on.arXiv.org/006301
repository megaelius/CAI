We have identified a new supernova remnant (SNR), G51.04+0.07 (G51.04), using observations at
74 MHz from the VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey Redux. Earlier, higher frequency radio continuum,
recombination line, and infrared data had correctly inferred the presence of nonthermal radio
emission within a large complex including ionised nebulae and active star formation. However,
our observations have allowed us to redefine at least one SNR as a relatively small source (7'.5 x
3' in size) located at the southern periphery of the originally defined SNR candidate. The integrated
flux density of G51.04 at 74 MHz is 6.1 +/- 0.8 Jy, while its radio continuum spectrum has a slope alpha=-0.52
+/- 0.05, typical of a shell-type remnant. We also measured spatial variations in the spectral index
between 74 and 1400~MHz across the source, ranging from a steeper spectrum (alpha~-0.50) coincident
with the brightest emission to a flatter component (alpha~-0.30) in the surrounding fainter region.
To probe the interstellar medium into which the redefined SNR is likely evolving, we have analysed
the surrounding atomic and molecular gas using the 21~cm neutral hydrogen (HI) and 13CO (J=1-0)
emissions. We found that G51.04 is confined within an HI cavity and that its radio emission is consistent
with the remains of a stellar explosion that occurred ~6300 yr ago at a distance of ~7.7 kpc. Kinematic
data suggest that the newly discovered SNR lies in front of HII regions in the complex, consistent
with the lack of a low frequency turnover in the continuum spectrum. The CO observations revealed
molecular material that traces the central and northern parts of G51.04. The interaction between
the cloud and the radio source is not conclusive. The relatively low flux density (~1.5 Jy at 1400
MHz) of G51.04 is consistent with many similar SNRs hidden along complex lines of sight towards inner
Galactic emission complexes.
