We consider the decoherence effects in the propagation of neutrinos in a background composed of
a scalar particle and a fermion due to the non-forward neutrino scattering processes. Using a simple
model for the coupling of the form $\bar f_R\nu_L\phi$ we calculate the contribution to the imaginary
part of the neutrino self-energy arising from the non-forward neutrino scattering processes in
such backgrounds, from which the damping terms are determined. In the case we are considering, in
which the initial neutrino state is depleted but does not actually disappear (the initial neutrino
transitions into a neutrino of a different flavor but does not decay into a $f\phi$ pair, for example),
we associate the damping terms with decoherence effects. For this purpose we give a precise prescription
to identify the decoherence terms, as used in the context of the master or Linblad equation, in terms
of the damping terms we have obtained from the calculation of the imaginary part of the neutrino self-energy
from the non-forward neutrino scattering processes. The results can be directly useful in the context
of Dark Matter-neutrino interaction models in which the scalar and/or fermion constitute the dark-matter,
and can also serve to guide the generalizations to other models and/or situations in which the decoherence
effects in the propagation of neutrinos originate from the non-forward scattering processes may
be important. As a guide to estimating such decoherence effects, the contributions to the absorptive
part of the self-energy and the corresponding damping terms are computed explicitly in the context
of the model we consider, for several limiting cases of the momentum distribution functions of the
background particles.
