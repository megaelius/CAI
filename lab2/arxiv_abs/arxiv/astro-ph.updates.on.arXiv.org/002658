We present constraints on the parameters of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model in the presence
of massive neutrinos, using the one-dimensional Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum obtained with
the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by Palanque-Delabrouille
et al. (2013), complemented by additional cosmological probes. The interpretation of the measured
Ly$\alpha$ spectrum is done using a second-order Taylor expansion of the simulated power spectrum.
BOSS Ly$\alpha$ data alone provide better bounds than previous Ly$\alpha$ results, but are still
poorly constraining, especially for the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$, for which we obtain
an upper bound of 1.1~eV (95\% CL), including systematics for both data and simulations. Ly$\alpha$
constraints on $\Lambda$CDM parameters and neutrino masses are compatible with CMB bounds from
the Planck collaboration. Interestingly, the combination of Ly$\alpha$ with CMB data reduces
the uncertainties significantly, due to very different directions of degeneracy in parameter
space, leading to the strongest cosmological bound to date on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu
< 0.15$~eV at 95\% CL (with a best-fit in zero). Adding recent BAO results further tightens this
constraint to $\sum m_\nu < 0.14$~eV at 95\% CL. This bound is nearly independent of the statistical
approach used, and of the different combinations of CMB and BAO data sets considered in this paper
in addition to Ly$\alpha$. Given the measured values of the two squared mass differences $\Delta
m^2$, this result tends to favor the normal hierarchy scenario against the inverted hierarchy scenario
for the masses of the active neutrino species.
