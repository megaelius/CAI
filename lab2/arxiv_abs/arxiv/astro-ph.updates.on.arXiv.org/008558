We studied the polarization behavior of the quasar 3C 273 over the 1 mm wavelength band at ALMA with
a total bandwidth of 7.5GHz across 223 to 243 GHz at 0.8 arcsec resolution, corresponding to 2.1 kpc
at the distance of 3C 273. With these observations we were able to probe the optically thin polarized
emission close to the jet base, and constrain the magnetic field structure. We computed the Faraday
rotation measure using simple linear fitting and Faraday rotation measure synthesis. In addition,
we modeled the broadband behavior of the fractional Stokes Q and U parameters (qu-fitting). The
systematic uncertainties in the polarization observations at ALMA were assessed through Monte
Carlo simulations. We find the unresolved core of 3C 273 to be 1.8% linearly polarized. We detect
a very high rotation measure (RM) of ~5.0 x10^5 rad/m^2 over the 1 mm band when assuming a single polarized
component and an external RM screen. This results in a rotation of >40 deg of the intrinsic electric
vector position angle, which is significantly higher than typically assumed for millimeter wavelengths.
The polarization fraction increases as a function of wavelength, which according to our qu-fitting
could be due to multiple polarized components of different Faraday depth within our beam, or internal
Faraday rotation. With our limited wavelength coverage, we cannot distinguish between the cases,
and additional multifrequency and high angular resolution observations are needed to determine
the location and structure of the magnetic field of the Faraday active region. Comparing our RM estimate
with values obtained at lower frequencies, the RM increases as a function of observing frequency,
following a power law with an index of ~2.0 consistent with a sheath surrounding a conically expanding
jet. We also detect ~0.2% circular polarization, although further observations are needed to confirm
this result.
