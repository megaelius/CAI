In a recent work, Kilcik et al. (2017), have detected the temporal and periodic behavior of sunspot
counts (SSC) in flaring (i.e. C, M, or X class flares), and non-flaring active regions for the last
two solar cycles, covering the period: 1996 - 2016. The main results obtained are: 1) The temporal
behavior of monthly means of daily total SSC in flaring and non-flaring active regions are different
and these differences are also varying from cycle to cycle; 2) The periodicities detected in SSC
of flaring and non-flaring active regions are quite different and these variations are also different
from one cycle to another; the highest detected period in the flaring active regions is 113 days,
while there are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and 256 days) in non-flaring regions. The detection
of typical different periodicities in flaring and non-flaring regions can suggests both important
differences and physical interpretation in the magneto-hydrodynamic behavior of the Sun. For
this reason in the present paper we show a further periodicity analysis of the sunspot counts in flaring
and in non-flaring active regions using the same data source of that used by the above cited authors
and applying a powerful wavelet analysis tool which is particularly useful to detect multiscale
features of complex unsteady and unevenly sampled time series. In order to futher support the differences
and similarities found in the time behavior of SSC in flaring and non-flaring regions, we also computed
the behavior of the wavelet entropy, a proper time function which allow us to measure the degree of
complexity in the dynamics of the related time series.
