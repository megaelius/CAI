The cause of hot Jupiter radius inflation, where giant planets with $T_{\rm eq}$ $>1000$ K are significantly
larger than expected, is an open question and the subject of many proposed explanations. Rather
than examine these models individually, this work seeks to characterize the anomalous heating
as a function of incident flux, $\epsilon(F)$, needed to inflate the population of planets to their
observed sizes. We then compare that result to theoretical predictions for various models. We examine
the population of about 300 giant planets with well-determined masses and radii and apply thermal
evolution and Bayesian statistical models to infer the anomalous power as a function of incident
flux that best reproduces the observed radii. First, we observe that the inflation of planets below
about $M=0.5 \;\rm{M}_\rm{J}$ appears very different than their higher mass counterparts, perhaps
as the result of mass loss or an inefficient heating mechanism. As such, we exclude planets below
this threshold. Next, we show with strong significance that $\epsilon(F)$ increases with $T_{\rm{eq}}$
towards a maximum of $\sim 2.5\%$ at $T_{\rm{eq}} \approx 1500$ K, and then decreases as temperatures
increase further, falling to $\sim0.2\%$ at $T_\rm{eff}= 2500$ K. This high-flux decrease in inflation
efficiency was predicted by the Ohmic dissipation model of giant planet inflation but not other
models. We also explicitly check the thermal tides model and find that it predicts far more variance
in radii than is observed. Thus, our results provide evidence for the Ohmic dissipation model and
a functional form for $\epsilon(F)$ that any future theories of hot Jupiter radii can be tested against.
