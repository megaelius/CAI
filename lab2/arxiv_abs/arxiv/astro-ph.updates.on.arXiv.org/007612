We describe results from a new technique for the prediction of complete, self-consistent X-ray
spectra from three-dimensional General Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations
of black hole accretion flows. Density and cooling rate data from a HARM3D GRMHD simulation are processed
by both an improved version of the Monte Carlo radiation transport code PANDURATA (in the corona)
and the Feautrier solver PTRANSX (in the disk), with XSTAR subroutines. The codes are run in a sequential
but iterative fashion to achieve globally energy-conserving and self-consistent radiation fields,
temperature maps, and photoionization equilibria. The output is the X-ray spectrum as seen by a
distant observer. For the example cases we consider here---a non-rotating $10 M_\odot$ black hole
with solar abundances, accreting at 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 Eddington---we find spectra resembling
actual observations of stellar-mass black holes in the soft or steep power-law state: broad thermal
peaks (at 1-3 keV), steep power-laws extending to high energy ($\Gamma$ = 2.7-4.5), and prominent,
asymmetric Fe K$\alpha$ emission lines with equivalent widths in the range 40-400 eV (larger EW
at lower accretion rates). By starting with simulation data, we obviate the need for parameterized
descriptions of the accretion flow geometry---no a priori specification of the corona's shape
or flux, or the disk temperature or density, etc., are needed. Instead, we apply the relevant physical
principles to simulation output using appropriate numerical techniques; this procedure allows
us to calculate inclination-dependent spectra after choosing only a small number of physically
meaningful parameters: black hole mass and spin, accretion rate, and elemental abundances.
