Symplectic integrators are the preferred method of solving conservative $N$-body problems in
cosmological, stellar cluster, and planetary system simulations because of their superior error
properties and ability to compute orbital stability. Newtonian gravity is scale free, and there
is no preferred time or length scale: this is at odds with construction of traditional symplectic
integrators, in which there is an explicit timescale in the time-step. Additional timescales have
been incorporated into symplectic integration using various techniques, such as hybrid methods
and potential decompositions in planetary astrophysics, integrator sub-cycling in cosmology,
and block time-stepping in stellar astrophysics, at the cost of breaking or potentially breaking
symplecticity at a few points in phase space. The justification provided, if any, for this procedure
is that these trouble points where the symplectic structure is broken should be rarely or never encountered
in practice. We consider the case of hybrid integrators, which are used ubiquitously in astrophysics
and other fields, to show that symplecticity breaks at a few points are sufficient to destroy beneficial
properties of symplectic integrators, which is at odds with some statements in the literature.
We show how to solve this problem in the case of hybrid integrators by requiring Lipschitz continuity
of the equations of motion. For other techniques, like time step subdivision, {consequences to
this this problem are not explored here}, and the fact that symplectic structure is broken should
be taken into account by $N$-body simulators, who may find an alternative non-symplectic integrator
performs similarly.
