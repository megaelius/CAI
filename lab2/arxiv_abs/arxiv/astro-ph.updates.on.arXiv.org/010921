We report the serendipitous discovery of a nitrogen-rich, mildly metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-1.08) giant
star in a single-lined spectroscopic binary system found in the SDSS-IV Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2) survey, Data Release 14 (DR14). Previous work has assumed
that the two percent of halo giants with unusual elemental abundances have been evaporated from
globular clusters, but other origins for their abundance signatures, including binary mass transfer,
must also be explored. We present the results of an abundance re-analysis of the APOGEE-2 high-resolution
near-infrared spectrum of 2M12451043+1217401 with the Brussels Automatic Stellar Parameter
(BACCHUS) automated spectral analysis code, and re-derive manually the main element families,
namely the light elements (C, N), elements (O, Mg, Si), iron-peak element (Fe), \textit{s}-process
element (Ce), and the light odd-Z element (Al). Our analysis confirm the N-rich nature of 2M12451043+1217401,
which has a [N/Fe] ratio of $+0.69$, and shows that the abundances of C and Al are slightly discrepant
from that of a typical mildly metal-poor RGB star, but exhibit Mg, Si, O and \textit{s}-process abundances
(Ce) of typical field stars. We also detect a particularly large variability in its radial velocity
over the period of the APOGEE-2 observations, and the most likely orbit fit to the radial velocity
data has a period of $730.89\pm106.86$ days, a velocity semi-amplitude of $9.92 \pm 0.14$ km s$^{-1}$,
and an eccentricity of $\sim 0.1276 \pm0.1174$, which support the hypothesis of a binary companion,
and that has probably been polluted by a now-extinct AGB star.
