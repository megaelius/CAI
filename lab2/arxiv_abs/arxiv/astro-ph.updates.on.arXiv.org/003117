The broad emission lines (BELs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) respond to ionizing continuum variations.
The time and velocity dependence of their response depends on the structure of the broad-line region:
its geometry, kinematics and ionization state. Here, we predict the reverberation signatures
of BELs formed in rotating accretion disc winds. We use a Monte Carlo radiative transfer and ionization
code to predict velocity-delay maps for representative high- (C$~IV$) and low-ionization (H$\alpha$)
emission lines in both high- and moderate-luminosity AGN. Self-shielding, multiple scattering
and the ionization structure of the outflows are all self-consistently taken into account, while
small-scale structure in the outflow is modelled in the micro-clumping approximation. Our main
findings are: (1) The velocity-delay maps of smooth/micro-clumped outflows often contain significant
negative responses. (2)~The reverberation signatures of disc wind models tend to be rotation dominated
and can even resemble the classic "red-leads-blue" inflow signature. (3) Traditional "blue-leads-red"
outflow signatures can usually only be observed in the long-delay limit. (4) Our models predict
lag-luminosity relationships similar to those inferred from observations, but systematically
underpredict the observed centroid delays. (5) The ratio between "virial product" and black hole
mass predicted by our models depends on viewing angle. Our results imply that considerable care
needs to be taken in interpreting data obtained by observational reverberation mapping campaigns.
In particular, basic signatures such as "red-leads-blue", "blue-leads-red" and "blue and red
vary jointly" are not always reliable indicators of inflow, outflow or rotation. This may help to
explain the perplexing diversity of such signatures seen in observational campaigns to date.
