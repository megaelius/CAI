In this paper we present a thorough discussion about the photometric redshift (photo-z) performance
of the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). This survey combines a 7 narrow + 5 broad
passband filter system, with a typical photometric-depth of r$\sim$21 AB. For this exercise, we
utilize the Data Release 1 (DR1), corresponding to 336 deg$^{2}$ from the Stripe-82 region. We rely
on the \texttt{BPZ2} code to compute our estimates, using a new library of SED models, which includes
additional templates for quiescent galaxies. When compared to a spectroscopic redshift control
sample of $\sim$100k galaxies, we find a precision of $\sigma_{z}<$0.8\%, $<$2.0\% or $<$3.0\%
for galaxies with magnitudes r$<$17, $<$19 and $<$21, respectively. A precision of 0.6\% is attained
for galaxies with the highest \texttt{Odds} values. These estimates have a negligible bias and
a fraction of catastrophic outliers inferior to 1\%. We identify a redshift window (i.e., 0.26$<z<$0.32)
where our estimates double their precision, due to the simultaneous detection of two emission-lines
in two distinct narrow-bands; representing a window opportunity to conduct statistical studies
such as luminosity functions. We forecast a total of $\sim$2M, $\sim$16M and $\sim$32M galaxies
in the S-PLUS survey with a photo-z precision of $\sigma_{z}<$1.0\%, $<$2.0\% and $<$2.5\% after
observing 8000 $deg^{2}$. We also derive redshift Probability Density Functions, proving their
reliability encoding redshift uncertainties and their potential recovering the $n(z)$ of galaxies
at $z<0.4$, with an unprecedented precision for a photometric survey in the southern hemisphere.
