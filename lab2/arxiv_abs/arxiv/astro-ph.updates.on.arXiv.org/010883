We report the detection of a new planetary system orbiting the nearby M2.5V star GJ 357, using precision
radial-velocities from three separate echelle spectrographs, HARPS, HiRES, and UVES. Three small
planets have been confirmed in the system, with periods of 9.125$\pm$0.001, 3.9306$\pm$0.0003,
and 55.70$\pm$0.05 days, and minimum masses of 3.33$\pm$0.48, 2.09$\pm$0.32, and 6.72$\pm$0.94
M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. The second planet in our system, GJ 357c, was recently shown to transit
by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; Luque et al. 2019), but we could find no transit
signatures for the other two planets. Dynamical analysis reveals the system is likely to be close
to coplanar, is stable on Myrs timescales, and places strong upper limits on the masses of the two
non-transiting planets b and d of 4.25 and 11.20 M$_{\oplus}$, respectively. Therefore, we confirm
the system contains at least two super-Earths, and either a third super-Earth or mini-Neptune planet.
GJ 357b & c are found to be close to a 7:3 mean motion resonance, however no libration of the orbital
parameters was found in our simulations. Analysis of the photometric lightcurve of the star from
the TESS, when combined with our radial-velocities, reveal GJ 357c has an absolute mass, radius,
and density of $2.087^{+0.319}_{-0.315}$ M$_{\oplus}$, $1.167^{+0.037}_{-0.036}$ R$_{\oplus}$,
and $2.401^{+0.451}_{-0.416}$ gcm$^{-3}$, respectively. Comparison to super-Earth structure
models reveals the planet is likely a predominantly rocky world. The GJ 357 system adds to the small
sample of low-mass planetary systems with well constrained masses, and further observational
and dynamical follow-up is warranted to better understand the overall population of small multi-planet
systems in the solar neighbourhood.
