The development of high-contrast capabilities has long been recognized as one of the top priorities
for the VLTI. As of today, the VLTI routinely achieves contrasts of a few 10$^{-3}$ in the near-infrared
with PIONIER (H band) and GRAVITY (K band). Nulling interferometers in the northern hemisphere
and non-redundant aperture masking experiments have, however, demonstrated that contrasts of
at least a few 10$^{-4}$ are within reach using specific beam combination and data acquisition techniques.
In this paper, we explore the possibility to reach similar or higher contrasts on the VLTI. After
reviewing the state-of-the-art in high-contrast infrared interferometry, we discuss key features
that made the success of other high-contrast interferometric instruments (e.g., integrated optics,
nulling, closure phase, and statistical data reduction) and address possible avenues to improve
the contrast of the VLTI by at least one order of magnitude. In particular, we discuss the possibility
to use integrated optics, proven in the near-infrared, in the thermal near-infrared (L and M bands,
3-5 $\mu$m), a sweet spot to image and characterize young extra-solar planetary systems. Finally,
we address the science cases of a high-contrast VLTI imaging instrument and focus particularly
on exoplanet science (young exoplanets, planet formation, and exozodiacal disks), stellar physics
(fundamental parameters and multiplicity), and extragalactic astrophysics (active galactic
nuclei and fundamental constants). Synergies and scientific preparation for other potential
future instruments such as the Planet Formation Imager are also briefly discussed.
