We propose a local Lagrangian for a point particle where its inertia part is modified in the regime
of small accelerations. %and its potential energy is kept intact. For the standard gravitational
central force, it recovers the deep MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) (accelerations $\ll a_0\approx
10^{-10}$m/s$^{2}$) equations of motion in the case of a circular orbit. Perturbations to that
turn on higher derivative terms, leading to exponentially unstable solutions that must vanish
in order to account for the very small scattering of the Tully-Fisher relation. Unstable solutions
linearly growing with time remain valid for a characteristic timescale of at least 3 billion years.
We show that vertical perturbations recover similar results to dark matter for old galaxies, but
deviations could be present for young ones. We also present ways to probe our approach and describe
some of its subtleties, such as the strong equivalence principle (violated in general), the center
of mass motion of a composite body, and how in some cases it could overcome Ostrogradsky's instabilities
(with naturally occurring piecewise Lagrangians). Our main conclusions regarding our MOND-like
proposal are: (i) it constitutes a possible recipe where Ostrogradsky instabilities could be "tamed";
(ii) it is a falsifiable approach in various contexts and (iii) it might explain simultaneously
some of the issues usual modified gravity MOND and dark matter phenomenologies have difficulties
individually. These aspects seem relevant to start addressing practical ways to differentiate
modified gravity MOND from modified inertia and give insights into alternative ways to tackle some
astrophysical and cosmological puzzles.
