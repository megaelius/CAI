For the first time, we reveal large amounts of cold molecular gas in a ram pressure stripped tail,
out to a large, intracluster distance from the galaxy. With the ESO APEX telescope we have detected
12CO(2-1) emission corresponding to more than 10^9 Msun of molecular gas (assuming a Galactic value
of the CO-to-H_2 conversion factor) in three Ha bright regions along the tail of the Norma cluster
ram pressure stripped galaxy ESO137-001, out to a projected distance of 40 kpc from the disk. The
amount of 1.5x10^8 Msun of H_2 found in the most distant region is similar to molecular masses of tidal
dwarf galaxies. We speculate that a ram pressure dwarf galaxy (RPDG) could be forming in this location.
Along the tail, the amount of molecular gas was found to drop, while masses of the X-ray emitting and
diffuse ionized components stay roughly constant. Moreover, the amounts of hot and cold gas are
large and similar, and together nearly account for the missing gas from the disk. We find a very low
star formation efficiency (tau>10^10 yr) in the stripped gas in ESO~137-001 and suggest that
this is due to a low average gas density in the tail, or turbulent heating of the interstellar medium
that is induced by a ram pressure shock. By means of simple numerical modeling, we suggest that ESO137-001
may be at a high orbital velocity of about 3000 km/s in the Norma cluster, in order to be consistent
with a first infall scenario. The corresponding strong ram pressure would then be able to strip denser
gas than is usual in other known ram pressure stripped galaxies. Such a dense component in the tail
is more able to quickly transform into molecular gas than stripped diffuse gas. The unprecedented
bulk of observed molecular gas in the ESO137-001 tail also suggests that some stripped gas may survive
ram pressure stripping in the molecular phase.
