The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was the highest ranked large space-based mission
of the 2010 New Worlds, New Horizons decadal survey. It is now a NASA mission in formulation with a
planned launch in the mid-2020s. A primary mission objective is to precisely constrain the nature
of dark energy through multiple probes, including Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Here, we present
the first realistic simulations of the WFIRST SN survey based on current hardware specifications
and using open-source tools. We simulate SN light curves and spectra as viewed by the WFIRST wide-field
channel (WFC) imager and integral-field channel (IFC) spectrometer, respectively. We examine
11 survey strategies with different time allocations between the WFC and IFC, two of which are based
upon the strategy described by the WFIRST Science Definition Team, which measures SN distances
exclusively from IFC data. We propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties
to predict the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit (FoM) for each strategy. Of the strategies investigated,
we find the most successful to be WFC-focused. However, further work in constraining systematics
is required to fully optimize the use of the IFC. Even without improvements to other cosmological
probes, the WFIRST SN survey has the potential to increase the FoM by more than an order of magnitude
from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented here have not been fully optimized,
these initial investigations are an important step in the development of the final hardware design
and implementation of the WFIRST mission.
