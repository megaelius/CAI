We present a new class of estimators for computing small-scale power spectra and bispectra in configuration-space
via weighted pair- and triple-counts, with no explicit use of Fourier transforms. Particle counts
are truncated at $R_0\sim 100h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ via a continuous window function, which has
negligible effect on the measured power spectrum multipoles at small scales. This gives a power
spectrum algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(NnR_0^3)$ (or $\mathcal{O}(Nn^2R_0^6)$ for
the bispectrum), measuring $N$ galaxies with number density $n$. Our estimators are corrected
for the survey geometry and have neither self-count contributions nor discretization artifacts,
making them ideal for high-$k$ analysis. Unlike conventional Fourier transform based approaches,
our algorithm becomes more efficient on small scales (since a smaller $R_0$ may be used), thus we
may efficiently estimate spectra across $k$-space by coupling this method with standard techniques.
We demonstrate the utility of the publicly available power spectrum algorithm by applying it to
BOSS DR12 simulations to compute the high-$k$ power spectrum and its covariance. In addition, we
derive a theoretical rescaled-Gaussian covariance matrix, which incorporates the survey geometry
and is found to be in good agreement with that from mocks. Computing configuration- and Fourier-space
statistics in the same manner allows us to consider joint analyses, which can place stronger bounds
on cosmological parameters; to this end we also discuss the cross-covariance between the two-point
correlation function and the small-scale power spectrum.
