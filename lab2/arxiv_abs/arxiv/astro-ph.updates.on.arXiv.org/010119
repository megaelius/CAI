We calculate the sensitivity of space-based cosmic neutrino detection from transient sources
in the context of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) mission using Target-of-Opportunity
(ToO) observations. POEMMA uses two spacecraft each with a large Schmidt telescope to simultaneously
view the optical signals generated by extensive air showers (EASs). POEMMA is designed for both
ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray and very-high-energy neutrino measurements. POEMMA has significant
neutrino sensitivity starting in the 10 PeV decade via measurements of Cherenkov signals from upward-moving
EASs initiated by tau neutrinos interacting in the Earth. For ToO observations, POEMMA uses the
ability to quickly repoint ($90^\circ$ in 500 s) each of the two spacecraft to the direction of the
transient source. POEMMA EAS measurements are performed during astronomical night, leading to
different observational constraints for short- and long-duration bursts. For short-bursts of
order $10^3$ s, POEMMA will increase the sensitivity of existing experiments (e.g., IceCube and
the Pierre Auger Observatory) by up to two orders of magnitude. For long-duration bursts on the scale
of $10^{5-6}$ s, the full celestial sky is available and the average neutrino sensitivity will be
increased by up to a factor of 50, reaching the desired level to probe model predictions of transient
neutrino sources (e.g., of blazar flares as well as both black hole-black hole and neutron star-neutron
star mergers). POEMMA's neutrino sensitivity to various models of transient neutrino sources
are detailed. Altogether, our results demonstrate better sensitivity to ToO neutrino sources
from the space-based POEMMA experiment compared to current ground-based experiments, and more
importantly, demonstrate unique full-sky coverage for ToO neutrino sources.
