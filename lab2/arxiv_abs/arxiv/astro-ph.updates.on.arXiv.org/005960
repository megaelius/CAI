Observations of heavy (${\simeq}2\,M_\odot$) neutron stars in addition to the recent measurement
of tidal deformability from the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, place interesting constraints
on theories of dense matter. Current and future observatories, such as the NICER and ATHENA are expected
to collect information on the global parameters of neutron stars, namely masses and radii, with
the accuracy of a few percent. Such accuracy will allow for precise comparisons of measurements
to models of compact objects. Here we investigate how the measurement accuracy of the NICER and ATHENA
missions will improve our understanding of the dense-matter interior of neutron stars. We compare
global parameters of stellar configurations obtained using three different equations of state:
a reference (SLy4 EOS) and two piecewise polytropes manufactured to produce mass-radius relations
indistinguishable from the observational point of view i.e. within the predicted error of the radius
measurement. We assume observational errors on the radius determination corresponding to the
expected accuracies. The effect of rotation is examined using high-precision numerical relativity
computations. Due to the fact that masses and rotational frequencies might be determined very precisely
in the most optimistic scenario, only the influence of observational errors on the radius measurements
is investigated. We show that ${\pm}5\%$ errors in radius measurement lead to ${\sim}10\%$ and
${\sim}40\%$ accuracy in central parameter estimation, for low-mass and high-mass neutron stars,
respectively. Global parameters, such as oblateness and surface area, can be established with
$8-10\%$ accuracy, even if only compactness (instead of mass and radius) is measured. We also report
on the range of tidal deformabilities corresponding to the estimated masses of GW170817, for the
assumed uncertainty in radius.
