A multifractal formalism is employed to analyse high-precision time-series data of \textit{Kepler}
stars with surface differential rotation traces. The multifractal detrended moving average analysis
(MFDMA) algorithm has been explored to characterize the multi-scale behaviour of the observed
time series from a sample of 662 stars selected with parameters close to those of the Sun, e.g., effective
temperature, mass, effective gravity and rotation period. Among these stars, 141 have surface
differential rotation traces, whereas 521 have no detected differential rotation signatures.
In our sample, we also include the Sun in its active phase. Our results can be summarized in two points:
first, our work suggests that starspots for time series with and without differential rotation
have distinct dynamics, and second, the magnetic fields of active stars are apparently governed
by two mechanisms with different levels of complexity for fluctuations. Throughout the course
of the study, we identified an overall trend whereby the differential rotation is distributed in
two $H$ regimes segregated by the degree of asymmetry $A$, where $H$-index denotes the global Hurst
exponent which is used as a measure of long-term memory of time series. As a result, we show that the
degree of asymmetry can be considered a segregation factor that distinguishes the differential
rotation behaviour when related to the effect of the rotational modulation on the time series. In
summary, the multifractality signals in our sample are the result of magnetic activity control
mechanisms leading to activity-related long-term persistent signatures.
