The Mars thermosphere holds clues to the evolution of the Martian climate, and has practical implications
for spacecraft visiting Mars, which often use it for aerobraking upon arrival, or for landers, which
must pass through it. Nevertheless, it has been sparsely characterized, even when past accelerometer
measurements and remote observations are taken into account. The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile
EvolutioN (MAVEN) orbiter, which includes a number of instruments designed to characterize the
thermosphere, has greatly expanded the available thermospheric observations. This paper presents
new and unanticipated measurements of density and temperature profiles (120-200 km) derived from
solar occultations using the MAVEN Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Monitor. These new measurements
complement and expand MAVEN's intended thermospheric measurement capacity. In particular, because
the local-time is inherently fixed to the terminator, solar occultations are ideally suited for
characterizing long-term and latitudinal variability. Occultation measurements are made during
approximately half of all orbits, resulting in thousands of new thermospheric profiles. The density
retrieval method is presented in detail, including an uncertainty analysis. Altitude-latitude
maps of thermospheric density and temperature at perihelion and aphelion are presented, revealing
structures that have not been previously observed. Tracers of atmospheric dynamics are also observed,
including a high altitude polar warming feature at intermediate latitudes, and an apparent thermostatic
response to solar EUV heating during a solar rotation, which shows heating at high altitudes that
is accompanied by cooling at lower altitudes.
