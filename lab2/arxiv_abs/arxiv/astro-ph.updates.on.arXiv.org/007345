We explore mechanisms to produce extremely high Ly-alpha/HeII flux ratios, or to enhance the observed
number of Ly-alpha photons per incident ionizing photon, in extended AGN-photoionized nebulae
at high-redshift. Using photoionization models, we explore the impact of ionization parameter,
gas metallicity, ionizing spectrum, electron energy distribution, and cloud viewing angle on
the relative fluxes of Ly-alpha, HeII and other lines, and on the observed number of Ly-alpha photons
per incident ionizing photon. We find that low ionization parameter, a relatively soft or filtered
ionizing spectrum, low gas metallicity, kappa-distributed electron energies, or reflection
of Ly-alpha photons by HI can all result in significantly enhanced Ly-alpha relative to other lines
(>10%), with log Ly-alpha/HeII reaching values up to 4.6. In the cases of low gas metallicity, reflection
by HI, or a hard or filtered ionizing spectrum, the observed number of Ly-alpha photons per incident
ionizing photon is itself significantly enhanced above the nominal Case B value of 0.66 due to collisional
excitation, reaching values up to 5.3 in our 'extreme case' model. At low gas metallicity (e.g. 0.1
x Solar), the production of Ly-alpha is predominantly via collisional excitation rather than recombination.
In addition, we find that collisional excitation of Ly-alpha becomes more efficient if the ionizing
continuum is pre-filtered through an optically thin screen of gas closer to the AGN. We also show
that Ly-alpha / HeII ratios of the z~3.5 quasars studied by Borisova et al. (2016) are consistent
with AGN-photoionization of gas with moderate to low metallicity and/or low ionization parameter,
without requiring exotic ionization/excitation mechanisms such as strong line-transfer effects.
We also present UV-optical diagnostic diagrams to distinguish between photoionization by Pop
III stars and AGN photoionization.
