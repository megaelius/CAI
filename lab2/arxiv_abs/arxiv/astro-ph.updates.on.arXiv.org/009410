We search for superflares from 4,068 cool stars in over 2 years of Evryscope photometry, focusing
on those with high-cadence data obtained by both Evryscope and TESS. The Evryscope array of small
telescopes observed 576 large flares from 285 flare stars, with a median energy of 10^34.0 erg. Since
2016, Evryscope has enabled the detection of rare events from all stars observed by TESS through
multi-year, high-cadence continuous observing. We report ~2X the previous largest number of 10^34
erg flares observed from nearby cool stars at high cadence. We find 8 flares that increased the stellar
brightness by at least 3 g' magnitudes, with the largest flare reaching 5.6 magnitudes and releasing
10^36.2 erg. We also observe a 10^34 erg superflare from TOI-455, a mid-M star with a rocky planet
candidate. We measure or constrain the annual superflare rate of each flare star, and explore the
dependence of superflare occurrence upon stellar age and spectral type. We estimate the average
flare behavior of active stars as a function of spectral type, including superflare rates, flare
frequency distributions, and typical flare amplitudes in g'. We also observe an apparent decrease
in large flares at high galactic latitudes. We explore the effects our super-flaring stars may have
on ozone loss to planetary atmospheres: we observe 1 superflare with sufficient energy in the UV
to photo-dissociate all ozone in an Earth-like atmosphere in a single event, and 24 other superflares
that reach at least 10% of this energy. We also find 17 stars that may deplete an Earth-like atmosphere
via repeated flaring; these emit at least 1 flare of 10^34 erg every 10 d. Of the 1690 stars around which
TESS may discover temperate rocky planets, we observe 49 to exhibit large flares.
