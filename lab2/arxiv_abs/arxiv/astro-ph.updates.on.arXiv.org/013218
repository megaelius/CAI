To study the high-transition dense-gas tracers and their relationships to the star formation of
the inner $\sim$ 2 kpc circumnuclear region of NGC253, we present HCN $J=4-3$ and HCO$^+ J=4-3$ maps
obtained with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). With the spatially resolved data, we compute
the concentration indices $r_{90}/r_{50}$ for the different tracers. HCN and HCO$^+$ 4-3 emission
features tend to be centrally concentrated, which is in contrast to the shallower distribution
of CO 1-0 and the stellar component. The dense-gas fraction ($f_\text{dense}$, traced by the velocity-integrated-intensity
ratios of HCN/CO and HCO$^+$/CO) and the ratio $R_\text{31}$ (CO 3-2/1-0) decline towards larger
galactocentric distances, but increase with higher SFR surface density. The radial variation
and the large scatter of $f_\text{dense}$ and $R_\text{31}$ imply distinct physical conditions
in different regions of the galactic disc. The relationships of $f_\text{dense}$ versus $\Sigma_\text{stellar}$,
and SFE$_\text{dense}$ versus $\Sigma_\text{stellar}$ are explored. SFE$_\text{dense}$ increases
with higher $\Sigma_\text{stellar}$ in this galaxy, which is inconsistent with previous work
that used HCN 1-0 data. This implies that existing stellar components might have different effects
on the high-$J$ HCN and HCO$^+$ than their low-$J$ emission. We also find that SFE$_\text{dense}$
seems to be decreasing with higher $f_\text{dense}$, which is consistent with previous works,
and it suggests that the ability of the dense gas to form stars diminishes when the average density
of the gas increases. This is expected in a scenario where only the regions with high-density contrast
collapse and form stars.
