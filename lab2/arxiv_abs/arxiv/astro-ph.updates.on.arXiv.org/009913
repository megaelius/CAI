Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in astroparticle physics experiments to detect light
flashes (e.g. fluorescence or Cherenkov light) from extensive air showers (EASs) initiated by
statistically rare very high energy cosmic particles when travelling through the atmosphere.
Their high amplification factor (gain) allows the detection of very low photon fluxes down to single
photons. At the same time this sensitivity causes the gain and signal-to-noise ratio to decrease
with collected charge over the lifetime of the PMT (referred to as "ageing"). To avoid fast ageing,
many experiments limit the PMT operation to reasonably low night sky background (NSB) conditions.
However, in order to collect more event statistics at the highest energies, it is desirable to extend
the measurement cycle into (part of) nights with higher NSB levels. In case the signal-to-noise
ratio remains large enough in the subsequent reconstruction of the EAS events, lowering the PMT
gain in such conditions can be an option to avoid faster ageing. In this paper, performance studies
under high NSB with Photonis XP3062 PMTs, as used in the fluorescence detector of the Pierre Auger
Observatory, are presented. The results suggest that lowering the PMT gain by a factor of 10 while
increasing the NSB level by a similar factor does not significantly affect the PMT performance and
ageing behaviour so that detection and offline reconstruction of EASs are still possible. Adjusting
the PMT gain according to a changing NSB level throughout a night has been shown to be possible and
it follows a predictable behaviour. This allows to extend the measurement cycles of experiments,
based on PMTs of type Photonis XP3062 or comparable and exposed to the NSB, to enhance the sensitivity
especially at the highest energies where events are very rare.
