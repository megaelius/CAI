Context. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to address numerous questions in astrophysics and
cosmology. Due to their well known spectral and photometric properties, SNe Ia are well suited to
study gas and dust along the lines-of-sight to the explosions. For example, narrow Na I D and Ca II
H&K absorption lines can be studied easily, because of the well-defined spectral continuum of SNe
Ia around these features. Aims. We study the gas and dust along the line-of-sight to iPTF16abc, which
occurred in an unusual location, in a tidal arm, 80 kpc from centre of the galaxy NGC 5221. Methods.
Using a time-series of high-resolution spectra, we examine narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption
features for variations in time, which would be indicative for circumstellar (CS) matter. Furthermore,
we take advantage of the well known photometric properties of SNe Ia to determine reddening due to
dust along the line-of-sight. Results. From the lack of variations in Na I D and Ca II H&K, we determine
that none of the detected absorption features originate from the CS medium of iPTF16abc. While the
Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption is found to be optically thick, a negligible amount of reddening points
to a small column of interstellar dust. Conclusions. We find that the gas along the line-of-sight
to iPTF16abc is typical of what might be found in the interstellar medium (ISM) within a galaxy. It
suggests that we are observing gas that has been tidally stripped during an interaction of NGC 5221
with one of its neighbouring galaxies in the past $\sim10^9$ years. In the future, the gas clouds
could become the locations of star formation. On a longer time scale, the clouds might diffuse, enriching
the circum-galactic medium (CGM) with metals. The gas profile along the line-of-sight should be
useful for future studies of the dynamics of the galaxy group containing NGC 5221.
