Direct detection of gravitational waves (GW) from compact binary systems suggests that the merger
rate of such events is too large to be individually resolved, and thus they can be detected as stochastic
signals. Due to its random nature, cross-correlating the signals from multiple detectors is essential
to disentangle the GWs from instrumental noise. However, the global magnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere
cavity produce the environmental disturbances at low-frequency bands, known as Schumann resonances,
and coupled with GW detectors, they potentially contaminate the stochastic GW signal as a correlated
noise. Previously, we have presented a simple analytical model to estimate its impact on the detection
of stochastic GWs. Here, extending the analysis to further take account of the effects of anisotropic
lightning source distributions, we present a comprehensive study of the impact of correlated magnetic
noise at low-frequency bands, including non-tensor type GWs, as well as circularly polarized tensor-type
GWs. We find that as opposed to a naive expectation, the impact of correlated magnetic noise does
not always increase with anisotropies in the lighting source distribution. Even in the presence
of large anisotropies, there is a robust detector pair for which the amplitude of correlated magnetic
noise becomes comparable to or well below detectable amplitude of stochastic GWs. The results indicate
that the properties of the correlated magnetic noise depends crucially on both the geometrical
and geographical setup of detector's pair, and Virgo and KAGRA would be potentially the most insensitive
detector pair against the correlated magnetic for both tensor- and non-tensor type stochastic
GWs.
