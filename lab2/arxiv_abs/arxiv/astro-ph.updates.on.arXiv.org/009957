Recent observations with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument on the SDO spacecraft
have revealed the existence of decayless coronal kink oscillations. These transverse oscillations
are not connected to any external phenomena like flares or coronal mass ejections, and show significantly
lower amplitudes than the externally excited decaying oscillations. Numerical studies have managed
to reproduce such decayless oscillations in the form of footpoint driven standing waves in coronal
loops, and to treat them as a possible mechanism for wave heating of the solar corona. Our aim is to
investigate the correlation between the observed amplitudes of the oscillations and input the
energy flux from different drivers. We perform 3D MHD simulations in single, straight, density-enhanced
coronal flux tubes for different drivers, in the presence of gravity. Synthetic images at different
spectral lines are constructed with the use of the FoMo code. The development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability leads to mixing of plasma between the flux tube and the hot corona. Once the KHI is fully
developed, the amplitudes of the decayless oscillations show only a weak correlation with the driver
strength. We find that low amplitude decayless kink oscillations may correspond to significant
energy fluxes of the order of the radiative losses for the Quiet Sun. A clear correlation between
the input energy flux and the observed amplitudes from our synthetic imaging data cannot be established.
Stronger drivers lead to higher vales of the line width estimated energy fluxes. Finally, estimations
of the energy fluxes by spectroscopic data are affected by the LOS angle, favoring combined analysis
of imaging and spectroscopic data for single oscillating loops.
