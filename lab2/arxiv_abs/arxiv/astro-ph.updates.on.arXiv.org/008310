Galactic outflows are critical to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. However
the details of the underlying feedback process remain unclear. We compare Ly$\alpha$ observations
of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) with mock observations of their
simulated CGM. We use cosmological hydrodynamical `zoom-in' simulations of an LBG which contains
strong, momentum-driven galactic outflows. Simulation snapshots at $z=2.2$ and $z=2.65$ are
used, corresponding to the available observational data. The simulation is post-processed with
the radiative transfer code \textsc{crash} to account for the impact of ionising photons on hydrogen
gas surrounding the simulated LBG. We generate mock absorption line maps for comparison with data
derived from observed close galaxy-galaxy pairs. We perform calculations of Ly$\alpha$ photons
scattering through the CGM with our newly developed Monte-Carlo code \textsc{slaf}, and compare
to observations of diffuse Ly$\alpha$ halos around LBGs. Our fiducial galactic outflow model comes
closer to reproducing currently observed characteristics of the CGM in Ly$\alpha$ than a reference
inefficient feedback model used for comparison. Nevertheless, our fiducial model still struggles
to reproduce the observed data of the inner CGM (at impact parameter $b<30$kpc). Our results suggest
that galactic outflows affect Ly$\alpha$ absorption and emission around galaxies mostly at impact
parameters $b<50$ kpc, while cold accretion flows dominate at larger distances. We discuss the
implications of this result, and underline the potential constraining power of CGM observations
- in emission and absorption - on galactic outflow models.
