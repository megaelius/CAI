The evolution of galaxies is governed by equations with chaotic solutions: gravity and compressible
hydrodynamics. While this micro-scale chaos and stochasticity has been well studied, it is poorly
understood how it couples to macro-scale properties examined in simulations of galaxy formation.
In this paper, we show how perturbations introduced by floating-point roundoff, random number
generators, and seemingly trivial differences in algorithmic behaviour can produce non-trivial
differences in star formation histories, circumgalactic medium (CGM) properties, and the distribution
of stellar mass. We examine the importance of stochasticity due to discreteness noise, variations
in merger timings and how self-regulation moderates the effects of this stochasticity. We show
that chaotic variations in stellar mass can grow until halted by feedback-driven self-regulation
or gas exhaustion. We also find that galaxy mergers are critical points from which large (as much
as a factor of 2) variations in quantities such as the galaxy stellar mass can grow. These variations
can grow and persist for more than a Gyr before regressing towards the mean. These results show that
detailed comparisons of simulations require serious consideration of the magnitude of effects
compared to run-to-run chaotic variation, and may significantly complicate interpreting the
impact of different physical models. Understanding the results of simulations requires us to understand
that the process of simulation is not a mapping of an infinitesimal point in configuration space
to another, final infinitesimal point. Instead, simulations map a point in a space of possible initial
conditions points to a volume of possible final states.
