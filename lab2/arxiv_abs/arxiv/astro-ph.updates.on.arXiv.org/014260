The Special Collection of papers in this issue of Astrobiology provide an overview of the characteristics
and potential for future exploration of the Ojos del Salado volcano, located in the Andes Mountains
in front of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. The main benefits of this site compared with others
are the combination of strong UV radiation, the presence of permafrost, and geothermal activity
within a dry terrain. The interaction between limited snow events and wind results in snow patches
buried under a dry soil surface. This leads to ephemeral water streams that only flow duringdaytime
hours. On this volcano, which has the highest located subsurface temperature monitoring systems
reported to date, seasonal melting of the permafrost is followed by fast percolation events. This
is due to the high porosity of these soils. The results are landforms that shaped by the strong winds.
At this site, both thermal springs and lakes (the latter arising from melting ice) provide habitats
for life; a 6480m high lake heated by volcanic activity shows both warm and cold sediments that contain
a number of different microbial species, including psychrophiles. Where the permafrost melts,
thawing ponds have formed at 5900m that is dominated by populations of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria,
while in the pond sediments and the permafrost itself Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia are abundant. In turn, fumaroles show
the presence of acidophilic iron-oxidizers and iron-reducing species. In spite of the extreme
conditions reported at Ojos del Salado, this site is easily accessible.
