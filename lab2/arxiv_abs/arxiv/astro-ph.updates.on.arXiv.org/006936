Spectroscopic observations from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared have revealed new and diagnostic
differences among primitive asteroids. We review the spectral characteristics of these asteroids
and their inferred compositional and physical properties. Primitive asteroids throughout the
belt show carbon-rich compounds, varying degrees of aqueous alteration and even surface ice; recent
observations provide significant new constraints on composition, thermal inertia, and other
surface properties. New mid-infrared connections between primitive asteroids and interplanetary
dust particles indicate that the latter sample a larger fraction of main belt asteroids than meteorites.
Links with the composition of comets are consistent with a proposed continuum between primitive
asteroids and comets. Two sample-return missions, OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa 2, will visit primitive
near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). Most spacecraft-accessible NEAs originate in the inner asteroid
belt, which contains several primitive asteroid families and a background of primitive asteroids
outside these families. Initial results from these families offer a tantalizing preview of the
properties expected in the NEAs they produce. So far, primitive asteroids in the inner belt fall
into two spectral groups. The first group includes the Polana-Eulalia families, which show considerable
spectral homogeneity in spite of their dynamical and collisional complexity. In contrast, the
Erigone and Sulamitis families are spectrally diverse and most of their members show clear 0.7 microns
hydration features. The two sample-return targets (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu, most likely
originated in the Polana family.
