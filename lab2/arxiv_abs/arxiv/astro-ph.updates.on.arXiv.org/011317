We present XMM-Newton X-ray observations and analysis of three DES $z>6.5$ quasars (VDES J0020$-$3653
at $z=6.824$, VDES J0244$-$5008 at $z=6.724$ and VDES J0224$-$4711 at $z=6.526$) and six other
quasars with $6.438 < z < 6.747$ from the XMM-Newton public archive. Two of the nine quasars are detected
at a high ($>$4$\sigma$) significance level: VDES J0224$-$4711(z=6.53) at $9\sigma$ and PSO J159$-$02
($z=6.38$) at $8\sigma$. They have a photon index of $\Gamma=1.82^{+0.29}_{-0.27}$ and $\Gamma=1.94^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$
respectively, which is consistent with the mean value of $\sim1.9$ found for quasars at all redshifts.
The rest-frame $2-10$ keV luminosity of VDES J0224$-$4711, is $L_{2-10\mathrm{keV}} = (2.92\pm0.43)\times10^{45}\;\mathrm{erg\;s^{-1}}$,
which makes this quasar one of the most X-ray luminous quasars at $z>5.5$ and the most X-ray luminous
quasar at $z>6.5$, with a luminosity 6 times and 2.5 times larger than ULAS J1120+0641 ($z=7.08$)
and ULAS J1342+0928 ($z=7.54$) respectively. The X-ray-to-optical power-law slopes of the nine
quasars are consistent with the previously observed anti-correlation of $\alpha_{ox}$ with UV
luminosity $L_{2500\mathrm{\AA}}$. We find no evidence for evolution of $\alpha_{ox}$ with redshift
when the anti-correlation with UV luminosity is taken into account. Similar to previous studies
at z$\sim$6 we have found remarkably consistent X-ray spectral properties between low (z$\sim$1)
and high-redshift quasars. Our results add further evidence to the picture that the observable
properties of high luminosity quasars over the UV to X-ray spectral region have not evolved significantly
from $z\sim7$ to the present day and that quasars comparable to local versions existed 800 million
years after the big bang.
