The chemical abundances of spiral galaxies, as probed by HII regions across their disks, are key
to understanding the evolution of galaxies over a wide range of environments. We present LBT/MODS
spectra of 52 HII regions in NGC3184 as part of the CHemical Abundances Of Spirals (CHAOS) project.
We explore the direct-method gas-phase abundance trends for the first four CHAOS galaxies, using
temperature measurements from one or more auroral line detections in 190 individual HII regions.
We find the dispersion in Te-Te relationships is dependent on ionization, as characterized by F_5007/F_3727,
and so recommend ionization-based temperature priorities for abundance calculations. We confirm
our previous results that [NII] and [SIII] provide the most robust measures of electron temperature
in low-ionization zones, while [OIII] provides reliable electron temperatures in high-ionization
nebula. We measure relative and absolute abundances for O, N, S, Ar, and Ne. The four CHAOS galaxies
marginally conform with a universal O/H gradient, as found by empirical IFU studies when plotted
relative to effective radius. However, after adjusting for vertical offsets, we find a tight universal
N/O gradient of alpha_N/O = -0.33 dex/Re with sigma_tot. = 0.08 for Rg/Re < 2.0, where N is dominated
by secondary production. Despite this tight universal N/O gradient, the scatter in the N/O-O/H
relationship is significant. Interestingly, the scatter is similar when N/O is plotted relative
to O/H or S/H. The observable ionic states of S probe lower ionization and excitation energies than
O, which might be more appropriate for characterizing abundances in metal-rich HII regions.
