The current progress in the detection of terrestrial type exoplanets has opened a new avenue in the
characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and in the search for biosignatures of life with
the upcoming ground-based and space missions. To specify the conditions favorable for the origin,
development and sustainment of life as we know it in other worlds, we need to understand the nature
of astrospheric, atmospheric and surface environments of exoplanets in habitable zones around
G-K-M dwarfs including our young Sun. Global environment is formed by propagated disturbances
from the planet-hosting stars in the form of stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, energetic
particles, and winds collectively known as astrospheric space weather. Its characterization
will help in understanding how an exoplanetary ecosystem interacts with its host star, as well as
in the specification of the physical, chemical and biochemical conditions that can create favorable
and/or detrimental conditions for planetary climate and habitability along with evolution of
planetary internal dynamics over geological timescales. A key linkage of (astro) physical, chemical,
and geological processes can only be understood in the framework of interdisciplinary studies
with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary and Earth sciences.
The assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets
will significantly expand the current definition of the habitable zone to the biogenic zone and
provide new observational strategies for searching for signatures of life. The major goal of this
paper is to describe and discuss the current status and recent progress in this interdisciplinary
field and to provide a new roadmap for the future development of the emerging field of exoplanetary
science and astrobiology.
