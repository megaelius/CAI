1I/'Oumuamua is the first interstellar interloper to have been detected. Because planetesimal
formation and ejection of predominantly icy objects are common by-products of the star and planet
formation processes, in this study we address whether 1I/'Oumuamua could be representative of
this background population of ejected objects. The purpose of the study of its origin is that it could
provide information about the building blocks of planets in a size range that remains elusive to
observations, helping to constrain planet formation models. We compare the mass density of interstellar
objects inferred from its detection to that expected from planetesimal disks under two scenarios:
circumstellar disks around single stars and wide binaries, and circumbinary disks around tight
binaries. Our study makes use of a detailed study of the PanSTARRS survey volume; takes into account
that the contribution from each star to the population of interstellar planetesimals depends on
stellar mass, binarity, and planet presence; and explores a wide range of possible size distributions
for the ejected planetesimals, based on solar system models and observations of its small-body
population. We find that 1I/'Oumuamua is unlikely to be representative of a population of isotropically
distributed objects, favoring the scenario that it originated from the planetesimal disk of a young
nearby star whose remnants are highly anisotropic. Finally, we compare the fluxes of meteorites
and micrometeorites observed on Earth to those inferred from this population of interstellar objects,
concluding that it is unlikely that one of these objects is already part of the collected meteorite
samples.
