There is now strong evidence that the close binary fraction (P < 10$^4$ days; a < 10 AU) of solar-type
stars ($M_1$ = 0.6-1.5M$_{\odot}$) decreases significantly with metallicity. Although early
surveys showed that the observed spectroscopic binary (SB) fractions in the galactic disk and halo
are similar (e.g., Carney-Latham sample), these studies did not correct for incompleteness. In
this study, we examine five different surveys and thoroughly account for their underlying selection
biases to measure the intrinsic occurrence rate of close solar-type binaries. We re-analyze: (1)
a volume-limited sample of solar-type stars, (2) an SB survey of high-proper-motion stars, (3)
various SB samples of metal-poor giants, (4) the APOGEE survey of radial velocity (RV) variables,
and (5) Kepler eclipsing binaries (EBs). The observed APOGEE RV variability fraction and Kepler
EB fraction both decrease by a factor of $\approx$4 across $-$1.0 < [Fe/H] < 0.5 at the 22$\sigma$
and 9$\sigma$ confidence levels, respectively. After correcting for incompleteness, all five
samples exhibit a quantitatively consistent anti-correlation between the intrinsic close binary
fraction (a < 10 AU) and metallicity: $F_{\rm close}$ = 53%$\pm$12%, 40%$\pm$6%, 24%$\pm$4%, and
10%$\pm$3% at [Fe/H] = $-$3.0, $-$1.0, $-$0.2 (mean field metallicity), and +0.5, respectively.
We present fragmentation models that explain why the close binary fraction of solar-type stars
strongly decreases with metallicity while the wide binary fraction, close binary fraction of OB
stars, and initial mass function are all constant across $-$1.5 < [Fe/H] < 0.5. The majority of solar-type
stars with [Fe/H] < $-$1.0 will interact with a stellar companion, which has profound implications
for binary evolution in old and metal-poor environments such as the galactic halo, bulge, thick
disk, globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, and high-redshift universe.
