Interstellar dust plays a central role in shaping the detailed structure of the interstellar medium,
thus strongly influencing star formation and galaxy evolution. Dust extinction provides one of
the main pillars of our understanding of interstellar dust while also often being one of the limiting
factors when interpreting observations of distant objects, including resolved and unresolved
galaxies. The ultraviolet (UV) and mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength regimes exhibit features of
the main components of dust, carbonaceous and silicate materials, and therefore provide the most
fruitful avenue for detailed extinction curve studies. Our current picture of extinction curves
is strongly biased to nearby regions in the Milky Way. The small number of UV extinction curves measured
in the Local Group (mainly Magellanic Clouds) clearly indicates that the range of dust properties
is significantly broader than those inferred from the UV extinction characteristics of local regions
of the Milky Way. Obtaining statistically significant samples of UV and MIR extinction measurements
for all the dusty Local Group galaxies will provide, for the first time, a basis for understanding
dust grains over a wide range of environments. Obtaining such observations requires sensitive
medium-band UV, blue-optical, and mid-IR imaging and followup R ~ 1000 spectroscopy of thousands
of sources. Such a census will revolutionize our understanding of the dependence of dust properties
on local environment providing both an empirical description of the effects of dust on observations
as well as strong constraints on dust grain and evolution models.
