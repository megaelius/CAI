The protoplanetary disk around HL Tau is so far the youngest candidate of planet formation, and it
is still embedded in a protostellar envelope with a size of thousands of au. In this work, we study
the gas kinematics in the envelope and its possible influence on the embedded disk. We present our
new ALMA cycle 3 observational results of HL Tau in the 13CO (2-1) and C18O (2-1) emission at resolutions
of 0.8" (110 au), and we compare the observed velocity pattern with models of different kinds of gas
motions. Both the 13CO and C18O emission lines show a central compact component with a size of 2" (280
au), which traces the protoplanetary disk. The disk is clearly resolved and shows a Keplerian motion,
from which the protostellar mass of HL Tau is estimated to be 1.8+/-0.3 M$_\odot$, assuming the inclination
angle of the disk to be 47 deg from the plane of the sky. The 13CO emission shows two arc structures with
sizes of 1000-2000 au and masses of 3E-3 M$_\odot$ connected to the central disk. One is blueshifted
and stretches from the northeast to the northwest, and the other is redshifted and stretches from
the southwest to the southeast. We find that simple kinematical models of infalling and (counter-)rotating
flattened envelopes cannot fully explain the observed velocity patterns in the arc structures.
The gas kinematics of the arc structures can be better explained with three-dimensional infalling
or outflowing motions. Nevertheless, the observed velocity in the northwestern part of the blueshifted
arc structure is ~60-70% higher than the expected free-fall velocity. We discuss two possible origins
of the arc structures: (1) infalling flows externally compressed by an expanding shell driven by
XZ Tau and (2) outflowing gas clumps caused by gravitational instabilities in the protoplanetary
disk around HL Tau.
