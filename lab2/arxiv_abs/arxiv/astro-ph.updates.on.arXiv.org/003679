The GAPS experiment is designed to carry out a sensitive dark matter search by measuring low-energy
cosmic ray antideuterons and antiprotons. GAPS will provide a new avenue to access a wide range of
dark matter models and masses that is complementary to direct detection techniques, collider experiments
and other indirect detection techniques. Well-motivated theories beyond the Standard Model contain
viable dark matter candidates which could lead to a detectable signal of antideuterons resulting
from the annihilation or decay of dark matter particles. The dark matter contribution to the antideuteron
flux is believed to be especially large at low energies (E < 1 GeV), where the predicted flux from conventional
astrophysical sources (i.e. from secondary interactions of cosmic rays) is very low. The GAPS low-energy
antiproton search will provide stringent constraints on less than 10 GeV dark matter, will provide
the best limits on primordial black hole evaporation on Galactic length scales, and will explore
new discovery space in cosmic ray physics. Unlike other antimatter search experiments such as BESS
and AMS that use magnetic spectrometers, GAPS detects antideuterons and antiprotons using an exotic
atom technique. This technique, and its unique event topology, will give GAPS a nearly background-free
detection capability that is critical in a rare-event search. GAPS is designed to carry out its science
program using long-duration balloon flights in Antarctica. A prototype instrument was successfully
flown from Taiki, Japan in 2012. GAPS has now been approved by NASA to proceed towards the full science
instrument, with the possibility of a first long-duration balloon flight in late 2020. Here we motivate
low-energy cosmic ray antimatter searches and discuss the current status of the GAPS experiment
and the design of the payload.
