Strong gravity and magnetic fields are key ingredients that power processes of accretion and ejection
near compact objects. While particular mechanisms which operate here are still discussed, it seems
that the presence of ordered magnetic field is crucial for the acceleration and collimation of relativistic
jets of electrically charged particles on super-horizon length-scales. In this context we further
study the effect of large-scale magnetic field on the dynamics of charged particles near a rotating
black hole. We consider a scenario in which the initially neutral particles on regular geodesic
orbits in the equatorial plane are destabilized by a charging process (e.g., by photoionization).
Some charged particles are accelerated out of the equatorial plane and they follow jet-like trajectories
with relativistic velocities. In our previous paper we investigated this scenario for the case
of perfect alignment of the magnetic field with the axis of rotation, i.e., the system was considered
axisymmetric. Here we relax this assumption and investigate non-axisymmetric systems in which
the magnetic field is arbitrarily inclined with respect to the black hole spin. We study the system
numerically in order to locate the zones of escaping trajectories and compute the maximum (terminal)
escape velocity. It appears that breaking the axial symmetry (even by small inclination angles)
substantially increases the fraction of escaping orbits, and allows the acceleration to ultrarelativistic
velocities which were excluded in the axisymmetric setup. Presence of transient chaotic dynamics
in the launching region of the relativistic outflow is confirmed with chaotic indicators.
