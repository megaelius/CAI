Analysis of 15314 electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) within $\pm$2 hours of 52 interplanetary
(IP) shocks observed by the \emph{Wind} spacecraft near 1 AU are introduced. The electron VDFs are
fit to the sum of three model functions for the cold dense core, hot tenuous halo, and field-aligned
beam/strahl component. The best results were found by modeling the core as either a bi-kappa or a
symmetric (or asymmetric) bi-self-similar velocity distribution function, while both the halo
and beam/strahl components were best fit to bi-kappa velocity distribution function. This is the
first statistical study to show that the core electron distribution is better fit to a self-similar
velocity distribution function than a bi-Maxwellian under all conditions. The self-similar distribution
deviation from a Maxwellian is a measure of inelasticity in particle scattering from waves and/or
turbulence. The range of values defined by the lower and upper quartiles for the kappa exponents
are $\kappa{\scriptstyle_{ec}}$ $\sim$ 5.40--10.2 for the core, $\kappa{\scriptstyle_{eh}}$
$\sim$ 3.58--5.34 for the halo, and $\kappa{\scriptstyle_{eb}}$ $\sim$ 3.40--5.16 for the beam/strahl.
The lower-to-upper quartile range of symmetric bi-self-similar core exponents are $s{\scriptstyle_{ec}}$
$\sim$ 2.00--2.04, and asymmetric bi-self-similar core exponents are $p{\scriptstyle_{ec}}$
$\sim$ 2.20--4.00 for the parallel exponent, and $q{\scriptstyle_{ec}}$ $\sim$ 2.00--2.46 for
the perpendicular exponent. The nuanced details of the fit procedure and description of resulting
data product are also presented. The statistics and detailed analysis of the results are presented
in Paper II and Paper III of this three-part study.
