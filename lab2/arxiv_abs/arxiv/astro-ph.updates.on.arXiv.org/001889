By exploiting the VLA-COSMOS and the Herschel-PEP surveys, we investigate the Far Infrared (FIR)
properties of radio-selected AGN. To this purpose, from VLA-COSMOS we considered the 1537, F[1.4
GHz]>0.06 mJy sources with a reliable redshift estimate, and sub-divided them into star-forming
galaxies and AGN solely on the basis of their radio luminosity. The AGN sample is complete with respect
to radio selection at all z<~3.5. 832 radio sources have a counterpart in the PEP catalogue. 175
are AGN. Their redshift distribution closely resembles that of the total radio-selected AGN population,
and exhibits two marked peaks at z~0.9 and z~2.5. We find that the probability for a radio-selected
AGN to be detected at FIR wavelengths is both a function of radio power and redshift, whereby powerful
sources are more likely to be FIR emitters at earlier epochs. This is due to two distinct effects:
1) at all radio luminosities, FIR activity monotonically increases with look-back time and 2) radio
activity of AGN origin is increasingly less effective at inhibiting FIR emission. Radio-selected
AGN with FIR emission are preferentially located in galaxies which are smaller than those hosting
FIR-inactive sources. Furthermore, at all z<~2, there seems to be a preferential (stellar)
mass scale M ~[10^{10}-10^{11}] Msun which maximizes the chances for FIR emission. We find such
FIR (and MIR) emission to be due to processes indistinguishable from those which power star-forming
galaxies. It follows that radio emission in at least 35% of the entire AGN population is the sum of
two contributions: AGN accretion and star-forming processes within the host galaxy.
