The large scale structure (LSS) of the universe is generated by the linear density gaussian modes,
which are evolved into the observed nonlinear LSS. The posterior surface of the modes is convex in
the linear regime, leading to a unique global maximum (MAP), but this is no longer guaranteed in the
nonlinear regime. In this paper we investigate the nature of posterior surface using the recently
developed MAP reconstruction method, with a simplified but realistic N-body simulation as the
forward model. The reconstruction method uses optimization with analytic gradients from back-propagation
through the simulation. For low noise cases we recover the initial conditions well into the nonlinear
regime ($k\sim 1$ h/Mpc) nearly perfectly. We show that the large scale modes can be recovered more
precisely than the linear expectation, which we argue is a consequence of nonlinear mode coupling.
For noise levels achievable with current and planned LSS surveys the reconstruction cannot recover
very small scales due to noise. We see some evidence of non-convexity, specially for smaller scales
where the non-injective nature of the mappings: several very different initial conditions leading
to the same near perfect final data reconstruction. We investigate the nature of these phenomena
further using a 1-d toy gravity model, where many well separated local maximas are found to have identical
data likelihood but differ in the prior. We also show that in 1-d the prior favors some solutions over
the true solution, though no clear evidence of these in 3-d. Our main conclusion is that on very small
scales and for a very low noise the posterior surface is multi-modal and the global maximum may be
unreachable with standard methods, while for realistic noise levels in the context of the current
and next generation LSS surveys MAP optimization method is likely to be nearly optimal.
