Several unexpected features are observed at large angular scales in the CMB temperature anisotropy
measurements by both WMAP and Planck. These include the lack of both variance and correlation, alignment
of the lowest multipole moments with one another, hemispherical power asymmetry, and an odd-to-even
parity excess. In this work, we study the statistics of eight representative large-angle CMB features
in order to evaluate their covariance in LCDM. We do so using two sets of simulated CMB temperature
maps; an ensemble of 100,000 simple Gaussian simulations, and 1000 Full Focal Plane (FFP) simulations
provided by the Planck collaboration. In measuring feature probabilities, we pay particular attention
to analysis choices, making sure that we can reproduce previous results in the literature, and explain
differences where appropriate. The covariance structure we find is consistent with expectations
given that many of the features studied are functions of the angular power spectrum. Notably, we
find significant differences in the covariance entries associated with the quadrupole-octopole
alignments derived from the Gaussian and FFP simulations. We additionally perform a principal
component analysis to quantitatively gauge what combinations of features capture the most information
about how simulation measurements vary, and to provide an alternative assessment of the ways in
which the real sky is anomalous. The first four principal components explain about 90\% of the simulations'
variance, with the first two roughly quantifying the lack of large-angle correlations, and the
next two quantifying the phase-dependent anomalies (multipole alignments and power asymmetry).
Though the results of this analysis are fairly unsurprising, its comprehensive approach serves
to tie together a number of previous results, and will therefore provide context for future studies
of large-angle anomalies.
