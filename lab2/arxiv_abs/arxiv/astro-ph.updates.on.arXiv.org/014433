Light pollution is one of the most rapidly increasing types of environmental degradation. To limit
this pollution several effective practices have been defined: shields on lighting fixtures to
prevent direct upward light; no over lighting, i.e. avoid using higher lighting levels than strictly
needed for the task, constraining illumination to the area where and when it is needed. Nevertheless,
even after the best control of the light distribution is reached and when the proper quantity of light
is used, upward light emission remains, due to reflections from the lit surfaces and atmospheric
scatter. The environmental impact of this "residual light pollution" cannot be neglected and should
be limited too. We propose a new way to limit the effects of this residual light pollution on wildlife,
human health and stellar visibility. We performed analysis of the spectra of common types of lamps
for external use, including the new LEDs. We evaluated their emissions relative to the spectral
response functions of human eye photoreceptors, in the photopic, scotopic and melatonin suppressing
bands finding that the amount of pollution is strongly dependent on the spectral characteristics
of the lamps, with the more environmentally friendly lamps being low pressure sodium, followed
by high pressure sodium. Most polluting are the lamps with a strong blue emission, like white LEDs.
Migration from the now widely used sodium lamps to white lamps (Metal Halide and LEDs) would produce
an increase of pollution in the scotopic and melatonin suppression bands of more than five times
the present levels, supposing the same photopic installed flux. This increase will exacerbate
known and possible unknown effects of light pollution on human health, environment and on starry
sky visibility. We present quantitative criteria to evaluate the lamps based on their spectral
emissions and we suggest regulatory limits.
