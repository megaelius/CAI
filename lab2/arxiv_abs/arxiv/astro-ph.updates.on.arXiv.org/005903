We study the effect of anisotropic radiation illumination on the alignment of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and report that cross-sectional mechanism of alignment earlier considered
in terms of gas-grain interactions can also be efficient for the photon-grain interaction. We demonstrate
this by first calculating the angle-dependence rotational damping and excitation coefficients
by photon absorption followed by infrared emission. We then calculate the degree of PAH alignment
for the different environments and physical parameters, including the illumination direction,
ionization fraction, and magnetic field strength. For the reflection nebula (RN) conditions with
unidirectional radiation field, we find that the degree of alignment tends to increase with increasing
the angle $\psi$ between the illumination direction and the magnetic field, as a result of the decrease
of the cross-section of photon absorption with $\psi$. We calculate the polarization of spinning
PAH emission using the obtained degree of alignment for the different physical parameters, assuming
constant grain temperatures. We find that the polarization of spinning PAH emission from RN can
be large, between $5-20~\%$ at frequencies $\nu > 20$ GHz, whereas the polarization is less than
$3~\%$ for photodissociation regions (PDRs). In realistic conditions, the polarization is expected
to be lower due to grain temperature fluctuations and magnetic field geometry. The polarization
for the diffuse cold neutral medium (CNM) is rather low, below $1~\%$ at $\nu>20$ GHz, consistent
with observations by WMAP and Planck. Our results demonstrate that the RNe are the favored environment
to observe the polarization of spinning dust emission as well as polarized mid-IR emission from
PAHs.
