The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation instrument for the very high energy
gamma-ray astrophysics domain. With its enhanced sensitivity in comparison with the current facilities,
CTA is expected to shed light on a varied population of sources. In particular, we will achieve a deeper
knowledge of the Crab nebula and pulsar, which are the best characterized pulsar wind nebula and
rotation powered pulsar, respectively. We aim at studying the capabilities of CTA regarding these
objects through simulations, using the main tools currently in development for the CTA future data
analysis: Gammapy and ctools. We conclude that, even using conservative Instrument Response Functions,
CTA will be able to resolve many uncertainties regarding the spectrum and morphology of the pulsar
and its nebula. The large energy range covered by CTA will allow us to disentangle the nebula spectral
shape among different hypotheses, corresponding to different underlying emitting mechanisms.
In addition, resolving internal structures (smaller than ~ 0.02 degrees in size) in the nebula and
unveiling their location, would provide crucial information about the propagation of particles
in the magnetized medium. We used a theoretical asymmetric model to characterise the morphology
of the nebula and we showed that if predictions of such morphology exist, for instance as a result
of hydrodynamical or magneto-hydrodynamical simulations, it can be directly compared with CTA
results. We also tested the capability of CTA to detect periodic radiation from the Crab pulsar obtaining
a precise measurement of different light curves shapes.
