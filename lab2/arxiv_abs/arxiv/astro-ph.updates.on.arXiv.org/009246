We present a carefully designed, systematic study of the angular resolution dependence of simulations
with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. Employing a simplified neutrino heating-cooling
scheme in the Prometheus hydrodynamics module allows us to sample the angular resolution between
4 degrees and 0.5 degrees. With a newly-implemented static mesh refinement (SMR) technique on the
Yin-Yang grid, the angular coordinates can be refined in concentric shells, compensating for the
diverging structure of the spherical grid. In contrast to previous studies with Prometheus and
other codes, we find that higher angular resolution and therefore lower numerical viscosity provides
more favorable explosion conditions and faster shock expansion. We discuss the possible reasons
for the discrepant results. The overall dynamics converge at a resolution of about 1 degree. Applying
the SMR setup to marginally exploding progenitors is disadvantageous for the shock expansion,
however, because kinetic energy of downflows is dissipated to internal energy at resolution interfaces,
leading to a loss of turbulent pressure support and a steeper temperature gradient. We also present
a way to estimate the numerical viscosity on grounds of the measured turbulent kinetic-energy spectrum,
leading to smaller values that are more consistent with the flow behavior witnessed in the simulations
than results following calculations in previous literature. Interestingly, the numerical Reynolds
numbers (several 100 for a resolution of one degree or better) are in the ballpark of expected neutrino-drag
effects on relevant length scales in the turbulent postshock layer. We provide a formal derivation
and quantitative assessment of the neutrino drag terms in an Appendix.
