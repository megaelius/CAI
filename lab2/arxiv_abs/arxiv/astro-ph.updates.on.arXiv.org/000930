We report that active galactic nuclei jets are causally connected on parsec scales, based on 15 GHz
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data from a sample of 133 AGN jets. This result is achieved through
a new method to measure the product of jet Lorentz factor and intrinsic opening angle, Gamma*theta_j,
from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited samples of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) jets. The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics since it is related to the jet-frame
sidewise expansion speed and causal connection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most
importantly, the standard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected with
its symmetry axis, implying that Gamma*theta_j<1. When we apply our method to the MOJAVE flux
density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find Gamma*theta_j ~ 0.2, implying that AGN jets
are causally connected. We also find evidence that AGN jets viewed very close to the line of sight
effectively have smaller intrinsic opening angles compared with jets viewed more off-axis, which
is consistent with Doppler beaming and a fast inner spine/slow outer sheath velocity field. Notably,
gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets have a typical Gamma*theta_j that is two orders of magnitude higher,
suggesting that different physical mechanisms are at work in GRB jets as compared to AGN jets. A useful
application of our result is that a jet's beaming parameters can derived. Assuming Gamma*theta_j
is approximately constant in the AGN jet population, an individual jet's Doppler factor and Lorentz
factor (and therefore also its viewing angle) can be determined using two observable quantities:
apparent jet opening angle and the apparent speed of jet components.
