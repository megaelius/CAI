We calibrate commonly used star formation rate (SFR) prescriptions using observations in five
kpc-sized fields in the nearby galaxy Andromeda (M31) at 10\,pc spatial resolution. Our observations
at different scales enable us to resolve the star-forming regions and to distinguish them from non
star-forming components. We use extinction corrected H$\alpha$ from optical integral field spectroscopy
as our reference tracer and have verified its reliability via tests. It is used to calibrate monochromatic
and hybrid (H$\alpha$+a$\times$IR and FUV+b$\times$IR) SFR prescriptions, which use FUV (GALEX),
22\,$\mu$m (WISE) and 24\,$\mu$m (MIPS). Additionally, we evaluate other multi-wavelength infra-red
tracers. Our results indicate that the SFR prescriptions do not change (in M31) with spatial scales
or with subtraction of the diffuse component. For the calibration factors in the hybrid SFR prescriptions,
we find a$\approx$0.2 and b$\approx$22 in M31, which are a factor of 5 higher than in the literature.
As the fields in M31 exhibit high attenuation and low dust temperatures, lie at large galacto-centric
distances, and suffer from high galactic inclination compared to measurements in other galaxies,
we propose that the fields probe a dust layer extended along the line of sight that is not directly
spatially associated with star-forming regions. This (vertically) extended dust component increases
the attenuation and alters the SFR prescriptions in M31 compared to literature measurements. We
recommend that SFR prescriptions should be applied with caution at large galacto-centric distances
and in highly inclined galaxies, due to variations in the relative (vertical) distribution of dust
and gas.
