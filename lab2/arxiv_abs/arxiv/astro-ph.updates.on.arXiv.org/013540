It has been claimed that the standard model of cosmology (LCDM) cannot easily account for a number
of observations on relatively small scales, motivating extensions to the standard model. Here
we introduce a new suite of cosmological simulations that systematically explores three plausible
extensions: warm dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, and a running of the scalar spectral
index of density fluctuations. Current observational constraints are used to specify the additional
parameters that come with these extensions. We examine a large range of observable metrics on small
scales, including the halo mass function, density and circular velocity profiles, the abundance
of satellite subhaloes, and halo concentrations. For any given metric, significant degeneracies
can be present between the extensions. In detail, however, the different extensions have quantitatively
distinct mass and radial dependencies, suggesting that a multi-probe approach over a range of scales
can be used to break the degeneracies. We also demonstrate that the relative effects on the radial
density profiles in the different extensions (compared to the standard model) are converged down
to significantly smaller radii than are the absolute profiles. We compare the derived cosmological
trends with the impact of baryonic physics using the EAGLE and ARTEMIS simulations. Significant
degeneracies are also present between baryonic physics and cosmological variations (with both
having similar magnitude effects on some observables). Given the inherent uncertainties both
in the modelling of galaxy formation physics and extensions to LCDM, a systematic and simultaneous
exploration of both is strongly warranted.
