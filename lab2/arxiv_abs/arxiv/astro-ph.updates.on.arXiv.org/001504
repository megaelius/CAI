We examine the exchange of angular momentum between the component spins and the orbit in semi-detached
double white dwarf binaries undergoing mass transfer through direct impact of the transfer stream.
We approximate the stream as a series of discrete massive particles ejected in the ballistic limit
at the inner Lagrangian point of the donor toward the accretor. This work improves upon similar earlier
studies in a number of ways. First, we self-consistently calculate the total angular momentum of
the orbit at all times. This includes changes in the orbital angular momentum during the ballistic
trajectory of the ejected mass, as well as changes during the ejection/accretion due to the radial
component of the particle's velocity. Second, we calculate the particle's ballistic trajectory
for each system, which allows us to determine the precise position and velocity of the particle upon
accretion. We can then include specific information about the radius of the accretor as well as the
angle of impact. Finally, we ensure that the total angular momentum is conserved, which requires
the donor star spin to vary self-consistently. We calculate the angular momentum change of the orbit
and each binary component across the entire parameter space of direct impact double white dwarf
binaries. We find a significant decrease in the amount of angular momentum removed from the orbit
during mass transfer, as well as cases where this process increases the angular momentum of the orbit
at the expense of the spin angular momentum of the donor. We conclude that, unlike earlier claims
in the literature, mass transfer through direct impact need not destabilize the binary and that
the quantity and sign of the orbital angular momentum transfer depends on the binary properties.
This stabilization may significantly impact the population synthesis calculations of double
white dwarf progenitors.
