Galaxy clusters are luminous tracers of the most massive dark matter haloes in the universe. To use
them as a cosmological probe, a detailed description of the relation between observable properties
and host dark matter halo characteristics is required. We study how the dynamical state of haloes
impacts the mass function at the high mass end, for haloes hosting galaxy clusters. We use the MultiDark
suite of simulations and the high mass objects therein. We measure the mean relations of concentration,
offset and spin as a function of halo mass and redshift and their distributions. We confirm the recent
discovery of the concentration upturn at high masses and provide a model that predicts concentration
for different values of mass and redshift with one single equation. We model the distributions around
the mean values with modified Schechter functions. The concentration of low mass haloes shows a
faster redshift evolution, especially in the high concentration regime. The offset parameter
is smaller at low redshift, in agreement with the relaxation of structures at recent times. The peak
of its distribution shifts by a factor 1.5 from z=1.4 to z=0. The single models are combined into a
generalized mass function model, which predicts the halo mass function as a function of spin and
offset. Our model recovers the fiducial mass function with 3% accuracy at z=0 and accounts for redshift
evolution up to z=1.5. We link this theoretical work to observations by comparing the cumulative
distribution function of the optical X-ray displacement in observed galaxy clusters to that of
the offset parameter in simulations. We find the latter to be an upper limit of the observational
displacement. This model allows to marginalize over the cool-core bias while constraining cosmological
parameters with X-ray selected clusters. This is key towards precision cosmology using cluster
counts as a probe.
