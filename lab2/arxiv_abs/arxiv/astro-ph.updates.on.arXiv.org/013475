Realistic synthetic observations of theoretical source models are essential for our understanding
of real observational data. In using synthetic data, one can verify the extent to which source parameters
can be recovered and evaluate how various data corruption effects can be calibrated. These studies
are important when proposing observations of new sources, in the characterization of the capabilities
of new or upgraded instruments, and when verifying model-based theoretical predictions in a comparison
with observational data. We present the SYnthetic Measurement creator for long Baseline Arrays
(SYMBA), a novel synthetic data generation pipeline for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
observations. SYMBA takes into account several realistic atmospheric, instrumental, and calibration
effects. We used SYMBA to create synthetic observations for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT),
a mm VLBI array, which has recently captured the first image of a black hole shadow. After testing
SYMBA with simple source and corruption models, we study the importance of including all corruption
and calibration effects. Based on two example general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)
model images of M87, we performed case studies to assess the attainable image quality with the current
and future EHT array for different weather conditions. The results show that the effects of atmospheric
and instrumental corruptions on the measured visibilities are significant. Despite these effects,
we demonstrate how the overall structure of the input models can be recovered robustly after performing
calibration steps. With the planned addition of new stations to the EHT array, images could be reconstructed
with higher angular resolution and dynamic range. In our case study, these improvements allowed
for a distinction between a thermal and a non-thermal GRMHD model based on salient features in reconstructed
images.
