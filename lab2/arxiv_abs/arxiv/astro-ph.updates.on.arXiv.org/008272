We present 2.5-D global, ideal MHD simulations of magnetically and rotationally driven protostellar
jets from Keplerian accretion discs, wherein only the initial magnetic field strength at the inner
radius of the disc, $B_{\rm i}$, is varied. Using the AMR-MHD code AZEUS, we self-consistently follow
the jet evolution into the observational regime ($>10^3\,\mathrm{AU}$) with a spatial dynamic
range of $\sim6.5\times10^5$. The simulations reveal a three-component outflow: 1) A hot, dense,
super-fast and highly magnetised 'jet core'; 2) a cold, rarefied, trans-fast and highly magnetised
'sheath' surrounding the jet core and extending to a tangential discontinuity; and 3) a warm, dense,
trans-slow and weakly magnetised shocked ambient medium entrained by the advancing bow shock.
The simulations reveal power-law relationships between $B_{\rm i}$ and the jet advance speed,
$v_{\rm jet}$, the average jet rotation speed, $\langle v_\varphi\rangle$, as well as fluxes of
mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. Quantities that do not depend on $B_{\rm i}$ include the plasma-$\beta$
of the transported material which, in all cases, seems to asymptote to order unity. Jets are launched
by a combination of the 'magnetic tower' and 'bead-on-a-wire' mechanisms, with the former accounting
for most of the jet acceleration---even for strong fields---and continuing well beyond the fast
magnetosonic point. At no time does the leading bow shock leave the domain and, as such, these simulations
generate large-scale jets that reproduce many of the observed properties of protostellar jets
including their characteristic speeds and transported fluxes.
