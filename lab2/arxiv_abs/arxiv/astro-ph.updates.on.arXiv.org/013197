We present an algorithm for inferring the dynamical mass of galaxy clusters directly from their
respective phase-space distributions, i.e. the observed line-of-sight velocities and projected
distances of galaxies from the cluster centre. Our method employs neural flows, a deep neural network
capable of learning arbitrary high-dimensional probability distributions, and inherently accounts,
to an adequate extent, for the presence of interloper galaxies which are not bounded to a given cluster,
the primary contaminant of dynamical mass measurements. We validate and showcase the performance
of our neural flow approach to robustly infer the dynamical mass of clusters from a realistic mock
cluster catalogue. A key aspect of our novel algorithm is that it yields the probability density
function of the mass of a particular cluster, thereby providing a principled way of quantifying
uncertainties, in contrast to conventional machine learning approaches. The neural network mass
predictions, when applied to a contaminated catalogue with interlopers, have a logarithmic residual
scatter which goes down to 0.043 dex for the most massive clusters. This is nearly an order of magnitude
improvement over the classical cluster mass scaling relation with the velocity dispersion, and
outperforms recently proposed machine learning approaches. We also apply our neural flow mass
estimator to a compilation of galaxy observations of some well-studied clusters with robust dynamical
mass estimates, further substantiating the efficacy of our algorithm. Such sophisticated approaches
would undoubtedly be relevant for robust and efficient dynamical mass inference from upcoming
surveys covering unprecedented volumes of the sky.
