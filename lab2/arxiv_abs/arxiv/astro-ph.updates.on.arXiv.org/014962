We analyze the detection capability of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) for all currently operating
coronagraphs in space. We define as CMEs events that propagate beyond 10 solar radii with morphologies
broadly consistent with a magnetic flux rope presence. We take advantage of multi-viewpoint observations
over five month-long intervals, corresponding to special orbital configurations of the coronagraphs
aboard the STEREO and SOHO missions. This allows us to sort out CMEs from other outward-propagating
features (e.g. waves or outflows), and thus to identify the total number of unique CMEs ejected during
those periods. We determine the CME visibility functions of the STEREO COR2-A/B and LASCO C2/C3
coronagraphs directly as the ratio of observed to unique CMEs. The visibility functions range from
0.71 to 0.92 for a 95% confidence interval. By comparing detections between coronagraphs on the
same spacecraft and from multiple spacecraft, we assess the influence of field of view, instrument
performance, and projection effects on the CME detection ability without resorting to proxies,
such as flares or radio bursts. We find that no major CMEs are missed by any of the coronagraphs, that
a few slow halo-like events may be missed in synoptic cadence movies and, that narrow field of view
coronagraphs have difficulties discriminating between CMEs and other ejections leading to false
detection rates. We conclude that CME detection can only be validated with multi-viewpoint imaging--
two coronagraphs in quadrature offer adequate detection capability. Finally, we apply the visibility
functions to observed CME rates resulting in upward corrections of 40%.
