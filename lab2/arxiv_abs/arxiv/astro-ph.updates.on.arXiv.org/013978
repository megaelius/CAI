Context: The Galilean satellites are thought to have formed from a circumplanetary disk (CPD) surrounding
Jupiter. When it reached a critical mass, Jupiter opened an annular gap in the solar protoplanetary
disk (PPD) that might have exposed the CPD to radiation from the young Sun or from the stellar cluster
in which the Solar System formed. Aims: We investigate the radiation field to which the Jovian CPD
was exposed during the process of satellite formation. The resulting photoevaporation of the CPD
is studied in this context to constrain possible formation scenarios for the Galilean satellites
and explain architectural features of the Galilean system. Methods: We constructed a model for
the stellar birth cluster to determine the intracluster far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field.
We employed analytical annular gap profiles informed by hydrodynamical simulations to investigate
a range of plausible geometries for the Jovian gap. We used the radiation thermochemical code ProDiMo
to evaluate the incident radiation field in the Jovian gap and the photoevaporation of an embedded
2D axisymmetric CPD. Results: We derive the time-dependent intracluster FUV radiation field for
the solar birth cluster over 10 Myr. We find that intracluster photoevaporation can cause significant
truncation of the Jovian CPD. We determine steady-state truncation radii for possible CPDs, finding
that the outer radius is proportional to the accretion rate $\dot{M}^{0.4}$. For CPD accretion
rates $\dot M < 10^{-12} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, photoevaporative truncation explains the lack
of additional satellites outside the orbit of Callisto. For CPDs of mass $M_{\rm CPD} < 10^{-6.2
M_{\odot}}$ , photoevaporation can disperse the disk before Callisto is able to migrate into the
Laplace resonance. This explains why Callisto is the only massive satellite that is excluded from
the resonance.
