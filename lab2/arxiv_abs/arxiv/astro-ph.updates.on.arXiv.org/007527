The Gaia second Data Release (DR2) presents a first mapping of full-sky RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids
observed by the spacecraft during the initial 22 months of science operations. The Specific Object
Study (SOS) pipeline, developed to validate and fully characterise Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars
(SOS Cep&RRL) observed by Gaia, has been presented in the documentation and papers accompanying
the Gaia first Data Release. Here we describe how the SOS pipeline was modified to allow for processing
the Gaia multiband (G, G_BP and G_RP) time series photometry of all-sky candidate variables and
produce specific results for confirmed RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids that are published in the DR2
catalogue. The SOS Cep&RRL processing uses tools such as the period-amplitude and the period-luminosity
relations in the G band. For the analysis of the Gaia DR2 candidates we also used tools based on the
G_BP and G_RP photometry, such as the period-Wesenheit relation in (G,G_RP). Multiband time series
photometry and characterisation by the SOS Cep&RRL pipeline are published in Gaia DR2 for 150,359
such variables (9,575 classified as Cepheids and 140,784 as RR Lyrae stars) distributed all over
the sky. The sample includes variables in 87 globular clusters and 14 dwarf galaxies. To the best
of our knowledge, as of 25 April 2018, variability of 50,570 of these sources (350 Cepheids and 50,220
RR Lyrae stars) is not known in the literature, hence likely they are new discoveries by Gaia. An estimate
of the interstellar absorption is published for 54,272 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars from a relation
based on the G-band amplitude and the pulsation period. Metallicities derived from the Fourier
parameters of the light curves are also released for 64,932 RR Lyrae stars and 3,738 fundamental-mode
classical Cepheids with period shorter than 6.3 days.
