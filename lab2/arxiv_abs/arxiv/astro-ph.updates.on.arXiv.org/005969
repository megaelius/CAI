Coronal hole spatial-temporal evolution is studied and comparison made with that of the solar global
magnetic field in cycles 21-23 (1976-2012). The latitude-longitude distribution dynamics of
coronal holes and the regularities in the global magnetic field associated with the solar polar
field reversal are analyzed. Polar and non-polar coronal hole populations are considered. The
investigation reveals some temporal and spatial regularities in coronal hole distributions that
match well the global magnetic-field cycle evolution. The results show that the non-polar coronal
hole longitudinal distribution follows all configuration changes in the global magnetic-field
structure. Reorganizations of the global magnetic-field and coronal hole distributions occur
simultaneously during a time interval of a few solar rotations. The cycle evolution of the non-polar
coronal holes reflects the transition of the solar global magnetic field from the zonal structure
to sectorial andvice versa. Two different type waves of non-polar coronal holes are revealed from
their latitudinal distribution. The first one is short poleward waves. They trace the poleward
motion of the unipolar photospheric magnetic fields from approximately 35 deg to the associated
pole in each hemisphere and the redevelopment of a new-polarity polar CH. Although they start the
poleward movement before the change of the polar magnetic field in the associated hemisphere, they
reach the pole after the polar reversal. The other type of non-polar CH wave forms two sinusoidal
branches associated with the positive- and negative-polarity magnetic fields. The complete period
of the wave was equal to approximately 268 CRs (22 years). These wave CHs arrive at high latitudes
during declining phases when the new polarity polar CHs are already completely formed.
