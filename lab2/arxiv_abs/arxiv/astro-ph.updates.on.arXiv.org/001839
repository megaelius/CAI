We present improved methods for using stars found in astronomical exposures to calibrate both star
and galaxy colors as well as to adjust the instrument flat field. By developing a spectroscopic model
for the SDSS stellar locus in color-color space, synthesizing an expected stellar locus, and simultaneously
solving for all unknown zeropoints when fitting to the instrumental locus, we increase the calibration
accuracy of stellar locus matching. We also use a new combined technique to estimate improved flat-field
models for the Subaru SuprimeCam camera, forming `star flats' based on the magnitudes of stars observed
in multiple positions or through comparison with available SDSS magnitudes. These techniques
yield galaxy magnitudes with reliable color calibration (< 0.01 - 0.02 mag accuracy) that enable
us to estimate photometric redshift probability distributions without spectroscopic training
samples. We test the accuracy of our photometric redshifts using spectroscopic redshifts z_s for
~5000 galaxies in 27 cluster fields with at least five bands of photometry, as well as galaxies in
the COSMOS field, finding sigma((z_p - z_s)/(1 + z_s)) ~ 0.03 for the most probable redshift z_p.
We show that the full posterior probability distributions for the redshifts of galaxies with five-band
photometry exhibit good agreement with redshifts estimated from thirty-band photometry in the
COSMOS field. The growth of shear with increasing distance behind each galaxy cluster shows the
expected redshift-distance relation for a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology. Photometric redshifts
and calibrated colors are used in subsequent papers to measure the masses of 51 galaxy clusters from
their weak gravitational shear. We make our Python code for stellar locus matching available at
this http URL ; the code requires only a catalog and filter functions.
