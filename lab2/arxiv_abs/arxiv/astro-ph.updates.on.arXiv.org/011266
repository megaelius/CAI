*Abbreviated abstract* Context: Brown dwarfs in the spectral range L9-T3.5, within the so called
L/T transition, have been shown to be variable at higher amplitudes and with greater frequency than
other field dwarfs. [...] Now, more variables such as these need to be discovered and studied to better
constrain atmospheric models. This is also critical to better understand giant exoplanets and
to shed light on a number of possible correlations between brown dwarf characteristics and variability.
Aims: [...] In this work, we aim to discover new strong variables in this spectral range by targeting
ten previously unsurveyed brown dwarfs. Methods: We used the NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope
to observe 11 targets, with spectral types ranging from L9.5 to T3.5, in the J-band [...] Results:
We report first discoveries of strong and significant variability in four out of the ten targets
[...] measuring peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 10.7 +- 0.4% in J for the T1 dwarf 2MASS J22153705+2110554,
for which we observe significant light curve evolution between the 2017 and 2018 epochs. We also
report a marginally significant detection of strong variability, and confirm that the well known
2MASS J01365662+0933473 is still strongly variable three years after the last reported epoch.
Finally, we present an extensive multi-epoch catalogue of strong variables reported in the literature
and discuss possible correlations that are identifiable from the catalogue. Conclusions: We significantly
add to the number of known strong variables, and through Poisson statistics infer an occurrence
rate for strong variability among L9-T3.5 brown dwarfs of 40[+32-19]%, which is in agreement with
previous estimates. The new variables identified in this work are also excellently suited for extensive
multi-wavelength observations dedicated to probing the 3D structure of brown dwarf atmospheres.
