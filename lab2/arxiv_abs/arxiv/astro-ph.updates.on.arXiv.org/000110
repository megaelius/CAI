We present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between the Hbeta broad-line region
(BLR) radius and the luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we have carried
out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new AGNs imaged
with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow
us to create "AGN-free" images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution
to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate
20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the Hbeta time lag, which is assumed to yield the average
Hbeta BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity.
The additions and updates incorporated here primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R-L
relationship. The best fit to the relationship using a Bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =
0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simple photoionization arguments.
Only two AGNs appear to be outliers from the relationship, but both of them have monitoring light
curves that raise doubt regarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. The scatter around the
relationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13 dex by the removal of
these two suspect measurements. A large fraction of the remaining scatter in the relationship is
likely due to the inaccurate distances to the AGN host galaxies. Our results help support the possibility
that the R-L relationship could potentially be used to turn the BLRs of AGNs into standardizable
candles. This would allow the cosmological expansion of the Universe to be probed by a separate population
of objects, and over a larger range of redshifts.
