Advanced AO systems will likely utilise Pyramid wave-front sensors (PWFS) over the traditional
Shack-Hartmann sensor in the quest for increased sensitivity, peak performance and ultimate contrast.
Here, we wish to bring knowledge and quantify the PWFS theoretical limits as a means to highlight
its properties and use cases. We explore forward models for the PWFS in the spatial-frequency domain
for they prove quite useful since a) they emanate directly from physical-optics (Fourier) diffraction
theory; b) provide a straightforward path to meaningful error breakdowns, c) allow for reconstruction
algorithms with $O (n\,log(n))$ complexity for large-scale systems and d) tie in seamlessly with
decoupled (distributed) optimal predictive dynamic control for performance and contrast optimisation.
All these aspects are dealt with here. We focus on recent analytical PWFS developments and demonstrate
the performance using both analytic and end-to-end simulations. We anchor our estimates with observed
on-sky contrast on existing systems and then show very good agreement between analytical and Monte-Carlo
estimates for the PWFS. For a potential upgrade of existing high-contrast imagers on 10\,m-class
telescopes with visible or near-infrared PWFS, we show under median conditions at Paranal a contrast
improvement (limited by chromatic and scintillation effects) of 2x-5x by replacing the wave-front
sensor alone at large separations close to the AO control radius where aliasing dominates, and factors
in excess of 10x by coupling distributed control with the PWFS over most of the AO control region,
from small separations starting with the Inner Working Angle of typically 1-2 $\lambda/D$ to the
AO correction edge (here 20 $\lambda/D$).
