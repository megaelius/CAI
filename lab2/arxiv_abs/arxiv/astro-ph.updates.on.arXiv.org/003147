Galaxy cross-correlations with high-fidelity redshift samples hold the potential to precisely
calibrate systematic photometric redshift uncertainties arising from the unavailability of
complete and representative training and validation samples of galaxies. However, application
of this technique in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) is hampered by the relatively low number density,
small area, and modest redshift overlap between photometric and spectroscopic samples. We propose
instead using photometric catalogs with reliable photometric redshifts for photo-z calibration
via cross-correlations. We verify the viability of our proposal using redMaPPer clusters from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to successfully recover the redshift distribution of SDSS spectroscopic
galaxies. We demonstrate how to combine photo-z with cross-correlation data to calibrate photometric
redshift biases while marginalizing over possible clustering bias evolution in either the calibration
or unknown photometric samples. We apply our method to DES Science Verification (DES SV) data in
order to constrain the photometric redshift distribution of a galaxy sample selected for weak lensing
studies, constraining the mean of the tomographic redshift distributions to a statistical uncertainty
of $\Delta z \sim \pm 0.01$. We forecast that our proposal can in principle control photometric redshift
uncertainties in DES weak lensing experiments at a level near the intrinsic statistical noise of
the experiment over the range of redshifts where redMaPPer clusters are available. Our results
provide strong motivation to launch a program to fully characterize the systematic errors from
bias evolution and photo-z shapes in our calibration procedure.
