K2-19b and c were among the first planets discovered by NASA's K2 mission and together stand in stark
contrast with the physical and orbital properties of the solar system planets. The planets are between
the size of Uranus and Saturn at 7.0$\pm$0.2 R_E and 4.1$\pm$0.2 R_E, respectively, and reside a
mere 0.1% outside the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. They represent a different outcome of
the planet formation process than the solar system, as well as the vast majority of known exoplanets.
We measured the physical and orbital properties of these planets using photometry from K2, Spitzer,
and ground-based telescopes, along with radial velocities from Keck/HIRES. Through a joint photodynamical
model, we found that the planets have moderate eccentricities of $e \approx0.20$ and well-aligned
apsides $\Delta \varpi \approx 0$ deg. The planets occupy a strictly non-resonant configuration:
the resonant angles circulate rather than librate. This defies the predictions of standard formation
pathways that invoke convergent or divergent migration, both of which predict $\Delta \varpi \approx
180$ deg and eccentricities of a few percent or less. We measured masses of $M_{p,b}$ = 32.4$\pm$1.7
M_E and $M_{p,c}$ = 10.8$\pm$0.6 M_E. Our measurements, with 5% fractional uncertainties, are
among the most precise of any sub-Jovian exoplanet. Mass and size reflect a planet's core/envelope
structure. Despite having a relatively massive core of $M_{core} \approx15$ $M_E$, K2-19b is envelope-rich,
with an envelope mass fraction of roughly 50%. This planet poses a challenge to standard models core-nucleated
accretion, which predict that cores $\gtrsim 10$ $M_E$ will quickly accrete gas and trigger runaway
accretion when the envelope mass exceeds that of the core.
