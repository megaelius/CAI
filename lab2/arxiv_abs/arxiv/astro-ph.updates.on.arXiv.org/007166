Asymmetries in HI in galaxies are often caused by the interaction with close companions, making
isolated galaxies an ideal framework to study secular evolution. The AMIGA project has demonstrated
that isolated galaxies show the lowest level of asymmetry in their HI integrated profiles, yet some
present significant asymmetries. CIG 96 (NGC 864) is a representative case reaching a 16% level.
Our aim is to investigate the HI asymmetries of this spiral galaxy and what processes have triggered
the star-forming regions observed in the XUV pseudoring. We performed deep optical observations
at CAHA 1.23m, 2.2m and VST telescopes. We reach surface brightness (SB) limits of mu_2.2m = 27.5
mag arcsec-2 (Cous R) and mu_VST = 28.7mag arcsec-2 (r) that show the XUV pseudoring of the galaxy
in detail. Additionally, a wavelet filtering of the HI data cube from our deep observations with
E/VLA telescope allowed us to reach a column density of N_HI = 8.9x10^18 cm -2 (5sigma) (28"x28" beam),
lower than in any isolated galaxy. We confirm that the HI extends farther than 4xr_25 in all directions.
Furthermore, we detect for the first time two gaseous structures (10^6 Msol) in the outskirts. The
g-r colour index image from 1.23m shows extremely blue colours in certain regions of the pseudoring
where N_HI>8.5x10^20 cm-2 , whereas the rest show red colours. Galactic cirrus contaminate the
field, setting an unavoidable detection limit at 28.5mag arcsec-2 (r). We detect no stellar link
within 1degx1deg or gaseous link within 40'x40' between CIG 96 and any companion. The isolation
criteria rule out interactions with other similar-sized galaxies for at least 2.7Gyr. Using existing
stellar evolution models, the age of the pseudoring is estimated at 1Gyr or older. Undetected previously
accreted companions and cold gas accretion remain as the main hypothesis to explain the optical
pseudoring and HI features of CIG 96.
