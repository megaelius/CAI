The rate at which massive stars eject mass in stellar winds significantly influences their evolutionary
path. Cosmic rates of nucleosynthesis, explosive stellar phenomena, and compact object genesis
depend on this poorly known facet of stellar evolution. We employ an unexploited observational
technique for measuring the mass-loss rates of O- and early-B stars. Our approach, which has no adjustable
parameters, uses the principle of pressure equilibrium between the stellar wind and the ambient
interstellar medium for a high-velocity star generating an infrared bowshock nebula. Results
for twenty bowshock-generating stars show good agreement with two sets of theoretical predictions
for O5--O9.5 main-sequence stars, yielding $\dot M=$1.3$\times$10$^{-6}$ to 2$\times$10$^{-9}$
solar masses per year. Although $\dot M$ values derived for this sample are smaller than theoretical
expectations by a factor of about two, this discrepancy is greatly reduced compared to canonical
mass-loss methods. Bowshock-derived mass-loss rates are factors of ten smaller than H$\alpha$-based
measurements (uncorrected for clumping) for similar stellar types and are nearly an order of magnitude
larger than P$^{4+}$ and some other UV absorption-line-based diagnostics. Ambient interstellar
densities of at least several cm$^{-3}$ appear to be required for formation of a prominent infrared
bowshock nebula. $\dot M$ measurements for early-B stars are not yet compelling owing to the small
number in our sample and the lack of clear theoretical predictions in the regime of lower stellar
luminosities. These results may constitute a partial resolution of the extant "weak-wind problem"
for late-O stars. The technique shows promise for determining mass-loss rates in the weak-wind
regime.
