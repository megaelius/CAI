Upcoming 21-cm intensity surveys will use the hyperfine transition in emission to map out neutral
hydrogen in large volumes of the universe. Unfortunately, large spatial scales are completely
contaminated with spectrally smooth astrophysical foregrounds which are orders of magnitude
brighter than the signal. This contamination also leaks into smaller radial and angular modes to
form a foreground wedge, further limiting the usefulness of 21-cm observations for different science
cases, especially cross-correlations with tracers that have wide kernels in the radial direction.
In this paper, we investigate reconstructing these modes within a forward modeling framework.
Starting with an initial density field, a suitable bias parameterization and non-linear dynamics
to model the observed 21-cm field, our reconstruction proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of
a forward simulation to match the observations, under given modeling error and a data noise model.
For redshifts $z=2$ and 4, we are able to reconstruct 21cm field with cross correlation, $r_c > 0.8$
on all scales for both our optimistic and pessimistic assumptions about foreground contamination
and for different levels of thermal noise. The performance deteriorates slightly at $z=6$. The
large-scale line-of-sight modes are reconstructed almost perfectly. We demonstrate how our method
also provides a technique for density field reconstruction for baryon acoustic oscillations,
outperforming standard methods on all scales. We also describe how our reconstructed field can
provide superb clustering redshift estimation at high redshifts, where it is otherwise extremely
difficult to obtain dense spectroscopic samples, as well as open up a wealth of cross-correlation
opportunities with projected fields (e.g. lensing) which are restricted to modes transverse to
the line of sight.
