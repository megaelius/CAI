SITELLE is a novel integral field unit spectroscopy instrument that has an impressive spatial (11
by 11 arcmin), spectral coverage, and spectral resolution (R=1-20000). SIGNALS is anticipated
to obtain deep observations (down to 3.6x10-17ergs s-1cm-2) of 40 galaxies, each needing complex
and substantial time to extract spectral information. We present a method that uses Convolution
Neural Networks (CNN) for estimating emission line parameters in optical spectra obtained with
SITELLE as part of the SIGNALS large program. Our algorithm is trained and tested on synthetic data
representing typical emission spectra for HII regions based on Mexican Million Models database(3MdB)
BOND simulations. The network's activation map demonstrates its ability to extract the dynamical
(broadening and velocity) parameters from a set of 5 emission lines (e.g. H{\alpha}, N[II] doublet,
and S[II] doublet) in the SN3 (651-685 nm) filter of SITELLE. Once trained, the algorithm was tested
on real SITELLE observations in the SIGNALS program of one of the South West fields of M33. The CNN
recovers the dynamical parameters with an accuracy better than 5 km s-1 in regions with a signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 15 over the H{\alpha}line. More importantly, our CNN method reduces calculation
time by over an order of magnitude on the spectral cube with native spatial resolution when compared
with standard fitting procedures. These results clearly illustrate the power of machine learning
algorithms for the use in future IFU-based missions. Subsequent work will explore the applicability
of the methodology to other spectral parameters such as the flux of key emission lines.
