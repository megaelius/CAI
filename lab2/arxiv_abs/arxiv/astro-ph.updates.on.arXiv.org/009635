YZ Phe is a very short-period contact binary (Sp.= $K2\,V$) with an orbital period of 0.2347 days
near the short period limit (0.22 d). We present the complete light curves in $VRI$ bands, which photometric
data were obtained with the 0.61-m telescope of PROMPT-8 at CTIO in Chile during June to October 2016
and August 2017. The photometric solutions were determined by using the W-D method and the results
reveal that YZ Phe is a W-subtype shallow contact binary ($f\sim$ 10%, $q$ = 2.635 or $1/q$ = 0.379
for W subtype) with rotational motion of a large hot spot on the more massive component, showing a
strong O'Connell effect with variation of maxima in photometric time series at period of 4.20 yr
and stellar cycle at period of 1.28 yr. By compiling all available eclipse times, the result shows
a long-term period decrease at a rate of $\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = -2.64(\pm 0.02)\times 10^{-8}$
d $yr^{-1}$, superimposed on a cyclic variation ($A_3$ = 0.0081 days and $P_3$ = 40.76 years). This
variation cannot be explained by Applegate mechanism. Thus, the cyclic change may be interpreted
as light-travel time effect via the presence of a cool third body. Based on photometric solutions,
the third light was detected with 2% contribution of total light in $V$ and $I$ bands. Those support
the existence of a third body. For the long-term period decrease, it can be explained by mass transfer
from the more massive component ($M_2 \sim 0.74 M_{\odot}$) to the less massive one ($M_1 \sim 0.28
M_{\odot}$) or plus AML via magnetic braking. With $1/q$ $<$ 0.4 and long-term period decrease,
all suggest that YZ Phe is on the AML-controlled state and its fill-out factor will increase, as well
as the system will evolve into a deeper normal contact binary.
