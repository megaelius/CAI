Deep, pencil-beam surveys from ALMA at 1.1-1.3mm have uncovered an apparent absence of high-redshift
dusty galaxies, with existing redshift distributions peaking around $z\sim1.5-2.5$. This has
led to a perceived dearth of dusty systems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models,
that the early Universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward evolution
galaxy model described by Casey et al. (2018) to the ALMA regime (in depth and area) and determine
that the measured number counts and redshift distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully
consistent with constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at $z<2.5$ determined
by single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger angular scales ($\sim1-10$deg$^{2}$).
We find that measured 1.1-1.3mm number counts are most constraining for the measurement of the faint-end
slope of the IRLF at $z<2.5$ instead of the prevalence of dusty galaxies at $z>4$. Recent studies
have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at $z>4$ may be particularly dust-poor, but we find their
millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law even
by assuming relatively typical, cold-dust ($T_{\rm dust}\approx30\,$K) SEDs. Our models suggest
that the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the prevalence of
$z>4$ early Universe obscured starbursts. The most promising avenue for detection and characterization
of such early dusty galaxies will come from future ALMA 2mm blank field surveys covering a few hundred
arcmin$^{2}$ and the combination of existing and future dual-purpose 3mm datasets.
