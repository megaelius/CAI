A key objective of the ESA Gaia satellite is the realization of a quasi-inertial reference frame
at visual wavelengths by means of global astrometric techniques. This requires an accurate mathematical
and numerical modeling of relativistic light propagation, as well as double-blind-like procedures
for the internal validation of the results, before they are released to the scientific community
at large. Aim of this work is to specialize the Time Transfer Functions (TTF) formalism to the case
of the Gaia observer and prove its applicability to the task of Global Sphere Reconstruction (GSR),
in anticipation of its inclusion in the GSR system, already featuring the suite of RAMOD models,
as an additional semi-external validation of the forthcoming Gaia baseline astrometric solutions.
We extend the current GSR framework and software infrastructure (GSR2) to include TTF relativistic
observation equations compatible with Gaia's operations. We use simulated data generated by the
Gaia Data Reduction and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) to obtain different least-squares estimations
of the full stellar spheres and gauge results. These are compared to analogous solutions obtained
with the current RAMOD model in GSR2 and to the catalog generated with GREM, the model baselined for
Gaia and used to generate the DPAC synthetic data. Linearized least-squares TTF solutions are based
on spheres of about 132,000 primary stars uniformly distributed on the sky and simulated observations
spanning the entire 5-yr range of Gaia's nominal operational lifetime. The statistical properties
of the results compare well with those of GREM. Finally, comparisons to RAMOD@GSR2 solutions confirmed
the known lower accuracy of that model and allowed us to establish firm limits on the quality of the
linearization point outside of which an iteration for non-linearity is required for its proper
convergence.
