CO isotopologue transitions are routinely observed in molecular clouds to probe the column density
of the gas, the elemental ratios of carbon and oxygen, and to trace the kinematics of the environment.
We aim at estimating the abundances, excitation temperatures, velocity field and velocity dispersions
of the three main CO isotopologues towards a subset of the Orion B molecular cloud. We use the Cramer
Rao Bound (CRB) technique to analyze and estimate the precision of the physical parameters in the
framework of local-thermodynamic-equilibrium excitation and radiative transfer with an additive
white Gaussian noise. We propose a maximum likelihood estimator to infer the physical conditions
from the 1-0 and 2-1 transitions of CO isotopologues. Simulations show that this estimator is unbiased
and efficient for a common range of excitation temperatures and column densities (Tex > 6 K, N > 1e14
- 1e15 cm-2). Contrary to the general assumptions, the different CO isotopologues have distinct
excitation temperatures, and the line intensity ratios between different isotopologues do not
accurately reflect the column density ratios. We find mean fractional abundances that are consistent
with previous determinations towards other molecular clouds. However, significant local deviations
are inferred, not only in regions exposed to UV radiation field but also in shielded regions. These
deviations result from the competition between selective photodissociation, chemical fractionation,
and depletion on grain surfaces. We observe that the velocity dispersion of the C18O emission is
10% smaller than that of 13CO. The substantial gain resulting from the simultaneous analysis of
two different rotational transitions of the same species is rigorously quantified. The CRB technique
is a promising avenue for analyzing the estimation of physical parameters from the fit of spectral
lines.
