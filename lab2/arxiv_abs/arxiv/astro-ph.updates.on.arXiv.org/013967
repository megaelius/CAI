We extend the cosmological bootstrap to correlators involving massless particles with spin. In
de Sitter space, these correlators are constrained both by symmetries and by locality. In particular,
the de Sitter isometries become conformal symmetries on the future boundary of the spacetime, which
are reflected in a set of Ward identities that the boundary correlators must satisfy. We solve these
Ward identities by acting with weight-shifting operators on scalar seed solutions. Using this
weight-shifting approach, we derive three- and four-point correlators of massless spin-1 and
spin-2 fields with conformally coupled scalars. Four-point functions arising from tree-level
exchange are singular in particular kinematic configurations, and the coefficients of these singularities
satisfy certain factorization properties. We show that in many cases these factorization limits
fix the structure of the correlators uniquely, without having to solve the conformal Ward identities.
The additional constraint of locality for massless spinning particles manifests itself as current
conservation on the boundary. We find that the four-point functions only satisfy current conservation
if the s, t, and u-channels are related to each other, leading to nontrivial constraints on the couplings
between the conserved currents and other operators in the theory. For spin-1 currents this implies
charge conservation, while for spin-2 currents we recover the equivalence principle from a purely
boundary perspective. For multiple spin-1 fields, we recover the structure of Yang-Mills theory.
Finally, we apply our methods to slow-roll inflation and derive a few phenomenologically relevant
scalar-tensor three-point functions.
