Despite expanding research activity in gravitational lens modeling, there is no particular software
which is considered a standard. Much of the gravitational lens modeling software is written by individual
investigators for their own use. Some gravitational lens modeling software is freely available
for download but is widely variable with regard to ease of use and quality of documentation. This
review of 13 software packages was undertaken to provide a single source of information. Gravitational
lens models are classified as parametric models or non-parametric models, and can be further divided
into research and educational software. Software used in research includes the GRAVLENS package
(with both gravlens and lensmodel), Lenstool, LensPerfect, glafic, PixeLens, SimpLens, Lensview,
and GRALE. In this review, GravLensHD, G-Lens, Gravitational Lensing, lens and MOWGLI are categorized
as educational programs that are useful for demonstrating various aspects of lensing. Each of the
13 software packages is reviewed with regard to software features (installation, documentation,
files provided, etc.) and lensing features (type of model, input data, output data, etc.) as well
as a brief review of studies where they have been used. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility
of strong gravitational lensing data for mass mapping, and suggest increased use of these techniques
in the future. Coupled with the advent of greatly improved imaging, new approaches to modeling of
strong gravitational lens systems are needed. This is the first systematic review of strong gravitational
lens modeling software, providing investigators with a starting point for future software development
to further advance gravitational lens modeling research.
