We present the largest publicly available catalog of interacting dwarf galaxies. It includes 177
nearby merging dwarf galaxies of stellar mass M$_{*}$ $<$ 10$^{10}$M$_{\sun}$ and redshifts z
$<$ 0.02. These galaxies are selected by visual inspection of publicly available archival imaging
from two wide-field optical surveys (SDSS III and the Legacy Survey), and they possess low surface
brightness features that are likely the result of an interaction between dwarf galaxies. We list
UV and optical photometric data which we use to estimate stellar masses and star formation rates.
So far, the study of interacting dwarf galaxies has largely been done on an individual basis, and
lacks a sufficiently large catalog to give statistics on the properties of interacting dwarf galaxies,
and their role in the evolution of low mass galaxies. We expect that this public catalog can be used
as a reference sample to investigate the effects of the tidal interaction on the evolution of star-formation,
morphology/structure of dwarf galaxies. Our sample is overwhelmingly dominated by star-forming
galaxies, and they are generally found significantly below the red-sequence in the color-magnitude
relation. The number of early-type galaxies is only 3 out of 177. We classify them, according to observed
low surface brightness features, into various categories including shells, stellar streams,
loops, antennae or simply interacting. We find that dwarf-dwarf interactions tend to prefer the
low density environment. Only 41 out of the 177 candidate dwarf-dwarf interaction systems have
giant neighbors within a sky projected distance of 700 kpc and a line of sight radial velocity range
$\pm$700 km/s and, compared to the LMC-SMC, they are generally located at much larger sky-projected
distances from their nearest giant neighbor.
