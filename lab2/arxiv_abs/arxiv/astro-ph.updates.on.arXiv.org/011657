Here we discuss the jet production efficiency in a sample of 17 young radio galaxies with measured
redshifts, kinematic ages, and nuclear X-ray fluxes, for which the observed luminosities of compact
jets/lobes and accretion disks correspond to the same episode of the AGN activity. For the targets,
we analyze the available optical data, estimating the bolometric luminosities of the accretion
disks $L_{\rm bol}$, and the black hole masses; we also derive the minimum jet kinetic luminosities,
$P_{\rm j}$. With such, we investigate the distribution of our sample in the three-dimensional
space of the accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \equiv L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$, the nuclear X-ray
luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ considered here as a limit for the emission of the disk coronae, and $P_{\rm
j}$, expressing the latter two parameters either in the Eddington units, or in the units of the disk
luminosity. We find that (i) the accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in our sample is distributed
within a narrow range $\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.01 - 0.2$; (ii) the normalized jet power $P_{\rm
j}/L_{\rm Edd}$ formally correlates with the accretion rate $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with some saturation
at the largest values $\lambda_{\rm Edd}> 0.05$; (iii) the jet production efficiency $\eta_{\rm
jet} \equiv P_{\rm j}/\dot{M}_{\rm acc} c^2$ spans a range from $\eta_{\rm jet} \lesssim 10^{-3}$
up to $\sim 0.2$ at maximum, which is below the level expected for magnetically arrested disks around
maximally spinning black holes; and (iv) there is a diversification in $\eta_{\rm jet}$ on the hardness--intensity
diagram $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol} - \lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with the jets being produced most efficiently
during the high/hard states, and suppressed during the soft states.
