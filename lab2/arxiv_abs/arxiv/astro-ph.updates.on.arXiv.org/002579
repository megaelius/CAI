We present Cholla (Computational Hydrodynamics On ParaLLel Architectures), a new three-dimensional
hydrodynamics code that harnesses the power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate
astrophysical simulations. Cholla models the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art
techniques, including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind (CTU) algorithm, a variety of exact
and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction techniques including the
piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Cholla performs all hydrodynamical calculations in a massively-parallel
manner, using GPUs to evolve the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously while leaving
the power of central processing units (CPUs) available for modeling additional physics. On current
hardware, Cholla can update more than ten million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann
solver and PPM reconstruction with the CTU algorithm. Owing to the massively-parallel architecture
of GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with physically interesting
grid resolutions (> 256^3) can easily be computed on a single device. Cholla utilizes the Message
Passing Interface library to extend calculations onto multiple devices, and exhibits nearly ideal
scaling beyond 100,000 GPU cores. The excellent performance of Cholla is demonstrated on a suite
of test problems that highlights the physical accuracy of our modeling and provides a useful comparison
to other codes. We also provide a set of Appendices that uniformly documents all of the reconstruction
methods and Riemann solvers implemented in Cholla, and discusses strengths and weakness of the
various methods.
