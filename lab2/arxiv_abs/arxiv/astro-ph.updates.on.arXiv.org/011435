Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are tightly correlated with their hosts but the origin of such
connection remains elusive. To explore the cosmic build-up of this scaling relation, we present
an empirically-motivated model that tracks galaxy and SMBH growth down to z=0. Starting from a random
mass seed distribution at z=10, we assume that each galaxy evolves on the star-forming "main sequence"
(MS) and each BH follows the recently-derived stellar mass (M$_{\star}$) dependent ratio between
BH accretion rate and star formation rate, going as BHAR/SFR$\propto$M$_{\star}^{0.73[+0.22,-0.29]}$.
Our simple recipe naturally describes the BH-galaxy build-up in two stages. At first, the SMBH lags
behind the host that evolves along the MS. Later, as the galaxy grows in M$_{\star}$, our M$_{\star}$-dependent
BHAR/SFR induces a super-linear BH growth, as M$_{\rm BH}$$\propto$M$_{\star}^{1.7}$. According
to this formalism, smaller BH seeds increase their relative mass faster and earlier than bigger
BH seeds, at fixed M$_{\star}$, thus setting along a gradually tighter M$_{\rm BH}$-M$_{\star}$
locus towards higher M$_{\star}$. Assuming reasonable values of the radiative efficiency $\epsilon
\sim$0.1, our empirical trend agrees with both high-redshift model predictions and intrinsic
M$_{\rm BH}$-M$_{\star}$ relations of local BHs. We speculate that the observed non-linear BH-galaxy
build-up is reflected in a twofold behavior with dark matter halo mass (M$_{\rm DM}$), displaying
a clear turnover at M$_{\rm DM}\sim$2$\times$10$^{12}$M$_{\odot}$. While Supernovae-driven
feedback suppresses BH growth in smaller halos (BHAR/SFR$\propto$M$_{\rm DM}^{1.6}$), above
the M$_{\rm DM}$ threshold cold gas inflows possibly fuel both BH accretion and star formation in
a similar fashion (BHAR/SFR$\propto$M$_{\rm DM}^{0.3}$).
