GASPS is a far-infrared line and continuum survey of protoplanetary and young debris disks using
PACS on the Herschel Space Observatory. The survey includes [OI] at 63 microns, as well as 70, 100
and 160um continuum, with the brightest objects also studied in [OI]145um, [CII]157um, H2O and
CO. Targets included T Tauri stars and debris disks in 7 nearby young associations, and a sample of
isolated Herbig AeBe stars. The aim was to study the global gas and dust content in a wide disk sample,
systemically comparing the results with models. In this paper we review the main aims, target selection
and observing strategy. We show initial results, including line identifications, sources detected,
and a first statistical study. [OI]63um was the brightest line in most objects, by a factor of ~10.
Detection rates were 49%, including 100% of HAeBe stars and 43% of T Tauri stars. Comparison with
published dust masses show a dust threshold for [OI]63um detection of ~1e-5 M_solar. Normalising
to 140pc distance, 32% with mass 1e-6 - 1e-5 M_solar, and a small number with lower mass were also detected.
This is consistent with moderate UV excess and disk flaring. In most cases, continuum and line emission
is spatially and spectrally unresolved, suggesting disk emission. ~10 objects were resolved,
likely from outflows. Detection rates in [OI]145um, [CII]157um and CO J=18-17 were 20-40%, but
[CII] was not correlated with disk mass, suggesting it arises instead from a compact envelope. [OI]
detection rates in T Tauri associations of ages 0.3-4Myr were ~50%. ~2 stars were detectable in associations
of 5-20Myr, with no detections in associations of age >20Myr. Comparing with the total number
of young stars, and assuming a ISM-like gas/dust ratio, this indicates that ~18% of stars retain
a gas-rich disk of total mass >1M_Jupiter for 1-4Myr, 1-7% keep such disks for 5-10Myr, and none
remain beyond 10-20Myr.
