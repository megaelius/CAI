In this work we aimed to describe the three-dimensional morphology and kinematics of the molecular
gas of the water-fountain nebula IRAS 16342-3814. In order to do this, we retrieved data from the
ALMA archive to analyse it using a simple spatio-kinematical model. We used the software SHAPE to
construct a three-dimensional spatio-kinematical model of the molecular gas in IRAS 16342-3814.
By reproducing the intensity distribution and position-velocity diagram of the CO emission from
the ALMA observations we derived the morphology and velocity field of the gas. We used CO(1-0) data
to support the physical interpretation of the model. A spatio-kinematical model that includes
a high-velocity collimated outflow embedded within material expanding at relatively lower velocity
reproduces the images and position-velocity diagrams from the observations. The high-velocity
collimated outflow exhibits deceleration across its length, while the velocity of the surrounding
component increases with distance. The morphology of the emitting region; the velocity field and
the mass of the gas as function of velocity are in excellent agreement with the properties predicted
for a molecular outflow driven by a jet. The timescale of the molecular outflow is estimated to be
~70-100 years. An oscillating pattern was found associated to the high-velocity collimated outflow.
The oscillation period of the pattern is T~60-90 years and its opening angle is ~2 degrees. The CO
(3-2) emission in IRAS 16342-3814 is interpreted in terms of a jet-driven molecular outflow expanding
along an elongated region. The position-velocity diagram and the mass spectrum reveal a feature
due to entrained material that is associated to the driving jet. It is likely that the jet in those
objects has already disappeared since it is expected to last only for a couple of hundred years.
