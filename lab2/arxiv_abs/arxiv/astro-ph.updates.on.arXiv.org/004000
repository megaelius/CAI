The presence and properties of compact radio sources embedded in massive star-forming regions
can reveal important physical properties about these regions and the processes occurring within
them. The NGC 6334 complex, a massive star-forming region, has been studied extensively. Nevertheless,
none of these studies has focused in its content in compact radio sources. We report on a systematic
census of the compact radio sources toward NGC 6334, and their characteristics. This will be used
to try and define their very nature. We use VLA C band (4-8 GHz) archive data with 0.36" of spatial resolution
and noise level of 50 uJy/bm to carry out a systematic search for compact radio sources within NGC
6334. We also search for infrared counterparts to provide some constraints on the nature of the detected
radio sources. A total of 83 compact sources and three slightly resolved sources were detected.
Most of them are here reported for the first time. We found that 29 of these 86 sources have infrared
counterparts and three are highly variable. Region D contains 18 of these sources. The compact source
toward the center, in projection, of region E is also detected. From statistical analyses, we suggest
that the 83 reported compact sources are real and most of them are related to NGC 6334 itself. A stellar
nature for 27 of them is confirmed by their IR emission. Compared with Orion, region D suffers a deficit
of compact radio sources. The infrared nebulosities around two of the slightly resolved sources
are suggested to be warm dust, and we argue that the associated radio sources trace free-free emission
from ionized material. We confirm the thermal radio emission of the compact source in region E. However,
its detection at infrared wavelengths implies that it is located in the foreground of the molecular
cloud. Three strongly variable sources are suggested to be magnetically active young stars.
