The past two decades saw a renewed interest in low frequency radio astronomy, with a particular focus
on frequencies above 30 MHz. However, at frequencies below 30 MHz, Earth-based observations are
limited due to a combination of severe ionospheric distortions, almost full reflection of radio
waves below 10 MHz, solar eruptions and human-made radio frequency interference (RFI). A space
or Lunar-based ultra-low-frequency (or ultra-long-wavelength, ULW) array would suffer significantly
less from these limitations and hence would open up the last, virtually unexplored frequency domain
in the electromagnetic spectrum. A roadmap has been initiated in order to explore the opportunity
of building a swarm of satellites to observe at the frequency band below 30 MHz. This roadmap, dubbed
Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio Astronomy (OLFAR), presents a space-based ultra-low
frequency radio telescope that will explore the Universe's so-called dark ages, map the interstellar
medium, and study planetary and solar bursts in the solar system and search them in other planetary
systems. Such a system will comprise of a swarm of hundreds to thousands of satellites, working together
as a single aperture synthesis instrument deployed sufficiently far away from Earth to avoid terrestrial
RFI. A number of key technologies of OLFAR are still to be developed and proven. The first step in this
roadmap is the NCLE (Netherlands China Low Frequency Explorer) experiment launched in May 2018
on the Chinese Chang'e-4 mission. The NCLE payload consists of a three monopole antenna system from
which the first data stream is expected in the second half of 2019, which will provide important feedback
for future science and technology opportunities. In this paper, the roadmap towards OLFAR, a brief
overview of the science opportunities, and the technological and programmatic challenges of the
mission are presented.
