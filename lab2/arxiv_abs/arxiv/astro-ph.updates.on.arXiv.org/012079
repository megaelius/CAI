The determination of extrasolar planet masses with the radial velocity (RV) technique requires
spectroscopic Doppler information from the planet's host star, which varies with stellar brightness
and temperature. We analyze Doppler information in spectra of F--M dwarfs utilizing empirical
information from HARPS and CARMENES, and from model spectra. We come to the conclusions that an optical
setup ($BVR$-bands) is more efficient that a near-infrared one ($YJHK$) in dwarf stars hotter than
3200\,K. We publish a catalogue of 46,480 well-studied F--M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood and
compare their distribution to more than one million stars from Gaia DR2. For all stars, we estimate
the RV photon noise achievable in typical observations assuming no activity jitter and slow rotation.
We find that with an ESPRESSO-like instrument at an 8m-telescope, a photon noise limit of 10\,cm\,s$^{-1}$
or lower can be reached in more than 280 stars in a 5\,min observation. At 4m-telescopes, a photon
noise limit of 1\,m\,s$^{-1}$ can be reached in a 10\,min exposure in approx.\ 10,000 predominantly
sun-like stars with a HARPS-like (optical) instrument. The same applies to $\sim$3000 stars for
a red-optical setup covering the $RIz$-bands, and to $\sim$700 stars for a near-infrared instrument.
For the latter two, many of the targets are nearby M dwarfs. Finally, we identify targets in which
Earth-mass planets within the liquid water habitable zone can cause RV amplitudes comparable to
the RV photon noise. Assuming the same exposure times, we find that an ESPRESSO-like instrument
can reach this limit for 1\,M$_\Earth$ planets in more than 1000 stars. The optical, red-optical,
and near-infrared configurations reach the limit for 2\,M$_\Earth$ planets in approximately
500, 700, and 200 stars, respectively.
