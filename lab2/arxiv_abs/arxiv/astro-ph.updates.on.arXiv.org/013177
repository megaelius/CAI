While the behavior of the dominant component of the dark matter is reasonably well established by
cosmological observables, its particle nature and interactions with the rest of the matter are
not known. We consider three dark matter models that admit electromagnetic interaction between
baryons and dark matter: (a) milli-charged particle (CCDM) of charge $q_{\rm ccdm}$ and mass $m_{\rm
ccdm}$, (b) a neutral atom of two charged particles of mass $m_{\rm dd}$ (DD), and (c) a neutral atom
of doubly charged particle and helium nucleus (HeD). We derive and discuss in detail the formation,
stability, and interaction of these atoms with baryons. We derive the implications of this new interaction
in the tight-coupling approximation, which allows us to analytically gauge their impact on the
matter power spectrum and CMB anisotropy. We incorporate this new interaction into the publicly-available
code CLASS to obtain numerical results. We compare our results with Planck 2018 data to constrain
the fraction of interacting dark matter. For the range of allowed astrophysical parameters, the
HeD atom yields the results of $\Lambda$CDM model for $k < 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$, and hence its fraction
is not constrained by CMB anisotropy data which is sensitive to $k < 0.2 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. For $m_{\rm
dd} \gtrsim 25 \, \rm GeV$, the DD atom is also not constrained by CMB data. For $m_{\rm dd} = 10 \, \rm
GeV$, the CMB data constrains the fraction of DD atoms to be smaller than 4% of the total CDM component.
For $q_{\rm ccdm} = 10^{-6}e$ and $m_{\rm ccdm} = 50 \, \rm MeV$, the CCDM fraction is constrained
to be less than 1%.
