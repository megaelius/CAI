Any Dark Energy (DE) or Modified Gravity (MG) model that deviates from a cosmological constant requires
a consistent treatment of its perturbations, which can be described in terms of an entropy perturbation
and an anisotropic stress. We have considered a recently proposed generic parameterisation of
DE/MG perturbations and compared it to data from the Planck satellite and six galaxy catalogues,
including temperature-galaxy (Tg), CMB lensing-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy (gg) correlations.
Combining these observables of structure formation with tests of the background expansion allows
us to investigate the properties of DE/MG both at the background and the perturbative level. Our
constraints on DE/MG are mostly in agreement with the cosmological constant paradigm, while we
also find that the constraint on the equation of state w (assumed to be constant) depends on the model
assumed for the perturbation evolution. We obtain $w=-0.92^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ (95% CL; CMB+gg+Tg)
in the entropy perturbation scenario; in the anisotropic stress case the result is $w=-0.86^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$.
Including the lensing correlations shifts the results towards higher values of w. If we include
a prior on the expansion history from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements,
we find that the constraints tighten closely around $w=-1$, making it impossible to measure any
DE/MG perturbation evolution parameters. If, however, upcoming observations from surveys like
DES, Euclid or LSST show indications for a deviation from a cosmological constant, our formalism
will be a useful tool towards model selection in the dark sector.
