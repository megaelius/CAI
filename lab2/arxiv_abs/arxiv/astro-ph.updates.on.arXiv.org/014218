The majority of potentially habitable exoplanets detected orbit stars cooler than the Sun, and
therefore are irradiated by a stellar spectrum peaking at longer wavelengths than that incident
on Earth. Here, we present results from a set of simulations of tidally-locked terrestrial planets
orbiting three different host stars to isolate the effect of the stellar spectra on the simulated
climate. Specifically, we perform simulations based on TRAPPIST-1e, adopting an Earth-like atmosphere
and using the UK Met Office Unified Model in an idealised 'aqua-planet' configuration. Whilst holding
the planetary parameters constant, including the total stellar flux (900 W/m$^2$) and orbital
period (6.10 Earth days), we compare results between simulations where the stellar spectrum is
that of a quiescent TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Centauri and the Sun. The simulations with cooler host stars
had an increased proportion of incident stellar radiation absorbed directly by the troposphere
compared to the surface. This, in turn, led to an increase in the stability against convection, a
reduction in overall cloud coverage on the dayside (reducing scattering), leading to warmer surface
temperatures. The increased direct heating of the troposphere also led to more efficient heat transport
from the dayside to the nightside and, therefore, a reduced day-night temperature contrast. We
inferred that planets with an Earth-like atmosphere orbiting cooler stars had lower dayside cloud
coverage, potentially allowing habitable conditions at increased orbital radii, compared to
similar planets orbiting hotter stars for a given planetary rotation rate.
