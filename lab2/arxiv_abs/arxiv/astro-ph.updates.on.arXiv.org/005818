We investigate the clustering properties and close neighbour counts for galaxies with different
types of bulges and stellar masses. We select samples of "classical" and "pseudo" bulges, as well
as "bulge-less" disk galaxies, based on the bulge/disk decomposition catalog of SDSS galaxies
provided by Simard et al. (2011). For a given galaxy sample we estimate: the projected two-point
cross-correlation function with respect to a spectroscopic reference sample, w_p(r_p), and the
average background-subtracted neighbour count within a projected separation using a photometric
reference sample, N_neighbour(<r_p). We compare the results with the measurements of control
samples matched in color, concentration and redshift. We find that, when limited to a certain stellar
mass range and matched in color and concentration, all the samples present similar clustering amplitudes
and neighbour counts on scales above ~0.1h^{-1}Mpc. This indicates that neither the presence of
a central bulge, nor the bulge type is related to intermediate-to-large scale environments. On
smaller scales, in contrast, pseudo-bulge and pure-disk galaxies similarly show strong excess
in close neighbour count when compared to control galaxies, at all masses probed. For classical
bulges, small-scale excess is also observed but only for M_stars < 10^{10} M_sun; at higher masses,
their neighbour counts are similar to that of control galaxies at all scales. These results imply
strong connections between galactic bulges and galaxy-galaxy interactions in the local Universe,
although it is unclear how they are physically linked in the current theory of galaxy formation.
