Rho-Ophiuchus (Rho-Oph), one of the nearest star forming regions, is an ideal laboratory to study
the earlier stages of the stellar and protoplanetary disc evolution. We aim to find potential new
members of the Rho-Oph region and identify those surrounded by a circumstellar disc. We constructed
a control sample composed by 188 bona fide Rho-Oph members. Using this sample as a reference we applied
three different density-based Machine Learning clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and HDBSCAN)
to a sample drawn from the Gaia DR2 catalogue centred on the Rho-Oph cloud. The clustering analysis
was applied in the five astrometric dimensions defined by the 3-dimensional Cartesian space and
the proper motions in right ascension and declination. The three clustering algorithms systematically
identify a main cluster with astrometric properties consistent with those of the control sample.
Joining their outcome we constructed a common sample containing 391 member candidates including
166 new (not yet discussed in the literature) objects. Combining the Gaia data with 2MASS and WISE
photometry we built the spectral energy distributions from $0.5$ to $22\microm$ for the subset
of 48 objects with high quality photometry, finding a total of 41 discs (including 11 Class II and
1 Class III new discs). Density-based clustering algorithms are a promising tool to identify candidate
members of star forming regions in large astrometric databases. Combining the Gaia DR2 data with
infrared catalogues it is possible to discover protoplanetary discs that escaped detection by
previous surveys. The objects here presented conform an interesting sample to be followed-up with
sub-millimetre (and longer wavelengths) observatories and future infrared facilities. If confirmed,
the candidate members here discussed would represent an increment of roughly $40-50\%$ of the current
census of the Rho-Oph region.
