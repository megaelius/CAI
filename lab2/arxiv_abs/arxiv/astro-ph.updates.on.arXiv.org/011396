The Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory carried out prompt searches for gravitational wave (GW) events
detected by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) during the second observing run ("O2"). Swift performed
extensive tiling of eight LVC triggers, two of which had very low false-alarm rates (GW 170814 and
the epochal GW 170817), indicating a high confidence of being astrophysical in origin; the latter
was the first GW event to have an electromagnetic counterpart detected. In this paper we describe
the follow-up performed during O2 and the results of our searches. No GW electromagnetic counterparts
were detected; this result is expected, as GW 170817 remained the only astrophysical event containing
at least one neutron star after LVC's later retraction of some events. A number of X-ray sources were
detected, with the majority of identified sources being active galactic nuclei. We discuss the
detection rate of transient X-ray sources and their implications in the O2 tiling searches. Finally,
we describe the lessons learned during O2, and how these are being used to improve the \swift\ follow-up
of GW events. In particular, we simulate a population of GRB afterglows to evaluate our source ranking
system's ability to differentiate them from unrelated and uncatalogued X-ray sources. We find
that $\approx$60-70% of afterglows whose jets are oriented towards Earth will be given high rank
(i.e., "interesting" designation) by the completion of our second follow-up phase (assuming their
location in the sky was observed), but that this fraction can be increased to nearly 100% by performing
a third follow-up observation of sources exhibiting fading behavior.
