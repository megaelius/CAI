Many Seyfert galaxies are known to exhibit Fe-K broad emission line features in their X-ray energy
spectra. The observed lines have three distinct features; (1) the line profiles are skewed and show
significant low-energy tails, (2) the Fe-K band have low variability, which produces a broad and
deep dip in the root-mean-square (rms) spectra, and (3) photons in this band have time lags behind
those in the adjacent energy bands with amplitudes of several $R_g/c$, where $R_g$ is the gravitational
radius. The "relativistic light bending model" is proposed to explain these observed features,
where a compact X-ray source (lamp post) above an extreme Kerr black hole illuminates the innermost
area of the accretion disc. In this paper, we critically examine the relativistic light bending
model by computing the rms spectra and the lag features using a ray-tracing technique, when a lamp
post moves vertically on the black hole spin axis. As a result, we found that the observed deep rms
dip requires that the iron is extremely overabundant ($\gtrsim10$ solar), whereas the observed
lag amplitude is consistent with the normal iron abundance. Furthermore, disappearance of the
lag in the high-flux state requires a source height as high as $\sim40\,R_g$, which contradicts
the relativistically broad emission line feature. Our simulations agree with the data that the
reverberation feature moves to lower frequencies with larger source height, however, if this scenario
is correct, the simulations predict detection of a clear Fe-K lag at low frequencies, which is not
constrained in the data. Therefore, we conclude that the relativistic light bending model may not
explain the characteristic Fe-K spectral variations in Seyfert galaxies.
