The diffuse hard X-ray emission that fills the Galactic center, bulge, and ridge is believed to arise
from unresolved populations of X-ray binary systems. However, the identity of the dominant class
of accreting objects in each region remains unclear. Recent studies of Fe line properties and the
low-energy (<10 keV) X-ray continuum of the bulge indicate a major population fraction of non-magnetic
cataclysmic variables (CVs), in particular quiescent dwarf novae. This is in contrast to previous
high-energy (>10 keV) X-ray measurements of the bulge and ridge, which indicate a dominant population
of magnetic CVs, in particular intermediate polars. In addition, NuSTAR broad-band measurements
have uncovered a much heavier intermediate polar population in the central ~100 pc than previously
assumed, raising the possibility that some fraction of this population extends further from the
center. Here we use NuSTAR's large aperture for unfocused photons and its broad-band X-ray range
to probe the diffuse continuum of the inner ~1-3$^\circ$ of the Galactic bulge. This allows us to
constrain possible multi-temperature components of the spectrum, such as could indicate a mixture
of soft and hard populations. Our emissivity is consistent with previous hard X-ray measurements
in the bulge and ridge, with the diffuse X-ray luminosity tracing the stellar mass. The spectrum
is well-described by a single-temperature thermal plasma with $kT \approx 8$ keV, with no significant
emission above 20 keV. This supports that the bulge is dominated by quiescent dwarf novae; we find
no evidence of a significant intermediate polar population in the hard X-ray band.
