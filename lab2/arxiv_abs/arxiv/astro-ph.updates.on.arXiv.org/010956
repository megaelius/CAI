The magnetic field is believed to play an important role in at least some core-collapse supernovae
if its magnitude reaches $10^{15}\,\rm{G}$, which is a typical value for a magnetar. In the presence
of fast rotation, such a strong magnetic field can drive powerful jet-like explosions if it has the
large-scale coherence of a dipole. The topology of the magnetic field is, however, probably much
more complex with strong multipolar and small-scale components and the consequences for the explosion
are so far unclear. We investigate the effects of the magnetic field topology on the dynamics of core-collapse
supernovae and the properties of forming proto-neutron star (PNS) by comparing pre-collapse fields
of different multipolar orders and radial profiles. Using axisymmetric special relativistic
MHD simulations and a two-moment neutrino transport, we find that higher multipolar magnetic configurations
lead to generally less energetic explosions, slower expanding shocks and less collimated outflows.
Models with a low order multipolar configuration tend to produce more oblate PNS, surrounded in
some cases by a rotationally supported toroidal structure of neutron-rich material. Moreover,
magnetic fields which are distributed on smaller angular scales produce more massive and faster
rotating central PNS, suggesting that higher-order multipolar configurations tend to decrease
the efficiency of the magnetorotational launching mechanism. Even if our dipolar models systematically
display a far more efficient extraction of the rotational energy of the PNS, fields distributed
on smaller angular scales are still capable of powering magnetorotational explosions and shape
the evolution of the central compact object.
