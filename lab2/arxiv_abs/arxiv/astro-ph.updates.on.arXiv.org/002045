We quantify the systematics in the size-luminosity relation of galaxies in the SDSS main sample
which arise from fitting different 1- and 2-component model profiles to the images. In objects brighter
than L*, fitting a single Sersic profile to what is really a two-component SerExp system leads to
biases: the half-light radius is increasingly overestimated as n of the fitted single component
increases; it is also overestimated at B/T ~ 0.6. However, the net effect on the R-L relation is small,
except for the most luminous tail, where it curves upwards towards larger sizes. We also study how
this relation depends on morphological type. Our analysis is one of the first to use Bayesian-classifier
derived weights, rather than hard cuts, to define morphology. Crudely, there appear to be only two
relations: one for early-types (Es, S0s and Sa's) and another for late-types (Sbs and Scds). However,
closer inspection shows that within the early-type sample S0s tend to be 15% smaller than Es of the
same luminosity, and, among faint late types, Sbs are more than 25% smaller than Scds. Neither the
early- nor the late-type relations are pure power-laws: both show significant curvature, which
we quantify. However, the R-L relations of the bulges of early-types are almost pure power laws.
Our analysis confirms that two mass scales are special for early-type galaxies: M* = 3e10 and 2e11
Msun. These same mass scales are also special for late types: there is almost no correlation between
R and M* below the former, and almost no late-types above the latter. We also show that the intrinsic
scatter around the relation decreases at large luminosity and/or stellar mass; this should provide
additional constraints on models of how the most massive galaxies formed.
