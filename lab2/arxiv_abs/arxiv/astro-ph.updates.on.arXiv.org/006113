We study the growth pathways of Brightest Central Galaxies (BCGs) and Intra-Cluster Light (ICL)
by means of a semi-analytic model. We assume that the ICL forms by stellar stripping of satellite
galaxies and violent processes during mergers, and implement two independent models: (1) one considers
both mergers and stellar stripping (named {\small STANDARD} model), and one considers only mergers
(named {\small MERGERS} model). We find that BCGs and ICL form, grow and overall evolve at different
times and with different timescales, but they show a clear co-evolution after redshift $z \sim 0.7-0.8$.
Around 90\% of the ICL from stellar stripping is built-up in the innermost 150 Kpc from the halo centre
and the dominant contribution comes from disk-like galaxies (B/T$<$0.4) through a large number
of small/intermediate stripping events ($M_{strip}/M_{sat}<0.3$). The fractions of stellar
mass in BCGs and in ICL over the total stellar mass within the virial radius of the halo evolve differently
with time. At high redshift, the BCG accounts for the bulk of the mass, but its contribution gradually
decreases with time and stays constant after $z\sim 0.4-0.5$. The ICL, instead, grows very fast
and its contribution keeps increasing down to the present time. The {\small STANDARD} and the {\small
MERGERS} models make very similar predictions in most of the cases, but predict different amounts
of ICL associated to other galaxies within the virial radius of the group/cluster other than the
BCG, at $z=0$. We then suggest that this quantity is a valid observable that can shed light on the relative
importance of mergers and stellar stripping for the formation of the ICL.
