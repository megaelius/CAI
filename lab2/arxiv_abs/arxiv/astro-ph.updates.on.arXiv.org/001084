We present a variability study of a sample of bright gamma-ray (30 MeV -- 50 GeV) sources. This sample
is an extension of the first AGILE catalogue of gamma-ray sources (1AGL), obtained using the complete
set of AGILE observations in pointing mode performed during a 2.3 year period from July 9, 2007 until
October 30, 2009. The dataset of AGILE pointed observations covers a long time interval and its gamma-ray
data archive is useful for monitoring studies of medium-to-high brightness gamma-ray sources.
In the analysis reported here, we used data obtained with an improved event filter that covers a wider
field of view, on a much larger (about 27.5 months) dataset, integrating data on observation block
time scales, which mostly range from a few days to thirty days. The data processing resulted in a better
characterized source list than 1AGL was, and includes 54 sources, 7 of which are new high galactic
latitude (|BII| >= 5) sources, 8 are new sources on the galactic plane, and 20 sources from the
previous catalogue with revised positions. Eight 1AGL sources (2 high-latitude and 6 on the galactic
plane) were not detected in the final processing either because of low OB exposure and/or due to their
position in complex galactic regions. We report the results in a catalogue of all the detections
obtained in each single OB, including the variability results for each of these sources. In particular,
we found that 12 sources out of 42 or 11 out of 53 are variable, depending on the variability index used,
where 42 and 53 are the number of sources for which these indices could be calculated. Seven of the
11 variable sources are blazars, the others are Crab pulsar+nebula, LS I +61{\deg}303, Cyg X-3,
and 1AGLR J2021+4030.
