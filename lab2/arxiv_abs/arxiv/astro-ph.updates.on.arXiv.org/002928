A large fraction of the gas in the Galaxy is cold, dense, and molecular. If all this gas collapsed under
the influence of gravity and formed stars in a local free-fall time, the star formation rate in the
Galaxy would exceed that observed by more than an order of magnitude. Other star-forming galaxies
behave similarly. Yet observations and simulations both suggest that the molecular gas is indeed
gravitationally collapsing, albeit hierarchically. Prompt stellar feedback offers a potential
solution to the low observed star formation rate if it quickly disrupts star-forming clouds during
gravitational collapse. However, this requires that molecular clouds must be short-lived objects,
raising the question of how so much gas can be observed in the molecular phase. This can occur only
if molecular clouds form as quickly as they are destroyed, maintaining a global equilibrium fraction
of dense gas. We therefore examine cloud formation timescales. We first demonstrate that supernova
and superbubble sweeping cannot produce dense gas at the rate required to match the cloud destruction
rate. On the other hand, Toomre gravitational instability can reach the required production rate.
We thus argue that, although dense, star-forming gas may last only around a single global free-fall
time, the dense gas in star-forming galaxies can globally exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium
between formation by gravitational instability, and disruption by stellar feedback. At redshift
$z \gtrsim 2$, the Toomre instability timescale decreases, resulting in a prediction of higher
molecular gas fractions at early times, in agreement with observations.
