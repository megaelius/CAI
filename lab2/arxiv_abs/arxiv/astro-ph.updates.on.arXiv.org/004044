Aims. We present a multiwavelength study of two southern Galactic H II regions G346.056-0.021 and
G346.077-0.056 which are located at a distance of 10.9 kpc. The distribution of ionized gas, cold
and warm dust and the stellar population associated with the two H II regions are studied in detail
using measurements at near-infrared, mid-infrared, far-infrared, submillimeter and radio wavelengths.
Methods. The radio continuum maps at 1280 and 610 MHz were obtained using the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope to probe the ionized gas. The dust temperature, column density and dust emissivity maps
were generated by using modified blackbody fits in the far-infrared wavelength range 160 - 500 {\mu}m.
Various near- and mid-infrared colour and magnitude criteria were adopted to identify candidate
ionizing star(s) and the population of young stellar objects in the associated field. Results.
The radio maps reveal the presence diffuse ionized emission displaying distinct cometary morphologies.
The 1280 MHz flux densities translate to ZAMS spectral types in the range O7.5V - O7V and O8.5V - O8V
for the ionizing stars of G346.056-0.021 and G346.077-0.056, respectively. A few promising candidate
ionizing star(s) are identified using near-infrared photometric data. The column density map
shows the presence of a large, dense dust clump enveloping G346.077-0.056. The dust temperature
map shows peaks towards the two H II regions. The submillimetre image shows the presence of two additional
clumps one being associated with G346.056-0.021. The masses of the clumps are estimated to range
between {\sim} 1400 to 15250 M{\sun}. Based on simple analytic calculations and the correlation
seen between the ionized gas distribution and the local density structure, the observed cometary
morphology in the radio maps is better explained invoking the champagne-flow model.
