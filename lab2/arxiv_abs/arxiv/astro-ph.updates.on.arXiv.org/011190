We present Chandra and VLA observations of GW170817 at ~521-743 days post merger, and a homogeneous
analysis of the entire Chandra data set. We find that the late-time non-thermal emission follows
the expected evolution from an off-axis relativistic jet, with a steep temporal decay $F_{\nu}\propto
t^{-1.95\pm0.15}$ and a simple power-law spectrum $F_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-0.575\pm0.007}$.
We present a new method to constrain the merger environment density based on diffuse X-ray emission
from hot plasma in the host galaxy and we find $n\le 9.6 \times 10^{-3}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$. This measurement
is independent from inferences based on the jet afterglow modeling and allows us to partially solve
for model degeneracies. The updated best-fitting model parameters with this density constraint
are a fireball kinetic energy $E_0 = 1.5_{-1.1}^{+3.6}\times 10^{49}\,\rm{erg}$ ($E_{iso}=
2.1_{-1.5}^{+6.4}\times10^{52}\, \rm{erg}$), jet opening angle $\theta_{0}= 5.9^{+1.0}_{-0.7}\,\rm{deg}$
with characteristic Lorentz factor $\Gamma_j = 163_{-43}^{+23}$, expanding in a low-density
medium with $n_0 = 2.5_{-1.9}^{+4.1} \times 10^{-3}\, \rm{cm^{-3}}$ and viewed $\theta_{obs}
= 30.4^{+4.0}_{-3.4}\, \rm{deg}$ off-axis. The synchrotron emission originates from a power-law
distribution of electrons with $p=2.15^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$. The shock microphysics parameters
are constrained to $\epsilon_{\rm{e}} = 0.18_{-0.13}^{+0.30}$ and $\epsilon_{\rm{B}}=2.3_{-2.2}^{+16.0}
\times 10^{-3}$. We investigate the presence of X-ray flares and find no statistically significant
evidence of $\ge2.5\sigma$ of temporal variability at any time. Finally, we use our observations
to constrain the properties of synchrotron emission from the deceleration of the fastest kilonova
ejecta with energy $E_k^{KN}\propto (\Gamma\beta)^{-\alpha}$ into the environment, finding
that shallow stratification indexes $\alpha\le6$ are disfavored.
