On hot Jupiter exoplanets, strong horizontal and vertical winds should homogenize the abundances
of the important absorbers CH$_4$ and CO much faster than chemical reactions restore chemical equilibrium.
This effect, typically neglected in general circulation models (GCMs), has been suggested as explanation
for discrepancies between observed infrared lightcurves and those predicted by GCMs: On the nightsides
of several hot Jupiters, GCMs predict outgoing fluxes that are too large, especially in the Spitzer
4.5 $\mu$m band. We modified the SPARC/MITgcm to include disequilibrium abundances of CH$_4$,
CO and H$_2$O by assuming that the CH$_4$/CO ratio is constant throughout the simulation domain.
We ran simulations of hot Jupiter HD 189733b with 8 CH$_4$/CO ratios. In the more likely CO-dominated
regime, we find temperature changes $\geq$50-100 K compared to the equilibrium chemistry case
across large regions. This effect is large enough to affect predicted emission spectra and should
thus be included in GCMs of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures between 600K and 1300K. We
find that spectra in regions with strong methane absorption, including the Spitzer 3.6 and 8 $\mu$m
bands, are strongly impacted by disequilibrium abundances. We expect chemical quenching to result
in much larger nightside fluxes in the 3.6 $\mu$m band, in stark contrast to observations. Meanwhile,
we find almost no effect on predicted observations in the 4.5 $\mu$m band, as the opacity changes
due to CO and H$_2$O offset each other. We thus conclude that disequilibrium carbon chemistry cannot
explain the observed low nightside fluxes in the 4.5 $\mu$m band.
