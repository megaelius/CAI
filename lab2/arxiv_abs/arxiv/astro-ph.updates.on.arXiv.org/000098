We investigate the unification scenario provided by the generalised Chaplygin gas model (a perfect
fluid characterized by an equation of state p = -A/\rho^{\alpha}). Our concerns lie with a possible
tension existing between background kinematic tests and those related to the evolution of small
perturbations. We analyse data from the observation of the differential age of the universe, type
Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations and the position of the first peak of the angular spectrum
of the cosmic background radiation. We show that these tests favour negative values of the parameter
\alpha: we find \alpha = - 0.089^{+0.161}_{-0.128} at the 2\sigma\ level and that \alpha < 0 with
85% confidence. These would correspond to negative values of the square speed of sound which are
unacceptable from the point of view of structure formation. We discuss a possible solution to this
problem, when the generalised Chaplygin gas is framed in the modified theory of gravity proposed
by Rastall. We show that a fluid description within this theory does not serve the purpose, but it
is necessary to frame the generalised Chaplygin gas in a scalar field theory. Finally, we address
the standard general relativistic unification picture provided by the generalised Chaplygin
gas in the case \alpha = 0: this is usually considered to be undistinguishable from the standard \Lambda
CDM model, but we show that the evolution of small perturbations, governed by the M\'esz\'aros equation,
is indeed different and the formation of sub-horizon GCG matter halos may be importantly affected
in comparison with the \Lambda CDM scenario.
