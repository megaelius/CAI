Super-sample covariance (SSC) is the dominant source of statistical error on large scale structure
(LSS) observables for both current and future galaxy surveys. In this work, we concentrate on the
SSC of cluster counts, also known as sample variance, which is particularly useful for the self-calibration
of the cluster observable-mass relation; our approach can similarly be applied to other observables,
such as galaxy clustering and lensing shear. We first examined the accuracy of two analytical approximations
proposed in the literature for the flat sky limit, finding that they are accurate at the 15% and 30-35%
level, respectively, for covariances of counts in the same redshift bin. We then developed a harmonic
expansion formalism that allows for the prediction of SSC in an arbitrary survey mask geometry,
such as large sky areas of current and future surveys. We show analytically and numerically that
this formalism recovers the full sky and flat sky limits present in the literature. We then present
an efficient numerical implementation of the formalism, which allows fast and easy runs of covariance
predictions when the survey mask is modified. We applied our method to a mask that is broadly similar
to the Dark Energy Survey footprint, finding a non-negligible negative cross-z covariance, i.e.
redshift bins are anti-correlated. We also examined the case of data removal from holes due to, for
example bright stars, quality cuts, or systematic removals, and find that this does not have noticeable
effects on the structure of the SSC matrix, only rescaling its amplitude by the effective survey
area. These advances enable analytical covariances of LSS observables to be computed for current
and future galaxy surveys, which cover large areas of the sky where the flat sky approximation fails.
