The diffuse plasma inside clusters of galaxies has X-ray emitting temperatures of a few keV. The
physical mechanisms that heat this intracluster medium (ICM) to such temperatures include the
accretion shock at the periphery of a galaxy cluster, the shocks driven by merger events, as well
as a somewhat overlooked mechanism -- the dissipation of intracluster turbulent motions. We study
the relative role of these heating mechanisms using simulated galaxy clusters in a set of Lagrangian
tracer particle re-simulations of the non-radiative run of the Omega500 cosmological simulation.
We adopt a novel analysis method of decomposing the temperature increase at each time step into that
associated with entropy increase and that caused by density variations, which enables separation
of irreversible dissipative heating and adiabatic heating. The high time resolution and a large
number of tracer particles allow a unique view of the spatial-temporal distribution of these heating
rates, in which merger tracks are clearly visible, demonstrating the dominant role of merger events
in heating the ICM. The dissipative heating contributed by each merger event is extended in time
and occurs also in regions where the gas density is decreasing, suggesting the importance of heating
by the dissipation of merger-induced turbulence. Quantitative analysis shows that turbulence
heating, rather than direct heating at merger shocks, dominates the temperature increase of the
ICM especially at inner radii $r < r_{\rm 500c}$. In addition, we find that many merger shocks can
propagate with almost constant velocity to very large radii $r \gg r_{\rm 500c}$, some even reach
and join with the accretion shock, becoming the outer boundary of the ICM. Altogether, these results
suggest that the ICM is heated more in an `inside-out' fashion rather than `outside-in' as depicted
in the classical smooth accretion picture.
