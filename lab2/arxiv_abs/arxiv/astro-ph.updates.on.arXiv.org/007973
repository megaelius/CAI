The High Energy Modular Ensemble of Satellites (HERMES) project is aimed to realize a modular X/gamma-ray
monitor for transient events, to be placed on-board of a CubeSat bus. This expandable platform will
achieve a significant impact on Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) science and on the detection of Gravitational
Wave (GW) electromagnetic counterparts: the recent LIGO/VIRGO discoveries demonstrated that
the high-energy transient sky is still a field of extreme interest. The very complex temporal variability
of GRBs (up to the millisecond scale) combined with the spatial and temporal coincidence between
GWs and their electromagnetic counterparts suggest that upcoming instruments require sub-ms
time resolution combined with a transient localization accuracy lower than a degree. The current
phase of the ongoing HERMES project is focused on the realization of a technological pathfinder
with a small network (3 units) of nano-satellites to be launched in mid 2020. We will show the potential
and prospects for short and medium-term development of the project, demonstrating the disrupting
possibilities for scientific investigations provided by the innovative concept of a new "modular
astronomy" with nano-satellites (e.g. low developing costs, very short realization time). Finally,
we will illustrate the characteristics of the HERMES Technological Pathfinder project, demonstrating
how the scientific goals discussed are actually already reachable with the first nano-satellites
of this constellation. The detector architecture will be described in detail, showing that the
new generation of scintillators (e.g. GAGG:Ce) coupled with very performing Silicon Drift Detectors
(SDD) and low noise Front-End-Electronics (FEE) are able to extend down to few keV the sensitivity
band of the detector. The technical solutions for FEE, Back-End-Electronics (BEE) and Data Handling
will be also described.
