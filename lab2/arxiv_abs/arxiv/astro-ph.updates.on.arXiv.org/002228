With Herschel/PACS 134 low mass members of the Taurus star-forming region spanning the M4-L0 spectral
type range and covering the transition from low mass stars to brown dwarfs were observed. Combining
the new Herschel results with other programs, a total of 150 of the 154 M4-L0 Taurus members members
have observations with Herschel. Among the 150 targets, 70um flux densities were measured for 7
of the 7 ClassI objects, 48 of the 67 ClassII members, and 3 of the 76 ClassIII targets. For the detected
ClassII objects, the median 70um flux density level declines with spectral type, however, the distribution
of excess relative to central object flux density does not change across the stellar/substellar
boundary in the M4-L0 range. Connecting the 70um TBOSS values with the results from K0-M3 ClassII
members results in the first comprehensive census of far-IR emission across the full mass spectrum
of the stellar and substellar population of a star-forming region, and the median flux density declines
with spectral type in a trend analogous to the flux density decline expected for the central objects.
SEDs were constructed for all TBOSS targets covering the optical to far-IR range and extending to
the submm/mm for a subset of sources. Based on an initial exploration of the impact of different physical
parameters; inclination, scale height and flaring have the largest influence on the PACS flux densities.
From the 24um to 70um spectral index of the SEDs, 5 new candidate transition disks were identified.
The steep 24um to 70um slope for a subset of 8 TBOSS targets may be an indication of truncated disks
in these systems.Two examples of mixed pair systems that include secondaries with disks were measured.
Finally, comparing the TBOSS results with a Herschel study of Ophiuchus brown dwarfs reveals a lower
fraction of disks around the Taurus substellar population.
