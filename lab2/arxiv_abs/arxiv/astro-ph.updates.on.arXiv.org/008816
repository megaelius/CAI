Anticipating the kinematic constraints from the Gaia mission, we perform an extensive numerical
study of the evolution of massive binary systems to predict the peculiar velocities that stars obtain
when their companion collapses and disrupts the system. Our aim is to (1) identify which predictions
are robust against model uncertainties and assess their implications, (2) investigate which physical
processes leave a clear imprint and may therefore be constrained observationally and (3) provide
a suite of publicly available model predictions. We find that $22_{-8}^{+26}$% of all massive binary
systems merge prior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder, $86_{-9}^{+11}$%
become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this rarely produce runaway stars (i.e.,
stars with velocities above 30 km/s). These are outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by
slower unbound companions, or "walkaway stars". This is a robust outcome of our simulations and
is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and widening of the orbit, as we show
analytically and numerically. We estimate a $10^{+5}_{-8}$% of massive stars to be walkaways and
only $0.5^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$% to be runaways, nearly all of which have accreted mass from their companion.
Our findings are consistent with earlier studies, however the low runaway fraction we find is in
tension with observed fractions 10%. If Gaia confirms these high fractions of massive runaway stars
resulting from binaries, it would imply that we are currently missing physics in the binary models.
Finally, we show that high end of the mass distributions of runaway stars is very sensitive to the
assumed black hole natal kicks and propose this as a potentially stringent test for the explosion
mechanism. We discuss companions remaining bound which can evolve into X-ray and gravitational
wave sources.
