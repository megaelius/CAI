We study the evolution, rotation, and surface abundances of O-type dwarfs in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. We analyzed the UV and optical spectra of twenty-three objects and derived photospheric
and wind properties. The observed binary fraction of the sample is ~ 26%, which is compatible with
more systematic studies, if one considers that the actual binary fraction is potentially larger
owing to low-luminosity companions and that the sample excluded obvious spectroscopic binaries.
The location of the fastest rotators in the H-R diagram indicates that these could be several Myr
old. The offset in the position of these fast rotators compared with the other stars confirms the
predictions of evolutionary models that fast-rotating stars tend to evolve more vertically in
the H-R diagram. Only one star of luminosity-class Vz, expected to best characterize extreme youth,
is located on the ZAMS, the other two stars are more evolved. The distribution of nitrogen abundance
of O and B stars suggests that the mechanisms responsible for the chemical enrichment of slowly rotating
massive stars depends only weakly on the star's mass. We confirm that the group of slowly rotating
N-rich stars is not reproduced by the evolutionary tracks. Our results call for stronger mixing
in the models to explain the range of observed N abundances. All stars have an N/C ratio as a function
of stellar luminosity that matches the predictions of the stellar evolution models well. More massive
stars have a higher N/C ratio than the less massive stars. Faster rotators show on average a higher
N/C ratio than slower rotators. The N/O versus N/C ratios agree qualitatively well with those of
stellar evolution models. The only discrepant behavior is observed for the youngest two stars of
the sample, which both show very strong signs of mixing, which is unexpected for their evolutionary
status.
