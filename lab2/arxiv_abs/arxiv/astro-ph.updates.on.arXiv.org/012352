We study the highly magnified arc SGAS J122651.3+215220 caused by a star-forming galaxy source
at $z_s=2.93$ crossing the lensing caustic cast by the galaxy cluster SDSS J1226+2152 ($z_l=0.43$),
using archival Hubble Space Telescope observations. We report in the arc a number of asymmetric
surface brightness features consistently seen across four filters, lying at a fraction of an arcsecond
from the lensing critical curve and likely to be highly but unequally magnified image pairs of underlying
compact sources. One explanation of unequal magnification is strongly coupled microlensing by
intracluster stars, which induces independent flux variations in the images of individual or groups
of source stars in the lensed galaxy. For a second possibility, intracluster dark matter subhalos
invisible to the telescope can effectively perturb lensing magnifications near the critical curve
and give rise to persistently unequal image pairs. Our modeling suggests that the microlensing
hypothesis is in tension with the absence of notable temporal variation in the asymmetries over
a six-year baseline, while subhalos of $\sim 10^6$--$10^8\,M_\odot$ anticipated from structure
formation with Cold Dark Matter typically produce stationary and sizable asymmetries. We judge
that observations at additional times and more precise lens models are necessary to stringently
constrain temporal variability and robustly distinguish between the two possible explanations.
The arc under our study is a scheduled target of a Director's Discretionary Early Release Science
program of the James Webb Space Telescope, which will provide deep images as well as a high-resolution
view with integral field spectroscopy.
