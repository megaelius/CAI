The stability of satellites in the solar system is affected by the so-called evection resonance.
The moons of Saturn, in particular, exhibit a complex dynamical architecture in which co-orbital
configurations occur, especially close to the planet where this resonance is present. We address
the dynamics of the evection resonance, with particular focus on the Saturn system, and compare
the known behavior of the resonance for a single moon to that of a pair of moons in co-orbital trojan
configuration. We developed an analytic expansion of the averaged Hamiltonian of a trojan pair
of bodies, including the perturbation from a distant massive body. {The analysis of the corresponding
equilibrium points was restricted to the asymmetric apsidal corotation solution of the co-orbital
dynamics.} We also performed numerical N-body simulations to construct dynamical maps of the stability
of the evection resonance in the Saturn system, and to study the effects of this resonance under the
migration of trojan moons caused by tidal dissipation. The structure of the phase space of the evection
resonance for trojan satellites is similar to that of a single satellite, differing in that the libration
centers are displaced from their standard positions by an angle that depends on the periastron difference
$\varpi_2-\varpi_1$ and on the mass ratio $m_2/m_1$ of the trojan pair. The interaction with the
inner evection resonance may have been relevant during the early evolution of the Saturn moons Tethys,
Dione, and Rhea. In particular, Rhea may have had trojan companions in the past that were lost when
it crossed the evection resonance, while Tethys and Dione may either have retained their trojans
or have never crossed the evection. This may help to constrain the dynamical processes that led to
the migration of these satellites and to the evection itself.
