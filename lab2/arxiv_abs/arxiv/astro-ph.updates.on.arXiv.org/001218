ABRIDGED: Context: HI and CO large scale surveys of the Milky Way trace the diffuse atomic clouds
and the dense shielded regions of molecular hydrogen clouds. However, until recently, we have not
had spectrally resolved C+ surveys to characterize the photon dominated interstellar medium,
including, the H2 gas without C, the CO-dark H2, in a large sample of clouds. Aims: To use a sparse Galactic
plane survey of the 1.9 THz [C II] spectral line from the Herschel Open Time Key Programme, Galactic
Observations of Terahertz C+ (GOT C+), to characterize the H2 gas without CO in a statistically significant
sample of clouds. Methods: We identify individual clouds in the inner Galaxy by fitting [CII] and
CO isotopologue spectra along each line of sight. We combine these with HI spectra, along with excitation
models and cloud models of C+, to determine the column densities and fractional mass of CO-dark H2
clouds. Results: We identify 1804 narrow velocity [CII] interstellar cloud components in different
categories. About 840 are diffuse molecular clouds with no CO, 510 are transition clouds containing
[CII] and 12CO, but no 13CO, and the remainder are dense molecular clouds containing 13CO emission.
The CO-dark H2 clouds are concentrated between Galactic radii 3.5 to 7.5 kpc and the column density
of the CO-dark H2 layer varies significantly from cloud-to-cloud with an average 9X10^(20) cm-2.
These clouds contain a significant fraction of CO-dark H2 mass, varying from ~75% for diffuse molecular
clouds to ~20% for dense molecular clouds. Conclusions: We find a significant fraction of the warm
molecular ISM gas is invisible in HI and CO, but is detected in [CII]. The fraction of CO-dark H2 is
greatest in the diffuse clouds and decreases with increasing total column density, and is lowest
in the massive clouds.
