We present VLA HI spectral line imaging of 5 sources discovered by ALFALFA. These targets are drawn
from a larger sample of systems that were not uniquely identified with optical counterparts during
ALFALFA processing, and as such have unusually high HI mass to light ratios. These candidate "Almost
Dark" objects fall into 4 categories: 1) objects with nearby HI neighbors that are likely of tidal
origin; 2) objects that appear to be part of a system of multiple HI sources, but which may not be tidal
in origin; 3) objects isolated from nearby ALFALFA HI detections, but located near a gas-poor early-type
galaxy; 4) apparently isolated sources, with no object of coincident redshift within ~400 kpc.
Roughly 75% of the 200 objects without identified counterparts in the $\alpha$.40 database (Haynes
et al. 2011) fall into category 1. This pilot sample contains the first five sources observed as part
of a larger effort to characterize HI sources with no readily identifiable optical counterpart
at single dish resolution. These objects span a range of HI mass [7.41 < log(M$_{\rm HI}$) <
9.51] and HI mass to B-band luminosity ratios (3 < M$_{\rm HI}$/L$_{\rm B}$ < 9). We compare
the HI total intensity and velocity fields to SDSS optical imaging and to archival GALEX UV imaging.
Four of the sources with uncertain or no optical counterpart in the ALFALFA data are identified with
low surface brightness optical counterparts in SDSS imaging when compared with VLA HI intensity
maps, and appear to be galaxies with clear signs of ordered rotation. One source (AGC 208602) is likely
tidal in nature. We find no "dark galaxies" in this limited sample. The present observations reveal
complex sources with suppressed star formation, highlighting both the observational difficulties
and the necessity of synthesis follow-up observations to understand these extreme objects. (abridged)
