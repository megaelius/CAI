We present an extensive study of the Sagittarius II (Sgr II) stellar system using MegaCam g and i photometry,
narrow-band, metallicity-sensitive Calcium H&K doublet photometry, augmented with Keck II/DEIMOS
multi-object spectroscopy. We are able to derive and refine the Sgr II structural and stellar properties:
the colour-magnitude diagram implies Sgr II is old (12.0 +- 0.5 Gyr) and metal-poor. The CaHK photometry
confirms the metal-poor nature of the satellite ([Fe/H]CaHK = -2.32 +- 0.04 dex) and suggests that
Sgr II hosts more than one single stellar population ({\sigma} CaHK = 0.11+0.05-0.03 dex). From
the deep spectroscopic data, the velocity dispersion of the system is found to be {\sigma}vr = 2.7+1.3-1.0
km s-1 after excluding two potential binary stars. Using the Ca infrared triplet measured from our
highest signal-to-noise spectra, we are able to confirm the metallicity and dispersion inferred
from the Pristine photometric metallicities: ([Fe/H] = -2.23 +- 0.05 dex, {\sigma}spectro = 0.10+0.06-0.04
dex). Sgr II's metallicity and absolute magnitude (MV = -5.7 +- 0.1 mag) place the system on the luminosity-metallicity
relation of the Milky Way dwarf galaxies despite its small size. The low, but resolved metallicity
and velocity dispersions paint the picture of a slightly dark matter-dominated satellite. Furthermore,
using the Gaia Data Release 2, we constrain the orbit of the satellite and find an apocenter of 118.4+28.4-23.7
kpc and a pericenter of 54.8+3.3-6.1 kpc. The orbit of Sgr II is consistent with the trailing arm of
the Sgr stream and indicates that it is possibly a satellite of the Sgr dSph that was tidally stripped
from the dwarf's influence.
