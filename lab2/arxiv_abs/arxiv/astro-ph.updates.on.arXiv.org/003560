We present spectroscopic follow-up observations of CR7 with ALMA, targeted at constraining the
infrared (IR) continuum and [CII]$_{158 \mu \rm m}$ line-emission at high spatial resolution matched
to the HST/WFC3 imaging. CR7 is a luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=6.6$ that consists of
three separated UV-continuum components. Our observations reveal several well-separated components
of [CII] emission. The two most luminous components in [CII] coincide with the brightest UV components
(A and B), blue-shifted by $\approx 150$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the peak of Ly$\alpha$ emission.
Other [CII] components are observed close to UV clumps B and C and are blue-shifted by $\approx300$
and $\approx80$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic redshift. We do not detect FIR continuum
emission due to dust with a 3$\sigma$ limiting luminosity L$_{\rm IR} (T_d = 35 \rm \, K) < 3.1\times10^{10}$
L$_{\odot}$. This allows us to mitigate uncertainties in the dust-corrected SFR and derive SFRs
for the three UV clumps A, B and C of 29, 6 and 7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. All clumps have [CII] luminosities
consistent within the scatter observed in the local relation between SFR and L$_{\rm [CII]}$, implying
that strong Ly$\alpha$ emission does not necessarily anti-correlate with [CII] luminosity. Combining
our measurements with the literature, we show that galaxies with blue UV slopes have weaker [CII]
emission at fixed SFR, potentially due to their lower metallicities and/or higher photoionisation.
Comparison with hydrodynamical simulations suggests that CR7's clumps have metallicities of
$0.1<\rm Z/Z_{\odot}<0.2$. The observed ISM structure of CR7 indicates that we are likely witnessing
the build up of a central galaxy in the early Universe through complex accretion of satellites.
