The Sco OB2 association is the nearest OB association, extending over approximately 2000 square
degrees on the sky. Only its brightest and most massive members are already known (from Hipparcos)
across its entire size, while studies of its lower-mass population refer only to small portions
of its extent. In this work we exploit the capabilities of Gaia DR2 measurements to search for Sco
OB2 members across its entire size and down to the lowest stellar masses. We use both Gaia astrometric
(proper motions and parallaxes) and photometric measurements (integrated photometry and colors)
to select association members, using minimal assumptions derived mostly from the Hipparcos studies.
Gaia resolves small details in both the kinematics of individual Sco OB2 subgroups and their distribution
with distance from the Sun. We find a sample of >11000 high-confidence pre-main sequence members
of Sco OB2, plus ~2740 main-sequence candidate members with a larger field-star contamination.
Most stars belong to a diffuse population, which outlines clearly the shape of the association.
Upper Sco is the densest region of Sco OB2, characterized by a complex spatial and kinematical structure,
with no global pattern of motion. Other dense subclusters are found in Upper Centaurus-Lupus (the
richest one coincident with the group near V1062 Sco found by Roser et al. 2018), and in Lower Centaurus-Crux.
The clustered stars appear to be younger than the diffuse PMS population, suggesting star formation
in small groups which rapidly disperse and dilute, reaching space densities lower than field stars
while keeping memory of their original kinematics. No large-scale expansion is found, in agreement
with previous studies. We also find that the open cluster IC 2602 has a similar dynamics to Sco OB2,
and its PMS members are currently evaporating and forming a diffuse (size ~10 deg) halo around its
double-peaked core.
