Zechmeister et al. (2009) surveyed 38 nearby M dwarfs from March 2000 to March 2007 with VLT2 and the
UVES spectrometer. This data has recently been reanalyzed (Butler et al. 2019), yielding a significant
improvement in the Doppler velocity precision. Spurred by this, we have combined the UVES data with
velocity sets from HARPS, Magellan/PFS, and Keck/HIRES. Sixteen planet candidates have been uncovered
orbiting nine M dwarfs. Five of them are new planets corresponding to radial velocity signals, which
are not sensitive to the choice of noise models and are identified in multiple data sets over various
timespans. Eight candidate planets require additional observation to be confirmed. We also confirm
three previously reported planets. Among the new planets, GJ 180 d and GJ 229A c are super-Earths
located in the conservative habitable zones of their host stars. We investigate their dynamical
stability using the Monte Carlo approach and find both planetary orbits are robust to the gravitational
perturbations of the companion planets. Due to their proximity to the Sun, the angular separation
between the host stars and the potentially habitable planets in these two systems is 25 and 59 mas,
respectively. They are thus good candidates for future direct imaging by JWST and E-ELT. In addition
we find GJ 433 c, a cold super-Neptune belonging to an unexplored population of Neptune-like planets.
With a separation of 0.5 as from its host star, GJ 433 c is probably the first realistic candidate for
direct imaging of cold Neptunes. A comprehensive survey of these planets is important for the studies
of planet formation.
