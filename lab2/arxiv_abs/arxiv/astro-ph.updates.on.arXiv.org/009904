The exact time-dependent solution is obtained for a magnetic field growth during a spherically
symmetric accretion into a black hole (BH) with a Schwarzschild metric. Magnetic field is increasing
with time, changing from the initially uniform into a quasi-radial field. Equipartition between
magnetic and kinetic energies in the falling gas is established in the developed stages of the flow.
Estimates of the synchrotron radiation intensity are presented for the stationary flow. The main
part of the radiation is formed in the region $r \leq 7 r_g$, here $r_g$ is a BH gravitational radius.
The two-dimensional stationary self-similar magnetohydrodynamic solution is obtained for the
matter accretion into BH, in a presence of a large-scale magnetic field, when the magnetic field
far from the BH is homogeneous and does not influence the flow. At the symmetry plane perpendicular
to the direction of the distant magnetic field, the quasi-stationary disk is formed around BH, which
structure is determined by dissipation processes. Parameters of the shock forming due to matter
infall onto the disk are obtained. The radiation spectrum of the disk and the shock are obtained for
the $10\,\, M_\odot$ BH. The luminosity of such object is about the solar one, for a characteristic
galactic gas density, with possibility of observation at distances less than 1 kpc. The spectra
of a laminar and a turbulent disk structure around BH are very different. The turbulent disk emits
a large part of its flux in the infrared. It may occur that some of the galactic infrared star-like
sources are a single BH in the turbulent accretion state. The radiative efficiency of the magnetized
disk is very high, reaching $\sim 0.5\,\dot M\,c^2$ so it was called recently as a magnetically arrested
disk (MAD). Numerical simulations of MAD, and its appearance during accretion into neutron stars
are considered and discussed.
