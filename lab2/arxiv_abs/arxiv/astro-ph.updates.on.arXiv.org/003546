Pierre Auger observatory reported the distribution of arrival directions of the highest energy
cosmic rays. These events were collected in 10 years of operations with declinations between -90$^\circ$
and +45$^\circ$. The IceCube neutrino telescope reported the detection of 54 extraterrestrial
neutrinos in the High-Energy Starting Events catalog. The highest-energy neutrino event (IC35)
reported in this catalog had an energy of 2004$^{+236}_{-262}$ TeV and was located centered at RA=$208.4^\circ$
and DEC=$-55.8^\circ$ (J2000). Being Centaurus A the nearest radio-loud active galactic nucleus
and one of the best potential candidates for accelerating cosmic rays up to $\sim\, 10^{20}$ eV,
we show that UHECRs with $E> 58$ EeV around the direction of Centaurus A (15$^\circ$ radius) could
be accelerated inside the giant lobes. Studying the composition of UHECRs through the photodisintegration
processes due to Cosmic Microwave background photons and the average deflecting angles that nuclei
undergo due to galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields, it is shown that the most promise candidates
of UHECR composition are He nuclei, although small fractions of ligth nuclei such as nitrogen nuclei
may be expected. These comic rays unavoidably interact with external radiation fields and ambient
gas whereas they propagate through the lobes and their paths to Earth. Using the buoyancy ages of
the giant radio lobes instead of their spectral ages, and those UHECRs in the direction of the IC35
event, we found that the IC35 event cannot be generated inside the giant lobes. Additionally, considering
the closest Galaxies around Centaurus A and the hadronic interactions in their paths to Earth, we
found that IC35 event might be created in this environment.
