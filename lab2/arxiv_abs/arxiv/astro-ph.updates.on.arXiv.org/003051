We monitored the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary SAX J1750.8-2900 after the end of its 2015/2016
outburst using the X-ray Telescope (XRT) aboard Swift to detect possible post-outburst 'rebrightenings',
similar to those seen after its 2008 outburst. We did not detect any such rebrightening behaviour,
suggesting that the physical mechanism behind the rebrightening events is not always active after
each outburst of the source. Any model that attempts to explain these rebrightenings should thus
be able to reproduce different outburst profiles of the source at different times. Surprisingly,
our Swift/XRT observations were unable to detect the source, contrary to previous Swift/XRT observations
in quiescence. We determined a temperature upper limit of $\leq$ 106 eV, much colder than the post
2008 outburst value of $\sim$ 145 eV. We also report on an archival Chandra observation of the source
after its 2011 outburst and found a temperature of $\sim$ 126 eV. These different quiescent temperatures,
including the non-detection very close after the end of the 2015/2016 outburst are difficult to
explain in any model assuming we observe the cooling emission from a hot neutron star. We discuss
our observations in the context of a change in envelope composition of the neutron star crust and
(possibly in combination with) a cooling accretion-heated crust. However, both hypotheses cannot
fully explain our results unless potentially unrealistic assumptions are made. Irrespective
of what causes the variability in surface temperature, it is clear that the neutron star in SAX J1750.8-2900
may not be as hot as previously assumed.
