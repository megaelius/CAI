Measuring the properties of extragalactic magnetic fields through the effect of Faraday rotation
provides a means to understand the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism. Here we use data from
the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) to calculate the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of close pairs
of extragalactic radio sources. By considering the RM difference ($\Delta$RM) between physical
pairs (e.g. double-lobed radio galaxies) and non-physical pairs (i.e. close projected sources
on the sky), we statistically isolate the contribution of extragalactic magnetic fields to the
total RM variance along the line of sight. We find a difference in the rms of $\Delta$RM between non-physical
and physical pairs of 0.4$\pm$0.3 rad/m$^2$, and a difference in the corresponding median |$\Delta$RM|
values of 0.3$\pm$0.4 rad/m$^2$. This enables us to place an upper limit on the co-moving cosmological
magnetic field strength of $B < 2.5$ nG on Mpc scales. This limit is obtained by exploring a wide range
of input magnetic field strengths in a model of cosmic over-densities that realistically reflects
the observed matter inhomogeneities on large scales. We also compare the LOFAR RM data with a suite
of cosmological MHD simulations, that explore different magnetogenesis scenarios. Both magnetization
of the large scale structure by astrophysical processes such as galactic and AGN outflows, and simple
primordial scenarios with seed field strengths of $B\lesssim0.5$ nG cannot be rejected by the current
data, while stronger primordial fields or models with dynamo amplification in filaments are disfavoured.
In general, LOFAR polarized sources are typically located in regions of the Universe with low RM
variance, making them excellent probes of the weak magnetization of cosmic filaments and voids
far from galaxy cluster environments.
