We present stellar atmosphere and evolution models of main sequence stars in two stellar populations
of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6752. These populations represent the two extremes of light-element
abundance variations in the cluster. NGC 6752 is a benchmark cluster in the study of multiple stellar
populations because of the rich array of spectroscopic abundances and panchromatic Hubble Space
Telescope photometry. The spectroscopic abundances are used to compute stellar atmosphere and
evolution models. The synthetic spectra for the two populations show significant differences
in the ultraviolet and, for the coolest temperatures, in the near-infrared. The stellar evolution
models exhibit insignificant differences in the H-R diagram except on the lower main sequence.
The appearance of multiple sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of NGC 6752 is almost
exclusively due to spectral effects caused by the abundance variations. The models reproduce the
observed splitting and/or broadening of sequences in a range of CMDs. The ultraviolet CMDs are sensitive
to variations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen but the models are not reliable enough to directly
estimate abundance variations from photometry. On the other hand, the widening of the lower main
sequence in the near-infrared CMD, driven by oxygen-variation via the water molecule, is well-described
by the models and can be used to estimate the range of oxygen present in a cluster from photometry.
We confirm that it is possible to use multiband photometry to estimate helium variations among the
different populations, with the caveat that the estimated amount of helium-enhancement is model-dependent.
