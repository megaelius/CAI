In this work we present spectra of all $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglows that have been promptly
observed with the X-shooter spectrograph until 31-03-2017. In total, we obtained spectroscopic
observations of 103 individual GRBs observed within 48 hours of the GRB trigger. Redshifts have
been measured for 97 per cent of these, covering a redshift range from 0.059 to 7.84. Based on a set
of observational selection criteria that minimize biases with regards to intrinsic properties
of the GRBs, the follow-up effort has been focused on producing a homogeneous sample of 93 afterglow
spectra for GRBs discovered by the Swift satellite. We here provide a public release of all the reduced
spectra, including continuum estimates and telluric absorption corrections. For completeness,
we also provide reductions for the 18 late-time observations of the underlying host galaxies. We
provide an assessment of the degree of completeness with respect to the parent GRB population, in
terms of the X-ray properties of the bursts in the sample and find that the sample presented here is
representative of the full Swift sample. We constrain the fraction of dark bursts to be < 28 per cent
and we confirm previous results that higher optical darkness is correlated with increased X-ray
absorption. For the 42 bursts for which it is possible, we provide a measurement of the neutral hydrogen
column density, increasing the total number of published HI column density measurements by $\sim$
33 per cent. This dataset provides a unique resource to study the ISM across cosmic time, from the
local progenitor surroundings to the intervening universe.
