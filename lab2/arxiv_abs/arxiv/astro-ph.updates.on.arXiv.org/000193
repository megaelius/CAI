The Hubble morphological sequence from early to late galaxies corresponds to an increasing rate
of specific star formation. The Hubble sequence also follows a banana-shaped correlation between
24 and 70 micron luminosities, both normalized with the K-band luminosity. We show that this correlation
is significantly tightened if galaxies with central AGN emission are removed, but the cosmic scatter
of elliptical galaxies in both 24 and 70 micron luminosities remains significant along the correlation.
We find that the 24 micron variation among ellipticals correlates with stellar metallicity, reflecting
emission from hot dust in winds from asymptotic giant branch stars of varying metallicity. Infrared
surface brightness variations in elliptical galaxies indicate that the K - 24 color profile is U-shaped
for reasons that are unclear. In some elliptical galaxies cold interstellar dust emitting at 70
and 160 microns may arise from recent gas-rich mergers. However, we argue that most of the large range
of 70 micron luminosity in elliptical galaxies is due to dust transported from galactic cores by
feedback events in (currently IR-quiet) active galactic nuclei. Cooler dusty gas naturally accumulates
in the cores of elliptical galaxies due to dust-cooled local stellar mass loss and may accrete onto
the central black hole, releasing energy. AGN-heated gas can transport dust in cores 5-10 kpc out
into the hot gas atmospheres where it radiates extended 70 micron emission but is eventually destroyed
by sputtering. This, and some modest star formation, defines a cycle of dust creation and destruction.
Elliptical galaxies evidently undergo large transient excursions in the banana plot in times comparable
to the sputtering time or AGN duty cycle, 10 Myrs. Normally regarded as passive, elliptical galaxies
are the most active galaxies in the IR color-color correlation.
