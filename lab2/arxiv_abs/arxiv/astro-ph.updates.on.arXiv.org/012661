Gravitational lensing sometimes dominates the observed properties of apparently very bright
objects. We present morphological properties in the high-resolution (FWHM $\sim0.''15$) Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1-mm map for an ultra-luminous quasar (QSO) at $z=6.30$,
SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (hereafter J0100+2802), whose black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$ is the most
massive ($\sim$ 1.2$\times10^{10}M_{\odot}$) at $z>6$ ever known. We find that the continuum
emission of J0100+2802 is resolved into a quadruple system within a radius of $0.''2$, which can
be interpreted as either multiple dusty star-forming regions in the host galaxy or multiple images
due to strong gravitational lensing. The Mg$_{\rm II}$ absorption and the potential Ly$\alpha$
line features have been identified at $z=2.33$ in the near-infrared spectroscopy towards J0100+2802,
and a simple mass model fitting well reproduces the positions and flux densities of the quadruple
system, both of which are consistent with the latter interpretation. Although a high-resolution
map taken in the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) on board Hubble Space Telescope (HST) shows a morphology
with an apparently single component, in our fiducial lens mass model it can simply be explained by
a $\sim50$ pc scale offset between the ALMA and HST emission regions. In this case, the magnification
factor for the observed HST emission is obtained to $\sim450$, reducing the intrinsic $M_{\rm BH}$
estimate to even below $10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$. The confirmation or the rejection of the gravitational
lensing scenario is important for our understanding of the super-massive black holes in the early
Universe.
