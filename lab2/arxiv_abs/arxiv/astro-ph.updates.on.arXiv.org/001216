In order to complete the knowledge of the magnetic field and of its influence during the transition
from Asymptotic Giant Branch to Planetary Nebulae stages, we have undertaken a search for magnetic
fields at the surface of Mira stars. We used spectropolarimetric observations, collected with
the Narval instrument at TBL, in order to detect - with Least Squares Deconvolution method - a Zeeman
signature in the visible part of the spectrum. We present the first spectropolarimetric observations
of the S-type Mira star chi Cyg, performed around its maximum light. We have detected a polarimetric
signal in the Stokes V spectra and we have established its Zeeman origin. We claim that it is likely
to be related to a weak magnetic field present at the photospheric level and in the lower part of the
stellar atmosphere. We have estimated the strength of its longitudinal component to about 2-3 Gauss.
This result favors a 1/r law for the variation of the magnetic field strength across the circumstellar
envelope of chi Cyg. This is the first detection of a weak magnetic field at the stellar surface of
a Mira star and we discuss its origin in the framework of shock waves periodically propagating throughout
the atmosphere of these radially pulsating stars. At the date of our observations of chi Cyg, the
shock wave reaches its maximum intensity, and it is likely that the shock amplifies a weak stellar
magnetic field during its passage through the atmosphere. Without such an amplification by the
shock, the magnetic field strength would have been too low to be detected. For the first time, we also
report strong Stokes Q and U signatures (linear polarization) centered onto the zero velocity (i.e.,
at the shock front position). They seem to indicate that the radial direction would be favored by
the shock during its propagation throughout the atmosphere.
