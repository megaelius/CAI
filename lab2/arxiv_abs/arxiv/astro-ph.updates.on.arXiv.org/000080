In this paper we develop the extended jet model of Potter & Cotter to model the simultaneous multi-wavelength
spectra of six Compton-dominant blazars. We include an accelerating parabolic base transitioning
to a slowly decelerating conical jet with a geometry set by observations of M87 and consistent with
simulations and theory. We investigate several jet models and find that the optically thick to thin
synchrotron break in the radio spectrum requires the jet to first come into equipartition at large
distances along the jet (10^5 Schwarzschild radii), consistent with the observed transition from
parabolic to conical in the jet of M87. We confirm this result analytically and calculate the expected
frequency core-shift relations for the models under consideration. We find that a parabolic jet
transitioning to a ballistic conical jet, which starts in equipartition and becomes more particle
dominated at larger distances, fits the multiwavelength data of the six blazars well, whilst an
adiabatic equipartition conical section requires very large bulk Lorentz factors to reproduce
the Compton-dominance of the blazars. We find that all these blazars require high power, high bulk
Lorentz factor jets observed close to the line of sight as we expect from the blazar sequence and consistent
with the results from Paper II. The inverse-Compton emission in our fits is due to inverse-Compton
scattering of high-redshift CMB photons at large distances along the jet due to the high bulk Lorentz
factors of the jets. We postulate a new interpretation of the blazar sequence based on the radius
of the transition region of the jet (where the jet is brightest in synchrotron emission) scaling
linearly with black hole mass.
