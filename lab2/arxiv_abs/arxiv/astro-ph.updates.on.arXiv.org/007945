We present the highest resolution study to date of super-Earths migrating in inviscid and low viscosity
discs, motivated by the connection to laminar, wind-driven models of protoplanetary discs. Our
models unveil the critical role of vortices in determining the migration behaviour for partial
gap-opening planets. Vortices form in pressure maxima at gap edges, and prevent the disc-feedback
stopping of migration for intermediate planets in low viscosity and inviscid discs, contrary to
the concept of the `inertial limit' or `disc feedback' halting predicted from analytical models.
Vortices may also form in the corotation region, and can dramatically modify migration behaviour
through direct gravitational interaction with the planet. These features become apparent at high
resolution, and for all but the highest viscosities there exist significant difficulties in obtaining
numerically converged results. The migration of partial gap-opening planets, however, clearly
becomes non-deterministic for sufficiently low viscosities. At moderate viscosity, a smooth
disc-feedback regime is found in which migration can slow substantially, and the migration timescale
observed corresponds to migration being driven by diffusive relaxation of the gap edges. At high
viscosity classical Type I migration is recovered. For Jupiter-analogue planets in inviscid discs,
a wide, deep gap is formed. Transient Type II migration occurs over radial length scales corresponding
to the gap width, beyond which migration can stall. Finally, we examine the particle trapping driven
by structures left in inviscid discs by a migrating planet, and find that particle traps in the form
of multiple rings and vortices can persist long after the planet has passed. In this case, the observation
of particle traps by submillimeter interferometers such as ALMA cannot be used to infer the current
presence of an adjacent planet.
