We investigate mass ejection from accretion disks formed in mergers of black holes (BHs) and neutron
stars (NSs). The third observing run of the LIGO/Virgo interferometers provided BH-NS candidate
events that yielded no electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The broad range of disk configurations
expected from BH-NS mergers motivates a thorough exploration of parameter space to improve EM signal
predictions. Here we conduct 27 high-resolution, axisymmetric, long-term hydrodynamic simulations
of the viscous evolution of black hole accretion disks that include neutrino emission/absorption
effects and post-processing with a nuclear reaction network. In the absence of magnetic fields,
these simulations provide a lower-limit to the fraction of the initial disk mass ejected. We find
a nearly linear inverse dependence of this fraction on disk compactness (BH mass over initial disk
radius). The dependence is related to the fraction of the disk mass accreted at the time when weak
interactions freeze out. We also characterize a trend of decreasing ejected fraction and decreasing
lanthanide/actinide content with increasing disk mass at fixed BH mass. This trend results from
a longer time to reach weak freezout and an increasingly dominant role of neutrino absorption at
higher disk masses. We provide estimates of the radioactive luminosity from the disk outflow alone
available to power kilonovae over the range of BH and NS combinations studied, finding a spread of
two orders of magnitude. For most of the BH-NS parameter space, the disk outflow contribution is
well below the kilonova mass upper limits for S190814bv.
