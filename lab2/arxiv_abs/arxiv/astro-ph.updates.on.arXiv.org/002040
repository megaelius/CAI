We present, for the first time, a characterization of the Local Universe (LU) using high precision
constrained $N$-body simulations based on self-consistent phase-space reconstructions of the
large-scale structure. Our study relies on the Two-Micron All-Sky Galaxy Redshift Survey. The
first question we want to address is whether we live in a special cosmic web environment. We assess
this problem by estimating cosmic variance from a set of unconstrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations
as a function of distance to random observers. By computing volume and mass filling fractions for
voids, sheets, filaments and knots, we find that the LU displays a typical scatter of about $1\sigma$
at scales $r\gtrsim15\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc, in agreement with $\Lambda$CDM, converging to a fair unbiased
sample when considering spheres of about $60\,h^{-1}\,$Mpc radius. Additionally, we compute
the matter density profile of the LU and found a reasonable agreement with the estimates of Karachentsev
(2012) only when considering the contribution of dark haloes. This indicates that the observational
estimates may be biased towards low density values. As a first application of our reconstructed
cosmic web, we investigate the likelihood of different galaxy morphological types to inhabit certain
cosmic web environments. In particular we find, that irrespective of the method used to define the
web, either based on the density or on the peculiar velocity field, elliptical galaxies show a clear
tendency to preferentially reside in clusters as opposed to voids (up to a level of $5.3\sigma$ and
$9.8\sigma$ respectively) and the opposite happens to spiral galaxies (up to a level of $5.6\sigma$
and $5.4\sigma$ respectively). These findings are compatible with previous works, however providing
results at higher confidence levels.
