We present an analysis to disentangle the connection between physical quantities that characterize
the conditions of ionized HII regions -- metallicity ($Z$), ionization parameter ($U$), and electron
density ($n_\mathrm{e}$) -- and the global stellar mass ($M_\ast$) and specific star formation
rate ($\mathrm{sSFR}=\mathrm{SFR}/M_\ast$) of the host galaxies. We construct composite spectra
of galaxies at $0.027 \le z \le 0.25$ from Sloan Digital Sky Survey, separating the sample into bins
of $M_\ast$ and sSFR, and estimate the nebular conditions from the emission line flux ratios. Specially,
metallicity is estimated from the direct method based on the faint auroral lines [OIII]$\lambda$4363
and [OII]$\lambda\lambda$7320,7330. The metallicity estimates cover a wide range from $12+\log\mathrm{O/H}\sim7.6\textrm{--}8.9$.
It is found that these three nebular parameters all are tightly correlated with the location in the
$M_\ast$--sSFR plane. With simple physically-motivated ans\"atze, we derive scaling relations
between these physical quantities by performing multi regression analysis. In particular, we
find that $U$ is primarily controlled by sSFR, as $U \propto \mathrm{sSFR}^{0.43}$, but also depends
significantly on both $Z$ and $n_\mathrm{e}$. The derived partial dependence of $U \propto Z^{-0.36}$
is weaker than the apparent correlation ($U\propto Z^{-1.52}$). The remaining negative dependence
of $U$ on $n_\mathrm{e}$ is found to be $U \propto n_\mathrm{e}^{-0.29}$. The scaling relations
we derived are in agreement with predictions from theoretical models and observations of each aspect
of the link between these quantities. Our results provide a useful set of equations to predict the
nebular conditions and emission-line fluxes of galaxies in semi-analytic models.
