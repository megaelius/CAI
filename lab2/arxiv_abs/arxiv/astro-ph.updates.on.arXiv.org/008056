Context: The observations of solar-like oscillations in evolved stars have brought important
constraints on their internal rotation rates. To correctly reproduce these data, an efficient
transport mechanism is needed in addition to meridional circulation and shear instability. Aims:
We study the efficiency of the transport of angular momentum during the subgiant phase. Results:
The precise asteroseismic measurements of both core and surface rotation rates available for the
six Kepler targets enable a precise determination of the efficiency of the transport of angular
momentum needed for each of these subgiants. These results are found to be insensitive to all the
uncertainties related to the modelling of rotational effects before the post-main sequence phase.
An interesting exception in this context is the case of young subgiants (typical values of log(g)
close to 4), because their rotational properties are sensitive to the degree of radial differential
rotation on the main sequence. These young subgiants constitute therefore perfect targets to constrain
the transport of angular momentum on the main sequence from asteroseismic observations of evolved
stars. As for red giants, we find that the efficiency of the additional transport process increases
with the mass of the star during the subgiant phase. However, the efficiency of this undetermined
mechanism decreases with evolution during the subgiant phase, contrary to what is found for red
giants. Consequently, a transport process with an efficiency that increases with the degree of
radial differential rotation cannot account for the core rotation rates of subgiants, while it
correctly reproduces the rotation rates of red giant stars. This suggests that the physical nature
of the additional mechanism needed for the internal transport of angular momentum may be different
in subgiant and red giant stars.
