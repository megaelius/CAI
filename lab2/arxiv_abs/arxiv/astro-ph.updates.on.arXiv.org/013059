The paper examines the early growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in cosmological hydrodynamic
simulations with different BH seeding scenarios. Employing the constrained Gaussian realization,
we reconstruct the initial conditions in the large-volume BlueTides simulation and run them to
$z=6$ to cross-validate that the method reproduces the first quasars and their environments. Our
constrained simulations in a volume of $(15 h^{-1} {\rm Mpc})^3$ successfully recover the evolution
of large-scale structure and the stellar and BH masses in the vicinity of a $\sim10^{12} M_{\odot}$
halo which we identified in BlueTides at $z\sim7$ hosting a $\sim10^9 M_{\odot}$ SMBH. Among our
constrained simulations, only the ones with a low-tidal field and high-density peak in the initial
conditions induce the fastest BH growth required to explain the $z>6$ quasars. We run two sets of
simulations with different BH seed masses of $5\times10^3$, $5\times10^4$, and $5\times10^5
h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, (a) with the same ratio of halo to BH seed mass and (b) with the same halo threshold
mass. At $z = 6$, all the SMBHs converge in mass to $\sim10^9 M_{\odot}$ except for the one with the
smallest seed in (b) undergoing critical BH growth and reaching $\sim10^{8-9} M_{\odot}$, albeit
with most of the growth in (b) delayed compared to set (a). The finding of eight BH mergers in the small-seed
scenario (four with masses $10^4\sim10^6 M_{\odot}$ at $z > 12$), six in the intermediate-seed
scenario, and zero in the large-seed scenario suggests that the vast BHs in the small-seed scenario
merge frequently during the early phases of the growth of SMBHs. The increased BH merger rate for
the low-mass BH seed and low-mass halo threshold scenario provides an exciting prospect for discriminating
BH formation mechanisms with the advent of multi-messenger astrophysics and next-generation
GW facilities.
