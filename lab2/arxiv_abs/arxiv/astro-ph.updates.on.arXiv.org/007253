Algol-type binary systems are the product of rapid mass transfer between the initially more massive
component to its companion. It is still unknown whether the process is conservative, or whether
substantial mass is lost from the system. The history of a system prior to mass exchange is imprinted
in the photospheric chemical composition, in particular in the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio.
We use this to trace the efficiency of mass-transfer processes in the components of a classical Algol-type
system, $\delta$ Librae. The present analysis is based on new spectroscopic data (ground-based
high-resolution \'echelle spectra) and extracted archival photometric observations (space-based
measurements from the STEREO satellites). In the orbital solution, non-Keplerian effects on the
radial-velocity variations were taken into account. This reduces the primary's mass by 1.1 \Msun\
($\sim$23\%) significantly in comparison to previous studies, and removes a long-standing discrepancy
between the radius and effective temperature. A spectral disentangling technique is applied to
the \'echelle observations and the spectra of the individual components are separated. Atmospheric
and abundance analyses are performed for the mass-gaining component and we found C/N $= 1.55 \pm
0.40$ for this star. An extensive set of evolutionary models ($3.5\times10^6$) for both components
are calculated from which the best-fitting model is derived. It is found that $\beta$, the parameter
which quantifies the efficiency of mass-loss from a binary system, is close to zero. This means that
the mass-transfer in $\delta$ Lib is mostly conservative with little mass loss from the system.
