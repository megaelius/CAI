The dense prominence material is believed to be supported against gravity through the magnetic
tension of dipped coronal magnetic field. For quiescent prominences, which exhibit many gravity-driven
flows, hydrodynamic forces are likely to play an important role in the determination of both the
large and small scale magnetic field distributions. In this study, we present the first steps toward
creating three-dimensional magneto-hydrostatic prominence model where the prominence is formed
in the dips of a coronal flux tube. Here 2.5D equilibria are created by adding mass to an initially
force-free magnetic field, then performing a secondary magnetohydrodynamic relaxation. Two
inverse polarity magnetic field configurations are studied in detail, a simple o-point configuration
with a ratio of the horizontal field (B_x) to the axial field (B_y) of 1:2 and a more complex model that
also has an x-point with a ratio of 1:11. The models show that support against gravity is either by
total pressure or tension, with only tension support resembling observed quiescent prominences.
The o-point of the coronal flux tube was pulled down by the prominence material, leading to compression
of the magnetic field at the base of the prominence. Therefore tension support comes from the small
curvature of the compressed magnetic field at the bottom and the larger curvature of the stretched
magnetic field at the top of the prominence. It was found that this method does not guarantee convergence
to a prominence-like equilibrium in the case where an x-point exists below the prominence flux tube.
The results imply that a plasma beta of ~ 0.1 is necessary to support prominences through magnetic
tension.
