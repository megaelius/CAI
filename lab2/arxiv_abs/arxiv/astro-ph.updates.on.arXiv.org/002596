We analyze the 5.5 year all-sky data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope restricted to gamma-ray
photons with energies between 0.6--307.2 GeV. Raw count maps show a superposition of diffuse and
point-like contributions and are subject to shot noise and instrumental artifacts. Using the D3PO
inference algorithm, we model the observed photon counts as the sum of a diffuse and a point-like
photon flux, convolved with the instrumental beam and subject to Poissonian shot noise. The D3PO
algorithm performs a Bayesian inference in this setting without the use of spatial or spectral templates;
i.e., it removes the shot noise, deconvolves the instrumental response, and yields estimates for
the two flux components separately. The non-parametric reconstruction uncovers the morphology
of the diffuse photon flux up to several hundred GeV. We present an all-sky spectral index map for
the diffuse component. We show that the diffuse gamma-ray flux can phenomenologically be described
by only two distinct components: a soft component, presumably dominated by hadronic processes,
tracing the dense, cold interstellar medium and a hard component, presumably dominated by leptonic
interactions, following the hot and dilute medium and outflows such as the Fermi bubbles. A comparison
of the soft component to the Galactic dust emission indicates that dust-to-soft-gamma ratio in
the interstellar medium decreases with latitude. The hard component exists in a thick Galactic
disk and tends to flow out of the Galaxy at some locations. Furthermore, we find the angular power
spectrum of the diffuse flux to roughly follow a power-law with an index of 2.45 on large scales, independent
of energy. Our preliminary point source catalog includes 2522 candidates of which we associate
1269 with known sources from the second Fermi source catalog. We provide upper limit fluxes for galaxy
clusters with known radio halos.
