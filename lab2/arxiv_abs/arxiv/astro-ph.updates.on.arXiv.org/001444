The study of exoplanetary atmospheres is one of the most exciting and dynamic frontiers in astronomy.
Over the past two decades ongoing surveys have revealed an astonishing diversity in the planetary
masses, radii, temperatures, orbital parameters, and host stellar properties of exoplanetary
systems. We are now moving into an era where we can begin to address fundamental questions concerning
the diversity of exoplanetary compositions, atmospheric and interior processes, and formation
histories, just as have been pursued for solar system planets over the past century. Exoplanetary
atmospheres provide a direct means to address these questions via their observable spectral signatures.
In the last decade, and particularly in the last five years, tremendous progress has been made in
detecting atmospheric signatures of exoplanets through photometric and spectroscopic methods
using a variety of space-borne and/or ground-based observational facilities. These observations
are beginning to provide important constraints on a wide gamut of atmospheric properties, including
pressure-temperature profiles, chemical compositions, energy circulation, presence of clouds,
and non-equilibrium processes. The latest studies are also beginning to connect the inferred chemical
compositions to exoplanetary formation conditions. In the present chapter, we review the most
recent developments in the area of exoplanetary atmospheres. Our review covers advances in both
observations and theory of exoplanetary atmospheres, and spans a broad range of exoplanet types
(gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths) and detection methods (transiting planets, direct
imaging, and radial velocity). We close with a discussion of the bright prospects for future studies
of exoplanetary atmospheres.
