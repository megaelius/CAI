As Milky Way-like galaxies form, smaller stellar systems accrete onto the main galactic progenitor,
assembling a kinematically hot, spheroidal-like stellar halo surrounding the galactic disc.
There is extensive observational evidence of this merging process both in the Milky Way and in external
galaxies. However, unambiguously identifying the oldest stellar population formed in the Milky
Way main progenitor has remained elusive, as a good fraction of observed stars in our Galactic halo
have characteristics pointing to an external origin. In this paper, we unveil the old stellar population
that can be associated with the first star formation events in the Milky Way. We identify this population
with the red sequence of the enigmatic, double sequenced colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the
kinematically hot, halo stars discovered in the second data release of the Gaia mission. This discovery
results from the novel, robust determination of stellar age distributions in the thick disc and
halo Gaia CMDs, using the well established technique of CMD modelling, and the comparison with state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. The age distributions unambiguously show that
the stars in the blue and red sequences of the halo CMD are equally old, and older than the bulk of thick
disc stars. This evidence allows us to identify the red sequence as the 'in-situ' halo stars, formed
within the seed progenitor of our Milky Way. The in-situ halo is naturally more metal rich than the
accreted halo population originating in the lower-mass galaxy Gaia-Enceladus whose stars form
most of the blue sequence. These findings provide a crystal clear picture of the early sequence of
events that gave rise to the complex Milky Way structure, and have far reaching implications for
understanding the formation of disc galaxies in general.
