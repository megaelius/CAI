In recent ALMA surveys, the gas distributions and velocity structures of most of the protoplanetary
disks can still not be imaged at high S/N due to the short integration time. In this work, we re-analyzed
the ALMA 13CO (3-2) and C18O (3-2) data of 88 young stellar objects in Lupus with the velocity-aligned
stacking method to enhance S/N and to study the kinematics and disk properties traced by molecular
lines. This method aligns spectra at different positions in a disk based on the projected Keplerian
velocities at their positions and then stacks them. This method enhances the S/N ratios of molecular-line
data and allows us to obtain better detections and to constrain dynamical stellar masses and disk
orientations. We obtain 13CO detections in 41 disks and C18O detections in 18 disks with 11 new detections
in 13CO and 9 new detections in C18O after applying the method. We estimate the disk orientations
and the dynamical stellar masses from the 13CO data. Our estimated dynamical stellar masses correlate
with the spectroscopic stellar masses, and in a subsample of 16 sources, where the inclination angles
are better constrained, the two masses are in a good agreement within the uncertainties and with
a mean difference of 0.15 Msun. With more detections of fainter disks, our results show that high
gas masses derived from the 13CO and C18O lines tend to be associated with high dust masses estimated
from the continuum emission. Nevertheless, the scatter is large (0.9 dex), implying large uncertainties
in deriving the disk gas mass from the line fluxes. We find that with such large uncertainties it is
expected that there is no correlation between the disk gas mass and the mass accretion rate with the
current data. Deeper observations to detect disks with gas masses <1E-5 Msun in molecular lines
are needed to investigate the correlation between the disk gas mass and the mass accretion rate.
