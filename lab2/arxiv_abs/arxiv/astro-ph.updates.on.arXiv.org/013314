We present calculations of auroral radio powers of magnetised hot Jupiters orbiting Sun-like stars,
computed using global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modelling of the magnetospheric and ionospheric
convection arising from the interaction between the magnetosphere and the stellar wind. Exoplanetary
auroral radio powers are traditionally estimated using empirical or analytically-derived relations,
such as the Radiometric Bode's Law (RBL), which relates radio power to the magnetic or kinetic energy
dissipated in the stellar wind-planet interaction. Such methods risk an oversimplification of
the magnetospheric electrodynamics giving rise to radio emission. As the next step toward a self-consistent
picture, we model the stellar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling currents using a 3D MHD
model. We compute electron-cyclotron maser instability-driven emission from the calculated
ionospheric field-aligned current density. We show that the auroral radio power is highly sensitive
to interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, and that the emission is saturated for plausible
hot Jupiter Pedersen conductances, indicating that radio power may be largely independent of ionospheric
conductance. We estimate peak radio powers of $10^{14}$ W from a planet exposed to an IMF strength
of $10^3$ nT, implying flux densities at a distance of 15 pc from Earth potentially detectable with
current and future radio telescopes. We also find a relation between radio power and planetary orbital
distance that is broadly consistent with results from previous analytic models of magnetosphere-ionosphere
coupling at hot Jupiters, and indicates that the RBL likely overestimates the radio powers by up
to two orders of magnitude in the hot Jupiter regime
