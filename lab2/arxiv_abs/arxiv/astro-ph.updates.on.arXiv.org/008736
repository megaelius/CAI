This paper identifies limits on the growth of a rock-ice planetary core by the accretion of small
solids from a gaseous disk. Pebbles falling into a gaseous envelope disintegrate into small grains
long before reaching the core, due to sublimation, mutual collisions, and sandblasting. The sublimation
of water ice creates a temperature plateau in the envelope, and a strong inward peak in the density
of hydrogen and water vapor. But the high accretion rate needed to build the core implies a high envelope
metallicity and grain opacity, effectively shutting off radiative cooling and pushing convective
motions out beyond the Bondi radius. Then the convective expulsion of dust-enriched gas can compensate
ongoing accretion of pebbles and cooler metal-poor gas, effectively quenching protoplanet growth.
We construct a time-dependent model of the envelope that includes ongoing accretion, pebble destruction,
convection in the mixing-length approximation, dust transport and size evolution, radiative
diffusion with a realistic dust opacity, feedback of sublimation on the thermodynamics of the envelope,
multiple luminosity sources, and tabulated equations of state for hydrogen and water. We find that
convection reaches beyond the Bondi radius of a 0.1 M_Earth core for a planetesimal accretion rate
as small as 0.1% of the pebble accretion rate. Then the envelope remains relatively light and is susceptible
to expulsion by collision with a single intermediate-mass object. A growing core will be accompanied
by an accumulation of dust-enriched and heavily processed gas near its orbit. The enhancement found
in the envelope metal abundance during pebble accretion from a gas-rich disk appears more conducive
to the formation of gas giants rather than ice giants.
