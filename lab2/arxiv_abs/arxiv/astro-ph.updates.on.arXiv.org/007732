Dark matter-baryon scaling relations in galaxies are important in order to constrain galaxy formation
models. Here, we provide a modern quantitative assessment of those relations, by modelling the
rotation curves of galaxies from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database
with the Einasto dark halo model. Our analysis is complementary to the analysis of Chemin et al. (2011)
and the recent one of Li et al. (2018). In particular, we focus here on the comparison between the original
SPARC parameters, with constant mass-to-light ratios for bulges and disks, and the parameters
for which galaxies follow the tightest radial acceleration relation (RAR). We show that fits are
improved in the second case, and that the pure halo scaling relations also become tighter. We report
that the density at the radius where the slope is $-2$ is strongly anticorrelated to this radius,
and to the Einasto index. The latter is close to unity for a large number of galaxies, indicative of
large cores. In terms of dark matter-baryon scalings, we focus on relations between the core properties
and the extent of the baryonic component, which are relevant to the cusp-core transformation process.
We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with small Einasto index and the stellar
disk scale-length, as well as between the averaged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced
rotational velocity at that radius. This finding is related to the consequence of the RAR on the diversity
of rotation curve shapes, quantified by the rotational velocity at 2 kpc. While a tight RAR slightly
decreases the observed diversity compared to the original SPARC parameters, the diversity of baryon-induced
accelerations at 2 kpc is sufficient to induce a large diversity, incompatible with current hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxy formation, while maintaining a tight RAR.
