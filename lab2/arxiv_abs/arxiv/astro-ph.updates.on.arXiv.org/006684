[abridged] The presence of large amounts of dust in the habitable zones of nearby stars is a significant
obstacle for future exo-Earth imaging missions. We executed an N band nulling interferometric
survey to determine the typical amount of such exozodiacal dust around a sample of nearby main sequence
stars. The majority of our data have been analyzed and we present here an update of our ongoing work.
We find seven new N band excesses in addition to the high confidence confirmation of three that were
previously known. We find the first detections around Sun-like stars and around stars without previously
known circumstellar dust. Our overall detection rate is 23%. The inferred occurrence rate is comparable
for early type and Sun-like stars, but decreases from 71% [+11%/-20%] for stars with previously
detected mid- to far-infrared excess to 11% [+9%/-4%] for stars without such excess, confirming
earlier results at high confidence. For completed observations on individual stars, our sensitivity
is five to ten times better than previous results. Assuming a lognormal luminosity function of the
dust, we find upper limits on the median dust level around all stars without previously known mid
to far infrared excess of 11.5 zodis at 95% confidence level. The corresponding upper limit for Sun-like
stars is 16 zodis. An LBTI vetted target list of Sun-like stars for exo-Earth imaging would have a
corresponding limit of 7.5 zodis. We provide important new insights into the occurrence rate and
typical levels of habitable zone dust around main sequence stars. Exploiting the full range of capabilities
of the LBTI provides a critical opportunity for the detailed characterization of a sample of exozodiacal
dust disks to understand the origin, distribution, and properties of the dust.
