Next-generation radio interferometers, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will revolutionise
our understanding of the universe through their unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. However,
to realise these goals significant challenges in image and data processing need to be overcome.
The standard methods in radio interferometry for reconstructing images, such as CLEAN, have served
the community well over the last few decades and have survived largely because they are pragmatic.
However, they produce reconstructed inter\-ferometric images that are limited in quality and
scalability for big data. In this work we apply and evaluate alternative interferometric reconstruction
methods that make use of state-of-the-art sparse image reconstruction algorithms motivated by
compressive sensing, which have been implemented in the PURIFY software package. In particular,
we implement and apply the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (P-ADMM) algorithm
presented in a recent article. First, we assess the impact of the interpolation kernel used to perform
gridding and degridding on sparse image reconstruction. We find that the Kaiser-Bessel interpolation
kernel performs as well as prolate spheroidal wave functions, while providing a computational
saving and an analytic form. Second, we apply PURIFY to real interferometric observations from
the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and find images recovered
by PURIFY are higher quality than those recovered by CLEAN. Third, we discuss how PURIFY reconstructions
exhibit additional advantages over those recovered by CLEAN. The latest version of PURIFY, with
developments presented in this work, is made publicly available.
