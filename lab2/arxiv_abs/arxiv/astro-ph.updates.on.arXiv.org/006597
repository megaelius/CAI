The observation of GW170817 in both gravitational and electromagnetic waves provides a number
of unique tests of general relativity. One question we can answer with this event is: Do large-wavelength
gravitational waves and short-frequency photons experience the same number of spacetime dimensions?
In models that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the gravitational waves
propagate, they "leak" into the extra dimensions, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of the
observed gravitational waves, and a commensurate systematic error in the inferred distance to
the gravitational wave source. Electromagnetic waves would remain unaffected. We compare the
inferred distance to GW170817 from the observation of gravitational waves, $d_L^\mathrm{GW}$,
with the inferred distance to the electromagnetic counterpart NGC 4993, $d_L^\mathrm{EM}$. We
constrain $d_L^\mathrm{GW} = (d_L^\mathrm{EM}/\mathrm{Mpc})^\mathrm{\gamma}$ with $\gamma
= 1.01^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ (for the SHoES value of $H_0$) or $\gamma = 0.99^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ (for
the Planck value of $H_0$), where all values are MAP and minimal 68\% credible intervals. These constraints
imply that gravitational waves propagate in $D=3+1$ spacetime dimensions, as expected in general
relativity. In particular, we find that $D = 4.02^{+0.07}_{-0.10}$ (SHoES) and $D = 3.98^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$
(Planck). Furthermore, we place limits on the screening scale for theories with $D>4$ spacetime
dimensions, finding that the screening scale must be greater than $\sim 20$\,Mpc. We also place
a lower limit on the lifetime of the graviton of $t > 4.50 \times 10^8$\,yr.
