Hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions suggest that planets may be responsible
for a number of the sub-structures frequently observed in disks in both scattered light and dust
thermal emission. Despite the ubiquity of these features, direct evidence of planets embedded
in disks and of the specific interaction features like spiral arms within planetary gaps still remain
rare. In this study we discuss recent observational results in the context of hydrodynamical simulations
in order to infer the properties of a putative embedded planet in the cavity of a transition disk.
We imaged the transition disk SR 21 in H-band in scattered light with SPHERE/IRDIS and in thermal
dust emission with ALMA band 3 (3mm) observations at a spatial resolution of 0.1". We combine these
datasets with existing band 9 (430um) and band 7 (870um) ALMA continuum data. The Band 3 continuum
data reveals a large cavity and a bright ring peaking at 53 au strongly suggestive of dust trapping.The
ring shows a pronounced azimuthal asymmetry, with a bright region in the north-west that we interpret
as a dust over-density. A similarly-asymmetric ring is revealed at the same location in polarized
scattered light, in addition to a set of bright spirals inside the mm cavity and a fainter spiral bridging
the gap to the outer ring. These features are consistent with a number of previous hydrodynamical
models of planet-disk interactions, and suggest the presence of a ~1 MJup planet at 44 au and PA=11{\deg}.
This makes SR21 the first disk showing spiral arms inside the mm cavity, as well as one for which the
location of a putative planet can be precisely inferred. With the location of a possible planet being
well-constrained by observations, it is an ideal candidate for follow-up observations to search
for direct evidence of a planetary companion still embedded in its disk.
