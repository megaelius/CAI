Interstellar carbonaceous dust is mainly formed in the innermost regions of circumstellar envelopes
around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. In these highly chemically stratified
regions, atomic and diatomic carbon, along with acetylene are the most abundant species after H$_2$
and CO. In a previous study, we addressed the chemistry of carbon (C and C$_2$) with H$_2$ showing
that acetylene and aliphatic species form efficiently in the dust formation region of carbon-rich
AGBs whereas aromatics do not. Still, acetylene is known to be a key ingredient in the formation of
linear polyacetylenic chains, benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as shown
by previous experiments. However, these experiments have not considered the chemistry of carbon
(C and C$_2$) with C$_2$H$_2$. In this work, by employing a sufficient amount of acetylene, we investigate
its gas-phase interaction with atomic and diatomic carbon. We show that the chemistry involved
produces linear polyacetylenic chains, benzene and other PAHs, which are observed with high abundances
in the early evolutionary phase of planetary nebulae. More importantly, we have found a non-negligible
amount of pure and hydrogenated carbon clusters as well as aromatics with aliphatic substitutions,
both being a direct consequence of the addition of atomic carbon. The incorporation of alkyl substituents
into aromatics can be rationalized by a mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction followed by methyl
addition. All the species detected in gas phase are incorporated into the nanometric sized dust
analogues, which consist of a complex mixture of sp, sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ hydrocarbons with amorphous
morphology.
