BANYAN $\Sigma$ is a new Bayesian algorithm to identify members of young stellar associations within
150 pc of the Sun. It includes 27 young associations with ages in the range ~1-800 Myr, modelled with
multivariate Gaussians in 6-dimensional XYZUVW space. It is the first such multi-association
classification tool to include the nearest sub-groups of the Sco-Cen OB star-forming region, the
IC 2602, IC 2391, Pleiades and Platais 8 clusters, and the $\rho$ Ophiuchi, Corona Australis, and
Taurus star-formation regions. A model of field stars is built from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians
based on the Besan\c{c}on Galactic model. The algorithm can derive membership probabilities for
objects with only sky coordinates and proper motion, but can also include parallax and radial velocity
measurements, as well as spectrophotometric distance constraints from sequences in color-magnitude
or spectral type-magnitude diagrams. BANYAN $\Sigma$ benefits from an analytical solution to
the Bayesian marginalization integrals that makes it more accurate and significantly faster than
its predecessor BANYAN II. A contamination versus hit rate analysis is presented and demonstrates
that BANYAN $\Sigma$ achieves a better classification performance than other moving group classification
tools, especially in terms of cross-contamination between young associations. An updated list
of bona fide members in the 27 young associations, augmented by the Gaia-DR1 release, are presented.
This new tool will make it possible to analyze large data sets such as the upcoming Gaia-DR2 to identify
new young stars. IDL and Python versions of BANYAN $\Sigma$ are made available with this publication.
