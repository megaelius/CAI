Transients XrB exhibit different spectral shapes during their evolution. In luminosity-color
diagrams, their X-ray behavior forms unexplained q-shaped cycles. We proposed a framework where
the innermost regions of the accretion disk evolve as a response to variations imposed in the outer
regions. These variations lead not only to modifications of the inner disk accretion rate $\dot
m_{in}$ but also to the evolution of the transition radius $r_J$ between two regions. The outermost
region is a standard accretion disk (SAD), whereas the innermost region is a jet-emitting disk (JED)
where all the disk angular momentum is carried away vertically by two self-confined jets. In the
previous papers of this series, it has been shown that such a configuration reproduces the typical
spectral properties of the five canonical XrB states. The aim of this paper is now to replicate all
X-ray spectra and radio emission observed during GX 339-4 2010-2011 outburst. We use the 2T plasma
code presented in papers II and III, and design an automatic fitting procedure that gives the parameters
$(\dot m_{in},r_J)$ that best fit each X-ray spectrum. We use RXTE/PCA X-ray data spread over 438
days, together with radio observations at 9 GHz (ATCA). We obtain the time distributions of $\dot
m_{in}$ and $r_J$ that uniquely reproduce the X-ray luminosity and the spectral shape of the whole
cycle. Using the classical self-absorbed jet synchrotron emission model, the JED-SAD configuration
reproduces also very satisfactorily the radio properties, in particular the switch-off and -on
events and the radio-X-ray correlation. Within the JED-SAD framework, radio emission can be used
to constrain the underlying disk configuration. If this result is confirmed using other outbursts
from GX 339-4 or other X-ray binaries, then radio could be indeed used as another means to indirectly
probe disk physics.
