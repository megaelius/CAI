The effect of galactic orbits on a galaxy's internal evolution within a galaxy cluster environment
has been the focus of heated debate in recent years. To understand this connection, we use both the
$(0.5 \,$Gpc)$^3$ and the Gpc$^3$ boxes from the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation set \textit{Magneticum
Pathfinder}. We investigate the velocity-anisotropy, phase space, and the orbital evolution
of up to $\sim 5 \cdot 10^{5}$ resolved satellite galaxies within our sample of 6776 clusters with
$M_{\mathrm{vir}} > 10^{14} \, M_{\odot}$ at low redshift, which we also trace back in time. In agreement
with observations we find that star-forming satellite galaxies inside galaxy clusters are characterised
by more radially dominated orbits, independent of cluster mass. Furthermore, the vast majority
of star-forming satellite galaxies stop to form stars during their first passage. We find a strong
dichotomy both in line-of-sight and radial phase space between star-forming and quiescent galaxies,
in line with observations. The tracking of individual orbits shows that almost all satellite galaxies'
star-formation drops to zero within $1 \, \mathrm{Gyr}$ after in-fall. Satellite galaxies that
are able to remain star-forming longer are characterised by tangential orbits and high stellar
mass. We also find a class of quiescent galaxies with indication of recent star-bursts which reproduce
the behaviour of observed post-star-burst galaxies regarding their position in phase space as
well as their relative abundance. These simulations suggest that in galaxy clusters the dominant
quenching mechanism is ram-pressure stripping.
