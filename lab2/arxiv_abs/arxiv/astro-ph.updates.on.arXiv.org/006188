HESS J1943+213 is a very-high-energy (VHE; $>$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray source in the direction of
the Galactic Plane. Studies exploring the classification of the source are converging towards
its identification as an extreme synchrotron BL Lac object. Here we present 38 hours of VERITAS observations
of HESS J1943+213 taken over two years. The source is detected with $\sim$20 standard deviations
significance, showing a remarkably stable flux and spectrum in VHE $\gamma$-rays. Multi-frequency
very-long-baseline array (VLBA) observations of the source confirm the extended, jet-like structure
previously found in the 1.6 GHz band with European VLBI Network and detect this component in the 4.6
GHz and the 7.3 GHz bands. The radio spectral indices of the core and the jet and the level of polarization
derived from the VLBA observations are in a range typical for blazars. Data from VERITAS, $Fermi$-LAT,
$Swift$-XRT, FLWO 48$''$ telescope, and archival infrared and hard X-ray observations are used
to construct and model the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source with a synchrotron-self-Compton
model. The well-measured $\gamma$-ray peak of the SED with VERITAS and $Fermi$-LAT provides constraining
upper limits on the source redshift. Possible contribution of secondary $\gamma$-rays from ultra-high-energy
cosmic ray-initiated electromagnetic cascades to the $\gamma$-ray emission is explored, finding
that only a segment of the VHE spectrum can be accommodated with this process. A variability search
is performed across X-ray and $\gamma$-ray bands. No statistically significant flux or spectral
variability is detected.
