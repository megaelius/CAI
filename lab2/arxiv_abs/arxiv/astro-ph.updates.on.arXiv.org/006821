AIMS: With our low-resolution spectroscopic observing program for selected blue proper motion
stars, we tried to find new white dwarfs (WDs) in the solar neighbourhood. METHODS: We used the LSPM
catalogue with a lower proper motion limit of 150mas/yr and the UCAC2 for proper motions down to about
90mas/yr. The LSPM and UCAC2 photometry was combined with Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) near-infrared
(NIR) photometry. Targets selected according to their blue optical-to-NIR and NIR colours were
observed mainly at Calar Alto. The spectra were classified by comparison with a large number of already
known comparison objects, including WDs, simultaneously observed within our program. Gaia DR2
parallaxes and colours were used to confirm or reject spectroscopic WD candidates and to derive
improved effective temperatures. RESULTS: We found ten new WDs at distances between 24.4pc and
79.8pc, including six hot DA WDs: GD 221 (DA2.0), HD 166435 B (DA2.2), GD 277 (DA2.2), 2MASS J19293865+1117523
(DA2.4), 2MASS J05280449+4105253 (DA3.6), and 2MASS J05005185-0930549 (DA4.2). The latter is
rather bright (G~12.6) and with its Gaia DR2 parallax of ~14mas it appears overluminous by about
3mag compared to the WD sequence in the Gaia DR2 colour-magnitude diagram. It may be the closest extremely
low mass (ELM) WD to the Sun. We further classified 2MASS J07035743+2534184 as DB4.1. With its distance
of 25.6pc it is the second nearest known representative of its class. With GD 28 (DA6.1), LP 740-47
(DA7.5), and LSPM J1919+4527 (DC10.3) three additional cool WDs were found. Gaia DR2 parallaxes
showed us that four of our candidates but also two previously supposed WDs (WD 1004+665 and LSPM J1445+2527)
are in fact distant Galactic halo stars with high tangential velocities. Among our rejected WD candidates,
we identified a bright (G=13.4mag) G-type carbon dwarf, LSPM J0937+2803, at a distance of 272pc.
