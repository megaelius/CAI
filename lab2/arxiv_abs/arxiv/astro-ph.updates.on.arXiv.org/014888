We present a systematic phase curve analysis of known transiting systems observed by the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Year 1 of the Primary Mission. Using theoretical predictions
for the amplitude of the planetary longitudinal atmospheric brightness modulation, stellar ellipsoidal
distortion and Doppler boosting, as well as brightness considerations to select targets with likely
detectable signals, we applied a uniform data processing and light curve modeling framework to
fit the full-orbit phase curves of 22 transiting systems with planet-mass or brown dwarf companions,
including previously published systems. Statistically significant secondary eclipse depths
and/or atmospheric brightness modulation amplitudes were measured for HIP 65A, WASP-18, WASP-19,
WASP-72, WASP-100, WASP-111, WASP-121, and WASP-122/KELT-14. For WASP-100b, we found marginal
evidence that the brightest region of the atmosphere is shifted eastward away from the substellar
point. We detected significant ellipsoidal distortion signals in the light curves of HIP 65A, TOI-503,
WASP-18, and WASP-30, with HIP 65A, TOI-503 and WASP-18 also exhibiting Doppler boosting. The measured
amplitudes of these signals agree with the predictions of theoretical models. Combining the optical
secondary eclipse depths with previously published Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m measurements, we
derived dayside brightness temperatures and visible-light geometric albedos for a subset of the
analyzed systems. We also calculated updated transit ephemerides combining the transit timings
from the TESS light curves with previous literature values.
