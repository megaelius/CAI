From optical spectroscopy of X-ray sources observed as part of ChaMP, we present redshifts and classifications
for a total of 1569 Chandra sources from our targeted spectroscopic follow up using the FLWO, SAAO,
WIYN, CTIO, KPNO, Magellan, MMT and Gemini telescopes, and from archival SDSS spectroscopy. We
classify the optical counterparts as 50% BLAGN, 16% NELG, 14% ALG, and 20% stars. We detect QSOs out
to z~5.5 and galaxies out to z~3. We have compiled extensive photometry from X-ray to radio bands.
Together with our spectroscopic information, this enables us to derive detailed SEDs for our extragalactic
sources. We fit a variety of templates to determine bolometric luminosities, and to constrain AGN
and starburst components where both are present. While ~58% of X-ray Seyferts require a starburst
event to fit observed photometry only 26% of the X-ray QSO population appear to have some kind of star
formation contribution. This is significantly lower than for the Seyferts, especially if we take
into account torus contamination at z>1 where the majority of our X-ray QSOs lie. In addition,
we observe a rapid drop of the percentage of starburst contribution as X-ray luminosity increases.
This is consistent with the quenching of star formation by powerful QSOs, as predicted by the merger
model, or with a time lag between the peak of star formation and QSO activity. We have tested the hypothesis
that there should be a strong connection between X-ray obscuration and star-formation but we do
not find any association between X-ray column density and star formation rate both in the general
population or the star-forming X-ray Seyferts. Our large compilation also allows us to report here
the identification of 81 XBONG, 78 z>3 X-ray sources and 8 Type-2 QSO candidates. Also we have
identified the highest redshift (z=5.4135) X-ray selected QSO with optical spectroscopy.
