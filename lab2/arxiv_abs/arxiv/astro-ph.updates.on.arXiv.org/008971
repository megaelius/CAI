Observations reveal a universal stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation (MZR) existing in
Local Group dwarfs of different types, $Z_*\propto M_*^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=0.30\pm0.02$.
In this work, we investigate the "universality" of the MZRs for both satellites and central galaxies
in a large number of different host dark matter halos covering a large mass range of $10^9$-$10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$,
by using a semianalytical galaxy formation and evolution model. We obtain the following results.
(1) The exponents ($\alpha$) for the MZRs of the satellites in halos with the same mass as the Milky
Way halo but different individual assembly histories are mostly $\sim$0.2-0.4, i.e., having a
scatter of $\sim 0.2$; and the scatter of $\alpha$ increases with decreasing halo masses. (2) The
MZR relations are changed little by the variation of halo masses and the classification between
central galaxies and satellites, if many halos with the same mass are stacked together. (3) A double
power law exists in the MZR relations for both central galaxies and stacked satellites, with $\alpha\sim$0.2-0.4
at $10^3M_\odot< M_*<10^{8} M_\odot$ and a relatively higher $\alpha\sim0.5$ at $10^8M_\odot<M_*<10^{11}M_\odot$.
(4) The high-mass satellites ($M_*>10^8M_\odot$) existing mostly in high-mass halos can lead
to an apparent increase of $\alpha$ (from $\sim0.2$ to $\sim0.4$) with increasing host halo masses
shown in the single power law fitting results of stacked satellites. The universality of the MZR
suggests the common physical processes in stellar formation and chemical evolution of galaxies
can be unified over a large range of galaxy masses and halo masses.
