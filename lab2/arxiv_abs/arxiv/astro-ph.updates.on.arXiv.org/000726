We wish to map the magnetic field geometry and to study the dust properties of the starless cloud,
L1570, using multi-wavelength optical polarimetry and photometry of the stars projected on the
cloud. We made R-band imaging polarimetry of the stars projected on a cloud, L1570, to trace the magnetic
field orientation. We also made multi-wavelength polarimetric and photometric observations
to constrain the properties of dust in L1570. We estimated a distance of 394 +/- 70 pc to the cloud using
2MASS JHKs colours. Using the values of the Serkowski parameters namely $\sigma_{1}$, $\bar \epsilon$,
{\lambda}max and the position of the stars on near infrared color-color diagram, we identified
13 stars that could possibly have intrinsic polarization and/or rotation in their polarization
angles. One star, 2MASS J06075075+1934177, which is a B4Ve spectral type, show the presence of diffuse
interstellar bands in the spectrum apart from showing H{\alpha} line in emission. There is an indication
for the presence of slightly bigger dust grains towards L1570 on the basis of the dust grain size-indicators
such as {\lambda}max and Rv values. The magnetic field lines are found to be parallel to the cloud
structures seen in the 250{\mu}m images (also in 8{\mu}m and 12{\mu}m shadow images) of L1570. Based
on the magnetic field geometry, the cloud structure and the complex velocity structure, we believe
that L1570 is in the process of formation due to the converging flow material mediated by the magnetic
field lines. Structure function analysis showed that in the L1570 cloud region the large scale magnetic
fields are stronger when compared with the turbulent component of magnetic fields. The estimated
magnetic field strengths suggest that the L1570 cloud region is sub-critical and hence could be
strongly supported by the magnetic field lines.
