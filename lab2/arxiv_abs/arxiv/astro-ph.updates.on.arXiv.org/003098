According to structure formation simulations, weak shocks with typical Mach number, $M_{\rm s}\lesssim
3$, are expected to form in merging galaxy clusters. The presence of such shocks has been indicated
by X-ray and radio observations of many merging clusters. In particular, diffuse radio sources
known as radio relics could be explained by synchrotron-emitting electrons accelerated via diffusive
shock acceleration (Fermi I) at quasi-perpendicular shocks. Here we also consider possible roles
of stochastic acceleration (Fermi II) by compressive MHD turbulence downstream of the shock. Then
we explore a puzzling discrepancy that for some radio relics, the shock Mach number inferred from
the radio spectral index is substantially larger than that estimated from X-ray observations.
This problem could be understood, if shock surfaces associated with radio relics consist of multiple
shocks with different strengths.In that case, X-ray observations tend to pick up the part of shocks
with lower Mach numbers and higher kinetic energy flux, while radio emissions come preferentially
from the part of shocks with higher Mach numbers and higher cosmic ray (CR) production. We also show
that the Fermi I reacceleration model with preexisting fossil electrons supplemented by Fermi
II acceleration due to postshock turbulence could reproduce observed profiles of radio flux densities
and integrated radio spectra of two giant radio relics. This study demonstrates the CR electrons
can be accelerated at collisionless shocks in galaxy clusters just like supernova remnant shock
in the interstellar medium and interplanetary shocks in the solar wind.
