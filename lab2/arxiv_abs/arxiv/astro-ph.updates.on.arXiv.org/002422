We analyzed the Einstein radius, $\theta_E$, in our sample of SL2S galaxy groups, and compared it
with $R_A$ (the distance from the arcs to the center of the lens), using three different approaches:
1.- the velocity dispersion obtained from weak lensing assuming a Singular Isothermal Sphere profile
($\theta_{E,I}$), 2.- a strong lensing analytical method ($\theta_{E,II}$) combined with a velocity
dispersion-concentration relation derived from numerical simulations designed to mimic our
group sample, 3.- strong lensing modeling ($\theta_{E,III}$) of eleven groups (with four new models
presented in this work) using HST and CFHT images. Finally, $R_A$ was analyzed as a function of redshift
$z$ to investigate possible correlations with L, N, and the richness-to-luminosity ratio (N/L).
We found a correlation between $\theta_{E}$ and $R_A$, but with large scatter. We estimate $\theta_{E,I}$
= (2.2 $\pm$ 0.9) + (0.7 $\pm$ 0.2)$R_A$, $\theta_{E,II}$ = (0.4 $\pm$ 1.5) + (1.1 $\pm$ 0.4)$R_A$,
and $\theta_{E,III}$ = (0.4 $\pm$ 1.5) + (0.9 $\pm$ 0.3)$R_A$ for each method respectively. We found
a weak evidence of anti-correlation between $R_A$ and $z$, with Log$R_A$ = (0.58$\pm$0.06) - (0.04$\pm$0.1)$z$,
suggesting a possible evolution of the Einstein radius with $z$, as reported previously by other
authors. Our results also show that $R_A$ is correlated with L and N (more luminous and richer groups
have greater $R_A$), and a possible correlation between $R_A$ and the N/L ratio. Our analysis indicates
that $R_A$ is correlated with $\theta_E$ in our sample, making $R_A$ useful to characterize properties
like L and N (and possible N/L) in galaxy groups. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that
the Einstein radius evolves with $z$.
