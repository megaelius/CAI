We investigate the X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) properties of millimeter galaxies in the
Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey South (GOODS-S) field detected with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), by utilizing the Chandra 7-Ms data, the deepest X-ray
survey to date. Our millimeter galaxy sample comes from the ASAGAO survey covering 26 arcmin$^2$
(12 sources at a 1.2-mm flux-density limit of $\approx$0.6 mJy), supplemented by the deeper but
narrower 1.3-mm survey of a part of the ASAGAO field by Dunlop et al.\ (2017). Fourteen out of the total
25 millimeter galaxies have Chandra counterparts. The observed AGN fractions at $z=1.5-3$ is found
to be 90$^{+8}_{-19}$\% and $57^{+23}_{-25}$\% for the ultra/luminous infrared galaxies with
$\log L_{\rm IR}/L_{\odot} = 12-12.8$ and $\log L_{\rm IR}/L_{\odot} = 11.5-12$, respectively.
The majority ($\sim$2/3) of the ALMA and/or Herschel detected X-ray AGNs at $z=1.5-3$ appear to
be star-formation dominant populations, having $L_{\rm X}$/ $L_{\rm IR}$ ratios smaller than
the "simultaneous evolution" value expected from the local black-hole mass to stellar mass ($M_{\rm
BH}$-$M_*$) relation. On the basis of the $L_{\rm X}$ and stellar mass relation, we infer that a large
fraction of star-forming galaxies at $z=1.5-3$ have black hole masses smaller than those expected
from the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation. This is opposite to previous reports on luminous AGN
at same redshifts detected in wider and shallower surveys, which are subject to selection biases
against lower luminosity AGN. Our results are consistent with an evolutionary scenario that star
formation occurs first, and an AGN-dominant phase follows later, in objects finally evolving into
galaxies with classical bulges.
