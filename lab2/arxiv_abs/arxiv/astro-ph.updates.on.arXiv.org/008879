Recent simulations predict that the presence of stellar bulge suppress the efficiency of star formation
in early-type galaxies, and this `morphological quenching' scenario is supported by many observations.
In this study, we discuss the net effect of galaxy morphologies on the star formation efficiency
(SFE) during the phase of galaxy transition, on the basis of our CO($J=1-0$) observations of 28 local
`green-valley' galaxies with the Nobeyama 45m Radio Telescope. We observed 13 `disk-dominated'
and 15 `bulge-dominated' green-valley galaxies at fixed stellar mass ($M_*$) and star formation
rate (SFR), supplemented by 1 disk- and 6 bulge-dominated galaxies satisfying the same criteria
from the xCOLD~GASS survey. By using a total of 35 green-valley galaxies, we reveal that the distributions
of molecular gas mass, molecular gas fraction, and SFE of green-valley galaxies do not change with
their morphologies, suggesting little impact of galaxy morphologies on their SFE, and interestingly
this result is also valid for normal star-forming galaxies on the SF main-sequence selected from
the xCOLD~GASS galaxies. On the other hand, we find that $\sim$20 % of bulge-dominated green-valley
galaxies do not show significant CO emission line, showing high SFEs for their M$_*$ and SFR. These
molecular gas deficient sources identified only in the bulge-dominated green-valley galaxies
may represent an important population during the quenching phase under the influence of stellar
bulge, but our results suggest that the presence of stellar bulge does not decrease the efficiency
of on-going star formation, in contrast to the prediction of the morphological quenching scenario.
