Recent advances in nuclear structure theory have significantly enlarged the accessible part of
the nuclear landscape via ab initio many-body calculations. These developments open new ways for
microscopic studies of light, medium-mass and heavy nuclei as well as nuclear matter and represent
an important step towards a systematic and comprehensive understanding of atomic nuclei across
the nuclear chart. While remarkable agreement has been found between different many-body methods
for a given nuclear Hamiltonian, the comparison with experiment and the understanding of theoretical
uncertainties are still important open questions. The observed discrepancies to experiment indicate
deficiencies in presently used nuclear interactions and operators. Chiral effective field theory
(EFT) allows to systematically derive contributions to nucleon-nucleon (NN), three-nucleon
(3N) and higher-body interactions including estimates of theoretical uncertainties. While the
treatment of NN interactions in many-body calculations is well established, the calculation of
3N interactions and their incorporation in ab initio frameworks is still a frontier. This work reviews
in detail recent and current developments on the derivation and implementation of improved 3N interactions
and provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental methods for their practical calculation
and representation. We further give an overview of novel and established methods that facilitate
the inclusion and treatment of 3N interactions in ab initio nuclear structure frameworks and present
a selection of the latest calculations of atomic nuclei as well as nuclear matter based on state-of-the-art
nuclear NN and 3N interactions derived within chiral EFT. Finally, we discuss ongoing efforts,
open questions and future directions.
