Some thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts at the neutron star surfaces in low-mass X-ray binaries
take place during hard persistent states of the systems. Spectral evolution of these bursts is well
described by the atmosphere model of a passively cooling neutron star when the burst luminosity
is high enough. The observed spectral evolution deviates from the model predictions when the burst
luminosity drops below a critical value of 20-70% of the maximum luminosity. We suggest that these
deviations are induced by the additional heating of the accreted particles. We present a method
for computation of the neutron star atmosphere models heated by accreted particles assuming that
their energy is released via Coulomb interactions with electrons. We compute the temperature structures
and the emergent spectra of the atmospheres of various chemical compositions and investigate the
dependence of the results on the other model parameters. We show that the heated atmosphere develops
the hot (20--100 keV) corona-like surface layer cooled by Compton scattering, and the deeper, almost
isothermal optically thick region with a temperature of a few keV. The emergent spectra deviate
strongly from those of undisturbed neutron star atmospheres, with the main differences being the
presence of a high-energy tail and a strong excess in the low-energy part of the spectrum. They also
lack the iron absorption edge, which is visible in the spectra of undisturbed low-luminosity atmospheres
with solar chemical composition. Using the computed spectra, we obtained the dependences of the
dilution and color-correction factors as functions of relative luminosities for pure helium and
solar abundance atmospheres. We show that the helium model atmosphere heated by accretion corresponding
to 5% of the Eddington luminosity describes well the late stages of the X-ray bursts in 4U 1820-30.
