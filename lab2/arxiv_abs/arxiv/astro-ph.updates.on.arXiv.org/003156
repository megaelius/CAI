We present average stellar population properties and dark matter halo masses of $z \sim 2$ Ly$\alpha$
emitters (LAEs) from SED fitting to stacked images and clustering analysis, respectively, using
$\simeq$ $1250$ $NB387\le25.5$ objects in four separate fields of $\simeq 1$ deg$^2$ in total.
With an average stellar mass of $10.2\, \pm\, 3.0\times 10^8\ {\mathrm M_\odot}$ and star formation
rate of $3.4\, \pm\, 0.7\ {\rm M_\odot}\ {\rm yr^{-1}}$, the LAEs lie on a low-mass extrapolation
of the star-formation main sequence (MS) with moderate star formation. Their effective dark matter
halo mass is estimated to be $4.0_{-2.9}^{+5.1} \times 10^{10}\ {\rm M_\odot}$ with $b_{\rm g,\,
eff}^{\rm ave} = 1.22^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$, which is lower than that of $z \sim 2$ LAEs ($b_{\rm g,\,
eff} = 1.8\, \pm\, 0.3$) obtained by a previous study based on a three times smaller area with a probability
of $96\%$, although this difference can be explained if the cosmic variance in these $b_{\rm g,\,
eff}$ is taken into account. Such a low halo mass, if it implies a low HI gas mass, is consistent with
high Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions of LAEs observed. Despite the low halo mass and being in the MS mode,
our LAEs have a relatively high stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR) and baryon conversion efficiency,
converting baryons into stars efficiently until the observed time. The extended Press-Schechter
formalism predicts that at $z=0$ our LAEs are typically embedded in halos with masses similar to
that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC); if their SFRs are largely suppressed after $z \sim 2$ as
reported for the LMC itself, they will also have similar SHMRs to the LMC.
