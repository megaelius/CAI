To elucidate the composition of dark matter (DM) is one of the most important open questions in particle
and astroparticle phenomenology. Within the framework of minimal supersymmetric extensions
of the standard model of fundamental particles, the `mu-from-nu supersymmetric standard model',
$\mu\nu$SSM, solves the $\mu$-problem and reproduces neutrino data, only adding couplings involving
right-handed neutrinos. In this context, the supersymmetric partner of the graviton, known as
gravitino, becomes a natural DM candidate. Working in the mentioned model, in this thesis we have
analyzed the detection of gamma-ray signals arising from decaying gravitino DM considering experiments
such as $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT. For this purpose all gravitino decays have been taken into account,
complementing previous works. The possibility of an upcoming new generation of gamma-ray detectors
has motivated the inclusion of axino, the supersymmetric partner of the axion, as a DM candidate.
In this thesis, axino DM has been analyzed in the context of the $\mu\nu$SSM for the first time. Finally,
scenarios with multicomponent DM have been studied, focusing on gravitinos and axinos coexisting
as DM constituents. This novel scenario includes two very different cases with distinctive features:
axino lighter than gravitino and vice versa. Considering the sensitivity of future MeV-GeV gamma-ray
telescopes, axino and gravitino prospects of detection were analyzed in the mixed scenarios mentioned
previously. In some parameter space regions, both candidates can produce a signal, therefore a
double-line feature arises as a smoking gun that would uncover the DM composition.
