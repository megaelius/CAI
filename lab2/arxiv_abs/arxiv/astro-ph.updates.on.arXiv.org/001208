In the standard Cold Dark Matter theory for understanding the formation of structure in the universe,
there exists a tight connection between the properties of dark matter (DM) haloes, and their formation
epochs. Such relation can be expressed in terms of a single key parameter, namely the halo concentration.
In this work, we examine the concentration-mass relation, c(M), at present time over more than 20
orders of magnitude in halo mass, i.e. from Earth-mass microhalos up to galaxy clusters. We use the
c(M) model proposed by Prada et al. (2012) to test its predictions against results from N-body cosmological
simulations. Despite little knowledge of halo concentrations below ~10^8 Msun in simulations,
the model works remarkably well; indeed, it is compatible with all the available data down to ~10^-6
Msun within 1-sigma errors. Both simulation results and model show a clear flattening of the halo
concentration - mass relation towards smaller masses that excludes the commonly used power-law
c(M) models, and stands as a natural prediction for the CDM model. We provide a parametrization for
the c(M) relation that works accurately for all halo masses. The flattening of the halo concentrations
at low halo masses has decisive consequences e.g. for gamma-ray DM searches, as it implies more modest
enhancements of the DM annihilation flux due to DM substructure than usually adopted in the literature,
i. e. of ~1,000 for galaxy clusters and ~200 for Milky Way-sized halos (e.g., Springel et al. 2008,
Gao et al. 2012). These values relied on such power-law c(M) extrapolations and those are clearly
rejected. We obtain much lower boosts, i.e. ~35 for galaxy clusters and ~15 for galaxies like our
own. These figures may have a critical impact on current and up-coming gamma-ray search strategies.
We finally provide a parametrization of the boost that can be safely used for dwarf- to cluster-size
halos.
