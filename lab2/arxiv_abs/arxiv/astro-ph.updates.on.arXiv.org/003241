Observations reveal massive amounts of OVI around star-forming $L_*$ galaxies, with covering
fractions of near unity extending to the host halo's virial radius. This OVI absorption is typically
kinematically centered upon photoionized gas, with line widths that are suprathermal and kinematically
offset from the galaxy. We discuss various scenarios and whether they could result in the observed
phenomenology (cooling gas flows, boundary layers, shocks, virialized gas, photoionized clouds
in thermal equilibrium). If predominantly collisionally ionized, as we argue is most probable,
the OVI observations require that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of $L_*$ galaxies holds nearly
all the associated baryons within a virial radius ($\sim 10^{11}M_\odot$) and hosts massive flows
of cooling gas with $\approx30[nT/30{\rm~cm^{-3}K}]~M_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$, which must be largely
prevented from accreting onto the host galaxy. Cooling and feedback energetics considerations
require $10 <\langle nT\rangle<100{\rm~cm^{-3}K}$ for the warm and hot halo gases. We argue that
virialized gas, boundary layers, hot winds, and shocks are unlikely to directly account for the
bulk of the OVI. Furthermore, we show that there is a robust constraint on the number density of many
of the photoionized $\sim10^4$K absorption systems that yields upper bounds in the range $n<(0.1-3)\times10^{-3}(Z/0.3)$cm$^{-3}$,
where $Z$ is the metallicity, suggestive that the dominant pressure in some photoionized clouds
is nonthermal. This constraint, which requires minimal ionization modeling, is in accord with
the low densities inferred from more complex photoionization modeling. The large amount of cooling
gas that is inferred could re-form these clouds in a fraction of the halo dynamical time, as some arguments
require, and it requires much of the feedback energy available from supernovae and stellar winds
to be dissipated in the CGM.
