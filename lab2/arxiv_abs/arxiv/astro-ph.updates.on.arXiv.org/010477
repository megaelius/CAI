Aerosols appear to be ubiquitous in close-in gas giant atmospheres, and disequilibrium chemistry
likely impacts the emergent spectra of these planets. Lofted aerosols and disequilibrium chemistry
are caused by vigorous vertical transport in these heavily irradiated atmospheres. Here we numerically
and analytically investigate how vertical transport should change over the parameter space of
spin-synchronized gas giants. In order to understand how tracer transport depends on planetary
parameters, we develop an analytic theory to predict vertical velocities and mixing rates ($K_\mathrm{zz}$)
and compare the results to our numerical experiments. We find that both our theory and numerical
simulations predict that, if the vertical mixing rate is described by an eddy diffusivity, then
this eddy diffusivity $K_\mathrm{zz}$ should increase with increasing equilibrium temperature,
decreasing frictional drag strength, and increasing chemical loss timescales. We find that the
transition in our numerical simulations between circulation dominated by a superrotating jet
and that with solely day-to-night flow causes a marked change in the vertical velocity structure
and tracer distribution. The mixing ratio of passive tracers is greatest for intermediate drag
strengths that corresponds to this transition between a superrotating jet with columnar vertical
velocity structure and day-to-night flow with upwelling on the dayside and downwelling on the nightside.
Lastly, we present analytic solutions for $K_\mathrm{zz}$ as a function of planetary effective
temperature, chemical loss timescales, and other parameters, for use as input to one-dimensional
chemistry models of spin-synchronized gas giant atmospheres.
