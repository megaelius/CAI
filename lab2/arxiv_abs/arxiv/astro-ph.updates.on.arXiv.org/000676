Observations of the FR I radio galaxy Centaurus A in radio, X-ray and gamma-ray bands provide evidence
for lepton acceleration up to several TeV and clues about hadron acceleration to tens of EeV. Synthesising
the available observational constraints on the physical conditions and particle content in the
jets, inner lobes and giant lobes of Centaurus A, we aim to evaluate its feasibility as an ultra-high-energy
cosmic-ray source. We apply several methods of determining jet power and affirm the consistency
of various power estimates of ~ 1 x 10^43 erg s^-1. Employing scaling relations based on the results
of Laing & Bridle (2002), we estimate particle number densities in the jets, encompassing available
radio through X-ray observations. Our model is compatible with the jets ingesting ~ 3 x 10^21 g s^-1
of matter via external entrainment from hot gas and ~ 7 x 10^22 g s^-1 via internal entrainment from
jet-contained stars. This leads to an imbalance between the internal lobe pressure securable from
radiating particles and magnetic field, and our derived external pressure. Based on knowledge
of the external environments of other FR I sources, we estimate the thermal pressure in the giant
lobes as 1.5 x 10^-12 dyn cm^-2, from which we deduce a lower limit to the temperature of ~ 1.6 x 10^8
K. Using dynamical and buoyancy arguments, we infer ~ 440-645 Myr and ~ 560 Myr as the sound-crossing
and buoyancy ages of the giant lobes respectively, inconsistent with their spectral ages. We re-investigate
the feasibility of particle acceleration via stochastic processes in the lobes, placing new constraints
on the energetics and on turbulent input to the lobes. The same 'very hot' temperatures that allow
self-consistency between the entrainment calculations and the missing pressure also allow stochastic
UHECR acceleration models to work.
