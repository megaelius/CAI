Qualitative dynamics of three different loop quantizations of spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous
models is studied using effective spacetime description of the underlying quantum geometry. These
include the standard loop quantum cosmology (LQC), its recently revived modification (referred
to as mLQC-I), and another related modification of LQC (mLQC-II) whose dynamics is studied in detail
for the first time. Various features of LQC, including quantum bounce and pre-inflationary dynamics,
are found to be shared with the mLQC-I and mLQC-II models. We study universal properties of dynamics
for chaotic inflation, fractional monodromy inflation, Starobinsky potential, non-minimal
Higgs inflation, and an exponential potential. We find various critical points and study their
stability, which reveal various qualitative similarities in the post-bounce phase for all these
models. The pre-bounce qualitative dynamics of LQC and mLQC-II turns out to be very similar, but
is strikingly different from that of mLQC-I. In the dynamical analysis, some of the fixed points
turn out to be degenerate for which center manifold theory is used. For all these potentials, non-perturbative
quantum gravitational effects always result in a non-singular inflationary scenario with a phase
of super-inflation succeeded by the conventional inflation. We show the existence of inflationary
attractors, and obtain scaling solutions in the case of the exponential potential. Since all of
the models agree with general relativity at late times, our results are also of use in classical theory
where qualitative dynamics of some of the potentials has not been studied earlier.
