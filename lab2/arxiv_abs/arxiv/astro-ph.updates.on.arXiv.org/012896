Project AMIGA (Absorption Maps In the Gas of Andromeda) is a large ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope
program, which has assembled a sample of 43 QSOs that pierce the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of Andromeda
(M31) from R=25 to 569 kpc (25 of them probing gas from 25 kpc to about the virial radius-Rvir = 300 kpc-of
M31). Our large sample provides an unparalleled look at the physical conditions and distribution
of metals in the CGM of a single galaxy using ions that probe a wide range of gas phases (Si II, Si III,
Si IV, C II, C IV, and O VI, the latter being from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer). We find
that Si III and O VI have near unity covering factor maintained all the way out to 1.2Rvir and 1.9Rvir,
respectively. We show that Si III is the dominant ion over Si II and Si IV at any R. While we do not find
that the properties of the CGM of M31 depend strongly on the azimuth, we show that they change remarkably
around 0.3-0.5Rvir, conveying that the inner regions of the CGM of M31 are more dynamic and have more
complicated multi-phase gas-structures than at R>0.5Rvir. We estimate the metal mass of the CGM
within Rvir as probed by Si II, Si III, and Si IV is 2x10^7 Msun and by O VI is >8x10^7 Msun, while the baryon
mass of the 10^4-10^5.5 K gas is ~4x10^10 (Z/0.3 Zsun)^(-1) Msun within Rvir. We show that different
zoom-in cosmological simulations of L* galaxies better reproduce the column density profile of
O VI with R than Si III or the other studied ions. We find that observations of the M31 CGM and zoom-in
simulations of L* galaxies have both lower ions showing higher column density dispersion and dependence
on R than higher ions, indicating that the higher ionization structures are larger and/or more broadly
distributed.
