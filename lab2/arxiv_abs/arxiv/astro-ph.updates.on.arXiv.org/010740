We present the discovery and properties of DESJ014132.4-542749.9 (DES0141-54), a new powerful
radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the early Universe (z=5.0). It was discovered by cross-matching
the first data release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES DR1) with the Sidney University Molonglo Survey
(SUMSS) radio catalog at 0.843 GHz. This object is the first radio-loud AGN at high redshift discovered
in the DES. The radio properties of DES0141-54, namely its very large radio-loudness (R>10$^{4}$),
the high radio luminosity (L$_{0.8 GHz}$=1.73$\times$10$^{28}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and the flatness
of the radio spectrum ($\alpha$=0.35) up to very high frequencies (120 GHz in the source's rest frame),
classify this object as a blazar, meaning, a radio-loud AGN observed along the relativistic jet
axis. However, the X--ray luminosity of DESJ0141-54 is much lower compared to those of the high redshift
(z$\geq$4.5) blazars discovered so far. Moreover its X-ray-to-radio luminosity ratio (log($\frac{L_{[0.5-10]keV}}{L_{1.4GHz}}$)=9.96$\pm$0.30
Hz) is small also when compared to lower redshift blazars: only 2\% of the low-z population has a similar
ratio. By modeling the spectral energy distribution we found that this peculiar X--ray weakness
and the powerful radio emission could be related to a particularly high value of the magnetic field.
Finally, the mass of the central black hole is relatively small (M$_{BH}$ = 3-8 $\times$10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$)
compared to other confirmed blazars at similar redshift, making DES0141-54 the radio-loud AGN
that host the smallest supermassive black hole ever discovered at z$\geq$5.
