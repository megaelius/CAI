The mechanisms of planet formation are still under debate. We know little about how planets form,
even if more than 4000 exoplanets have been detected to date. Recent investigations target the cot
of newly born planets: the protoplanetary disk. At the first stages of their life, exoplanets still
accrete material from the gas-rich disk in which they are embedded. Transitional disks are indeed
disks that show peculiarities, such as gaps, spiral arms, and rings, which can be connected to the
presence of substellar companions. To investigate what is responsible for these features, we selected
all the known transitional disks in the solar neighborhood (<200 pc) that are visible from the southern
hemisphere. We conducted a survey of 11 transitional disks (TDs) with the SPHERE instrument at the
VLT. This is the largest Halpha survey that has been conducted so far to look for protoplanets. The
observations were performed with the Halpha filter of ZIMPOL in order to target protoplanets that
are still in the accretion stage. All the selected targets are very young stars, less than 20 Myr,
and show low extinction in the visible. We reduced the ZIMPOL pupil stabilized data by applying the
method of the angular spectral differential imaging (ASDI), which combines both techniques. The
datacubes are composed of the CntHalpha and the narrow band filter Halpha, which are taken simultaneously
to permit the suppression of the speckle pattern. The principal component analysis (PCA) method
was employed for the reduction of the data. For each dataset, we derived the 5sigma contrast limit
and converted it in upper limits on the accretion luminosity. We do not detect any new accreting substellar
companions around the targeted transition disks down to an average contrast of 12 magnitudes at
0.2 arcsec from the central star (continues in the manuscript).
