The Kepler mission observed thousands of transiting exoplanet candidates around hundreds of thousands
of FGK dwarf stars. He, Ford, & Ragozzine (2019) (arXiv:1907.07773) applied forward modelling
to infer the distribution of intrinsic architectures of planetary systems, developed a clustered
Poisson point process model for exoplanetary systems (SysSim) to reproduce the marginal distributions
of the observed Kepler population, and showed that orbital periods and planet radii are clustered
within a given planetary system. Here, we extend the clustered model to explore correlations between
planetary systems and their host star properties. We split the sample of Kepler FGK dwarfs into two
halves and model the fraction of stars with planets (between $0.5-10 R_\oplus$ and 3--300 d), $f_{\rm
swpa}$, as a linear function of the Gaia DR2 $b_p - r_p$ color. We find that the occurrence of these
planets rises significantly towards later type (redder or higher $b_p - r_p$) stars, with a slope
of $df_{\rm swpa}/d(b_p - r_p) = 0.53_{-0.19}^{+0.19}$. The fraction of stars with planets increases
from $f_{\rm swpa} = 0.34_{-0.11}^{+0.08}$ for F2V dwarfs to $f_{\rm swpa} = 0.91_{-0.18}^{+0.09}$
for mid K-dwarfs. About half ($f_{\rm swpa} = 0.54_{-0.13}^{+0.08}$) of all solar-type (G2V) dwarfs
harbour a planetary system between 3 and 300 d. While this linear $f_{\rm swpa}(b_p - r_p)$ model
is simple, it can closely match the observed multiplicity distributions of both bluer and redder
halves in our sample, suggesting that the architectures of planetary systems around stars of different
spectral types may be similar aside from a shift in the overall fraction of planet hosting stars.
