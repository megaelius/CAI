We propose an extension of the LSST survey to cover the northern sky to DEC < +30 (accessible at airmass
<1.8). This survey will increase the LSST sky coverage by ~9,600 square degrees from 18,900 to 28,500
square degrees (a 50% increase) but use only 0.6-2.5% of the time depending on the synergies with
other surveys. This increased area addresses a wide range of science cases that enhance all of the
primary LSST science goals by significant amounts. The science enabled includes: increasing the
area of the sky accessible for follow-up of multi-messenger transients including gravitational
waves, mapping the milky way halo and halo dwarfs including discovery of RR Lyrae stars in the outer
galactic halo, discovery of z>7 quasars in combination Euclid, enabling a second generation DESI
and other spectroscopic surveys, and enhancing all areas of science by improving synergies with
Euclid, WFIRST, and unique northern survey facilities. This white paper is the result of the Tri-Agency
Working Group (TAG) appointed to develop synergies between missions and presents a unified plan
for northern coverage. The range of time estimates reflects synergies with other surveys. If the
modified DESC WFD survey, the ecliptic plane mini survey, and the north galactic spur mini survey
are executed this plan would only need 0.6% of the LSST time, however if none of these are included
the overall request is 2.5% of the 10 year survey life. In other words, the majority of these observations
are already suggested as part of these other surveys and the intent of this white paper is to propose
a unified baseline plan to carry out a broad range of objectives to facilitate a combination of multiple
science objectives. A companion white paper gives Euclid specific science goals, and we support
the white papers for southern extensions of the LSST survey.
