We investigate the dependence of physical properties of galaxies on small and large scale density
environment. The galaxy population consists of mainly passively evolving galaxies in comparatively
low density regions of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We adopt (i) local density, $\rho_{20}$,
derived using adaptive smoothing kernel, (ii) projected distance, $r_p$, to the nearest neighbor
galaxy and (iii) the morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy as various definitions of environment
parameters of every galaxy in our sample. In order to detect long-range interaction effects we divide
galaxy interactions into four cases depending on morphology of target and neighbor galaxies. This
study builds upon an earlier study by Park & Choi (2009) by including improved definitions of target
and neighbor galaxies thus enabling us to better understand the effect of "the nearest neighbor"
interaction on target galaxy. We report that the impact of interaction on galaxy properties is detectable
at least out to the pair separation corresponding to the virial radius of (the neighbor) galaxies.
This turn out to be mostly between 210 and 360 $h^{-1}$kpc for galaxies included in our study. We report
that early type fraction, for isolated galaxies with $r_p > r_{vir,nei}$ are almost ignorant of
the background density and, has a very weak density dependence for closed pairs. Star formation
activity of a a galaxy is found to be crucially dependent on neighbor galaxy morphology. We find star
formation activity parameters and structure parameters of galaxies to be independent of the large
scale background density. We also exhibit that changing the absolute magnitude of the neighbor
galaxies does not affect significantly the star formation activity of those target galaxies whose
morphology and luminosities are fixed.
