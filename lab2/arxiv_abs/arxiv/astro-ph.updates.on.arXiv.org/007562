The C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS) is a high-sensitivity all-sky radio survey at an angular resolution
of 45 arcmin and a frequency of 5 GHz. We present a deep total intensity map of the North Celestial Pole
(NCP) region of sky at an effective centre frequency of 4.7 GHz, which is limited by source confusion
at a level of ~0.6 mK rms. The map contains extragalactic radio sources as well as diffuse Galactic
synchrotron emission. We apply the template-fitting (cross-correlation) technique to WMAP and
Planck data, using the C-BASS map as the synchrotron template, to investigate the contribution
of diffuse foreground emission at frequencies ~20-40 GHz for declinations above +80deg. In particular,
we investigate the anomalous microwave emission (AME) that is correlated with far-infrared emission
associated with dust. We find that the AME amplitude does not change significantly (<10%) when using
the higher frequency C-BASS 4.7 GHz template instead of the traditional Haslam 408 MHz map as a tracer
of synchrotron radiation. We measure correlation coefficients of $9.93\pm0.35$ and $9.52\pm0.34$
K per unit $\tau_{353}$ when using the Haslam 408 MHz and C-BASS 4.7 GHz synchrotron templates, respectively.
The AME contributes $55\pm2\,\mu$K rms at 22.8 GHz and accounts for ~60% of the total foreground
emission. The absence of change in the AME amplitude when adopting the C-BASS template suggests
that a harder (flatter spectrum) component of synchrotron emission is not the major contributor
to the emission at frequencies >5 GHz in the NCP region, the best-fitting synchrotron spectral index
is $\beta=-2.91\pm0.04$ from 4.7 to 22.8 GHz and $\beta=-2.85 \pm 0.14$ from 22.8 to 44.1 GHz. Free-free
emission is weak, contributing ~$7\,\mu$K rms in this region at 22.8 GHz, which is ~7% of the total.
The best explanation for the AME is still electric dipole emission from small spinning dust grains.
