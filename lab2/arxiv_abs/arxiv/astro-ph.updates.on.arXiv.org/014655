We investigated the chromospheric activity of 60 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in four molecular
clouds and five moving groups. It is considered that strong chromospheric activity is driven by
the dynamo processes generated by the stellar rotation. In contrast, several researchers have
pointed out that the chromospheres of PMS stars are activated by mass accretion from their protoplanetary
disks. In this study, the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) emission lines were investigated utilizing
medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy. The observations were conducted with Nayuta/MALLS
and Subaru/HDS. Additionally, archive data obtained by Keck/HIRES, VLT/UVES, and VLT/X-Shooter
was used. The small ratios of the equivalent widths indicate that Ca II IRT emission lines arise primarily
in dense chromospheric regions. Seven PMS stars show broad emission lines. Among them, four PMS
stars have more than one order of magnitude brighter emission line fluxes compared to the low-mass
stars in young open clusters. The four PMS stars have a high mass accretion rate, which indicates
that the broad and strong emission results from a large mass accretion. However, most PMS stars exhibit
narrow emission lines. No significant correlation was found between the accretion rate and flux
of the emission line. The ratios of the surface flux of the Ca II IRT lines to the stellar bolometric
luminosity, R'_IRT, of the PMS stars with narrow emission lines are as large as the largest R'_IRT
of the low-mass stars in the young open clusters. This result indicates that most PMS stars, even
in the classical T Tauri star stage, have chromospheric activity similar to zero-age main-sequence
stars.
