Context. The mechanisms governing the opening of cavities in transition disks are not fully understood.
Several processes have been proposed but their occurrence rate is still unknown. Aims. We present
spatially resolved observations of two transition disks and aim at constraining their vertical
and radial structure using multiwavelength observations. Methods. We have obtained near-IR scattered
light observations with VLT/SPHERE of the transition disks J1608 and J1852. We complement our datasets
with ALMA observations and with unresolved photometric observations covering a wide range of wavelengths.
We performed radiative transfer modeling to analyze the morphology of the disks and compare the
results with a sample of 20 other transition disks observed with both SPHERE and ALMA. Results. The
scattered light image of J1608 reveals a very inclined disk, with two bright lobes and a large cavity.
J1852 shows an inner ring extending beyond the coronagraphic radius up to 15au, a gap and a second
ring at 42au. Our radiative transfer model of J1608 indicates that the millimeter-sized grains
are less extended vertically and radially than the micron-sized grains, indicating advanced settling
and radial drift. We find good agreement with the observations of J1852 with a similar model, but
due to the low inclination of the system, the model remains partly degenerate. The analysis of 22
transition disks shows that, in general, the cavities observed in scattered light are smaller than
the ones detected at millimeter wavelengths. Conclusions. The analysis of a sample of transition
disks indicates that the small grains can flow inward of the region where millimeter grains are trapped.
While 15 out of the 22 cavities in our sample could be explained by a planet of less than 13 Jupiter masses,
the others either require the presence of a more massive companion or of several low-mass planets.
