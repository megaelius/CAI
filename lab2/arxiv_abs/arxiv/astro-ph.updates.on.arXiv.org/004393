We analyze the observations of a quiescent prominence acquired by the Telescope Heliographique
pour l'Etude du Magnetisme et des Instabilites Solaires (THEMIS) in the He I 5876 A (He I D3) multiplet
aiming to measure the spectral characteristics of the He I D3 profiles and to find for them an adequate
fitting model. The component characteristics of the He I D3 Stokes I profiles are measured by the
fitting system approximating them with a double Gaussian. This model yields an He I D3 component
peak intensity ratio of $5.5\pm0.4$, which differs from the value of 8 expected in the optically
thin limit. Most of the measured Doppler velocities lie in the interval $\pm5$ km/s, with a standard
deviation of $\pm1.7$ km/s around the peak value of 0.4 km/s. The wide distribution of the full-width
at half maximum has two maxima at 0.25 A and 0.30 A for the He I D3 blue component and two maxima at 0.22
A and 0.31 A for the red component. The width ratio of the components is $1.04\pm0.18$. We show that
the double-Gaussian model systematically underestimates the blue wing intensities. To solve
this problem, we invoke a two-temperature multi-Gaussian model, consisting of two double-Gaussians,
which provides a better representation of He I D3 that is free of the wing intensity deficit. This
model suggests temperatures of 11.5 kK and 91 kK, respectively, for the cool and the hot component
of the target prominence. The cool and hot components of a typical He I D3 profile have component peak
intensity ratios of 6.6 and 8, implying a prominence geometrical width of 17 Mm and an optical thickness
of 0.3 for the cool component, while the optical thickness of the hot component is negligible. These
prominence parameters seem to be realistic, suggesting the physical adequacy of the multi-Gaussian
model with important implications for interpreting He I D3 spectropolarimetry by current inversion
codes.
