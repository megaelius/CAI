We use extensive spectroscopy from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to investigate
the relationships between rest-frame optical emission line equivalent widths ($W$) and a number
of galaxy and ISM characteristics for a sample of $1134$ star-forming galaxies at redshifts $1.4\lesssim
z\lesssim 3.8$. We examine how the equivalent widths of [OII]$\lambda\lambda 3727, 3730$, H$\beta$,
[OIII]$\lambda\lambda 4960, 5008$, [OIII]$+$H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$+[NII]$\lambda\lambda
6550, 6585$, depend on stellar mass, UV slope, age, star-formation rate (SFR) and specific SFR (sSFR),
ionization parameter and excitation conditions (O32 and [OIII]/H$\beta$), gas-phase metallicity,
and ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$). The trend of increasing $W$ with
decreasing stellar mass is strongest for [OIII] (and [OIII]+H$\beta$). More generally, the equivalent
widths of all the lines increase with redshift at a fixed stellar mass or fixed gas-phase metallicity,
suggesting that high equivalent width galaxies are common at high redshift. This redshift evolution
in equivalent widths can be explained by the increase in SFR and decrease in metallicity with redshift
at a fixed stellar mass. Consequently, the dependence of $W$ on sSFR is largely invariant with redshift,
particularly when examined for galaxies of a given metallicity. Our results show that high equivalent
width galaxies, specifically those with high $W({\rm [OIII]})$, have low stellar masses, blue
UV slopes, young ages, high sSFRs, ISM line ratios indicative of high ionization parameters, high
$\xi_{\rm ion}$, and low metallicities. As these characteristics are often attributed to galaxies
with high ionizing escape fractions, galaxies with high $W$ are likely candidates for the population
that dominates cosmic reionization.
