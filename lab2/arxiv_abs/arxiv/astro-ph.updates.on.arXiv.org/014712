Steady-state circulation currents are predicted in tidally deformed binary stars, which are believed
to be progenitors of double black-hole merger events. This work aims to quantitatively characterise
the steady-state circulation currents in components of a tidally locked binary system and to explore
the effects of such currents on numerical models. Previous results describing the circulation
in a single rotating star and a binary star are used to deduce a new prescription for the internal circulation
in tidally locked binaries. We explore the effect of this prescription numerically for binary systems
with primary masses between 25 and 100 solar masses. When comparing circulation velocities in the
radial direction for the single rotating star and binary star, it is found that the average circulation
velocity in the binary star may be described as an enhancement to the circulation velocity in a single
rotating star. This velocity enhancement is a simple function depending on the masses of the binary
components and amounts to a factor of approximately two when the components have equal masses. It
is found that the ehancement causes the formation of double helium stars through efficient mixing
to occur for systems with higher initial orbital periods, lower primary masses and lower mass ratios,
compared to the standard circulation scenario. Taking into account appropriate distributions
for primary mass, initial period and mass ratio, models with enhanced mixing predict 2.4 times more
double helium stars being produced in the parameter space than models without. We conclude that
the effects of companion-induced circulation have strong implications for the formation of close
binary black holes. Not only do the predicted detection rates increase but double black-hole systems
with mass ratios as low as 0.8 may be formed when companion-induced circulation is taken into account.
