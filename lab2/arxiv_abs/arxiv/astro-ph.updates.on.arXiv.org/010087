The rotation curve of the Milky Way is commonly used to estimate the local dark matter density $\rho_{{\rm
DM},\odot}$. However, the estimates are subject to the choice of the distribution of baryons needed
in this type of studies. In this work we explore several Galactic mass models that differ in the distribution
of baryons and dark matter, in order to determine $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$. For this purpose we analyze
the precise rotation curve measurements of the Milky Way up to $\sim 25$ kpc from the Galactic centre
obtained from Gaia DR2 [1]. We find that the estimated value of $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ stays robust
to reasonable changes in the spherical dark matter halo. However, we show that $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$
is affected by the choice of the model for the underlying baryonic components. In particular, we
find that $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ is mostly sensitive to uncertainties in the disk components
of the Galaxy. We also show that, when choosing one particular baryonic model, the estimate of $\rho_{{\rm
DM},\odot}$ has an uncertainty of only about $10\%$ of its best-fit value, but this uncertainty
gets much bigger when we also consider the variation of the baryonic model. In particular, the rotation
curve method does not allow to exclude the presence of an additional very thin component, that can
increase $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$ by more than a factor of 8. Therefore, we conclude that exclusively
using the rotation curve of the Galaxy is not enough to provide a robust estimate of $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot}$.
For all the models that we study without the presence of an additional thin component, our resulting
estimates of the local dark matter density take values in the range $\rho_{{\rm DM},\odot} \simeq
\text{0.3--0.4}\,\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$, consistent with many of the estimates in the literature.
