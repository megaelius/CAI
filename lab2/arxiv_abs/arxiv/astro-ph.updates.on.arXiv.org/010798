(Abridged) The initial physical conditions of high-mass stars and protoclusters remain poorly
characterized. To this end we present the first targeted ALMA 1.3mm continuum and spectral line
survey towards high-mass starless clump candidates, selecting a sample of 12 of the most massive
candidates ($400-4000\, M_\odot$) within 5 kpc. The joint 12+7m array maps have a high spatial resolution
of $\sim 3000\, \mathrm{au}$ ($\sim 0.8^{\prime\prime}$) and have point source mass-completeness
down to $\sim 0.3\, M_\odot$ at $6\sigma$ (or $1\sigma$ column density sensitivity of $1.1\times10^{22}\,
\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$). We discover previously undetected signposts of low-luminosity star formation
from CO (2-1) and SiO (5-4) bipolar outflows and other signatures towards 11 out of 12 clumps, showing
that current MIR/FIR Galactic Plane surveys are incomplete to low- and intermediate-mass protostars
($\lesssim 50\, L_\odot$). We compare a subset of the observed cores with a suite of radiative transfer
models of starless cores. We find a high-mass starless core candidate with a model-derived mass
consistent with $29^{52}_{15}\, M_\odot$ when integrated over size scales of $2\times10^4\,
\mathrm{au}$. Unresolved cores are poorly fit by starless core models, supporting the interpretation
that they are protostellar even without detection of outflows. Substantial fragmentation is observed
towards 10 out of 12 clumps. We extract sources from the maps using a dendrogram to study the characteristic
fragmentation length scale. Nearest neighbor separations when corrected for projection are consistent
with being equal to the clump average thermal Jeans length. Our findings support a hierarchical
fragmentation process, where the highest density regions are not strongly supported against thermal
gravitational fragmentation by turbulence or magnetic fields.
