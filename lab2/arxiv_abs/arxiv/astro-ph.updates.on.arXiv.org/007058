Context. The detection of chromospheric activity cycles in solar-analogue and twin stars, can
be used to put in context the solar cycle. However, there is a relatively low percentage of these stars
with activity cycles detected. It is well known that the cores of Ca II H&K lines are modulated by stellar
activity. The behaviour of Balmer and other optical lines with stellar activity is not yet completely
understood. Aims. To search for Ca II H&K, Balmer and Fe II line variations modulated by the stellar
activity. In particular, we apply a novel strategy to detect possible shape variations in the H{\alpha}
line. Methods. We analyse activity signatures in HD 38858 by using HARPS and CASLEO spectra obtained
between 2003 and 2017. We calculate the Mount Wilson index (S$_{MW}$), log($\mathrm{R}'_\mathrm{HK}$)
and the statistical moments of Ca II H&K, Balmer and other optical lines. We search for periodicities
by using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Results. We detect a long-term activity cycle
of 10.8 yr in Ca II H&K and H{\alpha}, being HD 38858 one of the most similar stars to the Sun for which
a cycle has been detected. In contrast, this cycle is marginally detected in the Fe II lines. Also,
we detect a noticeable radial velocity variation, which seems to be produced by stellar activity.
Conclusions. HD 38858 is the second solar-analogue star where we find a clear activity cycle which
is replicated by Balmer lines. Spectral indexes based on the shape of H{\alpha} seems to be more realiable
than the fluxes in the same line to detect activity variations. On the other hand, the cyclic modulation
detected gives place to a radial velocity variation, previously associated to a super-Earth planet.
Finally, due to the similarity of HD 38858 with the Sun, we recommend to continue monitoring this
star.
