The strong galaxy-galaxy lensing produces highly magnified and distorted images of background
galaxies in the form of arcs and Einstein rings. Statistically, these effects are quantified, for
example, in the number counts of highly luminous sub-millimeter galaxies and of gravitational
arcs. Two key quantities to model these statistics are the magnification and the arc cross sections.
These are usually computed using either the circular infinitesimal source approximation or ray-tracing
simulations for sources of finite size. In this work, we use an analytic solution for gravitational
arcs to obtain these cross sections as a function of image magnification and length-to-width ratio
in closed form, for finite sources. These analytical solutions provide simple interpretations
to the numerical results, can be employed to test the computational codes, and can be used for fast
a computation of the abundance of distant sources and arcs. In this paper, the lens is modeled by a
Singular Isothermal Sphere, which is an excellent approximation to radial density profile of Early-Type
galaxies, and the sources are also axisymmetric. We derive expressions for the geometrical properties
of the images, such as the area and several definitions of length and width. We obtain the magnification
cross section in exact form and derive a simple analytic approximation covering the arc and Einstein
ring regimes. The arc cross section is obtained down to the formation of an Einstein ring and given
in terms of elementary functions. Perturbative expansions of these results are worked out, showing
explicitly the correction terms for finite sources.
