Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are bright X-ray sources in nearby galaxies not associated
with the central supermassive black hole. Their luminosities imply they are powered by either an
extreme accretion rate onto a compact stellar remnant, or an intermediate mass ($\sim100-10^5$
M$_{\odot}$) black hole. The recent detection of coherent pulsations coming from three bright
ULXs demonstrates that some of these sources are powered by accretion onto a neutron star, implying
accretion rates significantly in excess of the Eddington limit, a high degree of geometric beaming,
or both. The physical challenges associated with the high implied accretion rates can be mitigated
if the neutron star surface field is high - in the magnetar regime ($10^{14}$ G), since this suppresses
the electron scattering cross section, reducing the radiation pressure that chokes off accretion
for high luminosities. One of the few ways to determine surface magnetic fields is through the detection
of cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs) produced by the transition of charged particles
between quantized Landau levels. To date, CRSFs have only been detected in Galactic accreting pulsars.
Here we present the detection at 3.8-{\sigma} significance of a strong absorption line at a rest-frame
energy of 4.5 keV in the Chandra spectrum of a ULX in M51. We find that this feature is likely to be a CRSF
produced by the strong magnetic field of a neutron star. Assuming scattering off electrons, the
magnetic field strength is implied to be $\sim10^{11}$ G, however the line is narrower than any electron
CRSFs previously observed, and assuming thermal broadening, the implied temperature is significantly
cooler than the accretion disk or column. The line shape is, however, consistent with a proton resonance
scattering feature, implying that the neutron star has a magnetic field near the surface of B$\sim10^{15}$
G.
