We have shown the outcome of N-body simulations of the interactions of two disc galaxies without
gas with the same mass. Both disc galaxies have halos of dark matter, central bulges and initial supermassive
black hole (SMBH) seeds at their centers. The purpose of this work is to study the mass and dynamical
evolution of the initial SMBH seed during a Hubble cosmological time. It is a complementation of
our previous paper with different initial orbit conditions and by introducing the SMBH seed in the
initial galaxy. The disc of the secondary galaxy has coplanar or polar orientation in relation to
the disc of the primary galaxy and their initial orbit are eccentric and prograde. The primary and
secondary galaxies have mass and size of Milky Way with an initial SMBH seed. We have found that the
merger of the primary and secondary discs can result in a final normal disc or a final warped disc.
After the fusion of discs, the final one is thicker and larger than the initial disc. The tidal effects
are very important, modifying the evolution of the SMBH in the primary and secondary galaxy differently.
The mass of the SMBH of the primary galaxy have increased by a factor ranging from 52 to 64 times the
initial seed mass, depending on the experiment. However, the mass of the SMBH of the secondary galaxy
have increased by a factor ranging from 6 to 33 times the initial SMBH seed mass, depending also on
the experiment. Most of the accreted particles have come from the bulge and from the halo, depleting
their particles. This could explain why the observations show that the SMBH with masses of approximately
$10^6 M_\odot$ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Only a small number of the accreted particles
has come from the disc. In some cases of final merging stage of the two galaxies, the final SMBH of the
secondary galaxy was {ejected out of the galaxy}.
