Accurate techniques which allow for the derivation of the spatial density in star formation regions
are rare. A technique which has found application for the derivation of spatial densities in Galactic
star formation regions utilizes the density-sensitive properties of the K-doublet transitions
of formaldehyde (H2CO). In this paper, we present an extension of our survey of the formaldehyde
1(10)-1(11) (lambda = 6.2 cm) and 2(11)-2(12) (lambda = 2.1 cm) K-doublet transitions of H2CO in
a sample of 56 starburst systems (Mangum etal. 2008). We have extended the number of galaxies in which
both transitions have been detected from 5 to 13. We have improved our spatial density measurements
by incorporating kinetic temperatures based upon NH3 measurements of 11 of the galaxies with a total
of 14 velocity components in our sample (Mangum etal. 2013). Our spatial density measurements lie
in a relatively narrow range of from 10^(4.5) to 10^(5.5) cm^(-3). This implies that the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation between L_(IR) and M_(dense): (1) Is an indication of the dense gas mass reservoir available
to form stars, and (2) Is not directly dependent upon a higher average density driving the star formation
process in the most luminous starburst galaxies. We have also used our H2CO measurements to derive
two separate measures of the dense gas mass which are generally smaller, in many cases by a factor
of 10^2-10^3, than those derived using HCN. This disparity suggests that H2CO traces a denser, more
compact, component of the giant molecular clouds in our starburst galaxy sample. We also report
measurements of the rotationally-excited lambda = 6.3 cm 2P_(1/2) J=1/2 state of OH and the H111alpha
radio recombination line taken concurrently with our H2CO 1(10)-1(11) measurements.
