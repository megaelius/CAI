The upcoming generation of galaxy surveys will probe the distribution of matter in the universe
with unprecedented accuracy. Measurements of the matter power spectrum at different scales and
redshifts will provide stringent constraints on the cosmological parameters. However, on non-linear
scales this will require an accurate evaluation of the covariance matrix. Here, we compute the covariance
matrix of the matter power spectrum for the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology from an ensemble
of N-body simulations of the Dark Energy Universe Simulation - Parallel Universe Runs (DEUS-PUR).
This consists of 12288 realizations of a $(656\,h^{-1}\,\textrm{Mpc})^3$ simulation box with
$256^3$ particles. We combine this set with an auxiliary sample of 96 simulations of the same volume
with $1024^3$ particles to assess the impact of non-Gaussian uncertainties due to mass resolution
effects. We find this to be an important source of systematic errors at high redshift and small intermediate
scales. We introduce an empirical statistical method to correct for this effect and provide an accurate
determination of the covariance matrix over a wide range of scales including the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations. The large statistical sample of DEUS-PUR simulations enables us to finely sample
the probability distribution of the matter power spectrum. Contrary to previous studies which
have used smaller N-body simulation ensembles, we find the skewness of the distribution to significantly
deviate from expectations of a Gaussian random density field at $k\gtrsim 0.25\,h\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
and $z<0.5$. This suggests that in the case of finite volume surveys an unbiased estimate of the
ensemble averaged band power at these scales and redshifts may require a careful assessment of non-Gaussian
errors more than previously considered.
