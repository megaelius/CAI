The substantial number of binary central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) now known ($\sim$50)
has revealed a strong connection between binarity and some morphological features including jets
and low-ionisation structures. However, some features and asymmetries might be too complex or
subtle to ascribe to binary interactions alone. A tertiary component, i.e. a triple nucleus, could
be the missing ingredient required to produce these features. The only proven triple, NGC 246, is
insufficient to investigate the shaping role of triple nuclei, but one straight-forward way to
identify more triples is to search for binaries in nuclei with known visual companions. Here we report
on the SALT HRS discovery of a 4.81 d orbital period in the CSPN of Sp 3 which has a visual companion 0.31"
away. The spectroscopic distance of the visual companion agrees with distance estimates to the
nebula, the GAIA DR2 parallax of the central star, and the gravity distance of the central star. This
supports a physical association between the visual companion and the 4.81 d binary, making the nucleus
of Sp 3 a likely triple. We determine $T_\mathrm{eff}=68^{+12}_{-6}$ kK, $\log g=4.6\pm0.2$ cm
s$^{-2}$ and $v_\mathrm{rot}=80\pm20$ km s$^{-1}$ for the primary from NLTE model atmosphere
analysis. The peculiar nebula presents an apparent bipolar morphology, jets and an unexpected
`extreme' oxygen abundance discrepancy factor (adf) of 24.6$^{+4.1}_{-3.4}$. The adf is inconsistent
with the purported trend for longer orbital period post-CE PNe to exhibit normal adfs, further highlighting
selection effects in post-CE PNe. The Type-I nebular abundances of Sp 3, whose origin is often tied
to more massive progenitors, are incongruous with the likely Galactic Thick Disk membership of
Sp 3, possibly suggesting that rotation and binarity may play an important role in the AGB nucleosynthesis
of PNe. (abridged)
