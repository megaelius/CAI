The class variable source GRS 1915+105 exhibits a wide range of time variabilities in time scales
of a few seconds to a few days. Depending on the count rates in different energy bands and the nature
of the conventional colour-colour diagram, the variabilities were classified into sixteen classes
which were later sequenced in ascending order of Comptonization Efficiency. The $\chi$ classes
are known to be harder compared to the rest of the classes, and the light curves do not show significant
variation. However, all such variations of count rates across different classes must be linked
to the variation of flow parameters such as the accretion rates, be it the Keplerian disc rate and/or
the low angular momentum halo rate. This motivated us to analyse the spectra of the $\chi$ class data
using the physical Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) solution which extracts these two rates
from fits. We find that in the $\chi_{2,4}$ classes, which are reportedly devoid of significant
outflows, the spectra could be fitted well using TCAF solution alone. In the $\chi_{1,3}$ class,
which are always linked with outflows, a cutoff power-law model is needed in addition to the TCAF
solution. At the same time, the normalization required by this model along with the variation of
photon index and exponential roll-off factor provides us with the information on the relative dominance
of the outflow in the latter two classes. TCAF fit also provides us with the size and location of the
Compton cloud along with its optical depth. Thus, by fitting with TCAF we obtain the evolution of
the flow geometry in GRS when it is in the $\chi$ class.
