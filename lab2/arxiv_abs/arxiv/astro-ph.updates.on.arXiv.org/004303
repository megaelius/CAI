The motions of small-scale magnetic flux elements in the solar photosphere can provide some measure
of the Lagrangian properties of the convective flow. Measurements of these motions have been critical
in estimating the turbulent diffusion coefficient in flux-transport dynamo models and in determining
the Alfven wave excitation spectrum for coronal heating models. We examine the motions of internetwork
flux elements in a 24 hour long Hinode/NFI magnetogram sequence with 90 second cadence, and study
both the scaling of their mean squared displacement and the shape of their displacement probability
distribution as a function of time. We find that the mean squared displacement scales super-diffusively
with a slope of about 1.48. Super-diffusive scaling has been observed in other studies for temporal
increments as small as 5 seconds, increments over which ballistic scaling would be expected. Using
high-cadence MURaM simulations, we show that the observed super-diffusive scaling at short temporal
increments is a consequence of random changes in the barycenter positions due to flux evolution.
We also find that for long temporal increments, beyond granular lifetimes, the observed displacement
distribution deviates from that expected for a diffusive process, evolving from Rayleigh to Gaussian.
This change in the distribution can be modeled analytically by accounting for supergranular advection
along with motions due to granulation. These results complicate the interpretation of magnetic
element motions as strictly advective or diffusive on short and long timescales and suggest that
measurements of magnetic element motions must be used with caution in turbulent diffusion or wave
excitation models. We propose that passive trace motions in measured photospheric flows may yield
more robust transport statistics.
