We use planetary nebulae (PNe) as probes to determine the Galactic radial oxygen gradients, and
other abundance patterns. We select data homogeneously from recent data sets, including PNe at
large Galactocentric distances. The radial oxygen gradient calculated for the general PN population,
which probes the region between the Galactic center and out to $\sim$28 kpc, is shallow, with slope
$\sim$-0.02 dex kpc$^{-1}$, in agreement with previous findings. We looked for time evolution
of the metallicity gradient using PNe with different age progenitors as metallicity probes. We
identify PNe whose progenitor stars are younger than 1 Gyr (YPPNe), and those whose progenitor stars
are older than 7.5 Gyr (OPPNe), based on the comparison between evolutionary yields and elemental
abundances of the PNe. By studying OPPNe and YPPNe separately we found that: (i) The OPPNe oxygen
gradient is shallower ($\sim-0.015$ dex kpc$^{-1}$) than that derived from YPPNe ($\sim-0.027$
dex kpc$^{-1}$); (ii) the OPPNe inner radial distribution of oxygen is compatible with no gradient
to the radial extent of the thick disk population ($\sim$10 kpc), similarly to what has been observed
in thick disk stars; (iii) planetary nebulae (especially OPPNe) indicate that significant gradient
slope is limited to Galactocentric distances between $\sim$10 to $\sim$13.5 kpc, as observed for
open clusters and field stars. Outside this range, the distribution is almost flat. We found that
the radial oxygen gradient is steeper for a PN population closer to the Galactic disk, similarly
to what is observed in the general stellar population by the SEGUE survey. We use our novel population
dating to compare our results with current chemical evolutionary models, and with gradients from
other Galactic populations, for insight on galaxy chemical evolution.
