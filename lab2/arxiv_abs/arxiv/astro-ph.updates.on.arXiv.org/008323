Quadruply lensed quasars are extremely rare objects, but incredibly powerful cosmological tools.
Only few dozen are known in the whole sky. Here we present the spectroscopic confirmation of two new
quadruplets WG0214-2105 and WG2100-4452 discovered by Agnello & Spiniello (2018) within the Dark
Energy Survey (DES) public footprints. We have conducted a spectroscopic follow-up of these systems
with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) as part of the program Gotta catch'em all (PI: L.Marchetti)
that aims at confirming the largest possible number of optically selected strong gravitational
lensing systems in the Equatorial and Southern Hemisphere. For both systems, we present the spectra
for the sources and deflectors, that allowed us to estimate the redshifts and unambiguously confirm
their lensing nature. For the brightest deflector (WG2100-4452) we measure the stellar velocity
dispersion from the spectrum. We also perform for both lenses, PSF photometry, directly from DES
multi-band images, isolating the lens galaxy from the quasar images. One of the quadruplets, WG0214-2105,
was also observed by the Pan-STARRS Survey. This allowed us to obtain two estimations at two different
epochs of the apparent brightness of each quasar image, finding evidence for flux variability.
This could suggest a microlensing event for the faintest components, although intrinsic variability
cannot be excluded with only two epochs. Finally, we present a simple lens model for both quadruplets,
obtaining Einstein radii, SIE velocity dispersions, ellipticities and position angles of the
lens systems, as well as time delay predictions, assuming a concordance cosmological model.
