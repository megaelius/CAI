We present the star cluster catalogs for 17 dwarf and irregular galaxies in the $HST$ Treasury Program
"Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey" (LEGUS). Cluster identification and photometry in this subsample
are similar to that of the entire LEGUS sample, but special methods were developed to provide robust
catalogs with accurate fluxes due to low cluster statistics. The colors and ages are largely consistent
for two widely used aperture corrections, but a significant fraction of the clusters are more compact
than the average training cluster. However, the ensemble luminosity, mass, and age distributions
are consistent suggesting that the systematics between the two methods are less than the random
errors. When compared with the clusters from previous dwarf galaxy samples, we find that the LEGUS
catalogs are more complete and provide more accurate total fluxes. Combining all clusters into
a composite dwarf galaxy, we find that the luminosity and mass functions can be described by a power
law with the canonical index of $-2$ independent of age and global SFR binning. The age distribution
declines as a power law, with an index of $\approx-0.80\pm0.15$, independent of cluster mass and
global SFR binning. This decline of clusters is dominated by cluster disruption since the combined
star formation histories and integrated-light SFRs are both approximately constant over the last
few hundred Myr. Finally, we find little evidence for an upper-mass cutoff ($<2\sigma$) in the composite
cluster mass function, and can rule out a truncation mass below $\approx10^{4.5}$M$_{\odot}$
but cannot rule out the existence of a truncation at higher masses.
