This paper introduces a series of papers presenting a quantitative theory for the tidal disruption
of main sequence stars by supermassive black holes. Using fully general relativistic hydrodynamics
simulations and MESA-model initial conditions, we explore the pericenter-dependence of tidal
disruption properties for eight stellar masses ($0.15 \leq M_*/M_\odot \leq 10$) and six black
hole masses ($10^5 \leq M_{BH}/M_\odot \leq 5 \times 10^7$). We present here the results most relevant
to observations. The effects of internal stellar structure and relativity decouple for both the
disruption cross section and the characteristic energy width of the debris. Moreover, the full
disruption cross section is almost independent of $M_*$ for $M_*/M_\odot \lesssim 3$. Independent
of $M_*$, relativistic effects increase the critical pericenter distance for full disruptions
by up to a factor $\sim 3$ relative to the Newtonian prediction. The probability of a direct capture
is also independent of $M_*$; at $M_{BH}/M_\odot \simeq 5 \times 10^6$ this probability is equal
to that of a complete disruption. The width of the debris energy distribution $\Delta E$ can differ
from the standard estimate by factors from 0.35 to 2, depending on $M_*$ and $M_{BH}$, implying a
corresponding change in the characteristic mass-return timescale. The "frozen-in approximation"
is inconsistent with $\Delta E$, and mass-loss continues over a long span of time. We provide analytic
forms, suitable for use in both event rate estimates and parameter inference, to describe all these
trends. For partial disruptions, we find a nearly-universal relation between the star's angular
momentum and the fraction of $M_*$ remaining. Within the "empty loss-cone" regime, partial disruptions
must precede full disruptions. These partial disruptions can drastically affect the rate and appearance
of subsequent total disruptions.
