The envelope of the red supergiant VY CMa has long been considered an extreme example of episodic
mass loss that is possibly taking place in other cool and massive evolved stars. Recent submm observations
of the envelope revealed the presence of massive dusty clumps within 800 mas from the star which reinforce
the picture of drastic mass-loss phenomena in VY CMa. We present ALMA observations at an unprecedented
angular resolution and sensitivity that reveal further details about the dusty clumps. We resolve
more discrete features and identify a submm counterpart of a more distant Clump SW known from visual
observations. The brightest clump C is marginally resolved in the observations. Gas seen against
the resolved photosphere of clump C produces a molecular spectrum in absorption, in lines of sulfur-bearing
species. Except for SW Clump, no molecular emission is found to be associated with the dusty clumps
and we propose that the dusty structures have an atypically low gas content. We attempt to reproduce
the properties of the dusty clumps through three-dimensional radiative transfer modeling. Although
a clump configuration explaining the observations is found, it is not unique. A very high optical
depth of all clumps to the stellar radiation make the modeling very challenging and requires unrealistically
high dust masses for one of them. It is suggested that the dusty features have a substructure, e.g.
porosity, that allows deeper penetration of stellar photons within the clumps. A comparison of
the estimated clumps ages to variations in the stellar visual flux for over a century suggests that
the mechanism responsible for their formation is not uniquely manifested by enhanced or strongly
diminished visual light. The study demonstrates that the dusty mass-loss episodes of VY CMa are
indeed unparalleled among all known non-explosive stars. The origin of these episodes remains
unclear.
