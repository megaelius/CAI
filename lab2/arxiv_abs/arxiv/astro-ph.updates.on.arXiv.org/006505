We present high resolution H{\sc i} 21cm Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations of
the superthin galaxy FGC1540 with a spatial resolution of 10$''$ $\times$ 8$''$ and a spectral resolution
of 1.73 kms$^{-1}$ and an rms noise of 0.9 mJy per beam. We obtain its rotation curve as well as deprojected
radial H{\sc i} surface density profile by fitting a 3-dimensional tilted ring model directly to
the H{\sc i} data cubes by using the publicly-available software, Fully Automated Tirrific (FAT).
We also present the rotation curve of FGC1540 derived from its optical spectroscopy study using
the 6-m BTA telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
We use the rotation curve, the H{\sc i} surface density profile together with Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m
and the SDSS $i$--band data to construct the mass models for FGC1540. We find that both the Pseudo-isothermal
(PIS), as well as Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter (DM) halos, fit the observed rotation curve
equally well. The PIS model indicates a compact dark matter halo ($R_{\rm C}/R_{\rm D}$ < 2), with
the best-fitting core radius ($R_{\rm C}$) approximately half the exponential stellar disc scale
length ($R_{\rm D}$), which is in agreement with the mass models of superthin galaxies studied earlier
in the literature. Since the vertical thickness of the galactic stellar disc is determined by a balance
between the net gravitational field and the velocity dispersion in the vertical direction, the
compact dark matter halo may be primarily responsible in regulating the superthin vertical structure
of the stellar disc in FGC1540 as was found in case of the superthin galaxy UGC7321.
