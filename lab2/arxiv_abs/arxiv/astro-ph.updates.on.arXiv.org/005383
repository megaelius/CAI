When a planet becomes massive enough, it gradually carves a partial gap around its orbit in the protoplanetary
disk. A pressure maximum can be formed outside the gap where solids that are loosely coupled to the
gas, typically in the pebble size range, can be trapped. The minimum planet mass for building such
a trap, which is called the pebble isolation mass (PIM), is important for two reasons: it marks the
end of planetary growth by pebble accretion, and the trapped dust forms a ring that may be observed
with millimetre observations. We study the effect of disk turbulence on the pebble isolation mass
and find its dependence on the gas turbulent viscosity, aspect ratio, and particles Stokes number.
By means of 2D gas hydrodynamical simulations, we found the minimum planet mass to form a radial pressure
maximum beyond the orbit of the planet, which is the necessary condition to trap pebbles. We then
carried out 2D gas plus dust hydrodynamical simulations to examine how dust turbulent diffusion
impacts particles trapping at the pressure maximum. We finally provide a semi-analytical calculation
of the PIM based on comparing the radial drift velocity of solids and the root mean square turbulent
velocity fluctuations around the pressure maximum. From our results of gas simulations, we provide
an expression for the PIM versus disk aspect ratio and turbulent viscosity. Our gas plus dust simulations
show that the effective PIM can be nearly an order of magnitude larger in high-viscosity disks because
turbulence diffuse particles out of the pressure maximum. This is quantified by our semi-analytical
calculation, which gives an explicit dependence of the PIM with Stokes number of particles. We conclude
than disk turbulence can significantly alter the PIM, depending on the level of turbulence in regions
of planet formation.
