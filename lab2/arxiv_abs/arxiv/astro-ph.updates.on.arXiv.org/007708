For the Local Group Scd galaxy M 33 this paper presents a multi-scale study of the relationship between
the monochromatic star formation rate (SFR) estimator based on 12 $\mu$m emission and the total
SFR estimator based on a combination of far-ultraviolet and 24 $\mu$m emission. We show the 12 $\mu$m
emission to be a linear estimator of total SFR on spatial scales from 782 pc down to 49 pc, over almost
four magnitudes in SFR. These results therefore extend to sub-kpc length scales the analogous results
from other studies for global length scales. We use high-resolution HI and $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(J=2-1)$
image sets from the literature to compare the star formation to the neutral gas. For the full range
of length scales we find well-defined power-law relationships between 12 $\mu$m-derived SFR surface
densities and neutral gas surface densities. For the H$_\mathrm{2}$ gas component almost all correlations
are consistent with being linear. No evidence is found for a breakdown in the star formation law at
small length scales in M 33 reported by other authors. We show that the average star formation efficiency
in M 33 is roughly $10^{-9}$ yr$^{-1}$ and that it remains constant down to giant molecular cloud
length scales. Toomre and shear-based models of the star formation threshold are shown to inaccurately
account for the star formation activity in the inner disc of M 33. Finally, we clearly show that the
HI saturation limit of $\approx 9$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ reported in the literature for other galaxies
is not an intrinsic property of M 33 - it is systematically introduced as an artefact of spatially
smoothing the data.
