We present $\sim0.10^{\prime\prime}-$resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) CO(2$-$1) imaging of the arcsecond-scale ($r \approx 150$ pc) dusty molecular disk
in the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 3258. The data provide unprecedented resolution of cold gas disk
kinematics within the dynamical sphere of influence of a supermassive black hole, revealing a quasi-Keplerian
central increase in projected rotation speed rising from 280 km s$^{-1}$ at the disk's outer edge
to $>400$ km s$^{-1}$ near the disk center. We construct dynamical models for the rotating disk and
fit beam-smeared model CO line profiles directly to the ALMA data cube. Our models incorporate both
flat disks and tilted-ring disks that provide a better fit of the mildly warped structure in NGC 3258.
We show that the exceptional angular resolution of the ALMA data makes it possible to infer the host
galaxy's mass profile within $r=150$ pc solely from the ALMA CO kinematics, without relying on optical
or near-infrared imaging data to determine the stellar mass profile. Our model therefore circumvents
any uncertainty in the black hole mass that would result from the substantial dust extinction in
the galaxy's central region. The best model fit yields $M_\mathrm{BH} = 2.249\times10^9$ $M_\odot$
with a statistical model-fitting uncertainty of just 0.18\%, and systematic uncertainties of
0.62\% from various aspects of the model construction and 12\% from uncertainty in the distance
to NGC 3258. This observation demonstrates the full potential of ALMA for carrying out highly precise
measurements of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in early-type galaxies containing circumnuclear gas disks
