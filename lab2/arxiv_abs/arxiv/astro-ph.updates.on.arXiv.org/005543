The atmospheric temperatures of the very hot Jupiter KELT-9b straddle the transition between gas
giants and stars, and therefore between two traditionally distinct regimes of atmospheric chemistry.
Despite the high ultraviolet flux from KELT-9, we show using photochemical kinetics calculations
that the observable atmosphere of KELT-9b is predicted to be close to chemical equilibrium, which
greatly simplifies any theoretical interpretation of its spectra. It also makes the atmosphere
of KELT-9b, which is expected to be cloudfree, a tightly constrained chemical system that lends
itself to a clean set of theoretical predictions. Due to the lower pressures probed in transmission
spectroscopy, we predict the abundance of water to vary by several orders of magnitude across the
atmospheric limb depending on temperature, which makes water a sensitive thermometer. Carbon
monoxide is predicted to be the dominant molecule under a wide range of scenarios, rendering it a
robust diagnostic of the metallicity when analyzed in tandem with water. All of the other usual suspects
(acetylene, ammonia, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, methane) are predicted to be subdominant
at solar metallicity, while atomic oxygen, iron and magnesium are predicted to have relative abundances
as high as 1 part in 10,000. Neutral atomic iron is predicted to be seen through a forest of optical
and near-infrared lines, which makes KELT-9b suitable for high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy
with HARPS-N or CARMENES. We summarize the future observational prospects of characterizing the
atmosphere of KELT-9b with the Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope and CHEOPS.
