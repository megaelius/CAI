We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits the moderately bright ($V
\sim 9.9$) A8V star TYC 764-1494-1. We confirm the planetary nature of the companion via a combination
of low-precision radial velocities, which limit the mass to $M_{\rm P} < 4.1\,M_{\rm J}$ ($3\sigma$),
and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which indicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment
of $\lambda = -179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $T_{\rm eff}
=7500 \pm 110\,\rm K$ host star has $M_* = 1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\,M_{\odot}$ and $R_* = 1.83 \pm
0.10\,R_{\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $R_{\rm P}=1.91 \pm 0.11\,R_{\rm J}$ and receives
a stellar insolation flux of $\sim 3.2\times 10^{9}\,{\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, leading
to an inferred equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq} \sim 1935\,\rm K$ assuming zero albedo and
complete heat redistribution. With a $v\sin{I_*}=84.8\pm 2.0\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, the host star
is rapidly-rotating. Interestingly, its $v\sin{I_*}$ is relatively low compared to other stars
with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced in metallic species such as strontium
but deficient in others such as calcium, suggesting that it is likely an Am star. KELT-19A would be
the first definitive detection of an Am host of a transiting planet of which we are aware. Adaptive
optics observations of the system reveal the existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral
type at a projected separation of $\approx 160\, \mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity measurements indicate
that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to have stellar companions, which are often
invoked to explain the relatively slow rotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion
is unlikely to have caused the tidal braking of the primary.
