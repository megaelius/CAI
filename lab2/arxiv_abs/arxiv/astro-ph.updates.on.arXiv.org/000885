Damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs) can be used to measure gas-phase metallicities at large cosmological
lookback times with high precision. Relative abundances can still be measured accurately deep
into the reionization epoch (z > 6) using transitions redward of Ly-alpha. Here we study chemical
evolution of DLAs using a constrained model for evolution of galaxies and IGM to determine the degree
to which DLA abundance measurements can probe Population III enrichment. We find that if the critical
metallicity of Population III to II transition is < 10^-4 Zsun, the cosmic Population III SFR
is zero for z<8. Nevertheless, at high redshift (z ~ 6) Population III chemical signatures are
retained in low-mass galaxies (halo mass < 10^9 Msun). This is because photoionization feedback
suppresses star formation in these galaxies until relatively low redshift (z ~ 10), and the chemical
record of early Population III star formation is retained. We model DLAs as these galaxies by assigning
to them a mass-dependent H I absorption cross section and predict distribution of DLA abundance
ratios. We find that these distributions are anchored towards abundance ratios set by Population
II yields, but exhibit a tail that depends on the Population III IMF for z > 5. Thus, a sample of DLA
abundance measurements at high redshift holds the promise to constrain Population III IMF. A sample
of just 10 DLAs with relative abundances measured to an accuracy of 0.1 dex is sufficient to constrain
the Population III IMF at 4-sigma. These constraints may prove stronger than other probes such as
metal-poor stars and individual DLAs. Our results provide a global picture of the cosmic thermal,
ionization, and chemical evolution, and can rule out certain Population III scenarios.
