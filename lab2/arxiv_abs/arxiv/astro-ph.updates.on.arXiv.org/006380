We adopt two- and three-body nuclear forces derived at the next-to-next-to-leading-order (N2LO)
in the framework of effective chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) to calculate the equation of state
(EOS) of $\beta$-stable neutron star matter using the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock many-body approach.
We use the recent optimized chiral two-body nuclear interaction at N2LO derived by \cite{ekstrom1}
and two different parametrizations of the three-body N2LO interaction: the first one is fixed to
reproduce the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter while the second one is fixed to reproduce
the binding energies of light atomic nuclei. We show that in the second case the properties of nuclear
matter are not well determined whereas in the first case various empirical nuclear matter properties
around the saturation density are well reproduced. We also calculate the nuclear symmetry energy
$E_{sym}$ as a function of the nucleonic density and compare our results with the empirical constraints
obtained using the excitation energies of isobaric analog states in nuclei and the experimental
data on the neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei. We next calculate various neutron star properties
and in particular the mass-radius and mass-central density relations. We find that the adopted
interactions based on a fully microscopic framework, are able to provide an EOS which is consistent
with the present data of measured neutron star masses and in particular with the mass $M=2.01\pm0.04
M_\odot$ of the neutron star in PSR J0348+0432. We finally consider the possible presence of hyperons
in the stellar core and we find a softening of the EOS and a substantial reduction of the stellar maximum
mass in agreement with similar calculations present in the literature.
