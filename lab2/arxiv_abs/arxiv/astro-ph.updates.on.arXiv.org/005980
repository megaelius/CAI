Various galaxy classification schemes have been developed so far to constrain the main physical
processes regulating evolution of different galaxy types. In the era of a deluge of astrophysical
information and recent progress in machine learning, a new approach to galaxy classification becomes
imperative. We employ a Fisher Expectation-Maximization unsupervised algorithm working in a
parameter space of 12 rest-frame magnitudes and spectroscopic redshift. The model (DBk) and the
number of classes (12) were established based on the joint analysis of standard statistical criteria
and confirmed by the analysis of the galaxy distribution with respect to a number of classes and their
properties. This new approach allows us to classify galaxies based just on their redshifts and UV-NIR
spectral energy distributions. The FEM unsupervised algorithm has automatically distinguished
12 classes: 11 classes of VIPERS galaxies and an additional class of broad-line AGNs. After a first
broad division into blue, green and red categories we obtained a further sub-division into three
red, three green, and five blue galaxy classes. The FEM classes follow the galaxy sequence from the
earliest to the latest types that is reflected in their colours (which are constructed from rest-frame
magnitudes used in classification procedure) but also their morphological, physical, and spectroscopic
properties (not included in the classification scheme). We demonstrate that the members of each
class share similar physical and spectral properties. In particular, we are able to find three different
classes of red passive galaxy populations. Thus, we demonstrate the potential of an unsupervised
approach to galaxy classification and we retrieve the complexity of galaxy populations at z~0.7,
a task that usual simpler colour-based approaches cannot fulfil.
