Wojtak {\it et al} have stacked 7,800 clusters from the SDSS survey in redshift space. They find a
small net blue-shift for the cluster galaxies relative to the brightest cluster galaxies, which
agrees quite well with the gravitational redshift from GR. Zhao {\it et al.} have pointed out that,
in addition to the gravitational redshift, one would expect to see transverse Doppler (TD) redshifts,
and that these two effects are generally of the same order. Here we show that there are other corrections
that are also of the same order of magnitude. The fact that we observe galaxies on our past light cone
results in a bias such that more of the galaxies observed are moving away from us in the frame of the
cluster than are moving towards us. This causes the observed average redshift to be $\langle \delta
z \rangle = -\langle \Phi \rangle + \langle \beta^2 \rangle / 2 + \langle \beta_x^2 \rangle$, with
$\beta_x$ is the line of sight velocity. That is if we average over galaxies with equal weight. If
the galaxies in each cluster are weighted by their fluence, or equivalently if we do not resolve the
moving sources, and make an average of the mean redshift giving equal weight per photon, the observed
redshift is then opposite to the usual transverse Doppler effect. In the WHH experiment, the weighting
is a step-function because of the flux-limit for inclusion in the spectroscopic sample and the result
is different again, and depends on the details of the luminosity function and the SEDs of the galaxies.
Including these effects substantially modifies the blue-shift profile. We identify some potential
biases in the dynamical analysis of stacked clusters. We show that in-fall and out-flow have very
small effect over the relevant range of impact parameters.
