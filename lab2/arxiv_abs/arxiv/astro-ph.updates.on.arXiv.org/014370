Low-luminosity type II supernovae (LL SNe~II) make up the low explosion energy end of core-collapse
SNe, but their study and physical understanding remain limited. We present SN\,2016aqf, a LL SN~II
with extensive spectral and photometric coverage. We measure a $V$-band peak magnitude of $-14.58$\,mag,
a plateau duration of $\sim$100\,days, and an inferred $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.008 \pm 0.002$\,\msun.
The peak bolometric luminosity, L$_{\rm bol} \approx 10^{41.4}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, and its spectral
evolution is typical of other SNe in the class. Using our late-time spectra, we measure the [\ion{O}{i}]
$\lambda\lambda6300, 6364$ lines, which we compare against SN II spectral synthesis models to
constrain the progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass. We find this to be 12 $\pm$ 3\,\msun. Our
extensive late-time spectral coverage of the [\ion{Fe}{ii}] $\lambda7155$ and [\ion{Ni}{ii}]
$\lambda7378$ lines permits a measurement of the Ni/Fe abundance ratio, a parameter sensitive
to the inner progenitor structure and explosion mechanism dynamics. We measure a constant abundance
ratio evolution of $0.081^{+0.009}_{-0.010}$, and argue that the best epochs to measure the ratio
are at $\sim$200 -- 300\,days after explosion. We place this measurement in the context of a large
sample of SNe II and compare against various physical, light-curve and spectral parameters, in
search of trends which might allow indirect ways of constraining this ratio. We do not find correlations
predicted by theoretical models; however, this may be the result of the exact choice of parameters
and explosion mechanism in the models, the simplicity of them and/or primordial contamination
in the measured abundance ratio.
