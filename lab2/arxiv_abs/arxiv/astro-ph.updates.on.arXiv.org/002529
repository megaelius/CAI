A systematic investigation on the third dredge up in a 3M$_{\odot}$, solar metallicity AGB star
will be presented. The model evolves from the main sequence up to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB).
Intermediate mass stars are important because they contribute significantly via the slow neutron
capture nucleosynthesis. The aim of this work is to gain insight on the behaviour of the AGB star during
thermal pulsation. This investigation is based on an extended numerical simulation of the evolutionary
phases and full, consistent AGB model calculations. In particular, the convective structure during
pulsation will be studied, giving particular emphasis to the analysis of the stability of the Schwarzschild
boundary that will eventually determine the occurrence of Third Dredge Up (hereafter referred
to as TDUP). We provide a brief description of our updated evolutionary code and focus primarily
on the obtaining the TDUP after 14 thermal pulses. We elaborate on the non-standard treatment of
convection known as "overshooting" and its efficiency in achieving the TDUP event associated with
the thermal pulsations (helium shell flashes). However, our knowledge of the physics behind the
TDUP event, and the theoretical description of the overshooting mechanism suffer from embarrassing
gaps and are, therefore, not properly treated in stellar modelling. This is not surprising, particularly
with the oversimplified descriptions of important mixing mechanisms like convection in stellar
models. However, since such event drives the $^{13}$C nucleosynthesis of interest for the following
s-process activation, we present a full assessment of this process and its implications as calculations
will further proceed in different directions.
