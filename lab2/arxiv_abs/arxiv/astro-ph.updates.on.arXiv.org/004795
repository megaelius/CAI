R Aqr is a symbiotic binary system consisting of a Mira variable with a pulsation period of 387 days
and a hot companion which is presumably a white dwarf with an accretion disk. This binary system is
the source of a prominent bipolar gaseous outflow. We use high spatial resolution and sensitive
images from the Hubble Space Telescope to identify and investigate the different structural components
that form the complex morphology of the R Aqr jet . Methods. We present new high-resolution HST WFC3/UVIS
narrow-band images of the R Aqr jet obtained in 2013/14 in the light of the [OIII] 5007, [OI] 6300,
[NII] 6583, and Ha emission lines. These images also allow us to produce detailed maps of the jet flow
in several line ratios such as [OIII]/[OI] and [NII]/[OI] which are sensitive to the outflow temperature
and its hydrogen ionisation fraction. The new emission maps together with archival HST data are
used to derive and analyse the proper motion of prominent emitting features which can be traced over
20 years with the HST observations. The images reveal the fine gas structure of the jet out to distances
of a few ten arcseconds from the central region, as well as in the innermost region, within a few arcseconds
around the stellar source. They reveal for the first time the straight highly-collimated jet component
which can be traced to up to 900 AU in the NE direction. Images in [OIII], [OI], and [NII] clearly show
a helical pattern in the jet beams which may derive from the small-scale precession of the jet. The
highly-collimated jet is accompanied by a wide opening angle outflow which is filled by low excitation
gas. The position angles of the jet structures as well as their opening angles are calculated. Our
measurements of the proper motions of some prominent emission knots confirm the scenario of gas
acceleration during the propagation of the outflow.
