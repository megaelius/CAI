We used data from the WMAP satellite at 23, 33 and 41 GHz to study the diffuse polarised emission over
the entire sky. This emission is due to synchrotron radiation and it originates mostly from filamentary
structures with well-ordered magnetic fields. Some of these structures have been known for decades
in radio continuum maps: the 'radio loops', with the North Polar Spur being the most studied. The
origin of these filaments is not clear and there are many filaments that are visible for the first
time with these polarisation data. We have identified 11 filaments and studied their observational
properties. We find that the polarisation spectral indices, averaged over 18 regions in the sky
is $\beta = -3.06 \pm 0.02$, which is consistent with synchrotron radiation, although there are
significant variations in $\beta$ over the sky ($\Delta\beta\approx0.2$). The polarisation
fraction of some of the filaments can be as high as 40%, which is a signature of a well ordered magnetic
field. We explore the link between the large-scale filaments and the local ISM, using the model of
an expanding shell in the vicinity of the Sun. We compared the observed polarisation angles with
the predictions from the model and found good agreement over most of the sky. We also studied the level
of contamination added by the diffuse filaments to the CMB E- and B-modes power spectra. We find that
the power measured at low $\ell$ of the B-mode spectrum is $\sim10$ times larger than the power measured
after masking the filaments from the maps. We conclude that, even though these filaments present
low radio brightness, a careful removal will be necessary for future all-sky CMB polarisation analysis.
