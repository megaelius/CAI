We present self-consistent radiation hydrodynamic simulations of hydrogen reionization performed
with Arepo-RT complemented by a state-of-the-art galaxy formation model. We examine how photoheating
feedback, due to reionization, shapes the galaxies properties. Our fiducial model completes reionization
by $z\approx6$ and matches observations of the Ly$\alpha$ forest, the CMB electron scattering
optical depth, the high-redshift UV luminosity function, and stellar mass function. Contrary
to previous works, photoheating suppresses star formation rates by more than $50\%$ only in halos
less massive than $\sim10^{8.4}\ M_\odot$ ($\sim10^{8.8}\ M_\odot$) at $z=6$ $(z=5)$, suggesting
inefficient photoheating feedback from photons within galaxies. The use of a uniform UV background
that heats up the gas at $z\approx10.7$ generates an earlier onset of suppression of star formation
compared to our fiducial model. This discrepancy can be mitigated by adopting a UV background model
with a more realistic reionization history. In the absence of stellar feedback, photoheating alone
is only able to quench halos less massive than $\sim10^9\ M_\odot$ at $z\gtrsim5$, implying that
photoheating feedback is sub-dominant in regulating star formation. In addition, stellar feedback,
implemented as a non-local galactic wind scheme in the simulations, weakens the strength of photoheating
feedback by reducing the amount of stellar sources. Most importantly, photoheating does not leave
observable imprints in the UV luminosity function, stellar mass function, or the cosmic star formation
rate density. The feasibility of using these observables to detect imprints of reionization therefore
requires further investigation.
