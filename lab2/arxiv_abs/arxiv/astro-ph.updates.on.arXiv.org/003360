We analyzed the high-resolution spectra of a large sample of AGB and RGB stars in the Galactic globular
clusters (GCs) NGC 104, NGC 6121, and NGC 6809 obtained with FLAMES/GIRAFFE at ESO/VLT, and determined
their Na abundances. This is the first time that the AGB stars in NGC 6809 are targeted. Moreover,
we reanalyzed with the same method the data archive for NGC 6752. To investigate the dependence of
AGB Na abundance dispersion on GC parameters, we compared the AGB [Na/H] distributions we obtained
(including NGC 2808 presented in the first paper of this series) with literature data for four other
GCs, i.e., a total of nine GCs, covering a wide range of GC parameters. We find that NGC 104 and NG 6809
have comparable AGB and RGB Na abundance distributions revealed by the K-S test, while NGC 6121 shows
a lack of very Na-rich AGB star. By analyzing all the nine GCs, the Na abundances and multiple populations
of AGB stars show a complex picture. In some GCs, AGB stars have similar Na abundances and/or second-population
fractions as their RGB counterparts, while some GCs do not have Na-rich second-population AGB star,
and various cases exist between the two extremes. In addition, the fitted relations between fractions
of AGB second population and GC global parameters show that AGB second-population fraction slightly
anticorrelates with GC central concentration, while no robust dependency can be confirmed with
other GC parameters. Current data roughly support the prediction of FRMS scenario. However, considering
the weak observational and theoretical trends where scatter and exceptions exist, the fraction
of second-population AGB stars can be affected by more than one or two factors, and may even be a result
of stochasticity.
