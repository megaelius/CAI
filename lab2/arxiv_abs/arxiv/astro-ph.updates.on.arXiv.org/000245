We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies
to z = 4 using a sample of 95 675 galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. Sources have been selected
from the DR1 UltraVISTA K_{s}-band imaging which covers a unique combination of a wide area (1.62
deg^2), to a significant depth (K_{s,tot} = 23.4). The SMFs of the combined population are in good
agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was
only 50%, 10% and 1% of its current value at z ~ 1.0, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population
drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing by
2.71^{+0.93}_{-0.22} dex since z = 3.5. At z > 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total
SMF at all stellar masses, although a nonzero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4.
Comparisons of the K_{s}-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs to UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 < z <
4 show reasonable agreement and suggests UV-selected samples are representative of the majority
of the stellar mass density at z > 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies
by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with Log(M_{*}/M_{sun})
= 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0(3.5), whereas those with Log(M_{*}/M_{sun})
= 10.5 have grown by > 1.0 dex since z = 2. At z < 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always
larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that
redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic
uncertainties on the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, SPS modeling, and the definition
of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.
