High-redshift galaxy clusters, unlike local counterparts, show diverse star formation activities.
However, it is still unclear what keeps some of the high-redshift clusters active in star formation.
To address this issue, we performed a multi-object spectroscopic (MOS) observation of 226 high-redshift
(0.8 < z < 1.3) galaxies in galaxy cluster candidates and the areas surrounding them. Our spectroscopic
observation reveals six to eight clusters/groups at z ~ 0.9 and z ~ 1.3. The redshift measurements
demonstrate the reliability of our photometric redshift measurements, which in turn gives credibility
for using photometric redshift members for the analysis of large-scale structures (LSSs). Our
investigation of the large-scale environment (~10 Mpc) surrounding each galaxy cluster reveals
LSSs --- structures up to ~10 Mpc scale --- around many of, but not all, the confirmed overdensities
and the cluster candidates. We investigate the correlation between quiescent galaxy fraction
of galaxy overdensities and their surrounding LSSs, with a larger sample of ~ 20 overdensities including
photometrically selected overdensities at 0.6 < z < 0.9. Interestingly, galaxy overdensities
embedded within these extended LSSs show a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies (~ 20 %) than isolated
ones at similar redshifts (with a quiescent galaxy fraction of ~ 50 %). Furthermore, we find a possible
indication that clusters/groups with a high quiescent galaxy fraction are more centrally concentrated.
Based on these results, we suggest that LSSs are the main reservoirs of gas and star-forming galaxies
to keep galaxy clusters fresh and extended in size at z ~ 1.
