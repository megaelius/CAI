Studies based on Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$) photometry in F275W, F336W, and F438W have shown
that the incidence and complexity of multiple populations (MPs) in Globular Clusters (GCs) depend
on cluster mass. This result, however, is based on nearby, low-reddening Galactic GCs, for which
we can obtain accurate F275W photometry. In this work we exploit $HST$ photometry in F336W, F438W,
and F814W to characterize MPs in 68 Galactic and extragalactic GCs by using the pseudo-color $C_{F336W,F438W,F814W}$,
which is more efficient in terms of observation time than the pseudo-color $C_{F275W,F336W,F438W}$
adopted in previous works. We first analyzed the Galactic GCs alone and find that the RGB color width
strongly correlates with [Fe/H]. After removing the dependence from metallicity, we obtain a strong
correlation with cluster mass, thus confirming previous findings. We then exploited the RGB width
to compare MPs in Galactic and extragalactic GCs. Similarly to Galactic GCs, the RGB width of Magellanic
Cloud GCs correlates with clusters mass, after removing the dependence from metallicity. This
fact demonstrates that cluster mass is the main factor affecting the properties of MPs. Magellanic
Cloud clusters exhibit, on average, narrower RGBs than Galactic GCs with similar mass and metallicity.
We suggest that this difference is a signature of stellar mass loss in Galactic GCs. As an alternative,
the mass-RGB-width relation would depend on the host galaxy. Finally, we used ground-based photometry
to investigate Terzan\,7 through the $C_{U,B,I}$ pseudo-color, ground-based analogous of $C_{F336W,F438W,F814W}$,
and find that this cluster is consistent with a simple population.
