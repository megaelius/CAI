The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), a member of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard
and Smithsonian, is in discussions with the Space Applications Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space
Research Organization (ISRO) and its partners in the newly formed Indian Sub-millimetre-wave
Astronomy Alliance (ISAA), to collaborate in the construction of a sub-millimeter-wave astronomy
observatory in the high altitude deserts of the Himalayas, initially at the 4500 m Indian Astronomical
Observatory, Hanle. Two primary science goals are targeted. One is the mapping of the distribution
of neutral atomic carbon, and the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule in higher energy states, in large
parts of the Milky Way, and in selected external galaxies. Such studies would advance our understanding
of molecular hydrogen present in the interstellar medium, but partly missed by existing observations;
and characterize Galaxy-wide molecular cloud excitation conditions, through multi-level CO
observations. Stars form in interstellar clouds of molecular gas and dust, and these observations
would allow research into the formation and destruction processes of such molecular clouds and
the life cycle of galaxies. As the second goal, the observatory would add a new location to the global
Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) network, which lacks a station in the Himalayan longitudes. This
addition would enhance the quality of the images synthesized by the EHT, support observations in
higher sub-millimeter wave bands, sharpening its resolving ability, improve its dynamic imaging
capability and add weather resilience to observing campaigns. In the broader context, this collaboration
can be a starting point for a wider, mutually beneficial scientific exchange between the Indian
and US astronomy communities, including a potential future EHT space component.
