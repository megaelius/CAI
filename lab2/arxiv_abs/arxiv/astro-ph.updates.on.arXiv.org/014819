Mergers can be detected as double-peak narrow emission line galaxies but they are difficult to disentangle
from disc rotations and gas outflows. We aim to properly detect such galaxies and distinguish the
underlying mechanisms. Relying on RCSED, we developed an automated selection procedure and found
5663 double-peak emission line galaxies at z<0.34 corresponding to 0.8% of the parent database.
To characterise these galaxies, we built a single-peak no-bias control sample (NBCS) with the same
redshift and stellar mass distributions as the double-peak sample (DPS). These two samples are
indeed very similar in terms of absolute magnitude, [OIII] luminosity, colour-colour diagrams,
age and specific star formation rate, metallicity, and environment. We find an important excess
of S0 galaxies in the DPS, not observed in the NBCS, and which cannot be accounted for by the environment,
as most of these galaxies are isolated or in poor groups. Similarly, we find a relative deficit of
pure discs in the DPS late-type galaxies, that are preferentially of Sa type. In parallel, we observe
a systematic central excess of star formation and extinction for DP galaxies. Finally, there are
noticeable differences in the kinematics: the gas velocity dispersion is correlated with the galaxy
inclination in the NBCS, whereas this relation does not hold for the DPS. Furthermore, the DP galaxies
show larger stellar velocity dispersions and they deviate from the Tully-Fisher relation for both
late-type and S0 galaxies. These discrepancies can be reconciled if one considers the two peaks
as two different components. Considering the morphological biases in favour, bulge-dominated
galaxies and star-formation central enhancement, we suggest a scenario of multiple sequential
minor mergers driving the increase of the bulge size, leading to larger fractions of S0 galaxies
and a deficit of pure disc galaxies.
