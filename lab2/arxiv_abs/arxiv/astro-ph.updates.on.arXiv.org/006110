We present results from an ongoing investigation using the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) on the VLT Survey
Telescope (VST) to provide a census of ultra-compact massive galaxies (UCMGs), defined as galaxies
with stellar masses $M_{\rm \star} > 8 \times 10^{10} \rm M_{\rm \odot}$ and effective radii $R_{\rm
e} < 1.5\,\rm kpc$. Old UCMGs, which are expected to have undergone very few merger events, provide
a unique view on the accretion history of the most massive galaxies in the Universe, allowing to constrain
the rate of merging predicted by numerical simulations. Over an effective sky area of nearly 330
square degrees, we select UCMG candidates from the KiDS multi-colour images, which provide high
quality structural parameters and stellar masses, as well as precise photometric redshifts from
machine learning techniques. Spectroscopic redshifts are then required to validate UCMG candidates.
Here we describe a programme designed to obtain these redshifts using different facilities, starting
with first results for 28 galaxies with redshifts $z < 0.5$, obtained at NTT and TNG telescopes. We
confirmed, as bona fide UCMGs, 19 out of the 28 candidates with new redshifts, whereas a further 46
UCMG candidates are confirmed with literature redshifts (35 at $z<0.5$). The sample of 63 lower-z
galaxies is the largest at redshifts below 0.5, and it includes the first UCMGs discovered in the
Southern Hemisphere, outside the area covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We also use the spectroscopic
redshifts to quantify systematic errors in the candidate selection based on the KiDS photometric
redshifts, and use these to correct our UCMG number counts. We finally compare the results to independent
datasets and simulations. Our sample of 1000 photometrically selected UCMGs at $z < 0.5$ represents
the largest sample of UCMG candidates assembled to date over the largest sky area.
