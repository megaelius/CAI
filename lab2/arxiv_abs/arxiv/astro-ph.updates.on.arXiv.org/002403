[Abridged] We consider how galaxy clustering data, from Mpc to Gpc scales, from upcoming large scale
structure surveys, such as Euclid and DESI, can provide discriminating information about the bispectrum
shape arising from a variety of inflationary scenarios. Through exploring in detail the weighting
of shape properties in the calculation of the halo bias and halo mass function we show how they probe
a broad range of configurations, beyond those in the squeezed limit, that can help distinguish between
shapes with similar large scale bias behaviors. We assess the impact, on constraints for a diverse
set of non-Gaussian shapes, of galaxy clustering information in the mildly non-linear regime,
and surveys that span multiple redshifts and employ different galactic tracers of the dark matter
distribution. Fisher forecasts are presented for a Euclid-like spectroscopic survey of H$\alpha$-selected
emission line galaxies (ELGs) using recent revisions of the expected H$\alpha$ luminosity function,
and a DESI-like survey, of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and [O-II] doublet-selected ELGs, in combination
with Planck-like CMB temperature and polarization data. While ELG samples provide better probes
of shapes that are divergent in the squeezed limit, LRG constraints, centered below $z<1$, yield
stronger constraints on shapes with scale-independent large-scale halo biases, such as the equilateral
template. The ELG and LRG samples provide complementary degeneracy directions for distinguishing
between different shapes. If the Gaussian galaxy bias is constrained to better than a percent level,
such as can be determined from the galaxy bispectrum or weak lensing, then the LSS and CMB data could
provide complementary constraints that will enable differentiation of bispectra with distinct
theoretical origins but with similar large scale, squeezed-limit properties.
