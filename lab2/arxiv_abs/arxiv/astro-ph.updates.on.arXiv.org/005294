Time-dependent and systematic variations in band gain and central frequencies of instruments
used to study the Cosmic Microwave Background are important factors in the data-to-map analysis
pipeline. If not properly characterized, they could limit the ability of next-generation experiments
to remove astrophysical foreground contamination. Uncertainties include the instrument detector
band, which could systematically change across the focal plane, as well as the calibration of the
instrument used to measure the bands. A potentially major effect is time-dependent gain and band
uncertainties caused by atmospheric fluctuations. More specifically, changes in atmospheric
conditions lead to frequency-dependent changes in the atmospheric transmission which, in turn,
leads to variations in the effective gain and central frequency of the instrument's bandpass. Using
atmospheric modeling software and ACTPol bandpasses, we simulate the expected variations in band
gain and central frequency for 20, 40, 90, 150, and 240 GHz bands as a function of precipitable water
vapor, observing angle, and ground temperature. Combining these effects enables us to set maximum
and minimum limits on the expected uncertainties in band gain and central frequency over the course
of a full observing season. We then introduce the uncertainties to parametric maximum-likelihood
component separation methods on simulated CMB maps to forecast foreground removal performance
and likelihoods on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We conclude that to measure a $\sigma(r=0)$ ~ $10^{-3}$
with a bias on the recovered $r$ under control, the limit on the uncertainty in the relative gain and
central frequency of the bandpass must be <2% and <1%, respectively. We also comment on the possibility
of self-calibrating bandpass uncertainties.
