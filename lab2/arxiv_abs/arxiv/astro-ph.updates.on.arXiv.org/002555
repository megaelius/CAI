We explore the distribution of cool (~$10^4$K) gas around galaxies and its dependence on galaxy
properties. By cross-correlating about 50,000 MgII absorbers with millions of sources from the
SDSS (optical), WISE (IR), and GALEX (UV) surveys we effectively extract about 2,000 galaxy-absorber
pairs at z~0.5 and probe relations between absorption strength and galaxy type, impact parameter
and azimuthal angle. We find that cool gas traced by MgII absorbers exists around both star-forming
and passive galaxies with a similar incidence rate on scales greater than 100 kpc but each galaxy
type exhibits a different behavior on smaller scales: MgII equivalent width does not correlate
with the presence of passive galaxies whereas stronger MgII absorbers tend to be found in the vicinity
of star-forming galaxies. This effect is preferentially seen along the minor axis of these galaxies,
suggesting that some of the gas is associated with outflowing material. In contrast, the distribution
of cool gas around passive galaxies is consistent with being isotropic on the same scales. We quantify
the average excess MgII equivalent width $<\delta W_{0}^{\rm MgII}>$ as a function of galaxy
properties and find $<\delta W_0^{\rm MgII}>\propto SFR^{1.2}, sSFR^{0.5}$ and $M_\ast^{0.4}$
for star-forming galaxies. This work demonstrates that the dichotomy between star-forming and
passive galaxies is reflected in the CGM traced by low-ionized gas. We also measure the covering
fraction of MgII absorption and find it to be about 2-10 times higher for star-forming galaxies than
passive ones within 50 kpc. We estimate the amount of neutral gas in the halo of $<\log M_\ast/{\rm
M_\odot}>$~10.8 galaxies to be a few x$10^9 \rm M_\odot$ for both types of galaxies. Finally,
we find that correlations between absorbers and sources detected in the UV and IR lead to physical
trends consistent with those measured in the optical.
