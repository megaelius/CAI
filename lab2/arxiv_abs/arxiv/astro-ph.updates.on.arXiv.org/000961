In this paper we study current accumulations in 3D "tilted" nulls formed by a folding of the spine
and fan. A non-zero component of current parallel to the fan is required such that the null's fan plane
and spine are not perpendicular. Our aims are to provide valid magnetohydrostatic equilibria and
to describe the current accumulations in various cases involving finite plasma pressure.To create
our equilibrium current structures we use a full, non-resistive, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code
so that no reconnection is allowed. A series of experiments are performed in which a perturbed 3D
tilted null relaxes towards an equilibrium via real, viscous damping forces. Changes to the initial
plasma pressure and to magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.An initially tilted
fan is associated with a non-zero Lorentz force that drives the fan and spine to collapse towards
each other, in a similar manner to the collapse of a 2D X-point. In the final equilibrium state for
an initially radial null with only the current perpendicular to the spine, the current concentrates
along the tilt axis of the fan and in a layer about the null point with a sharp peak at the null itself.
The continued growth of this peak indicates that the system is in an asymptotic regime involving
an infinite time singularity at the null. When the initial tilt disturbance (current perpendicular
to the spine) is combined with a spiral-type disturbance (current parallel to the spine), the final
current density concentrates in three regions: one on the fan along its tilt axis and two around the
spine, above and below the fan. The increased area of current accumulation leads to a weakening of
the singularity formed at the null. The 3D spine-fan collapse with generic current studied here
provides the ideal setup for non-steady reconnection studies.
