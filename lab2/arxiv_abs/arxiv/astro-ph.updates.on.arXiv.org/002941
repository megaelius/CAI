Aims. HD166734 is an eccentric eclipsing binary system composed of two supergiant O-type stars,
orbiting with a 34.5-day period. In this rare configuration for such stars, the two objects mainly
evolve independently, following single-star evolution so far. This system provides a chance to
study the individual parameters of two supergiant massive stars and to derive their real masses.
Methods. An intensive monitoring was dedicated to HD166734.We analyzed mid- and high-resolution
optical spectra to constrain the orbital parameters of this system. We also studied its light curve
for the first time, obtained in the VRI filters. Finally, we disentangled the spectra of the two stars
and modeled them with the CMFGEN atmosphere code in order to determine the individual physical parameters.
Results. HD166734 is a O7.5If+O9I(f) binary. We confirm its orbital period but we revise the other
orbital parameters. In comparison to what we found in the literature, the system is more eccentric
and, now, the hottest and the most luminous component is also the most massive one. The light curve
exhibits only one eclipse and its analysis indicates an inclination of 63.0{\deg} $\pm$ 2.7{\deg}.
The photometric analysis provides us with a good estimation of the luminosities of the stars, and
therefore their exact positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The evolutionary and the
spectroscopic masses show good agreement with the dynamical masses of 39.5 Msun for the primary
and 33.5 Msun for the secondary, within the uncertainties. The two components are both enriched
in helium and in nitrogen and depleted in carbon. In addition, the primary also shows a depletion
in oxygen. Their surface abundances are however not different from those derived from single supergiant
stars, yielding, for both components, an evolution similar to that of single stars.
