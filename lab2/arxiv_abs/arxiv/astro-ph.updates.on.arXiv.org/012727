Quenched galaxies are often observed to contain a strong bulge component. It is an important open
question whether this reflects a causal connection - can star formation be quenched dynamically
by bulges or the spheroids of early-type galaxies? We systematically investigate the impact of
these morphological components on star formation, by performing hydrodynamical simulations
of a sample of isolated galaxies containing a spheroid. We vary the bulge mass and scale radius, while
the total initial stellar, gas and halo mass are kept constant. In addition, we consider two different
sub-grid star formation prescriptions. The first follows most simulations in the literature by
assuming a constant star formation efficiency per free-fall time, whereas in the second model it
depends on the gas virial parameter, following recent high-resolution simulations of turbulent
fragmentation. Across all simulations, we find that central spheroids increase the gas velocity
dispersion towards the galactic centre. This increases the gravitational stability of the gas
disc, suppresses fragmentation and star formation, and results in galaxies hosting extremely
smooth and quiescent gas discs that fall below the galaxy main sequence. These effects amplify when
using the more sophisticated, dynamics-dependent star formation model. Finally, we discover
a pronounced relation between the central stellar surface density and star formation rate (SFR),
such that the most bulge-dominated galaxies show the strongest deviation from the main sequence.
We conclude that the SFR of galaxies is not only set by the balance between accretion and feedback,
but carries a (sometimes dominant) dependence on the gravitational potential.
