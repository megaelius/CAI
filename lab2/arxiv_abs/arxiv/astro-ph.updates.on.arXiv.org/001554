[abbreviated] I describe the evolution of limited duration energy injection blast waves and their
transition stage, with an emphasis on the optical / X-ray plateau phase of Gamma-ray Burst (GRB)
afterglows as an application. A complete fluid profile during injection including the reverse
shock region is given. The transition is shown with one-dimensional simulations of radial flow
to take about a sound crossing time. While energy injection is ongoing, the sideways flux of energy
due to jet expansion usually lies orders of magnitude below the injected energy, causing the flow
to remain approximately radial. For synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated particles,
the resulting flux equations are provided for general circumburst medium structure. The relative
flux between forward and reverse shock region depends on their respective magnetizations and the
Lorentz factor of the inflowing matter from the source, but for typical afterglow values it is shown
that emission from the reverse shock can easily dominate, especially when different degrees of
magnetization for both regions are taken into account. After energy injection has ceased, the post-plateau
flux will steepen while the reverse shock region dissipates, and drop to the flux level predicted
for impulsive injection. Reverse shock emission supports the observational F-t correlation between
flux and time at the end of the GRB afterglow plateau phase. During energy injection, the synchrotron
injection break for the reverse shock region is shifted to high frequencies due to its strong dependence
on the Lorentz factor of the inflowing relativistic wind. These effects are illustrated for typical
afterglow values and the specific cases of short GRBs 090515 and 120521A.
