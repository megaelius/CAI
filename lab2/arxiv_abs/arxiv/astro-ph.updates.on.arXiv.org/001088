We present HST/WFC3 narrow-band imaging of the starburst galaxy M83 targeting the hydrogen recombination
lines (H$\beta$, H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$), which we use to investigate the dust extinction in the
HII regions. We derive extinction maps with 6 parsec spatial resolution from two combinations of
hydrogen lines (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$/Pa$\beta$), and show that the longer wavelengths
probe larger optical depths, with $A_V$ values larger by $\gtrsim$1 mag than those derived from
the shorter wavelengths. This difference leads to a factor $\gtrsim$2 discrepancy in the extinction-corrected
H$\alpha$ luminosity, a significant effect when studying extragalactic HII regions. By comparing
these observations to a series of simple models, we conclude that a large diversity of absorber/emitter
geometric configurations can account for the data, implying a more complex physical structure
than the classical foreground "dust screen" assumption. However, most data points are bracketed
by the foreground screen and a model where dust and emitters are uniformly mixed. When averaged over
large ($\gtrsim$100--200 pc) scales, the extinction becomes consistent with a "dust screen",
suggesting that other geometries tend to be restricted to more local scales. Moreover, the extinction
in any region can be described by a combination of the foreground screen and the uniform mixture model
with weights of 1/3 and 2/3 in the center ($\lesssim$2 kpc), respectively, and 2/3 and 1/3 for the
rest of the disk. This simple prescription significantly improves the accuracy of the dust extinction
corrections and can be especially useful for pixel-based analyses of galaxies similar to M83.
