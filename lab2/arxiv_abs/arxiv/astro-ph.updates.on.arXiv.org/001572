We want to estimate whether the positrons produced by the beta plus decay of 26Al, 44Ti and 56Ni synthesised
in massive stars and supernovae are sufficient to explain the 511 keV annihilation emission observed
in our Galaxy. Such a possibility has often been put forward in the past. We developed a Monte Carlo
Galactic propagation code for ~MeV positrons in which the Galactic interstellar medium, the Galactic
magnetic field (GMF) and the propagation are finely described. This code allows us to simulate the
spatial distribution of the 511 keV annihilation emission. We test several GMFs models and several
positron escape fractions from type-Ia supernova for 56Ni positrons. We consider the collisional
ballistic transport mode and then compare the simulated 511 keV intensity spatial distributions
to the INTEGRAL/SPI data. Whatever the GMF configuration and the escape fraction chosen for 56Ni
positrons, the 511 keV intensity distributions are very similar. The main reason is that ~MeV positrons
do not propagate very far away from their birth sites in our model. The direct comparison to the data
does not allow us to constrain the GMF configuration and the escape fraction for 56Ni positrons.
In any case, nucleosynthesis positrons produced in steady state cannot explain the full annihilation
emission. The comparison to the data shows that: (a) the annihilation emission from the Galactic
disk can be accounted for; (b) the strongly peaked annihilation emission from the inner Galactic
bulge can be explained by positrons annihilating in the central molecular zone but this seems to
require more positron sources than the population of massive stars and type Ia supernovae usually
assumed for this region; (c) the more extended emission from the Galactic bulge cannot be explained.
We show that a transient source at the GC, such as a starburst episode, could explain this extended
component.
