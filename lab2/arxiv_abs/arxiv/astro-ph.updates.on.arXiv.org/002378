We present a numerical study in resistive magnetohydrodynamics where the initial equilibrium
configuration contains adjacent, oppositely directed, parallel current channels. Since oppositely
directed current channels repel, the equilibrium is liable to an ideal magnetohydrodynamic tilt
instability. This tilt evolution, previously studied in planar settings, involves two magnetic
islands or fluxropes, which on Alfvenic timescales undergo a combined rotation and separation.
This in turn leads to the creation of (near) singular current layers, posing severe challenges to
numerical approaches. Using our open-source grid-adaptive MPI-AMRVAC software, we revisit the
planar evolution case in compressible MHD, as well as its extension to 2.5D and full 3D scenarios.
As long as the third dimension remains ignorable, pure tilt evolutions result which are hardly affected
by out of plane magnetic field components. In all 2.5D runs, our simulations do show secondary tearing
type disruptions throughout the near singular current sheets in the far nonlinear saturation regime.
In full 3D, both current channels can be liable to additional ideal kink deformations. We discuss
the effects of having both tilt and kink instabilities acting simultaneously in the violent, reconnection
dominated evolution. In 3D, both the tilt and the kink instabilities can be stabilized by tension
forces. As a concrete space plasma application, we argue that interacting tilt-kink instabilities
in repelling current channels provide a novel route to initiate solar coronal mass ejections, distinctly
different from currently favored pure kink or torus instability routes.
