We have performed a census of the UV-bright population in 78 globular clusters using wide-field
UV telescopes. This population includes a variety of phases of post-horizontal branch (HB) evolution,
including hot post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-early AGB stars. There are indications
that old stellar systems like globular clusters produce fewer post-(early) AGB stars than currently
predicted by evolutionary models, but observations are still scarce. We obtained FORS2 spectroscopy
of eleven of these UV-selected objects (covering a range of -2.3<[Fe/H]<-1.0), which we (re-)analysed
together with previously observed data. We used model atmospheres of different metallicities,
including super-solar ones. Where possible, we verified our atmospheric parameters using UV spectrophotometry
and searched for metal lines in the optical spectra. We calculated evolutionary sequences for four
metallicity regimes and used them together with information about the HB morphology of the globular
clusters to estimate the expected numbers of post-AGB stars. Seven of the eleven new luminous UV-bright
stars are post-AGB or post-early AGB stars, two are evolving away from the HB, one is a foreground
white dwarf, and one is a white dwarf merger. So spectroscopy is clearly required to identify the
evolutionary status of hot UV-bright stars. For hotter stars, metal-rich model spectra are required
to reproduce their optical and UV spectra, which may affect the flux contribution of hot post-AGB
stars to the UV spectra of evolved populations. Adding published information on other hot UV-bright
stars in globular clusters, we find that the number of observed hot post-AGB stars generally agrees
with the predicted values, although the numbers are still low.
