CEMP-no stars, a subclass of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, are one of the most significant
stellar populations in Galactic Archaeology, because they dominate the low end of the metallicity
distribution function, providing information on the early star-formation and chemical-evolution
history of the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies. Here we present an analysis of medium-resolution
($R \sim 1,800$) optical spectroscopy for a CEMP giant, SDSS J132755.56+333521.7, observed with
the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT), one of the brightest ($g \sim 20.5$) members of the classical
dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Canes Venatici I (CVn I). Many CEMP stars discovered to date have very cool
effective temperatures ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}< 4500$ K), resulting in strong veiling by molecular
carbon bands over their optical spectra at low/medium spectral resolution. We introduce a technique
to mitigate the carbon-veiling problem to obtain reliable stellar parameters, and validate this
method with the LBT medium-resolution optical spectra of the ultra metal-poor ([Fe/H] = $-4.0$)
CEMP-no dwarf, G 77-61, and seven additional very cool CEMP stars, which have published high-resolution
spectroscopic parameters. We apply this technique to the LBT spectrum of SDSS J132755.56+333521.7.
We find that this star is well-described with parameters $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=4530$ K, log $g=$ 0.7,
[Fe/H] $ = -3.38$, and absolute carbon abundance $A$(C) = 7.23, indicating that it is likely the first
Group III CEMP-no star identified in CVn I. The Group III identification of this star suggests that
it is a member of the extremely metal-poor population in CVn I, which may have been accreted into its
halo.
