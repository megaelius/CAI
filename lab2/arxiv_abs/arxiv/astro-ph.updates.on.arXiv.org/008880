We study the formation of the protoplanetary disk by the collapse of a primordial molecular cloud,
and how its evolution leads to the selection of specific types of planets. We use a hydrodynamical
code that accounts for the dynamics, thermodynamics, geometry, and composition of the disk to numerically
model its evolution as it is fed by the infalling cloud material. As the mass accretion rate of the
disk onto the star determines its growth, we can calculate the stellar characteristics by interpolating
its radius, luminosity, and temperature over the stellar mass from pre-calculated stellar evolution
models. The density and midplane temperature of the disk then allow us to model the interactions
between the disk and potential planets and determine their migration. At the end of the collapse
phase, when the disk reaches its maximum mass, it pursues its viscous spreading, similarly to the
evolution from a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN). In addition, we establish a timeline equivalence
between the MMSN and a "collapse-formed disk" that would be older by about 2 Myr. We can save various
types of planets from a fatal type-I inward migration: in particular, planetary embryos can avoid
falling on the star by becoming trapped at the heat transition barriers and at most sublimation lines
(except the silicates one). One of the novelties concerns the possible trapping of putative giant
planets around a few astronomical units from the star around the end of the infall. Moreover, trapped
planets may still follow the traps outward during the collapse phase and inward after it. Finally,
this protoplanetary disk formation model shows the early possibilities of trapping planetary
embryos at disk stages that are anterior by a few million years to the initial state of the MMSN approximation.
