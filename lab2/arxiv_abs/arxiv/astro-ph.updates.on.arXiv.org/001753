We describe redMaPPer, a new red-sequence cluster finder specifically designed to make optimal
use of ongoing and near-future large photometric surveys. The algorithm has multiple attractive
features: (1) It can iteratively self-train the red-sequence model based on minimal spectroscopic
training sample, an important feature for high redshift surveys; (2) It can handle complex masks
with varying depth; (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure
studies; (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z); (5) Similarly,
clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities;
(6) The algorithm is parallel and numerically efficient: it can run a Dark Energy Survey-like catalog
in ~500 CPU hours; (7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the
richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and
purity of the corresponding catalogs is superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to ~10,000 deg^2
of SDSS DR8 data, and present the resulting catalog of ~25,000 clusters over the redshift range 0.08<z<0.55.
The redMaPPer photometric redshifts are nearly Gaussian, with a scatter \sigma_z ~ 0.006 at z~0.1,
increasing to \sigma_z~0.02 at z~0.5 due to increased photometric noise near the survey limit.
The median value for |\Delta z|/(1+z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects
is low (<=5%). Detailed performance comparisons of the redMaPPer DR8 cluster catalog to X-ray
and SZ catalogs are presented in a companion paper (Rozo & Rykoff 2014).
