We present the results of 1D hydrodynamic simulations of coronal loops which are subject to nanoflares,
caused by either in-situ thermal heating, or non-thermal electrons (NTE) beams. The synthesized
intensity and Doppler shifts can be directly compared with IRIS and AIA observations of rapid variability
in the transition region (TR) of coronal loops, associated with transient coronal heating. We find
that NTE with high enough low-energy cutoff (E$_\textrm{C}$) deposit energy in the lower TR and
chromosphere causing blueshifts (up to~$\sim$~20 km/s) in the \emph{IRIS} \siiv~lines, which
thermal conduction cannot reproduce. The E$_\textrm{C}$ threshold value for the blueshifts depends
on the total energy of the events ($\approx$~5 keV for 10$^{24}$ ergs, up to 15 keV for 10$^{25}$ ergs).
The observed footpoint emission intensity and flows, combined with the simulations, can provide
constraints on both the energy of the heating event and E$_\textrm{C}$. The response of the loop
plasma to nanoflares depends crucially on the electron density: significant \siiv~intensity
enhancements and flows are observed only for initially low-density loops ($<$~10$^{9}$~cm$^{-3}$).
This provides a possible explanation of the relative scarcity of observations of significant moss
variability. While the TR response to single heating episodes can be clearly observed, the predicted
coronal emission (AIA 94\AA) for single strands is below current detectability, and can only be
observed when several strands are heated closely in time. Finally, we show that the analysis of the
IRIS \mgii~chromospheric lines can help further constrain the properties of the heating mechanisms.
