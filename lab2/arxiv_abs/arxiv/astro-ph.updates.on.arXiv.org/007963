The expansion history of the Universe can be constrained in a cosmology-independent way by measuring
the differential age evolution of cosmic chronometers. This yields a measurement of the Hubble
parameter $H(z)$ as a function of redshift. The most reliable cosmic chronometers known so far are
extremely massive and passively evolving galaxies. Age-dating these galaxies is, however, a difficult
task, and even a small contribution of an underlying young stellar population could, in principle,
affect the age estimate and its cosmological interpretation. We present several spectral indicators
to detect, quantify and constrain such contamination in old galaxies, and study how their combination
can be used to maximize the purity of cosmic chronometers selection. In particular, we analyze the
CaII H/K ratio, the presence (or absence) of H$\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines, higher order Balmer
absorption lines, and UV flux; each indicator is especially sensitive to a particular age range,
allowing us to detect young components ranging between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr. The combination of these
indicators minimizes the contamination to a level below 1% in the case of ideal data. More importantly,
it offers a way to control the systematic error on $H(z)$ as a function of the contamination by young
stellar populations. We show that for our previous measurements of the Hubble parameter, the possible
bias induced by the presence of a younger component is well below the current errors. We envision
that these indicators will be instrumental in paving the road for a robust and reliable dating of
the old population and its cosmological interpretation.
