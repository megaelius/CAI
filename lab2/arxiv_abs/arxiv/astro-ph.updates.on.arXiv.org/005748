The first 48-antenna stage of the Siberian Radioheliograph (SRH) started single-frequency test
observations early in 2016, and since August 2016 it routinely observes the Sun at several frequencies
in the 4-8 GHz range with an angular resolution of 1-2 arc minutes and an imaging interval of about
12 seconds. With limited opportunities of the incomplete antenna configuration, a high sensitivity
of about 100 Jy allows the SRH to contribute to the studies of eruptive phenomena along three lines.
First, some eruptions are directly visible in SRH images. Second, some small eruptions are detectable
even without a detailed imaging information from microwave depressions caused by screening the
background emission by cool erupted plasma. Third, SRH observations reveal new aspects of some
events to be studied with different instruments. We focus on an eruptive C2.2 flare on 16 March 2016
around 06:40, one of the first flares observed by the SRH. Proceeding from SRH observations, we analyze
this event using extreme-ultraviolet, hard X-ray, white-light, and metric radio data. An eruptive
prominence expanded, brightened, and twisted, which indicates a time-extended process of the
flux-rope formation together with the development of a large coronal mass ejection (CME). The observations
rule out a passive role of the prominence in the CME formation. The abrupt prominence eruption impulsively
excited a blast-wave-like shock, which appeared during the microwave burst and was manifested
in an "EUV wave" and Type II radio burst. The shock wave decayed and did not transform into a bow shock
because of the low speed of the CME. Nevertheless, this event produced a clear proton enhancement
near Earth. Comparison with our previous studies of several events confirms that the impulsive-piston
shock-excitation scenario is typical of various events.
