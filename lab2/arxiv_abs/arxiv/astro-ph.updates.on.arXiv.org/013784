We study the importance of gravitational lensing in the modelling of the number counts of galaxies.
We confirm previous results for photometric surveys, showing that lensing cannot be neglected
in a survey like LSST since it would infer a significant shift of cosmological parameters. For a spectroscopic
survey like SKA2, we find that neglecting lensing in the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole
of the correlation function also induces an important shift of parameters. For $\Lambda$CDM parameters,
the shift is moderate, of the order of $0.6\sigma$ or less. However, for a model-independent analysis,
that measures the growth rate of structure in each redshift bin, neglecting lensing introduces
a shift of up to $2.3\sigma$ at high redshift. Since the growth rate is directly used to test the theory
of gravity, such a strong shift would wrongly be interpreted as the breakdown of General Relativity.
This shows the importance of including lensing in the analysis of future surveys. On the other hand,
for a survey like DESI, we find that lensing is not important, mainly due to the value of the magnification
bias parameter of DESI, $s(z)$, which strongly reduces the lensing contribution at high redshift.
We also propose a way of improving the analysis of spectroscopic surveys, by including the cross-correlations
between different redshift bins (which is neglected in spectroscopic surveys) from the spectroscopic
survey or from a different photometric sample. We show that including the cross-correlations in
the SKA2 analysis does not improve the constraints. On the other hand replacing the cross-correlations
from SKA2 by cross-correlations measured with LSST improves the constraints by 10 to 20 %. Interestingly,
for $\Lambda$CDM parameters, we find that LSST and SKA2 are highly complementary, since they are
affected differently by degeneracies between parameters.
