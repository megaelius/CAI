The glaciological record of atmospheric composition suggests O2 has declined over the last 800000
years at an average rate of 0.3 x 1012 mol (Tmol) O2 yr-1. Because the geological carbon cycle regulates
long term atmospheric oxygen concentrations, fluctuations in atmospheric O2 are typically attributed
to an imbalance between the weathering of organic carbon (OC) and reduced sulfur on land, a sink of
atmospheric O2, and the burial of OC and reduced sulfur in marine sediments, a source of O2. Here we
compile and confront a database of C, Fe, S and H exchanges between the fluid Earth (atmosphere, ocean,
biosphere) and lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) with the record of deoxygenation to quantify
organic carbon sources and sinks in the Cenozoic. We show that the subduction of oxidized oceanic
lithosphere and degassing of reduced gas from the Earth's interior is a sink of oxygen, and that this
sink significantly exceeds the rate of atmospheric deoxygenation in the Pleistocene. A relative
constancy of atmospheric O2 in the Cenozoic requires that the organic carbon cycle was a net source
of O2 and sink of CO2, photosynthesis outpaced respiration by an average of ca 40 MtC yr-1 over the
last 50 million years. The cost for the relatively invariant atmospheric oxygen concentration
is the coexistence of two photosynthetically-driven imbalances in the cycles of iron and carbon
that offset each other to near perfection. The weak escape of OC from continents and oceans to the
lithosphere is more intriguing. It demonstrates that the organic carbon cycle remains under surprisingly
strong kinetic control, despite evolution/optimization of respiratory metabolisms and rising
atmospheric O2 for more than 2.4 billion years.
