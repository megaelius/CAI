Understanding how galaxies maintain the inefficiency of star formation with physically self-consistent
models is a central problem for galaxy evolution. Although numerous theoretical models have been
proposed in recent decades, the debate still exists. By means of high-resolution two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe
feedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the evolution of early-type
galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback models are updated based on \citet{Yuan2018}.
The gas sources comes exclusively from the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models.
We find that SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low mass elliptical
galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass galaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently
offset the radiative cooling and thus regulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression
of star formation is extremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot
account for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies. The X-ray temperature $T_{\rm X}$ and
luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ of hot plasma can be in agreement with the observed data with the inclusion
of effective feedback processes. These results thus suggest that we can use $T_{\rm X}$ and $L_{\rm
X}$ to probe the role of different feedback processes. The inclusion of additional gas sources can
make the mass scale between SNe and AGN feedback dominating in suppressing star formation decrease
to an observationally inferred value of a few $10^{10}~M_{\odot}$.
