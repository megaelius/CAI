In unified models, different types of active galaxy nuclei correspond to a single class of objects,
where their observed differences are solely due to the different orientations of the obscuring
material around the central inner regions. Recent studies also show that this obscuring material
can even extend at galactic scales due to debris and/or mergers. In standard unified models the different
AGN types are expected to show similar galaxy environments. We aim to investigate properties and
environment of obscured and unobscured AGNs selected from the MUSYC survey, in order to test the
unified model and evolutionary scenarios. The sample of AGNs was selected from images obtained
with the IRAC Camera, based on their MIR colors. We selected two samples of AGNs with redshifts in
the range $1\le z \le 2$ and $M_v\leq -$21: obscured and unobscured AGNs by means of a simple optical-MIR
color cut criterion. We find that obscured AGNs are intrinsically optically faint in the R band,
suggesting that luminous IR-selected AGNs have a significant dust extinction. From a cross-correlation
with several X-ray surveys, we find that the majority of the AGNs have X-ray luminosities similar
to those found in Seyfert-like galaxies. Neighbouring galaxies located close to ($\sim$200 kpc)
obscured AGNs tend to have redder colors, compared to the local environment of unobscured AGNs.
Results obtained from a KS test show that the two color distributions are different at $\sim$95%
confidence level. We find that obscured AGNs are located in denser local galaxy environments compared
to the unobscured AGN sample. Our results suggest that AGN obscuration can occur at galactic scales,
possibly due to galaxy interactions or mergers, and that the simple unified model based solely on
the local torus orientation may not be sufficient to explain all the observations.
