High resolution Keck HIRES and Gemini GRACES spectra are combined with Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry
to re-examine the low-metallicity, kinematically interesting dwarf stars studied by Stephens
& Boesgaard (2002). These stars, spanning a metallicity range of $-1.5>$ [Fe/H] $>-3$, were originally
selected as outer halo dwarf stars because of their large apocentric radii, large distances from
the Milky Way plane and/or highly elliptical or retrograde orbits. Using additional chemical and
kinematic criteria, we select a subsample of six stars (test cases) to redetermine stellar parameters
and abundances using new model atmospheres and updated atomic data. We confirm two of the six stars
in our sample to be very metal-poor, with [Fe/H]$\sim -2.3$ (G158-100, G037-037) and find two other
stars to be Mg-poor at intermediate metallicities [Fe/H]$\sim-1.5$ (G184-007 and G189-050).
The latter signature is suggestive of origins in an accreted dwarf galaxy. Gaia DR2 data is used to
redetermine the orbital parameters for the entire SB02 sample. We find nine stars to be dynamically
coincident with the \textit{Gaia}-Enceledas satellite merger, including one very low metallicity
star (G238-030) ([Fe/H]$\sim-3.6$). Another 17 stars are found to be dynamically coincident with
the \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia accretion event, including one very metal-poor star near [Fe/H] $=-3.5$.
Both metal-poor stars have low masses and isochrone ages older than 10 Gyr. A knee in [$\alpha$/Fe]
is found in the \textit{Gaia}-Enceladus associated stars, near [Fe/H]$\sim-1.6$, while the location
of an [$\alpha$/Fe] is less clear in the \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia sample. If the metal-poor stars
in these samples are true members of the \textit{Gaia}-Enceledas and \textit{Gaia}-Sequoia remnants,
they present unique opportunities to probe the low metallicity tail and early star formation history
of these systems.
