In the framework of the unification scheme of radio-loud active galactic nuclei, BL Lac objects
and quasars are the beamed end-on counterparts of low-power (FRI) and high-power (FRII) radio galaxies,
respectively. Some BL Lacs have been found to possess the FRII-type large-scale radio morphology,
suggesting that the parent population of BL Lacs is a mixture of low- and high-power radio galaxies.
This seems to apply only to `low frequency-peaked' BL Lacs, since all the `high frequency-peaked'
BL Lacs studied so far were shown to host exclusively the FRI-type radio jets. While analyzing the
NVSS survey maps of the TeV detected BL Lacs, we have however discovered that the high frequency-peaked
object SHBL J001355.9-185406 is associated uniquely with the one-sided, arcmin-scale, and edge-brightened
jet/lobe-like feature extending to the south-west from the blazar core. In order to investigate
in detail the large-scale morphology of SHBL J001355.9-185406, we have performed low-frequency
and high-resolution observations of the source at 156, 259 and 629 MHz using the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope. Our analysis indicates that no diffuse arcmin-scale emission is present around
the unresolved blazar core, and that the arcmin-scale structure seen on the NVSS map breaks into
three distinct features unrelated to the blazar, but instead associated with background AGN. The
upper limits for the extended radio halo around the TeV-emitting BL Lac object SHBL J001355.9-185406
read as < 10% - 1% at $156-629$ MHz. The fact that the integrated radio spectrum of the unresolved
blazar core is flat down to 156 MHz indicates that a self-similar character of the jet in the source
holds up to relatively large distances from the jet base.
