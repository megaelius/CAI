The atmospheric parameters and abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti have been determined for 20 stars
using the Gaia DR2 parallaxes, high-resolution spectra, and the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
(non-LTE) line formation modeling. A sample of stars with homogeneous data on the abundances of
alpha-process elements has thus been increased to 94. It is shown that applying a non-LTE approach
and classical 1D atmospheric models with spectroscopically determined surface gravities based
on Fe~I and Fe~II lines yields reliable results. Analysis of the full sample confirms the conclusions
of earlier studies indicating enhancements of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti relative to Fe for halo and thick-disk
stars, and larger enhancements for the thick-disk stars compared to the thin-disk stars of similar
metallicities. The following new results are obtained. The ratios [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe],
and [Ti/Fe] in the thick disk remain constant and similar to each other at the level 0.3 when [Fe/H]
< -0.4, and fall off when the metallicity becomes higher, suggesting the onset of the production
of iron in Type Ia supernovae. Halo stars have the same [alpha/Fe] values independent of their distance
(within ~ 8 kpc of the Sun), providing evidence for a universal evolution of the abundances of alpha-process
elements in different parts of the Galaxy. The enhancements relative to iron for halo stars are,
on average, similar, at the level 0.3 dex, for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti. These data are important for constraining
the nucleosynthesis models. The star-to-star scatter of [alpha/Fe] increases for [Fe/H] < -2.6,
while the scatter of the ratios between the different alpha-process elements remains small, possibly
indicating incomplete mixing of nucleosynthesis products at the epoch of the formation of these
stars.
