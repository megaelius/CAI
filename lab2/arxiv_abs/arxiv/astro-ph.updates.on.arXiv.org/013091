The study of cluster post starburst galaxies gives useful insights on the physical processes quenching
the star formation in the most massive environments. Exploiting the MUSE data of the GAs Stripping
Phenomena in galaxies (GASP) project, we characterise the quenching history of 8 local cluster
galaxies that were selected for not showing emission lines in their fiber spectra. We inspect the
integrated colors, the Hb rest frame equivalent widths (EW), star formation histories (SFHs) and
luminosity-weighted age (LWA) maps finding no signs of current star formation throughout the disks
of these early-spiral/S0 galaxies. All of them have been passive for at least 20 Myr, but their SF
declined on different timescales. In most of them the outskirts reached undetectable SFRs before
the inner regions (outside-in quenching). Our sample includes three post-starforming galaxies,
two passive galaxies and three galaxies with intermediate properties. The first population shows
blue colors, deep Hb in absorption (EW>>2.8A), young ages (8.8<log(LW [yr])<9.2). Two of these
galaxies show signs of a central SF enhancement before quenching. Passive galaxies have instead
red colors, EW(Hb)<2.8A, ages in the range 9.2<log(LWA[yr])<10. Finally, the other galaxies are
most likely in transition between a post starforming and passive phase, as they quenched in an intermediate
epoch and have not lost all the star forming features yet. The outside-in quenching, the morphology
and kinematics of the stellar component, along with the position of these galaxies within massive
clusters (sigma_cl=550-950km/s) point to a scenario in which ram pressure stripping has removed
the gas, leading to quenching. Only the three most massive galaxies might alternatively have entered
the clusters already quenched. These galaxies are therefore at the final stage of the rapid evolution
galaxies undergo when they enter the clusters.
