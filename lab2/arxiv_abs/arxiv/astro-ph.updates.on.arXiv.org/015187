As the SKA is expected to be operational in the next decade, investigations of the radio sky in the
range of 100 MHz to 10 GHz have become important for simulations of the SKA observations. In determining
physical properties of galaxies from radio data, the radio SED is often assumed to be described by
a simple power law, usually with a spectral index of 0.7 for all sources. Even though radio SEDs have
been shown to exhibit deviations from this assumption, both in differing spectral indices and complex
spectral shapes, it is often presumed that their individual differences cancel out in large samples.
We constructed the average radio SED of radio-excess active galactic nuclei (RxAGN), defined as
those that exhibit a 3 $\sigma$ radio luminosity excess with respect to the value expected only from
contribution from star formation, out to z~4. We combined VLA observations of the COSMOS field at
1.4 GHz and 3 GHz with GMRT observations at 325 MHz and 610 MHz. To account for nondetections in the
GMRT maps, we employed the survival analysis technique. We selected a sample of RxAGN out to z~4.
We find that a sample of RxAGN can be described by a spectral index of $\alpha_1=0.28\pm0.03$ below
the break frequency $\nu_b=(4.1\pm0.2)$ GHz and $\alpha_2=1.16\pm0.04$ above, while a simple
power-law model yields a single spectral index of $\alpha=0.64\pm0.07$. By binning in 1.4 GHz radio
luminosity and redshift, we find that the power-law spectral index, as well as broken power-law
spectral indices, may increase for larger source sizes, while the power-law spectral index and
lower-frequency (<4 GHz) broken power-law spectral index are additionally positively correlated
with redshift.
