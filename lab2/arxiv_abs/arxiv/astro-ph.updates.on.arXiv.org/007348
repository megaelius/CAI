Bayesian statistical inference has become increasingly important for the analysis of observations
from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. To this end, iterative
simulation techniques, in particular nested sampling and parallel tempering, have been implemented
in the software library LALInference to sample from the posterior distribution of waveform parameters
of compact binary coalescence events. Nested sampling was mainly developed to calculate the marginal
likelihood of a model but can produce posterior samples as a by-product. Thermodynamic integration
is employed to calculate the evidence using samples generated by parallel tempering but has been
found to be computationally demanding. Here we propose the stepping-stone sampling algorithm,
originally proposed by Xie et al. (2011) in phylogenetics and a special case of path sampling, as
an alternative to thermodynamic integration. The stepping-stone sampling algorithm is also based
on samples from the power posteriors of parallel tempering but has superior performance as fewer
temperature steps and thus computational resources are needed to achieve the same accuracy. We
demonstrate its performance and computational costs in comparison to thermodynamic integration
and nested sampling in a simulation study and a case study of computing the marginal likelihood of
a binary black hole signal model applied to simulated data from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo
gravitational wave detectors. To deal with the inadequate methods currently employed to estimate
the standard errors of evidence estimates based on power posterior techniques, we propose a novel
block bootstrap approach and show its potential in our simulation study and LIGO application.
