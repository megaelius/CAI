The quasar 3C454.3 underwent a uniquely-structured multi-frequency outburst in June 2016. The
blazar was observed in the optical $R$ band by several ground-based telescopes in photometric and
polarimetric modes, at $\gamma$-ray frequencies by the \emph{Fermi}\ Large Area Telescope, and
at 43 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array. The maximum flux density was observed on 2016 June 24 at
both optical and $\gamma$-ray frequencies, reaching $S^\mathrm{max}_\mathrm{opt}=18.91\pm0.08$
mJy and $S_\gamma^\mathrm{max} =22.20\pm0.18\times10^{-6}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively.
The June 2016 outburst possessed a precipitous decay at both $\gamma$-ray and optical frequencies,
with the source decreasing in flux density by a factor of 4 over a 24-hour period in $R$ band. Intraday
variability was observed throughout the outburst, with flux density changes between 1 and 5 mJy
over the course of a night. The precipitous decay featured statistically significant quasi-periodic
micro-variability oscillations with an amplitude of $\sim 2$-$3\%$ about the mean trend and a characteristic
period of 36 minutes. The optical degree of polarization jumped from $\sim3\%$ to nearly 20\% during
the outburst, while the position angle varied by $\sim120\degr$. A knot was ejected from the 43 GHz
core on 2016 Feb 25, moving at an apparent speed $v_\mathrm{app}=20.3c\pm0.8c$. From the observed
minimum timescale of variability $\tau_\mathrm{opt}^\mathrm{min}\approx2$ hr and derived
Doppler factor $\delta=22.6$, we find a size of the emission region $r\lesssim2.6\times10^{15}$
cm. If the quasi-periodic micro-variability oscillations are caused by periodic variations of
the Doppler factor of emission from a turbulent vortex, we derive a rotational speed of the vortex
$\sim0.2c$.
