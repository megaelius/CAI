To discover Earth analogs around other stars, next generation spectrographs must measure radial
velocity (RV) with 10 cm/s precision. To achieve 10cm/s precision, however, the effects of telluric
contamination must be accounted for. The standard approaches to telluric removal are: (a) observing
a standard star and (b) using a radiative transfer code. Observing standard stars, however, takes
valuable observing time away from science targets. Radiative transfer codes, meanwhile, rely
on imprecise line data in the HITRAN database (typical line position uncertainties range from a
few to several hundred m/s) and require difficult-to-obtain measurements of water vapor column
density for best performance. To address these issues, we present SELENITE: a SELf-calibrating,
Empricial, Light-Weight liNear regressIon TElluric model for high-resolution spectra. The model
exploits two simple observations: (a) water tellurics grow proportionally to precipitable water
vapor and therefore proportionally to each other and (b) non-water tellurics grow proportionally
to airmass. Water tellurics can be identified by looking for pixels whose growth correlates with
a known calibration water telluric and modelled by regression against it, and likewise non-water
tellurics with airmass. The model doesn't require line data, water vapor measurements and additional
observations (beyond one-time calibration observations), achieves fits with a reduced chi squared
of 1.17 on B stars and 2.95 on K dwarfs, and leaves residuals of 1% (B stars) and 1.1% (K dwarfs) of continuum.
Fitting takes seconds on laptop PCs: SELENITE is light-weight enough to guide observing runs.
