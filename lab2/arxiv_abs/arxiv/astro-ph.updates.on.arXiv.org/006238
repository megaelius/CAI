Feedback processes by active galactic nuclei in the centres of galaxy clusters appear to prevent
large-scale cooling flows and impede star formation. However, the detailed heating mechanism
remains uncertain. One promising heating scenario invokes the dissipation of Alfv\'en waves that
are generated by streaming cosmic rays (CRs). In order to study this idea, we use three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with the AREPO code that follow the evolution of jet-inflated
bubbles that are filled with CRs in a turbulent cluster atmosphere. We find that a single injection
event produces the CR distribution and heating rate required for a successful CR heating model.
As a bubble rises buoyantly, cluster magnetic fields drape around the leading interface and are
amplified to strengths that balance the ram pressure. Together with helical magnetic fields in
the bubble, this initially confines the CRs and suppresses the formation of interface instabilities.
But as the bubble continues to rise, bubble-scale eddies significantly amplify radial magnetic
filaments in its wake and enable CR transport from the bubble to the cooling intracluster medium.
By varying the jet parameters, we obtain a rich and diverse set of jet and bubble morphologies ranging
from Fanaroff-Riley type I-like (FRI) to FRII-like jets. We identify jet energy as the leading order
parameter (keeping the ambient density profiles fixed), whereas jet luminosity is primarily responsible
for setting the Mach numbers of shocks around FRII-like sources. Our simulations also produce FRI-like
jets that inflate bubbles without detectable shocks and show morphologies consistent with cluster
observations.
