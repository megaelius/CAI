The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations
are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the CMB anisotropy
from the \Planck\ satellite. The detailed results are based on studies of four independent estimates
of the CMB that are compared to simulations using a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model and incorporating
essential aspects of the \Planck\ measurement process. Deviations from isotropy have been found
and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask and frequency dependence.
Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the \textit{WMAP} data, and are now confirmed
at similar levels of significance (around $3\sigma$). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity
with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.
In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed
variance of the CMB signal. The dipolar power asymmetry is now found to persist to much smaller angular
scales, and can be described in the low-$\ell$ regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model.
Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum
of the data which shows a deficit of power on the same scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two
hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for
a deficit in power, whilst its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may
be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Whilst these
analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory
explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.
