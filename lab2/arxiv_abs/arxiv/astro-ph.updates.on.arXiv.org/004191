We present VRIJHK photometry of the KH 15D T Tauri binary system for the 2015/16 and 2016/17 observing
seasons. For the first time in the modern (CCD) era we are seeing Star B fully emerge from behind the
trailing edge of the precessing circumbinary ring during each apastron passage. We are, therefore,
able to measure its luminosity and color. Decades of photometry on the system now allow us to infer
the effective temperature, radius, mass and age of each binary component. We find our values to be
in good agreement with previous studies, including archival photographic photometry from the
era when both stars were fully visible, and they set the stage for a full model of the system that can
be constructed once radial velocity measurements are available. We also present the first high
sensitivity radio observations of the system, taken with ALMA and the SMA. The respective 2.0 and
0.88 mm observations provide an upper limit on the circumbinary (gas and dust) disk mass of 1.7 Jupiter
masses and reveal an extended CO outflow which overlaps with the position, systemic velocity and
orientation of the KH 15D system and is certainly associated with it. The low velocity, tight collimation,
and extended nature of the emission suggest that the outflow is inclined nearly orthogonal to the
line of sight, implying it is also orthogonal to the circumbinary ring. The position angle of the
radio outflow also agrees precisely with the direction of polarization of the optical emission
during the faint phase. A small offset between the optical image of the binary and the central line
of the CO outflow remains as a puzzle and possible clue to the jet launching mechanism.
