[Abridged] Molecular filaments have received special attention recently, thanks to new observational
results on their properties. In particular, our early analysis of filament properties revealed
a narrow distribution of median widths centered at a value of about 0.1 pc. Here, we extend and complement
our initial study with the analysis of the filamentary structures observed in eight nearby molecular
clouds. We use the column density maps derived from Herschel data and the DisPerSE algorithm to trace
a network of filaments in each cloud. We build synthetic maps to assess the completeness limit of
our extracted sample and validate our measurements. Our analysis yields a selected sample of 599
filaments with aspect ratios larger than 3 and column density contrasts larger than 0.3. We show
that our sample is more than 95% complete for column density contrasts larger than 1, with only 5%
of spurious detections. On average, more than 15% of the total gas mass in the clouds, and more than
80% of the dense gas mass, is found to be in the form of filaments, respectively. Analysis of the radial
column density profiles of the 599 filaments indicates a narrow distribution of crest-averaged
inner widths, with a median value of 0.10 pc and an interquartile range of 0.07 pc. In contrast, the
filaments span wide ranges in length, central column density, column density contrast, and mass
per unit length. The characteristic filament width is well resolved by Herschel observations,
and a median value of 0.1 pc is consistently found using three distinct estimates based on (1) a direct
measurement of the width at half power after background subtraction, as well as (2) Gaussian and
(3) Plummer fits. The existence of a characteristic filament width is further supported by the presence
of a tight correlation between mass per unit length and central column density for the observed filaments.
