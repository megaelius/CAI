Local Group (LG) galaxies have relatively accurate SFHs and metallicity evolution derived from
resolved CMD modeling, and thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the efficacy of estimating
stellar mass M$_{\star}$ of real galaxies based on integrated stellar luminosities. Building
on the SFHs and metallicity evolution of 40 LG dwarf galaxies, we carried out a comprehensive study
of the influence of SFHs, metallicity evolution and dust extinction on the UV-to-NIR color-$\mathcal{M/L}$
(color-log$\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$)) relations and M$_{\star}$ estimation of local universe
galaxies. We find that: The LG galaxies follow color-log$\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$) relations
that fall in between the ones calibrated by previous studies; Optical color-log$\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$)
relations at higher metallicities ([M/H]) are generally broader and steeper; The SFH "concentration"
does not significantly affect the color-log$\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$) relations; Light-weighted
ages and [M/H] together constrain log$\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$) with uncertainties ranging
from $\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for the NIR up to 0.2 dex for the optical passbands; Metallicity evolution
induces significant uncertainties to the optical but not NIR $\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$)
at given light-weighted ages and [M/H]; The $V$ band is the ideal luminance passband for estimating
$\Upsilon_{\star}$($\lambda$) from single colors, because the combinations of $\Upsilon_{\star}$($V$)
and optical colors such as $B-V$ and $g-r$ exhibit the weakest systematic dependence on SFHs, [M/H]
and dust extinction; Without any prior assumption on SFHs, M$_{\star}$ is constrained with biases
$\lesssim$ 0.3 dex by the optical-to-NIR SED fitting. Optical passbands alone constrain M$_{\star}$
with biases $\lesssim$ 0.4 dex (or $\lesssim$ 0.6 dex) when dust extinction is fixed (or variable)
in SED fitting. [abridged]
