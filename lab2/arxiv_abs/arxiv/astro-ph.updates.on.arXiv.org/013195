We present the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons (f_esc) from a sample of 34 high-resolution
cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxies at z>5 in the Feedback in Realistic Environments
project, post-processed with a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for ionizing radiation. Our
sample consists of 8500 halos in M_vir~10^8--10^{12} M_sun (M_star~10^4--10^{10} M_sun) at z=5--12.
We find the sample average <f_esc> increases with halo mass for M_vir~10^8--10^{9.5} M_sun, becomes
nearly constant for M_vir~10^{9.5}--10^{11} M_sun, and decreases at M_vir>10^{11} M_sun. Equivalently,
<f_esc> increases with stellar mass up to M_star~10^8 M_sun and decreases at higher masses. Even
applying single-star stellar population synthesis models, we find a moderate <f_esc>~0.2 for
galaxies at M_star~10^8 M_sun. Nearly half of the escaped ionizing photons come from stars 1--3
Myr old and the rest from stars 3--10 Myr old. Binaries only have a modest effect, boosting <f_esc>
by ~25--35% and the number of escaped photons by 60--80%. Most leaked ionizing photons are from vigorously
star-forming regions that usually contain a feedback-driven kpc-scale superbubble surrounded
by a dense shell. The shell is forming stars while accelerated, so new stars formed earlier in the
shell are already inside the shell. Young stars in the bubble and near the edge of the shell can fully
ionize some low-column-density paths pre-cleared by feedback, allowing a large fraction of their
ionizing photons to escape. The decrease of <f_esc> at the high-mass end is due to dust attenuation,
while at the low-mass end, <f_esc> decreases owing to inefficient star formation (and hence feedback).
At fixed mass, <f_esc> tends to increase with redshift. Our simulations produce sufficient ionizing
photons for cosmic reionization.
