Solar flare termination shocks have been suggested as one of the promising drivers for particle
acceleration in solar flares, yet observational evidence remains rare. By utilizing radio dynamic
spectroscopic imaging of decimetric stochastic spike bursts in an eruptive flare, Chen et al. found
that the bursts form a dynamic surface-like feature located at the ending points of fast plasma downflows
above the looptop, interpreted as a flare termination shock. One piece of observational evidence
that strongly supports the termination shock interpretation is the occasional split of the emission
band into two finer lanes in frequency, similar to the split-band feature seen in fast-coronal-shock-driven
type II radio bursts. Here we perform spatially, spectrally, and temporally resolved analysis
of the split-band feature of the flare termination shock event. We find that the ensemble of the radio
centroids from the two split-band lanes each outlines a nearly co-spatial surface. The high-frequency
lane is located slightly below its low frequency counterpart by ~0.8 Mm, which strongly supports
the shock upstream-downstream interpretation. Under this scenario, the density compression
ratio across the shock front can be inferred from the frequency split, which implies a shock with
a Mach number of up to 2.0. Further, the spatiotemporal evolution of the density compression along
the shock front agrees favorably with results from magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We conclude
that the detailed variations of the shock compression ratio may be due to the impact of dynamic plasma
structures in the reconnection outflows, which results in distortion of the shock front.
