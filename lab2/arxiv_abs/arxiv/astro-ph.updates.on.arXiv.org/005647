Obtaining a reliable model of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) is something many fields in astrophysics
long for. Recently, particular interest in this has been shown by an attempt to understand the origin
of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays; charged particles with extremely high energies for which detailed
knowledge of the GMF is required to trace them back to their sources. The development of a GMF model
often involves the optimization of a given parametrization by comparing it to data sets. These data
sets can include rotation measures from polarized sources or Galactic synchrotron radiation maps.
However, how reliable are these optimizations and how valid are these models? IMAGINE (arXiv:1801.04341)
is designed to answer these questions by using Bayesian statistics. This allows IMAGINE to compare
different models with each other while taking care of the growing amount of available data sets.
During my masters project, I have tested the first version of IMAGINE for one of the most used GMF models,
the "JF12 model". These tests were focused on finding the best sampling method to explore the 30 dimensions
of this model. In this thesis, I will report on the work that I have done on testing IMAGINE and explain
the challenges and difficulties of doing so. The main part of these tests involved analyzing the
behavior of the posterior probability distribution functions of the parameters in the JF12 model.
Doing so has shown that many different numerical errors can pop up when using models, some that can
be removed or circumvented and some that are simply hard-coded. To ensure compatibility with future
GMF models, this outcome forces us to use a nested sampler in IMAGINE. The carried out tests have also
pointed out other weak-points, including dependencies between parameters, not taking care of
unphysical model results and insufficient control over the modules in IMAGINE.
