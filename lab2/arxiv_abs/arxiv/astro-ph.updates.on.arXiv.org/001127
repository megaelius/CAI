Stellar rotation is an important parameter in the evolution of massive stars. Accurate and reliable
measurements of projected rotational velocities in large samples of OB stars are crucial to confront
the predictions of stellar evolutionary models with observational constraints. We reassess previous
determinations of projected rotational velocities (vsini) in Galactic OB stars using a large,
high quality spectroscopic dataset, and a strategy which account for other sources of broadening
appart from rotation affecting the diagnostic lines We present a versatile and user friendly IDL
tool, based on a combined Fourier Transform (FT) + goodness of fit (GOF) methodology, for the line-broadening
characterization in OB-type stars. We use this tool to (a) investigate the impact of macroturbulent
and microturbulent broadenings on vsini measurements, and (b) determine vsini in a sample of 200
Galactic OB-type stars, also characterizing the amount of macroturbulent broadening (\vmacro)
affecting the line profiles. We present observational evidence illustrating the strengths and
limitations of the proposed FT+GOF methodology for the case of OB stars. We confirm previous statements
(based on indirect arguments or smaller samples) that the macroturbulent broadening is ubiquitous
in the massive star domain. We compare the newly derived vsini with previous determinations not
accounting for this extra line-broadening contribution, and show that those cases with vsini<
120 km/s need to be systematically revised downwards by ~25 (+/-20) km/s. We suggest that microturbulence
may impose an upper limit below which vsini and \vmacro\ could be incorrectly derived by means of
the proposed methodology as presently used, and discuss the implications of this statement on the
study of relatively narrow line massive stars.
