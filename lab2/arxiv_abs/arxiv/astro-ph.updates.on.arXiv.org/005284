Since its inception in the early 2000, the Virtual Observatory (VO), developed as a collaboration
of many national and international projects, has become a major factor in the discovery and dissemination
of astronomical information worldwide. The IVOA has been coordinating all these efforts worldwide
to ensure a common VO framework that enables transparent access to and interoperability of astronomy
resources (data and software) around the world. The VO is not a magic solution to all astronomy data
management challenges but it does bring useful solutions in many areas borne out by the fact that
VO interfaces are broadly found in astronomy major data centres and projects worldwide. Astronomy
data centres have been building VO services on top of their existing data services to increase interoperability
with other VO-compliant data resources to take advantage of the continuous and increasing development
of VO applications. VO applications have made multi-instrument and multi-wavelength science,
a difficult and fruitful part of astronomy, somewhat easier. More recently, several major new astronomy
projects have been directly adopting VO standards to build their data management infrastructure,
giving birth to VO built-in archives. Embracing the VO framework from the beginning brings the double
gain of not needing to reinvent the wheel and ensuring from the start interoperability with other
astronomy VO resources. Some of the IVOA standards are also starting to be used by neighbour disciplines
like planetary sciences. There is still quite a lot to be done on the VO, in particular tackling the
upcoming big data challenge and how to find interoperable solutions to the new data analysis paradigm
of bringing and running the software close to the data.
