The environment around protoplanetary disks (PPDs) regulates processes which drive the chemical
and structural evolution of circumstellar material. We perform a detailed empirical survey of
warm molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) absorption observed against H I-Ly$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$: $\lambda$
1215.67 {\AA}) emission profiles for 22 PPDs, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet
(UV) spectra from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) to identify H$_2$ absorption signatures and quantify the column densities of H$_2$ ground
states in each sightline. We compare thermal equilibrium models of H$_2$ to the observed H$_2$ rovibrational
level distributions. We find that, for the majority of targets, there is a clear deviation in high
energy states (T$_{exc}$ $\gtrsim$ 20,000 K) away from thermal equilibrium populations (T(H$_2$)
$\gtrsim$ 3500 K). We create a metric to estimate the total column density of non-thermal H$_2$ (N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$)
and find that the total column densities of thermal (N(H$_2$)) and N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ correlate
for transition disks and targets with detectable C IV-pumped H$_2$ fluorescence. We compare N(H$_2$)
and N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ to circumstellar observables and find that N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ correlates
with X-ray and FUV luminosities, but no correlations are observed with the luminosities of discrete
emission features (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, C IV). Additionally, N(H$_2$) and N(H$_2$)$_{nLTE}$ are
too low to account for the H$_2$ fluorescence observed in PPDs, so we speculate that this H$_2$ may
instead be associated with a diffuse, hot, atomic halo surrounding the planet-forming disk. We
create a simple photon-pumping model for each target to test this hypothesis and find that Ly$\alpha$
efficiently pumps H$_2$ levels with T$_{exc}$ $\geq$ 10,000 K out of thermal equilibrium.
