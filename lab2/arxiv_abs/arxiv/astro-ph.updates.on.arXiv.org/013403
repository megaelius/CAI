We propose a flexible method for estimating luminosity functions (LFs) based on kernel density
estimation (KDE), the most popular nonparametric density estimation approach developed in modern
statistics, to overcome issues surrounding binning of LFs. One challenge in applying KDE to LFs
is how to treat the boundary bias problem, since astronomical surveys usually obtain truncated
samples predominantly due to the flux-density limits of surveys. We use two solutions, the transformation
KDE method ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{t}}$), and the transformation-reflection KDE method ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tr}}$)
to reduce the boundary bias. We develop a new likelihood cross-validation criterion for selecting
optimal bandwidths, based on which, the posterior probability distribution of bandwidth and transformation
parameters for $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{t}}$ and $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ are derived within
a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. The simulation result shows that $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{t}}$
and $\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tr}}$ perform better than the traditional binned method, especially
in the sparse data regime around the flux-limit of a survey or at the bright-end of the LF. To further
improve the performance of our KDE methods, we develop the transformation-reflection adaptive
KDE approach ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{tra}}$). Monte Carlo simulations suggest that it has a good
stability and reliability in performance, and is around an order of magnitude more accurate than
using the binned method. By applying our adaptive KDE method to a quasar sample, we find that it achieves
estimates comparable to the rigorous determination by a previous work, while making far fewer assumptions
about the LF. The KDE method we develop has the advantages of both parametric and non-parametric
methods.
