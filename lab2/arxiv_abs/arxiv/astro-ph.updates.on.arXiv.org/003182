Solar system small bodies come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, which are achieved following
very individual evolutional paths through billions of years. This paper focuses on the reshaping
process of rubble-pile asteroids driven by meteorite impacts. In our study, numerous possible
equilibrium configurations are obtained via Monte Carlo simulation, and the structural stability
of these configurations is determined via eigen analysis of the geometric constructions. The eigen
decomposition reveals a connection between the cluster's reactions and the types of external disturbance.
Numerical simulations are performed to verify the analytical results. The gravitational N-body
code pkdgrav is used to mimic the responses of the cluster under intermittent non-dispersive impacts.
We statistically confirm that the stability index, the total gravitational potential and the volume
of inertia ellipsoid show consistent tendency of variation. A common regime is found in which the
clusters tend towards crystallization under intermittent impacts, i.e., only the configurations
with high structural stability survive under the external disturbances. The results suggest the
trivial non-disruptive impacts might play an important role in the rearrangement of the constituent
blocks, which may strengthen these rubble piles and help to build a robust structure under impacts
of similar magnitude. The final part of this study consists of systematic simulations over two parameters,
the projectile momentum and the rotational speed of the cluster. The results show a critical value
exists for the projectile momentum, as predicted by theory, below which all clusters become responseless
to external disturbances; and the rotation proves to be significant for it exhibits an "enhancing"
effect on loose-packed clusters, which coincides with the observation that several fast-spinning
asteroids have low bulk densities.
