Aims. The existence of asteroid complexes produced by the disruption of these comets suggests that
evolved comets could also produce high-strength materials able to survive as meteorites. We chose
as an example comet 2P/Encke, one of the largest object of the so-called Taurid complex. We compare
the reflectance spectrum of this comet with the laboratory spectra of some Antarctic ungrouped
carbonaceous chondrites to investigate whether some of these meteorites could be associated with
evolved comets. Methods. We compared the spectral behaviour of 2P/Encke with laboratory spectra
of carbonaceous chondrites. Different specimens of the common carbonaceous chondrite groups
do not match the overall features and slope of comet 2P/Encke. Trying anomalous carbonaceous chondrites,
we found two meteorites, Meteorite Hills 01017 and Grosvenor Mountains 95551, which could be good
proxies for the dark materials forming this short-period comet. We hypothesise that these two meteorites
could be rare surviving samples, either from the Taurid complex or another compositionally similar
body. In any case, it is difficult to get rid of the effects of terrestrial weathering in these Antarctic
finds, and further studies are needed. Future sample return from the so-called dormant comets could
be also useful to establish a ground truth on the materials forming evolved short-period comets.
Results. As a natural outcome, we think that identifying good proxies of 2P/Encke-forming materials
might have interesting implications for future sample-return missions to evolved, potentially
dormant or extinct comets. To understand the compositional nature of evolved comets is particularly
relevant in the context of the future mitigation of impact hazard from these dark and dangerous projectiles.
