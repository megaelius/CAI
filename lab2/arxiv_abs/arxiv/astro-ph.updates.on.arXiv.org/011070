Population synthesis models predict that high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations produced
in low metallicity environments should be more X-ray luminous, a trend supported by studies of nearby
galaxies. This trend may be responsible for the observed increase of the X-ray luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{X}}$)
per star formation rate (SFR) with redshift due to the decrease of metallicity ($Z$) at fixed stellar
mass as a function of redshift. To test this hypothesis, we use a sample of 79 $z\sim2$ star-forming
galaxies with oxygen abundance measurements from the MOSDEF survey, which obtained rest-frame
optical spectra for $\sim1500$ galaxies in the CANDELS fields at $1.37<z<3.80$. Using Chandra
data from the AEGIS-X Deep, Deep Field North, and Deep Field South surveys, we stack the X-ray data
at the galaxy locations in bins of redshift and $Z$ because the galaxies are too faint to be individually
detected. In agreement with previous studies, the average $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR of our $z\sim2$
galaxy sample is enhanced by $\approx0.4-0.8$ dex relative to local HMXB $L_{\mathrm{X}}$-SFR
scaling relations. Splitting our sample by $Z$, we find that $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR and $Z$ are anti-correlated
with 97% confidence. This observed $Z$ dependence for HMXB-dominated galaxies is consistent both
with the local $L_{\mathrm{X}}$-SFR-$Z$ relation and a subset of population synthesis models.
Although the statistical significance of the observed trends is weak due to the low X-ray statistics,
these results constitute the first direct evidence connecting the redshift evolution of $L_{\mathrm{X}}$/SFR
and the $Z$ dependence of HMXBs.
