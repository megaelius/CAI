Ice mantles on dust grains play a central role in astrochemistry. Water and complex organic molecules
(COMs) are thought to first form on the ice mantles and subsequently are released into the gas phase
due to star formation activity. However, the critical question is whether ice mantles can survive
stellar radiation when grains are being heated from $T_{d}\sim 10\rm K$ to $\gtrsim 100$ K. In this
paper, we first study the effect of suprathermal grain rotation driven by the intense radiation
of young stellar objects (YSOs) on the ice mantles. We find that the entire ice mantles can be disrupted
into small fragments by centrifugal stress before the water ice and COMs desorb via thermal sublimation.
We then study the consequence of resulting ice fragments and find that tiny fragments of radius $a
\lesssim 10$\AA~ exhibit transient release of COMs due to thermal spikes, whereas larger fragments
can facilitate thermal sublimation at much higher rates than from the original icy grain or the same
rate but with temperatures of $\sim 20-40$ K lower. We find that rotational desorption is efficient
for hot cores/corinos from the inner to outer regions where the temperature drops to $T_{\rm gas}\sim
40\rm K$ and $n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{4}\rm cm^{-3}$. We discuss the implications of this mechanism for
desorption of COMs and water ice in various environments, including outflow cavity walls, photodissociation
regions, and protoplanetary disks. Finally, we show that very large aggregate grains can be disrupted
into individual icy grains via rotational disruption mechanism, followed by rotational desorption
of ice mantles.
