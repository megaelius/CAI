The paper deals with a computational method for detection of the solar system minor bodies (SSOs),
whose inter-frame shifts in series of CCD-frames during the observation are commensurate with
the errors in measuring their positions. These objects have velocities of apparent motion between
CCD-frames not exceeding three RMS errors ($3\sigma$) of measurements of their positions. About
15\% of objects have a near-zero apparent motion in CCD-frames, including the objects beyond the
Jupiter's orbit as well as the asteroids heading straight to the Earth. The proposed method for detection
of the object's near-zero apparent motion in series of CCD-frames is based on the Fisher f-criterion
instead of using the traditional decision rules that are based on the maximum likelihood criterion.
We analyzed the quality indicators of detection of the object's near-zero apparent motion applying
statistical and in situ modeling techniques in terms of the conditional probability of the true
detection of objects with a near-zero apparent motion. The efficiency of method being implemented
as a plugin for the Collection Light Technology (CoLiTec) software for automated asteroids and
comets detection has been demonstrated. Among the objects discovered with this plugin, there was
the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON). Within 26 minutes of the observation, the comet's image has
been moved by three pixels in a series of four CCD-frames (the velocity of its apparent motion at the
moment of discovery was equal to 0.8 pixels per CCD-frame; the image size on the frame was about five
pixels). Next verification in observations of asteroids with a near-zero apparent motion conducted
with small telescopes has confirmed an efficiency of the method even in bad conditions (strong backlight
from the full Moon). So, we recommend applying the proposed method for series of observations with
four or more frames.
