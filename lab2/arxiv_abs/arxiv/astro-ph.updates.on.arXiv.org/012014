We introduce SuperNNova, an open source supernova photometric classification framework which
leverages recent advances in deep neural networks. Our core algorithm is a recurrent neural network
(RNN) that is trained to classify light-curves using photometric information only. Additional
information such as host-galaxy redshift can be incorporated to improve performance. We evaluate
our framework using realistic supernovae simulations that include survey detection. We show that
our method, for the type Ia vs. non Ia supernovae classification problem, reaches accuracies greater
than 96.92 +- 0.09 without any redshift information and up to 99.55 +- 0.06 when redshift, either
photometric or spectroscopic, is available. Further, we show that our method attains unprecedented
performance for classification of incomplete light-curves, reaching accuracies >86.4 +- 0.1
(>93.5 +- 0.8) without host-galaxy redshift (with redshift information) two days before maximum
light. In contrast with previous methods, there is no need for time-consuming feature engineering
and we show that our method scales to very large datasets with a modest computing budget. In addition,
we investigate often neglected pitfalls of machine learning algorithms. We show that commonly
used algorithms suffer from poor calibration and overconfidence on out-of-distribution samples
when applied to supernovae data. We devise extensive tests to estimate the robustness of classifiers
and cast the learning procedure under a Bayesian light, demonstrating a much better handling of
uncertainties. We study the benefits of Bayesian RNNs for SN Ia cosmology. Our code is open-sourced
and available on https://github.com/supernnova/SuperNNova.
