We report the quasi-simultaneous INTEGRAL, SWIFT, and NuSTAR observations showing spectral state
transitions in the neutron star low mass X-ray binary 1RXS J180408.9-342058 during its 2015 outburst.
We present results of the analysis of high-quality broad energy band (0.8-200 keV) data in three
different spectral states: high/soft, low/very-hard, and transitional state. The broad band
spectra can be described in general as the sum of thermal Comptonization and reflection due to illumination
of an optically-thick accretion disc. During the high/soft state, blackbody emission is generated
from the accretion disc and the surface of the neutron star. This emission, measured at a temperature
of kTbb ~1.2 keV, is then Comptonized by a thick corona with an electron temperature of ~2.5 keV. For
the transitional and low/very-hard state, the spectra are successfully explained with emission
from a double Comptonizing corona. The first component is described by thermal Comptonization
of seed disc/neutron-star photons (kTbb ~1.2 keV) by a cold corona cloud with kT e ~8-10 keV, while
the second one originates from lower temperature blackbody photons (kTbb~0.1 keV) Comptonized
by a hot corona (kTe~35 keV). Finally, from NuSTAR observations, there is evidence that the source
is a new clocked burster. The average time between two successive X-ray bursts corresponds to ~7.9
ks and ~4.0 ks when the persistent emission decreases by a factor ~2, moving from very hard to transitional
state. The accretion rate and the decay time of the X-ray bursts longer than ~30 s suggest that the
thermonuclear emission is due to mixed H/He burning triggered by thermally unstable He ignition.
