The essential ingredients of nuclear astrophysics are the thermonuclear reactions which shape
the life and death of stars and which are responsible for the synthesis of the chemical elements in
the Universe. Deep underground in the Gran Sasso Laboratory the cross sections of the key reactions
responsible for the hydrogen burning in stars have been measured with two accelerators of 50 and
400 kV voltage right down to the energies of astrophysical interest. As a matter of fact, the main
advantage of the underground laboratory is the reduction of the background. Such a reduction has
allowed, for the first time, to measure relevant cross sections at the Gamow energy. The qualifying
features of underground nuclear astrophysics are exhaustively reviewed before discussing the
current LUNA program which is mainly devoted to the study of the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and of
the synthesis of the light elements in AGB stars and classical novae. The main results obtained during
the study of reactions relevant to the Sun are also reviewed and their influence on our understanding
of the properties of the neutrino, of the Sun and of the Universe itself is discussed. Finally, the
future of LUNA during the next decade is outlined. It will be mainly focused on the study of the nuclear
burning stages after hydrogen burning: helium and carbon burning. All this will be accomplished
thanks to a new 3.5 MV accelerator able to deliver high current beams of proton, helium and carbon
which will start running under Gran Sasso in 2019. In particular, we will discuss the first phase
of the scientific case of the 3.5 MV accelerator focused on the study of $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and of
the two reactions which generate free neutrons inside stars: $^{13}$C($\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O and
$^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg.
