We present ALMA Band 6 $^{12}$CO(2--1) line and rest-frame 232GHz continuum observations of the
nearby Compton-thick Seyfert galaxy NGC5643 with angular resolutions 0.11-0.26arcsec (9-21pc).
The CO(2--1) integrated line map reveals emission from the nuclear and circumnuclear region with
a two-arm nuclear spiral extending 10arcsec on each side. The circumnuclear CO(2--1) kinematics
can be fitted with a rotating disk, although there are regions with large residual velocities and/or
velocity dispersions. The CO(2--1) line profiles of these regions show two different velocity
components. One is ascribed to the circular component and the other to the interaction of the AGN
outflow, as traced by the [O III]5007AA emission, with molecular gas in the disk a few hundred parsecs
from the AGN. On nuclear scales, we detected an inclined CO(2--1) disk (diameter 26 pc, FWHM) oriented
almost in a north-south direction. The CO(2--1) nuclear kinematics can be fitted with a rotating
disk which appears to be tilted with respect to the large scale disk. There are strong non-circular
motions in the central 0.2-0.3 arcsec with velocities of up to 110km/s. In the absence of a nuclear
bar, these motions could be explained as radial outflows in the nuclear disk. We estimate a total
molecular gas mass for the nuclear disk of $M({\rm H}_2)=1.1\times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and an H$_2$
column density toward the location of the AGN of $N({\rm H}_2)\sim 5 \times 10^{23}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$,
for a standard CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. We interpret this nuclear molecular gas disk as the
obscuring torus of NGC5643 as well as the collimating structure of the ionization cone.
