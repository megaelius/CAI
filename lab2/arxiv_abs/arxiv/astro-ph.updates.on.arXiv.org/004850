WFIRST will conduct a coronagraphic program of characterizing the atmospheres of planets around
bright nearby stars. When observed with the WFIRST Wide Field Camera, these stars will saturate
the detector and produce very strong diffraction spikes. In this paper, we forecast the astrometric
precision that WFIRST can achieve by centering on the diffraction spikes of highly saturated stars.
This measurement principle is strongly facilitated by the WFIRST H4RG detectors, which confine
excess charges within the potential well of saturated pixels. By adopting a simplified analytical
model of the diffraction spike caused by a single support strut obscuring the telescope aperture,
integrated over the WFIRST pixel size, we predict the performance of this approach with the Fisher-matrix
formalism. We discuss the validity of the model and find that 10 ${\mu}$as astrometric precision
is achievable with a single 100 s exposure of a R = 6 or a J = 5 star. We discuss observational limitations
from the optical distortion correction and pixel-level artifacts, which need to be calibrated
at the level of 10 - 20 ${\mu}$as so as to not dominate the error budget. To suppress those systematics,
we suggest a series of short exposures, dithered by at least several hundred pixels, to reach an effective
per-visit astrometric precision of better than 10 ${\mu}$as. If this can be achieved, a dedicated
WFIRST GO program will be able to detect Earth-mass exoplanets with orbital periods of 1 yr around
stars within a few pc as well as Neptune-like planets with shorter periods or around more massive
or distant stars. Such a program will also enable mass measurements of many anticipated direct-imaging
exoplanet targets of the WFIRST coronagraph and a "starshade" occulter.
