As the only dark matter candidate that does not invoke a new particle that survives to the present
day, primordial black holes (PBHs) have drawn increasing attention recently. Up to now, various
observations have strongly constrained most of the mass range for PBHs, leaving only small windows
where PBHs could make up a substantial fraction of the dark matter. Here we revisit the PBH constraints
for the asteroid-mass window, i.e., the mass range $3.5\times 10^{-17}M_\odot < m_{\mathrm{PBH}}
< 4\times 10^{-12}M_\odot$. We revisit 3 categories of constraints. (1) For optical microlensing,
we analyze the finite source size and diffractive effects and discuss the scaling relations between
the event rate, $m_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ and the event duration. We argue that it will be difficult to
push the existing optical microlensing constraints to much lower m$_{\mathrm{PBH}}$. (2) For
dynamical capture of PBHs in stars, we derive a general result on the capture rate based on phase space
arguments. We argue that survival of stars does not constrain PBHs, but that disruption of stars
by captured PBHs should occur and that the asteroid-mass PBH hypothesis could be constrained if
we can work out the observational signature of this process. (3) For destruction of white dwarfs
by PBHs that pass through the white dwarf without getting gravitationally captured, but which produce
a shock that ignites carbon fusion, we perform a 1+1D hydrodynamic simulation to explore the post-shock
temperature and relevant timescales, and again we find this constraint to be ineffective. In summary,
we find that the asteroid-mass window remains open for PBHs to account for all the dark matter.
