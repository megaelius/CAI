Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) is a powerful astrophysical probe. Not only is it ubiquitous at high
redshifts, it is also a resonant line, which makes Ly$\alpha$ photons scatter. This scattering
process depends on the physical conditions of gas through which Ly$\alpha$ propagates, and these
are imprinted on observables such as the Ly$\alpha$ spectrum and its surface brightness profile.
In this work, we focus on a less used observable that can probe any scattering process: polarization.
We implement the density matrix formalism of polarization into the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer
code tlac. This allows us to treat it as a quantum mechanical process where single photons develop
and lose polarization from scatterings in arbitrary gas geometries. We explore static and expanding
ellipsoids, biconical outflows and clumpy, multiphase media. We find that photons become increasingly
polarized as they scatter and diffuse into the wings of the line profiles, making scattered Ly$\alpha$
polarized in general. The degree and orientation Ly$\alpha$ polarization depends on the kinematics
and distribution of the scattering HI gas. The degree of polarization generally increases with
the degree of asymmetry of the gas (in terms of its physical distribution, or distribution in velocity
space), and the orientation generally aligns tangentially to the source of emission. We show that
the spectra, the surface brightness profile and the polarization of Ly$\alpha$ photons leave signatures
that are degenerate between different models when studied separately. However, we show that such
degeneracies can be broken when observables are combined. We conclude by revealing how a joint analysis
of these can help us extract unique physical information on galaxies and their environments from
their strongest, most prominent emission line.
