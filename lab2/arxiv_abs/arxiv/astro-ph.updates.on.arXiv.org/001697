Constraints on the mass distribution in high-redshift clusters of galaxies are not currently very
strong. We aim to constrain the mass profile, M(r), and dynamical status of the $z \sim 0.8$ LCDCS
0504 cluster of galaxies characterized by prominent giant gravitational arcs near its center.
Our analysis is based on deep X-ray, optical, and infrared imaging, as well as optical spectroscopy.
We model the mass distribution of the cluster with three different mass density profiles, whose
parameters are constrained by the strong lensing features of the inner cluster region, by the X-ray
emission from the intra-cluster medium, and by the kinematics of 71 cluster members. We obtain consistent
M(r) determinations from three methods (dispersion-kurtosis, caustics and MAMPOSSt), out to
the cluster virial radius and beyond. The mass profile inferred by the strong lensing analysis in
the central cluster region is slightly above, but still consistent with, the kinematics estimate.
On the other hand, the X-ray based M(r) is significantly below both the kinematics and strong lensing
estimates. Theoretical predictions from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology for the concentration--mass
relation are in agreement with our observational results, when taking into account the uncertainties
in both the observational and theoretical estimates. There appears to be a central deficit in the
intra-cluster gas mass fraction compared to nearby clusters. Despite the relaxed appearance of
this cluster, the determinations of its mass profile by different probes show substantial discrepancies,
the origin of which remains to be determined. The extension of a similar dynamical analysis to other
clusters of the DAFT/FADA survey will allow to shed light on the possible systematics that affect
the determination of mass profiles of high-z clusters, possibly related to our incomplete understanding
of intracluster baryon physics.
