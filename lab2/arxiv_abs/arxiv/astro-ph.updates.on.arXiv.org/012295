We present ZTF18aaqjovh (SN 2018bvw), a high-velocity ("broad-lined") stripped-envelope (Type
Ic) supernova (Ic-BL SN) discovered in the Zwicky Transient Facility one-day cadence survey. The
shape of the r-band light curve and the evolution of the photospheric velocity are most similar to
that of the Type Ic-BL SN 1998bw, which was associated with a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (GRB).
However, the radio luminosity of ZTF18aaqjovh is almost two orders of magnitude fainter than that
of SN 1998bw at the same velocity phase, and is more similar to that of iPTF17cw. No X-ray emission
was detected, setting a limit that is fainter than the X-ray emission from SN 1998bw, SN 2010bh, and
SN 2006aj but consistent with the X-ray emission from SN 2009bb. From our radio observations we estimate
a shock velocity of $v\sim0.06$-0.4$c$ and a mass-loss rate of $0.1$-3$\times 10^{-4} (v_\mathrm{wind}/1000
$km/sec) solar masses per year. A search of high-energy catalogs reveals no GRB temporally and spatially
coincident with ZTF18aaqjovh. The lack of detection by the interplanetary network (IPN) sets a
limit on the prompt gamma-ray luminosity of $L_\mathrm{iso} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{48}$ erg/sec,
ruling out a classical GRB but not a low-luminosity GRB. ZTF18aaqjovh shares a number of features
with engine-driven explosions: the high photospheric velocity (SN 1998bw), the associated radio
emission (SN 2006aj, iPTF17cw), and the optical light curve (SN 1998bw). However, the velocity
of the radio-emitting ejecta is similar to that seen in interacting SNe with no evidence for an engine.
Therefore, ZTF18aaqjovh represents another transition event between GRB-SNe and "ordinary"
Ic-BL SNe.
