The initial conditions of cosmological simulations are commonly drawn from a Gaussian ensemble.
The limited number of modes inside a simulation volume gives rise to statistical fluctuations known
as \textit{sample variance}, limiting the accuracy of simulation predictions. Fixed fields offer
an alternative initialization strategy; they have the same power spectrum as standard Gaussian
fields but without intrinsic amplitude scatter at linear order. Paired fixed fields consists of
two fixed fields with opposite phases that cancel phase correlations which otherwise induce second-order
scatter in the non-linear power spectrum. We study the statistical properties of those fields for
19 different quantities at different redshifts through a large set of 600 N-body and 506 state-of-the-art
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations covering a wide range of scales, mass and spatial resolutions.
We find that paired fixed simulations do not introduce a bias on any of the examined quantities. We
quantify the statistical improvement brought by these simulations, over standard ones, on different
power spectra such as matter, halos, CDM, gas, stars, black-holes and magnetic fields, finding
that they can reduce their variance by factors as large as $10^6$. We quantify the improvement achieved
by fixing and by pairing, showing that sample variance in some quantities can be highly suppressed
by pairing after fixing. Paired fixed simulations do not change the scatter in quantities such as
the probability distribution function of matter density, or the halo, void or stellar mass functions.
We argue that procedures aiming at reducing the sample variance of those quantities are unlikely
to work. Our results show that paired fixed simulations do not affect either mean relations or scatter
of galaxy properties, and suggest that the information embedded in 1-pt statistics is highly complementary
to that in clustering.
