We introduce the "Bluedisk" project, a large program at the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
(WSRT) that has mapped the HI in a sample of 23 nearby galaxies with unusually high HI mass fractions,
along with a similar-sized sample of control galaxies matched in stellar mass, size, inclination
and redshift. This paper presents the sample selection, observational set-up, data reduction
strategy, and a first analysis of the sizes and structural properties of the HI disks. We find that
the HI-rich galaxies lie on the same HI mass versus HI size relation as normal spiral galaxies, extending
it to total HI masses of $2 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and radii R1 of $\sim 100$ kpc (where R1 is defined
as the radius where the HI column density reaches 1 $M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). HI-rich galaxies have
significantly larger values of HI-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass, concentration
index, stellar and star formation rate surface density compared to the control sample. The disks
of HI-rich galaxies are also significantly more clumpy (i.e. have higher HI Gini and $\Delta$Area
coefficient) than those of normal spirals. There is no evidence that the disks of HI-rich galaxies
are more disturbed: HI-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to control samples in their
distributions of HI asymmetry indices or optical/HI disk position angle differences. In fact,
the center of the HI distribution corresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in
the HI-rich galaxies than in the controls. All these results argue against a scenario in which new
gas has been brought in by mergers. It is possible that they may be more consistent with cooling from
a surrounding quasi-static halo of warm/hot gas.
