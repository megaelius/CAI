We present Keck/OSIRIS laser guide-star assisted adaptive optics (LGSAO) integral field spectroscopy
of [O III] 5007 Angstrom nebular emission from twelve galaxies hosting optically faint (R = 20 - 25;
nuLnu ~ 10^44 -10^46 erg/s) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at redshift z ~ 2 - 3. In combination with
deep Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 rest-frame optical imaging, Keck/MOSFIRE rest-optical
spectroscopy, and Keck/KCWI rest-UV integral field spectroscopy we demonstrate that both the
continuum and emission-line structure of these sources exhibit a wide range of morphologies from
compact isolated point sources to double-AGN merging systems with extensive ~ 50 kpc tidal tails.
One of the twelve galaxies previously known to exhibit a proximate damped LyA system coincident
in redshift with the galaxy shows evidence for both an extended [O III] narrow-line emission region
and spatially offset LyA emission (with morphologically distinct blueshifted and redshifted
components) indicative of large scale gas flows photoionized by the central AGN. We do not find widespread
evidence of star formation in the host galaxies surrounding these AGN; the [O III] velocity dispersions
tend to be high (sigma = 100 - 500 km/s), the continuum morphologies are much more compact than a mass-matched
star forming comparison sample, and the diagnostic nebular emission line ratios are dominated
by an AGN-like ionizing spectrum. The sample is most consistent with a population of AGN that radiate
at approximately their Eddington limit and photoionize extended [O III] nebulae whose characteristic
sizes scale approximately as the square root of the AGN luminosity.
