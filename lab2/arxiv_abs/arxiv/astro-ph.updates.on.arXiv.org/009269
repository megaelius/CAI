The signature of wind patterns caused by the interplay of rotation and energy redistribution in
hot Jupiters is detectable at high spectral resolution, yet no direct comparison has been attempted
between predictions from general circulation models (GCMs) and observed high-resolution spectra.
We present the first of such comparisons on near-infrared transmission spectra of the hot Jupiter
HD 189733b. Exploring twelve rotation rates and two chemical regimes, we have created model spectra
from 3-D GCMs and cross-correlated them with the observed spectra. Comparing our models against
those of HD 189733b, we obtain three key results: (1) we confirm CO and H$_2$O in the planet's atmosphere
at a detection significance of 8.2$\sigma$; (2) we recover the signature of $\sim$km/s day-to-night
winds at $\sim$mbar pressures; and (3) we constrain the rotation period of the planet to between
1.2 and 4.69 days (synchronous rotation (2.2 days) remains consistent with existing observations).
Our results do not suffer from the shortcomings of 1-D models as cross correlation templates - mainly
that these models tend to over-constrain the slower rotation rates and show evidence for anomalous
blue shifts. Our 3-D models instead match the observed line-of-sight velocity of this planet by
self-consistently including the effects of high-altitude day-to-night winds. Overall, we find
a high degree of consistency between HD 189733b observations and our GCM-based spectra, implying
that the physics and chemistry are adequately described in current 3-D forward models for the purpose
of interpreting observations at high spectral resolution.
