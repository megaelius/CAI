We present new methodological features and physical ingredients included in the 1D radiative transfer
code HELIOS, improving the hemispheric two-stream formalism. We conduct a thorough intercomparison
survey with several established forward models, including COOLTLUSTY, PHOENIX, and find satisfactory
consistency with their results. Then, we explore the impact of (i) different groups of opacity sources,
(ii) a stellar path length adjustment, and (iii) a scattering correction on self-consistently
calculated atmospheric temperatures and planetary emission spectra. First, we observe that temperature-pressure
(T-P) profiles are very sensitive to the opacities included, with metal oxides, hydrides, the alkali
atoms (and ionized hydrogen) playing an important role for the absorption of shortwave radiation
(in very hot surroundings). Moreover, if these species are sufficiently abundant, they are likely
to induce non-monotonic T-P profiles. Second, without the stellar path length adjustment, the
incoming stellar flux is significantly underestimated for zenith angles above 80{\deg}, which
somewhat affects the upper atmospheric temperatures and the planetary emission. Third, the scattering
correction improves the accuracy of the computation of the reflected stellar light by ~10%. We use
HELIOS to calculate a grid of cloud-free atmospheres in radiative-convective equilibrium for
self-luminous planets for a range of effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities,
and C/O ratios, to be used by planetary evolution studies. Furthermore, we calculate dayside temperatures
and secondary eclipse spectra for a sample of exoplanets for varying chemistry and heat redistribution.
These results may be used to make predictions on the feasibility of atmospheric characterizations
with future observations.
