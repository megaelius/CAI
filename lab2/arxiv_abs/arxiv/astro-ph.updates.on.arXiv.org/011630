A prominent jet-driven outflow of CO(2-1) molecular gas is found along the kinematic minor axis
of the Seyfert 2 galaxy ESO 420-G13, at a distance of $340-600\, \rm{pc}$ from the nucleus. The wind
morphology resembles a characteristic funnel shape, formed by a highly collimated filamentary
emission at the base, likely tracing the jet propagation through a tenuous medium, until a bifurcation
point at $440\, \rm{pc}$ where the jet hits a dense molecular core and shatters, dispersing the molecular
gas into several clumps and filaments within the expansion cone. We also trace the jet in ionised
gas within the inner $\lesssim 340\, \rm{pc}$ using the [NeII]$_{\rm 12.8 \mu m}$ line emission,
where the molecular gas follows a circular rotation pattern. The wind outflow carries a mass of $\sim
8 \times 10^6\, \rm{M_\odot}$ at an average wind projected speed of $\sim 160\, \rm{km\,s^{-1}}$,
which implies a mass outflow rate of $\sim 14\, \rm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. Based on the structure
of the outflow and the budget of energy and momentum, we discard radiation pressure from the active
nucleus, star formation, and supernovae as possible launching mechanisms. ESO 420-G13 is the second
case after NGC 1377 where the presence of a previously unknown jet is revealed due to its interaction
with the interstellar medium, suggesting that unknown jets in feeble radio nuclei might be more
common than expected. Two possible jet-cloud configurations are discussed to explain the presence
of an outflow at such distance from the AGN. The outflowing gas will likely not escape, thus a delay
in the star formation rather than quenching is expected from this interaction, while the feedback
effect would be confined within the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy.
