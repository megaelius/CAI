Micro-physical processes on interstellar dust surfaces are tightly connected to dust properties
(i.e. dust composition, size and shape) and play a key role in numerous phenomena in the interstellar
medium (ISM). The large disparity in physical conditions (i.e. density, gas temperature) in the
ISM triggers an evolution of dust properties. The analysis of how dust evolves with the physical
conditions is a stepping-stone towards a more thorough understanding of interstellar dust. The
aim of this paper is to highlight dust evolution in the Horsehead Nebula PDR region. We use Spitzer/IRAC
(3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 {\mu}m), Spitzer/MIPS (24 {\mu}m) together with Herschel/PACS (70 and 160 {\mu}m)
and Herschel/SPIRE (250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m) to map the spatial distribution of dust in the Horsehead
over the entire emission spectral range. We model dust emission and scattering using the THEMIS
interstellar dust model together with the 3D radiative transfer code SOC. We find that the nano-grains
dust-to-gas ratio in the irradiated outer part of the Horsehead is 6 to 10 times lower than in the diffuse
ISM. Their minimum size is 2 to 2.25 times larger than in the diffuse ISM and the power-law exponent
of their size distribution, 1.1 to 1.4 times lower than in the diffuse ISM. Regarding the denser part
of the Horsehead, it is necessary to use evolved grains (i.e. aggregates, with or without an ice mantle).
It is not possible to explain the observations using grains from the diffuse medium. We therefore
propose the following scenario to explain our results. In the outer part of the Horsehead, all the
nano-grains have not yet had time to re-form completely through photo-fragmentation of aggregates
and the smallest of the nano-grains that are sensitive to the radiation field are photo-destroyed.
In the inner part of the Horsehead, grains most likely consist of multi-compositional, mantled
aggregates.
