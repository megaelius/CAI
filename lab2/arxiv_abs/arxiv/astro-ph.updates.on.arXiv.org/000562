In setting up initial conditions for ensembles of cosmological N-body simulations there are, fundamentally,
two choices: either maximizing the correspondence of the initial density field to the assumed fourier-space
clustering or, instead, matching to real-space statistics and allowing the DC mode (i.e. overdensity)
to vary from box to box as it would in the real universe. As a stringent test of both approaches, I perform
ensembles of simulations using power law and a "powerlaw times a bump" model inspired by baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO), exploiting the self-similarity of these initial conditions to quantify the
accuracy of the matter-matter two-point correlation results. The real-space method, which was
originally proposed by Pen 1997 and implemented by Sirko 2005, performed well in producing the expected
self-similar behavior and corroborated the non-linear evolution of the BAO feature observed in
conventional simulations, even in the strongly-clustered regime (sigma8 >= 1). In revisiting
the real-space method championed by Sirko 2005, it was also noticed that this earlier study overlooked
an important integral constraint correction to the correlation function in results from the conventional
approach that can be important in LambdaCDM simulations with Lbox =< 1 Gpc/h and on scales r >=
Lbox / 10. Rectifying this shows that the fourier space and real space methods are about equally accurate
and efficient for modeling the evolution and growth of the correlation function, contrary to previous
claims. An appendix provides a useful independent-of-epoch analytic formula for estimating the
importance of the integral constraint bias on correlation function measurements in LambdaCDM
simulations.
