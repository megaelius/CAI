TANAMI is a multiwavelength program monitoring active galactic nuclei (AGN) south of -30deg declination
including high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) imaging, radio, optical/UV,
X-ray and gamma-ray studies. We have previously published first-epoch 8.4GHz VLBI images of the
parsec-scale structure of the initial sample. In this paper, we present images of 39 additional
sources. The full sample comprises most of the radio- and gamma-ray brightest AGN in the southern
quarter of the sky, overlapping with the region from which high-energy (>100TeV) neutrino events
have been found. We characterize the parsec-scale radio properties of the jets and compare with
the quasi-simultaneous Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data. Furthermore, we study the jet properties of
sources which are in positional coincidence with high-energy neutrino events as compared to the
full sample. We test the positional agreement of high-energy neutrino events with various AGN samples.
Our observations yield the first images of many jets below -30deg declination at milliarcsecond
resolution. We find that gamma-ray loud TANAMI sources tend to be more compact on parsec-scales
and have higher core brightness temperatures than gamma-ray faint jets, indicating higher Doppler
factors. No significant structural difference is found between sources in positional coincidence
with high-energy neutrino events and other TANAMI jets. The 22 gamma-ray brightest AGN in the TANAMI
sky show only a weak positional agreement with high-energy neutrinos demonstrating that the >100TeV
IceCube signal is not simply dominated by a small number of the $\gamma$-ray brightest blazars.
Instead, a larger number of sources have to contribute to the signal with each individual source
having only a small Poisson probability for producing an event in multi-year integrations of current
neutrino detectors.
