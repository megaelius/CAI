Beginning in 2012, NASA utilized a strategic process to identify broad societal questions, or grand
challenges, that are well suited to the aerospace sector and align with national priorities. This
effort generated NASA's first grand challenge, the Asteroid Grand Challenge, a large scale effort
using multidisciplinary collaborations and innovative engagement mechanisms focused on finding
and addressing asteroid threats to human populations. In April 2010, President Barack Obama announced
a mission to send humans to an asteroid by 2025. This resulted in the agency's Asteroid Redirect Mission
to leverage and maximize existing robotic and human efforts to capture and reroute an asteroid,
with the goal of eventual human exploration. The AGC, initiated in 2013, complemented ARM by expanding
public participation, partnerships, and other approaches to find, understand, and overcome these
potentially harmful asteroids. This paper describes a selection of AGC activities implemented
from 2013 to 2017 and their results, excluding those conducted by NASA's Near Earth Object Observations
Program and other organizations. The strategic development of the initiative is outlined as well
as initial successes, strengths, and weaknesses resulting from the first four years of AGC activities
and approaches. Finally, we describe lesson learned and areas for continued work and study. The
AGC lessons learned and strategies could inform the work of other agencies and organizations seeking
to conduct a global scientific investigation with matrixed organizational support, multiple
strategic partners, and numerous internal and external open innovation approaches and audiences.
