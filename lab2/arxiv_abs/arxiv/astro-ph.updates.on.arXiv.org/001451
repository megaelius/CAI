We report the detection of extremely broad emission toward two molecular clumps in the Galactic
central molecular zone. We have mapped the Sagittarius C complex ($-0^\circ.61 < l < -0^\circ.27$,
$-0^\circ.29 < b < 0^\circ.04$) in the HCN $J$ = 4--3, $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ $J$ = 3--2, and $\mathrm{H^{13}CN}$
$J$ = 1--0 lines with the ASTE 10 m and NRO 45 m telescopes, detecting bright emission with $80\mbox{--}120$\
$\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ velocity width (in full-width at zero intensity) toward CO$-0.30$$-0.07$
and CO$-0.40$$-0.22$, which are high velocity compact clouds (HVCCs) identified with our previous
CO $J$ = 3--2 survey. Our data reveal an interesting internal structure of CO$-0.30$$-0.07$ comprising
a pair of high velocity lobes. The spatial-velocity structure of CO$-0.40$$-0.22$ can be also understood
as multiple velocity component, or a velocity gradient across the cloud. They are both located on
the rims of two molecular shells of about 10 pc in radius. Kinetic energies of CO$-0.30$$-0.07$ and
CO$-0.40$$-0.22$ are $\left(0.8\mbox{--}2\right)\times10^{49}$ erg and $\left(1\mbox{--}4\right)\times10^{49}$
erg, respectively. We propose several interpretations of their broad emission: collision between
clouds associated with the shells, bipolar outflow, expansion driven by supernovae (SNe), and
rotation around a dark massive object. There scenarios cannot be discriminated because of the insufficient
angular resolution of our data, though the absence of visible energy sources associated with the
HVCCs seems to favor the cloud--cloud collision scenario. Kinetic energies of the two molecular
shells are $1\times10^{51}$ erg and $0.7\times10^{51}$ erg, which can be furnished by multiple
SN or hypernova explosions in $2\times10^5$ yr. These shells are candidates of molecular superbubbles
created after past active star formation.
