Current searches for gravitational waves from coalescing binary black holes (BBH) use templates
that only include the dominant harmonic. In this study we use effective-one-body multipolar waveforms
calibrated to numerical-relativity simulations to quantify the effect of neglecting sub-dominant
harmonics on the sensitivity of searches. We consider both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the
signal-based vetoes that are used to re-weight SNR. We find that neglecting sub-dominant modes
when searching for non-spinning BBHs with component masses $3\,M_{\odot} \leq m_1, m_2 \leq 200\,M_{\odot}$
and total mass $M < 360\,M_{\odot}$ in advanced LIGO results in a negligible reduction of the
re-weighted SNR at detection thresholds. Sub-dominant modes therefore have no effect on the detection
rates predicted for advanced LIGO. Furthermore, we find that if sub-dominant modes are included
in templates the sensitivity of the search becomes worse if we use current search priors, due to an
increase in false alarm probability. Templates would need to be weighted differently than what
is currently done to compensate for the increase in false alarms. If we split the template bank such
that sub-dominant modes are only used when $M \gtrsim 100\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $q \gtrsim
4$, we find that the sensitivity does improve for these intermediate mass-ratio BBHs, but the sensitive
volume associated with these systems is still small compared to equal-mass systems. Using sub-dominant
modes is therefore unlikely to substantially increase the probability of detecting gravitational
waves from non-spinning BBH signals unless there is a relatively large population of intermediate
mass-ratio BBHs in the universe.
