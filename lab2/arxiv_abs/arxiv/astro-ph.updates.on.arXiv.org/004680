Primordial nucleosynthesis is one of the three historical evidences for the big bang model, together
with the expansion of the universe and the cosmic microwave background. Now that the number of neutrino
families and the baryonic densities have been fixed by laboratory measurements or CMB observations,
the model has no free parameter and its predictions are rigid. Departure from its predictions could
provide hints or constraints on new physics or astrophysics in the early universe. Precision on
primordial abundances deduced from observations have recently been drastically improved and
reach the percent level for both deuterium and helium-4. Accordingly, the BBN predictions should
reach the same level of precision. For most isotopes, the dominant sources of uncertainty come from
those on the laboratory thermonuclear reactions. This article focuses on helium-4 whose predicted
primordial abundance depends essentially on weak interactions which control the neutron-proton
ratio. The rates of the various weak interaction processes depend on the experimentally measured
neutron lifetime, but also includes numerous corrections that we thoroughly investigate here.
They are the radiative, zero-temperature, corrections, finite nucleon mass corrections, finite
temperature radiative corrections, weak-magnetism, and QED plasma effects, which are for the
first time all included and calculated in a self consistent way, allowing to take into account the
correlations between them, and verifying that all satisfy detailed balance. The helium-4 predicted
mass fraction is $0.24709\pm0.00017$. In addition, we provide a Mathematica code (PRIMAT) that
incorporates, not only these corrections but also a full network of reactions, using the best available
thermonuclear reaction rates, allowing the predictions of primordial abundances up to the CNO
region.
