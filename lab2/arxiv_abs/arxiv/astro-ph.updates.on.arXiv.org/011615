Reactions with radioactive nuclear beams at relativistic energies have opened new doors to clarify
the mechanisms of stellar evolution and cataclysmic events in stars and during the big bang epoch.
Numerous nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest cannot be assessed directly in laboratory
experiments. In this contribution, we make a short review of the limitations of experiments and
of the theoretical methods needed to understand the physics of stars, adding to the knowledge inferred
from astronomical observations. We continue by introducing a more detailed description of how
the use of relativistic radioactive beams can help to solve astrophysical puzzles and several successful
experimental methods. State-of-the-art theories are discussed at some length with the purpose
of helping us understand the experimental results reported. The review is not complete and we have
focused most of it to traditional methods aiming at the determination of the equation of state of
symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter and the role of the symmetry energy. Whenever possible,
under the limitations of our present understanding of experimental data and theory, we try to pinpoint
the information still missing to further understand how stars evolve, explode, and how their internal
structure might be. We try to convey the idea that in order to improve microscopic theories for many-body
calculations, nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, and astrophysics, and in order to constrain
and allow for convergence of our understanding of stars, we still need considerable improvements
in terms of accuracy of experiments and the development of new and dedicated nuclear facilities
to study relativistic reactions with radioactive beams.
