A wealth of tiny galaxies populates the surroundings of the Milky Way. Some of these objects might
have their origin as former satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Examples of the importance
of understanding how many systems are genuine satellites of the MW or the LMC are the implications
that the number and mass function of satellites have for dark matter theories and the treatment of
baryonic physics in simulations of structure formation. Here we aim at deriving the bulk motions
and estimates of the internal velocity dispersion and metallicity properties in four recently
discovered distant southern dwarf galaxy candidates, Columba I, Reticulum III, Phoenix II and
Horologium II. We combine Gaia DR2 astrometric measurements, photometry and new FLAMES spectroscopic
data in the region of the CaII triplet lines; such combination is essential for finding potential
member stars in these low luminosity systems. We find very likely member stars in all four satellites
and are able to determine (or place limits on) the systems bulk motions and average internal properties.
The systems are found to be very metal-poor, in agreement with dwarf galaxies and dwarf galaxy candidates
of similar luminosity. The only system that we can place firmly in the category of dwarf galaxies
is Phx II, given its resolved large velocity dispersion ($9.5_{-4.4}^{+6.8}$ km/s) and intrinsic
metallicity spread (0.33 dex). Also for Col I we measure a clear metallicity spread. The orbital
pole of Phx II is well constrained and close to that of the LMC, suggesting a prior association. The
uncertainty on the orbital poles of the other systems are presently very large, so that an association
cannot be excluded, apart from Col I. Using the numbers of potential former satellites of the LMC
identified here and in the literature, we obtain for the LMC a dark matter mass of M$_{200}=1.9_{-0.9}^{+1.3}\times10^{11}$
M$_\odot$.
