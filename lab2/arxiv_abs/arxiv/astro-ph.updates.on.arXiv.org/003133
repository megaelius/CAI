The covariance matrix of the matter and halo power spectrum and bispectrum are studied. Using a large
suite of simulations, we find that the non-Gaussianity in the covariance is significant already
at mildly nonlinear scales. We compute the leading disconnected non-Gaussian correction to the
matter bispectrum covariance using perturbation theory, and find that the corrections result
in good agreement in the mildly nonlinear regime. The shot noise contribution to the halo power spectrum
and bispectrum covariance is computed using the Poisson model, and the model yields decent agreement
with simulation results. However, when the shot noise is estimated from the individual realization,
which is usually done in reality, we find that the halo covariance is substantially reduced and gets
close to the Gaussian covariance. This is because most of the non-Gaussianity in the covariance
arises from the fluctuations in the Poisson shot noise. We use the measured non-Gaussian covariance
to access the information content of the power spectrum and bispectrum. The signal-to-noise ratio,
S/N, of the matter and halo power spectrum levels off in the mildly nonlinear regime, $k \sim 0.1 -
0.2 \,\mathrm{Mpc} h^{-1}$. In the nonlinear regime the S/N of the matter and halo bispectrum increases
but much slower than the Gaussian results suggest. We find that both the S/N for power spectrum and
bispectrum are overestimated by the Gaussian covariances, but the problem being much more serious
for the bispectrum. Because the bispectrum is affected strongly by nonlinearity and shot noise,
inclusion of the bispectrum only adds modest amount of S/N compared to that of the power spectrum.
