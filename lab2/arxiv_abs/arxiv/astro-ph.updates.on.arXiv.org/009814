Circumbinary Planets (CBPs) can be misaligned with their host binary stars. Orbital dynamics,
simulations, and recent observations of proto-planetary disks all suggest that the planet can
stably orbit in a plane perpendicular to that of an eccentric host binary star (i.e., a polar orbit).
No solid claim of detection of such a configuration has been made; the nine systems detected by the
transit technique are nearly coplanar, but their discovery is also biased towards that configuration.
Here, we develop Eclipse Timing Variations (ETVs) as a method to detect misaligned CBPs. We find
that since apsidal motion (periastron precession) of the host binary is prograde for a coplanar
planet and retrograde for a polar planet, the mean eclipse period of primary and secondary eclipses
differ in a way that distinguishes those configurations. Secondly, the Eclipse Duration Variations
(EDVs) vary in a way that can confirm that inference, over and against a polar model. Thirdly, the
relative phasing of primary and secondary ETVs on the planet's orbital timescale also distinguishes
the two configurations, which we explain analytically and quantify through a grid of numerical
models. We apply these methods to Kepler-34, a transiting planet known to be nearly coplanar by detailed
photodynamic modeling. In this system, we find that the binary eclipse times alone suffice to distinguish
these orbital configurations, using the effects introduced here. Our work provides a tool for discovering
potential polar CBPs, or misaligned CBPs of milder inclinations, from the existing ETV dataset
of the Kepler, as well as future observations by TESS or PLATO.
