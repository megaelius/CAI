In large-scale optical spectroscopic surveys, there are many objects found to have multiple redshift
measurements due to the weakness of their emission lines and the different automatic identification
algorithms used. These include some suspicious high-redshift (z >= 5) active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
Here we present a method for inspecting the high-redshift identification of such sources provided
that they are radio-loud and have very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging observations
of their milli-arcsec (mas) scale jet structure available at multiple epochs. The method is based
on the determination of jet component proper motions, and the fact that the combination of jet physics
(the observed maximal values of the bulk Lorentz factor) and cosmology (the time dilation of observed
phenomena in the early Universe) constrain the possible values of apparent proper motions. As an
example, we present the case of the quasar J2346+0705 that was reported with two different redshifts,
$z_{1} = 5.063$ and $z_{2} = 0.171$, in the literature. We measured the apparent proper motions ($\mu$)
of three components identified in its radio jet by utilizing VLBI data taken from 2014 to 2018. We
obtained $\mu_{J1} = 0.334 \pm 0.099$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\mu_{J2} = 0.116 \pm 0.029$ mas yr$^{-1}$,
and $\mu_{J3} = 0.060 \pm 0.005$ mas yr$^{-1}$. The maximal proper motion is converted to an apparent
transverse speed of $\beta_{\rm app} = 41.2\pm12.2\,c$. if the source is at redshift 5.063. This
value exceeds the blazar jet speeds known to date. This and other arguments suggest that J2346+0705
is hosted by a low-redshift galaxy. Our method may be applicable for other high-redshift AGN candidates
lacking unambiguous spectroscopic redshift determination or having photometric redshift estimates
only, but showing prominent radio jets allowing for VLBI measurements of fast jet proper motions.
