The polarization transfer coefficients of a relativistic magnetized plasma are derived. These
results apply to any momentum distribution function of the particles, isotropic or anisotropic.
Particles interact with the radiation either in a non resonant mode when the frequency of the radiation
exceeds their characteristic synchrotron emission frequency, or quasi resonantly otherwise.
These two classes of particles contribute differently to the polarization transfer coefficients.
For a given frequency, this dichotomy corresponds to a regime change in the dependence of the transfer
coefficients on the parameters of the particle s population. The derivation of the transfer coefficients
involves an exact expression of the conductivity tensor of the relativistic magnetized plasma
that has not been used hitherto in this context. Suitable expansions valid at frequencies larger
than the cyclotron frequency allow us to analytically perform the summation over all resonances
at high harmonics of the relativistic gyrofrequency. The transfer coefficients are represented
in the form of two variable integrals that can be conveniently computed for any set of parameters
by using Olver s expansion of high order Bessel functions. We particularize our results to a number
of distribution functions, isotropic, thermal or powerlaw, with different multipolar anisotropies
of low order, or strongly beamed. For isotropic distributions, the Faraday coefficients are expressed
in the form of a one variable quadrature over energy, for which we provide the kernels in the high-frequency
limit and in the asymptotic low-frequency limit. A similar reduction to a one-variable quadrature
over energy is derived at high frequency for a large class of anisotropic distribution functions
that may form a basis on which any smoothly anisotropic distribution could be expanded.
