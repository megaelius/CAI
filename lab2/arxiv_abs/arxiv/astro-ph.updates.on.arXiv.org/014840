High-resolution numerical simulations including feedback and aimed at calculating the escape
fraction (fesc) of hydrogen-ionizing photons often assume stellar radiation based on single-stellar
population synthesis models. However, strong evidence suggests the binary fraction of massive
stars is 70%. Moreover, simulations so far yield values of fesc falling only on the lower end of the
roughly 10-20% range, the amount presumed necessary to reionize the Universe. Analyzing a high-resolution
(4 pc) cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulation we study how fesc changes when we include
two different products of binary stellar evolution - stars stripped of their hydrogen envelopes
and massive blue stragglers. Both produce significant amounts of ionizing photons 10-200 Myr after
each starburst. We find the relative importance of these photons are amplified with respect to escaped
ionizing photons, because peaks in star formation rates (SFRs) and fesc are often out of phase by
this 10-200 Myr. Additionally, low mass, bursty galaxies emit Lyman continuum radiation primarily
from binary products when SFRs are low. Observations of these galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope
could provide crucial information on the evolution of binary stars as a function of redshift. Overall,
including stripped stars and massive blue stragglers increases our photon-weighted mean escape
fraction by around 13% and 10%, respectively, resulting in a mean fesc of 17%. Our results emphasize
that using updated stellar population synthesis models with binary stellar evolution provides
a more sound physical basis for stellar reionization.
