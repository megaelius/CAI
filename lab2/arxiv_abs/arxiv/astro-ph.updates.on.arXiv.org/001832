We discuss complete theory of spin-1/2 electron-positron quantum plasmas, when electrons and
positrons move with velocities mach smaller than the speed of light. We derive a set of two fluid quantum
hydrodynamic equations consisting of the continuity, Euler, spin (magnetic moment) evolution
equations for each species. We explicitly include the Coulomb, spin-spin, Darwin and annihilation
interactions. The annihilation interaction is the main topic of the paper. We consider contribution
of the annihilation interaction in the quantum hydrodynamic equations and in spectrum of waves
in magnetized electron-positron plasmas. We consider propagation of waves parallel and perpendicular
to an external magnetic field. We also consider oblique propagation of longitudinal waves. We derive
set of quantum kinetic equations for electron-positron plasmas with the Darwin and annihilation
interactions. We apply the kinetic theory for the linear wave behavior in absence of external fields.
We calculate contribution of the Darwin and annihilation interactions in the Landau damping of
the Langmuir waves. We should mention that the annihilation interaction does not change number
of particles in the system. It does not related to annihilation itself, but it exists as a result of
interaction of an electron-positron pair via conversion of the pair into virtual photon. A pair
of the non-linear Schrodinger equations for electron-positron plasmas including the Darwin and
annihilation interactions. Existence of conserving helicity in electron-positron quantum plasmas
of spinning particles with the Darwin and annihilation interactions is demonstrated. We show that
annihilation interaction plays an important role in quantum electron-positron plasmas giving
contribution of the same magnitude as the spin-spin interaction.
