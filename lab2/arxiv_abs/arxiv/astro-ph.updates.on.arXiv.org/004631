We present here the results on the physical nature a RS CVn binary KIC 7885570 and its chromospheric
activity based on the Kepler Mission data. Assuming the primary component temperature, 6530 K,
the temperature of the secondary component was found to be 5732+-4 K. The mass ratio of the components
(q) was found to be 0.43$\pm$0.01, while the inclination ($i$) of the system 80.56+-0.01 deg. Additionally,
the data were separated into 35 subsets to model the sinusoidal variation due to the rotational modulation,
using the SPOTMODEL program, as the light curve analysis indicated the chromospherically active
secondary component. It was found that there are generally two spotted areas, whose radii, longitudes
and latitudes are rapidly changing, located around the latitudes of +50 deg and +90 deg on the active
component. Moreover, 113 flares were detected and their parameters were computed from the available
data. The One Phase Exponential Association function model was derived from the parameters of these
flares. Using the regression calculations, the Plateau value was found to be 1.9815+-0.1177, while
the half-life value was computed as 3977.2 s. In addition, the flare frequency (N1) - the flare number
per hour, was estimated to be 0.00362 1/h, while flare frequency (N2) - the flare-equivalent duration
emitted per hour, was computed as 0.00001. Finally, the times of eclipses were computed for 278 minima
of the light curves, whose analysis indicated that the chromosphere activity nature of the system
causes some effects on these minima times. Comparing the chromospheric activity patterns with
the analogues of the secondary component, it is seen that the magnetic activity level is remarkably
low. However, it is still at the expected level according to the B-V color index of 0.643 mag for the
secondary component.
