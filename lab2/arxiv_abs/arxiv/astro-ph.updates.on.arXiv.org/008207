We re-examine the statistical confirmation of small long-period Kepler planet candidates in light
of recent improvements in our understanding of the occurrence of systematic false alarms in this
regime. Using the final Data Release 25 (DR25) Kepler planet candidate catalog statistics, we find
that the previously confirmed single planet system Kepler-452b no longer achieves a 99% confidence
in the planetary hypothesis and is not considered statistically validated in agreement with the
finding of Mullally et al. (2018). For multiple planet systems, we find that the planet prior enhancement
for belonging to a multiple planet system is suppressed relative to previous Kepler catalogs, and
we identify the multi-planet system member, Kepler-186f, no longer achieves a 99% confidence in
the planetary hypothesis. Because of the numerous confounding factors in the data analysis process
that leads to the detection and characterization of a signal, it is difficult to determine whether
any one planetary candidate achieves a strict criterion for confirmation relative to systematic
false alarms. For instance, when taking into account a simplified model of processing variations,
the additional single planet systems Kepler-443b, Kepler-441b, Kepler-1633b, Kepler-1178b,
and Kepler-1653b have a non-negligible probability of falling below a 99% confidence in the planetary
hypothesis. The systematic false alarm hypothesis must be taken into account when employing statistical
validation techniques in order to confirm planet candidates that approach the detection threshold
of a survey. We encourage those performing transit searches of K2, TESS, and other similar data sets
to quantify their systematic false alarms rates. Alternatively, independent photometric detection
of the transit signal or radial velocity measurements can eliminate the false alarm hypothesis.
