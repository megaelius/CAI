Aims: This paper has two main objectives: (1) To determine the intrinsic properties of 16 faint and
mostly unstudied open clusters in the poorly known sector of the Galaxy at 270$^\circ-$300$^\circ$,
to probe the Milky Way structure in future investigations. (2) To address previously reported systematics
in Gaia DR2 parallaxes by comparing the cluster distances derived from photometry with those derived
from parallaxes. Methods: Deep UBVI photometry of 16 open clusters was carried out. Observations
were reduced and analyzed in an automaticway using the ASteCA package to get individual distances,
reddening, masses, ages and metallicities. Photometric distances were compared to those obtained
from a Bayesian analysis of Gaia DR2 parallaxes. Results: Ten out of the 16 clusters are true or highly
probable open clusters. Two of them are quite young and follow the trace of the Carina Arm and the already
detected warp. The rest of the clusters are placed in the interarm zone between the Perseus and Carina
Arms as expected for older objects. We found that the cluster van den Berg-Hagen 85 is 7.5$\times$10$^9$
yrs old becoming then one of the oldest open cluster detected in our Galaxy so far. The relationship
of these ten clusters with the Galaxy structure in the solar neighborhood is discussed. The comparison
of distances from photometry and parallaxes data, in turn, reveals a variable level of disagreement.
Conclusions: Various zero point corrections for Gaia DR2 parallax data recently reported were
considered for a comparison between photometric and parallax based distances. The results tend
to improve with some of these corrections. Photometric distance analysis suggest an average correction
of $\sim$+0.026 mas (to be added to the parallaxes). The correction may have a more intricate distance
dependency, but addressing that level of detail will require a larger cluster sample.
