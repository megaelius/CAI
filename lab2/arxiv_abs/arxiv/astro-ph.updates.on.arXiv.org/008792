Observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters in the local universe can account for only $\sim\,10\%$
of the total baryon content. Cosmological simulations predict that the `missing baryons' are spread
throughout filamentary structures in the cosmic web, forming a low-density gas with temperatures
of $10^5-10^7\,\!$K. We search for this warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) by stacking the Planck
Compton $y$-parameter map of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect for 1,002,334 pairs
of CMASS galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We model the contribution from the galaxy halo
pairs assuming spherical symmetry, finding a residual tSZ signal at the $2.9\mbox{$\sigma$}$
level from a stacked filament of length $10.5\,h^{-1}\,\rm Mpc$ with a Compton parameter magnitude
$y=(0.6\pm0.2)\times10^{-8}$. We consider possible sources of contamination and conclude that
bound gas in haloes may contribute only up to $20\%$ of the measured filamentary signal. To estimate
the filament gas properties we measure the gravitational lensing signal for the same sample of galaxy
pairs; in combination with the tSZ signal, this yields an inferred gas density of $\rho_{\rm b}=(5.5\pm
2.9)\times\bar{\rho_{\rm b}}$ with a temperature $T=(2.7\pm 1.7) \times 10^6\,$K. This result
is consistent with the predicted WHIM properties, and overall the filamentary gas can account for
$ 11\pm 7\%$ of the total baryon content of the Universe. We also see evidence that the gas filament
extends beyond the galaxy pair. Averaging over this longer baseline boosts the significance of
the tSZ signal and increases the associated baryon content to $28\pm 12\%$ of the global value.
