Collisionless magnetic reconnection is a prime candidate to account for flare-like or steady emission,
outflow launching, or plasma heating, in a variety of high-energy astrophysical objects, including
ones with relativistic ion-electron plasmas. But the fate of the initial magnetic energy in a reconnection
event remains poorly known: what is the amount given to kinetic energy, the ion/electron repartition,
and the hardness of the particle distributions? We explore these questions with 2D particle-in-cell
simulations of ion-electron plasmas. We find that 45 to 75% of the total initial magnetic energy
ends up in kinetic energy, this fraction increasing with the inflow magnetization. Depending on
the guide field strength, ions get from 30 to 60% of the total kinetic energy. Particles can be separated
into two populations that only weakly mix: (i) particles initially in the current sheet, heated
by its initial tearing and subsequent contraction of the islands; and (ii) particles from the background
plasma that primarily gain energy via the reconnection electric field when passing near the X-point.
Particles (ii) tend to form a power-law with an index $p=-d\log n(\gamma)/d\log\gamma$, that depends
mostly on the inflow Alfv\'en speed $V_A$ and magnetization $\sigma_s$ of species $s$, with for
electrons $p=5$ to $1.2$ for increasing $\sigma_e$. The highest particle Lorentz factor, for ions
or electrons, increases roughly linearly with time for all the relativistic simulations. This
is faster, and the spectra can be harder, than for collisionless shock acceleration. We discuss
applications to microquasar and AGN coronae, to extragalactic jets, and to radio lobes. We point
out situations where effects such as Compton drag or pair creation are important.
