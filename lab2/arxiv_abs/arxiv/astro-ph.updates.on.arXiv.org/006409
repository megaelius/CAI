We present photometric models of 532 disk galaxies in 3.6{\mu}m images from the Spitzer Survey of
Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) using the non-parametric DiskFit algorithm. We first test
DiskFit's performance on 400 synthetic S$^4$G-like galaxy images. DiskFit is unreliable in the
bulge region, but accurately disentangles exponential disks from Ferrers bars farther out as long
as their position angles differ by more than 5${^\circ}$. We then proceed to model the S$^4$G galaxies,
successfully fitting 489 of them using an automated approach for initializing DiskFit, optimizing
the model and deriving uncertainties using a bootstrap-resampling technique. The resulting component
geometries and surface brightness profiles are compared to those derived by Salo et al. (2015) using
the parametric model galfit. We find generally good agreement between the models, but discrepancies
between best-fitting values for individual systems are often significant: the choice of algorithm
clearly impacts the inferred disk and bar structure. In particular, we find that DiskFit typically
assigns more light to the bar and less light to the disk relative to the Ferrers and exponential profiles
presented by Salo et al. (2015) in the bar region. Given DiskFit's reliability at disentangling
these components in our synthetic images, we conclude that the surface brightness distributions
of barred S$^4$G galaxies are not well-represented by these functional forms. The results presented
here underscore the importance of validating photometric decomposition algorithms before applying
them to real data and the utility of DiskFit's non-parametric approach at measuring the structure
of disks and bars in nearby galaxies.
