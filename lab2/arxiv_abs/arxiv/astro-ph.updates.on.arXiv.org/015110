Gaia benchmark stars are selected to be calibration stars for different spectroscopic surveys.
Very high-quality and homogeneous spectroscopic data for these stars are therefore required.
We collected ultrahigh-resolution ESPRESSO spectra for 30 of the 34 Gaia benchmark stars and made
them public. We quantify the consistency of the results that are obtained with different high-,
and ultrahigh-resolution spectrographs. We also comprehensively studied the effect of using
different spectral reduction products of ESPRESSO on the final spectroscopic results. We used
ultrahigh- and high-resolution spectra obtained with the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectrographs
to measure spectral line characteristics (line depth; line width; and EW) and determined stellar
parameters and abundances for a subset of 11 Gaia benchmark stars. We used the ARES code for automatic
measurements of the spectral line parameters. Our measurements reveal that the same individual
spectral lines measured from adjacent 2D echelle orders of ESPRESSO spectra differ slightly in
line depth and line width. When a long list of spectral lines is considered, the EW measurements based
on the 2D and 1D (the final spectral product) ESPRESSO spectra agree very well. The EW spectral line
measurements based on the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectra also agree to within a few percent.
However, we note that the lines appear deeper in the ESPRESSO spectra than in PEPSI and HARPS. The
stellar parameters derived from each spectrograph by combining the several available spectra
agree well overall. We conclude that the ESPRESSO, PEPSI, and HARPS spectrographs can deliver spectroscopic
results that are sufficiently consistent for most of the science cases in stellar spectroscopy.
However, we found small but important differences in the performance of the three spectrographs
that can be crucial for specific science cases.
