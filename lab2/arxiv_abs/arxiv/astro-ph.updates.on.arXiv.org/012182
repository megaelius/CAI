A high fraction of massive stars are found to be binaries but only a few of them are reported as photometrically
variable. By studying the populations of SB2 in the 30 Doradus region, we found a subset of them that
have photometry from the OGLE project and that display variations in their light curves related
to orbital motions. The goal of this study is to determine the dynamical masses and radii of the 26
binary components to investigate the mass-discrepancy problem and to provide an empirical mass-luminosity
relation for the LMC. We use the PHOEBE programme to perform a systematic analysis of the OGLE V and
I light curves obtained for 13 binary systems in 30 Dor. We adopt Teff, and orbital parameters derived
previously to obtain the inclinations of the systems and the parameters of the individual components.
Three systems display eclipses in their light curves, while the others only display ellipsoidal
variations. We classify two systems as over-contact, five as semi-detached, and four as detached.
The two remaining systems have uncertain configurations due to large uncertainties on their inclinations.
The fact that systems display ellipsoidal variations has a significant impact on the inclination
errors. From the dynamical masses, luminosities, and radii, we provide LMC-based empirical mass-luminosity
and mass-radius relations, and we compare them to other relations given for the Galaxy, the LMC,
and the SMC. These relations differ for different mass ranges, but do not seem to depend on the metallicity
regimes. We also compare the dynamical, spectroscopic, and evolutionary masses of the stars in
our sample. While the dynamical and spectroscopic masses agree with each other, the evolutionary
masses are systematically higher, at least for stars in semi-detached systems. This suggests that
the mass discrepancy can be partly explained by past or ongoing interactions between the stars.
