Galaxy-galaxy lensing is an essential tool for probing dark matter halos and constraining cosmological
parameters. While galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements usually rely on shear, weak-lensing magnification
contains additional constraining information. Using the fundamental plane (FP) of elliptical
galaxies to anchor the size distribution of a background population is one method that has been proposed
for performing a magnification measurement. We present a formalism for using the FP residuals of
elliptical galaxies to jointly estimate the foreground mass and background redshift errors for
a stacked lens scenario. The FP residuals include information about weak-lensing magnification
$\kappa$, and therefore foreground mass, since to first order, nonzero $\kappa$ affects galaxy
size but not other FP properties. We also present a modular, extensible code that implements the
formalism using emulated galaxy catalogs of a photometric galaxy survey. We find that combining
FP information with observed number counts of the source galaxies constrains mass and photo-z error
parameters significantly better than an estimator that includes number counts only. In particular,
the improvement in the constraint on the mass is an order of magnitude better if FP residuals are included.
Furthermore, we find that the mass estimator is robust to selection effects. The effective size
noise for a foreground lens of mass $M_H=10^{14}M_\odot$, with a conservative selection function
in size and surface brightness applied to the source population, is $\sigma_{\kappa,\mathrm{eff}}=0.183$.
We discuss the improvements to our FP model necessary to make this formalism a practical companion
to shear analyses in weak lensing surveys.
