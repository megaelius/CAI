In this work, we have studied the dynamical evolution of the shock front in a neutron star. The shock
wave is expected to possess enough strength to ignite the nuclear matter thereby converting it to
quark matter. The conversion of nuclear to quark matter is assumed to take place at the shock discontinuity.
The density and pressure discontinuity is studied both spatially and temporally as it starts near
the center of the star and moves towards the surface. Polytropic equations of state which mimics
real original nuclear matter and quark matter equations of state are used to study such dynamical
phase transition. Solving relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a spherically symmetric star
we have studied the phase transition assuming a considerable density discontinuity near the center.
We find that as the shock wave propagates outwards, its intensity decreases with time, however the
shock velocity peaks up and reaches a value close to that of light. Such fast shock velocity indicates
rapid phase transition in neutron star taking place on a timescale of some tens of microseconds.
Such a result is quite an interesting one, and it differs from previous calculations that the phase
transition in neutron stars takes at least some tens of milliseconds. Rapid phase transition can
have significant observational significance because such fast phase transition would imply quite
strong gravitational wave signals but very short lived. Such short-lived gravitational wave signals
would be accompanied with short-lived gamma-ray bursts and neutrino signals originating from
the neutrino and gamma-ray generation from the phase transition of nuclear matter to quark matter.
