We present the revised and high quality CCD time series observations in 2017 and 2018 of the W UMa-type
contact binary BH~Cas. The combination of our new determinations of minimum times and those collected
from the literatures reveal a long-term period increase with a rate of $\textit{dP/dt}\,=\,+3.27
\times 10^{-7} \textrm{d}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, which can be accounted for by angular momentum
transfer as the less-massive component loses its mass to the more massive one. One cyclical oscillation
($A'=0.00300$~days and $P'=20.09$~yrs) superimposed on the long-term period increase tendency
is attributed to one additional object that orbits BH Cas. The low-resolution spectra of this source
are observed at phase $\sim$0.0 and $\sim$0.5 in 2018 and 2019, and the spectral types are identified
as K3V$\,\pm\,$1 and G8V$\,\pm\,$2. According to the luminosity contributions and spectra at
these phases, the spectral type of the primary star is close to K3V$\,\pm\,$1. We infer a cool spot
on the hotter and less-massive component to fit the asymmetry of light curves. In addition, changes
in the location, temperature, and area of spots on the secondary star in different observations
may indicate that the magnetic field activity of the secondary is more active than that of the primary.
Such strong spot activities and optical flare are both detected at the same time from a W UMa-type
star for the first time. With the \emph{XMM-Newton} observations taken in 2003 and 2012, the X-ray
light curve is obtained and the X-ray spectra can be well described with a black-body or a bremsstrahlung
model. The soft X-ray luminosity of BH Cas is estimated as 8.8\,--\,9.7$\,\times\,10^{30}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$.
