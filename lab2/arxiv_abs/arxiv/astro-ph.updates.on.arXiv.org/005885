We use a new mass modelling method, GravSphere, to measure the central dark matter density profile
of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Draco's star formation shut down long ago, making it a prime
candidate for hosting a 'pristine' dark matter cusp, unaffected by stellar feedback during galaxy
formation. We first test GravSphere on a suite of three tidally stripped mock 'Draco'-like dwarfs,
placed on orbits similar to the real Draco around the Milky Way, containing realistic populations
of binary stars, and with realistic foreground contamination. We show that we are able to correctly
infer the dark matter density profile of both cusped and cored mocks within our 95% confidence intervals.
While we obtain only a weak inference on the logarithmic slope of these density profiles, we are able
to obtain a robust inference of the amplitude of the inner dark matter density at 150pc, $\rho_{\rm
DM}(150\,{\rm pc})$. We show that, combined with constraints on the density profile at larger radii,
this is sufficient to distinguish a $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cusp $-$ that has
$\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc}) > 1.8 \times 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot \,{\rm kpc}^{-3}$ $-$ from alternative
dark matter models that have lower inner densities. We then apply GravSphere to the real Draco data.
We find that Draco has an inner dark matter density of $\rho_{\rm DM}(150\,{\rm pc}) = 2.4_{-0.6}^{+0.5}
\times 10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot \,{\rm kpc}^{-3}$, consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cusp. Using a velocity
independent SIDM model, calibrated on $\Lambda$SIDM cosmological simulations, we show that Draco's
high central density gives an upper bound on the SIDM cross section of $\sigma/m < 0.57\,{\rm cm}^2\,{\rm
g}^{-1}$ at 99% confidence. We conclude that the inner density of nearby dwarf galaxies like Draco
provides a new and competitive probe of dark matter models.
