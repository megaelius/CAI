Binary black-holes (BHs) and binary neutron-stars (NSs) mergers had been recently detected through
gravitational-wave (GW) emission, with the latter followed by post-merger electromagnetic counterparts,
appearing seconds up to weeks after the merger. While post-merger electromagnetic counterparts
had been anticipated theoretically, very little electromagnetic precursors to GW-sources had
been proposed, and non observed yet. Here we show that a fraction of ${\rm a}\,{\rm few\times}10^{-4}-10^{-1}$
of LIGO GW-sources and short-GRBs, could be preceded by supernovae-explosions years up to decades
before the merger. Each of the BH/NS-progenitors in GW-sources are thought to form following a supernova,
likely accompanied by a natal velocity-kick to the newly born compact object. The evolution and
natal-kicks determine the orbits of surviving binaries, and hence the delay-time between the birth
of the compact-binary and its final merger through GW-emission. We use data from binary evolution
population-synthesis models to show that the delay-time distribution has a non-negligible tail
of ultra-short delay-times between 1-100 yrs, thereby giving rise to potentially observable supernovae
precursors to GW-sources. Moreover, future LISA/DECIGO GW space-detectors will enable the detection
of GW-inspirals in the pre-mergers stage weeks to decades before the final merger. These ultra-short
delay-time sources could therefore produce a unique type of promptly appearing LISA/DECIGO-GW-sources
accompanied by \emph{coincident} supernovae. The archival (and/or direct) detection of precursor
(coincident) SNe with GW and/or short-GRBs will provide unprecedented characterizations of the
merging-binaries, and their prior evolution through supernovae and natal kicks, otherwise inaccessible
through other means.
