We combine data from the Spitzer Survey for Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G), a recently calibrated
empirical stellar mass estimator from Eskew et al., and an extensive database of HI spectral line
profiles to examine the baryonic Tully-Fisher (BTF) relation. We find 1) that the BTF has lower scatter
than the classic Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and is better described as a linear relationship, confirming
similar previous results, 2) that the inclusion of a radial scale in the BTF decreases the scatter
but only modestly, as seen previously for the TF relation, and 3) that the slope of the BTF, which we
find to be $3.5\pm 0.2$ (\Delta log $M_{baryon}$/\Delta log v_c), implies that on average a nearly
constant fraction ($\sim 0.4$) of all baryons expected to be in a halo are "condensed" onto the central
region of rotationally supported galaxies. The condensed baryon fraction, $M_{baryon}/M_{total}$,
is, to our measurement precision, nearly independent of galaxy circular velocity (our sample spans
circular velocities, $v_c$, between 60 and 250 km s$^{-1}$, but is extended to $v_c\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$
using data from the literature). The observed galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in this fraction is generally
$\le$ a factor of 2 despite fairly liberal selection criteria. These results imply that cooling
and heating processes, such as cold vs. hot accretion, mass loss due to stellar winds, and AGN driven
feedback, to the degree that they affect the global galactic properties involved in the BTF, are
independent of halo mass for galaxies with 10 < v_c < 250 km/s and typically introduce no more
than a factor of two range in the resulting $M_{baryon}/M_{total}$. Recent simulations by Aumer
et al. of a small sample of disk galaxies are in excellent agreement with our data, suggesting that
current simulations are capable of reproducing the global properties of individual disk galaxies.
