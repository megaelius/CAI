The combination of optical and mid-infrared (MIR) photometry has been extensively used to select
red active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our aim is to explore the obscuration properties of these red
AGNs with both X-ray spectroscopy and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In this study, we re-visit
the relation between optical/MIR extinction and X-ray absorption. We use IR selection criteria,
specifically the $W1$ and $W2$ WISE bands, to identify 4798 AGNs in the $\it{XMM-XXL}$ area ($\sim
25$deg$^2$). Application of optical/MIR colours ($r- W2 > 6$) reveals 561 red AGNs (14$\%$). Of
these, 47 have available X-ray spectra with at least 50 net (background-subtracted) counts per
detector. For these sources, we construct SEDs from the optical to the MIR using the CIGALE code.
The SED fitting shows that 44 of these latter 47 sources present clear signs of obscuration based
on the AGN emission and the estimated inclination angle. Fitting the SED also reveals ten systems
($\sim20\%$) which are dominated by the galaxy. In these cases, the red colours are attributed to
the host galaxy rather than AGN absorption. Excluding these ten systems from our sample and applying
X-ray spectral fitting analysis shows that up to $76\%$ (28/37) of the IR red AGNs present signs of
X-ray absorption. Thus, there are nine sources ($\sim20\%$ of the sample) that although optically
red, are not substantially X-ray absorbed. Approximately $50\%$ of these sources present broad
emission lines in their optical spectra. We suggest that the reason for this apparent discrepancy
is that the r-W2 criterion is sensitive to smaller amounts of obscuration relative to the X-ray spectroscopy.
In conclusion, it appears that the majority of red AGNs present considerable obscuration levels
as shown by their SEDs. Their X-ray absorption is moderate with a mean of $\rm N_H \sim 10^{22}\, \rm{cm^{-2}}$.
