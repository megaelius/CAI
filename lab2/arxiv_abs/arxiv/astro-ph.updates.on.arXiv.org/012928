There are several supervised machine learning methods used for the application of automated morphological
classification of galaxies; however, there has not yet been a clear comparison of these different
methods using imaging data, or a investigation for maximising their effectiveness. We carry out
a comparison between several common machine learning methods for galaxy classification (Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN), K-nearest neighbour, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random
Forest, and Neural Networks) by using Dark Energy Survey (DES) data combined with visual classifications
from the Galaxy Zoo 1 project (GZ1). Our goal is to determine the optimal machine learning methods
when using imaging data for galaxy classification. We show that CNN is the most successful method
of these ten methods in our study. Using a sample of $\sim$2,800 galaxies with visual classification
from GZ1, we reach an accuracy of $\sim$0.99 for the morphological classification of Ellipticals
and Spirals. The further investigation of the galaxies that have a different ML and visual classification
but with high predicted probabilities in our CNN usually reveals an the incorrect classification
provided by GZ1. We further find the galaxies having a low probability of being either spirals or
ellipticals are visually Lenticulars (S0), demonstrating that supervised learning is able to
rediscover that this class of galaxy is distinct from both Es and Spirals. We confirm that $\sim$2.5\%
galaxies are misclassified by GZ1 in our study. After correcting these galaxies' labels, we improve
our CNN performance to an average accuracy of over 0.99 (accuracy of 0.994 is our best result).
