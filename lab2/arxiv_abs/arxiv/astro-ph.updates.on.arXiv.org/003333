The large-scale structure of the universe can only be observed via luminous tracers of the dark matter.
However, the clustering statistics of tracers are biased and depend on various properties, such
as their host-halo mass and assembly history. On very large scales this tracer bias results in a constant
offset in the clustering amplitude, known as linear bias. Towards smaller nonlinear scales, this
is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a complicated function of scale and time. We focus on
tracer bias centred on cosmic voids, depressions of the density field that spatially dominate the
universe. We consider three types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and AGN, extracted from
the hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder. In contrast to common clustering statistics
that focus on auto-correlations of tracers, we find that void-tracer cross-correlations are successfully
described by a linear-bias relation. The tracer-density profile of voids can thus be related to
their matter-density profile by a single number. We show that it coincides with the linear tracer
bias extracted from the large-scale auto-correlation function and expectations from theory,
if sufficiently large voids are considered. For smaller voids we observe a shift towards higher
values. This has important consequences on cosmological parameter inference, as the problem of
unknown tracer bias is alleviated up to a constant number. The smallest scales in existing datasets
become accessible to simpler models, providing numerous modes of the density field that have been
disregarded so far, but may help to further reduce statistical errors in constraining cosmology.
