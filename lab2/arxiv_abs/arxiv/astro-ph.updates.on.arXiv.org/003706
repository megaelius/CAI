In an earlier paper we presented Jansky Very Large Array multi-frequency, multi-array continuum
imaging of a unique sample of low axial-ratio radio galaxies. In this paper, the second in the series,
we examine the images to know the phenomenology of how the off-axis emission relates to the main radio
source. Inversion symmetric offset emission appears to be bimodal and to originate from one of two
strategic locations: outer ends of radio lobes (Outer-deviation) or from inner ends (Inner-deviation).
The latter sources are almost always associated with edge-brightened sources. With S- and Z-shaped
sources being a subset of Outer-deviation sources this class lends itself naturally to explanations
involving black hole axis precession. Our data allow us to present a plausible model for the more
enigmatic Inner-deviation sources with impressive wings; as for outer-deviation sources these
too require black hole axis shifts although also requiring plasma backflows into relic channels.
Evolution in morphology over time relates the variety in structures in inner-deviation sources
including XRGs. With features such as non-collinearities, central inner-S "spine", corresponding
lobe emission peaks, double and protruding hotspots not uncommon, black hole axis precession,
drifts, or flips could be active in significant fraction of radio sources with prominent off-axis
emission. At least 4\% of radio galaxies appear to undergo black hole axis rotation. Quasars offer
a key signature to recognize rotating axes. With rich haul of sources that have likely undergone
axis rotation our work shows the usefulness of low axial-ratio sources to pursue searches for binary
supermassive black holes.
