Owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are perhaps
the best-studied class of SNe, yet the progenitor systems of these explosions largely remain a mystery.
A rare subclass of SNe Ia show evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM),
and in particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM. In the first systematic search
for such systems, we have identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and here we present new spectra of 13 of them. Six
SNe Ia-CSM have been well-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depth
for the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar Transient Factory. The spectra
of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated by H{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large
H{\alpha}/H{\beta} intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the
SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover, they have an almost complete lack of
He I emission. They also show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in the red wing
of H{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximum brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D absorption
from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) of SNe
Ia-CSM are found to be -21.3 <= M_R <= -19 mag, and they also seem to show ultraviolet emission
at early times and strong infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray emission).
Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM are all late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf
irregulars like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these objects come from a relatively
young stellar population. This work represents the most detailed analysis of the SN Ia-CSM class
to date.
