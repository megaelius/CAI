Context. Planck observations demonstrated that the grain alignment efficiency is almost constant
in the diffuse ISM. Aims. We test if the Radiative Torque (RAT) theory is compatible with observational
constraints on grain alignment. Methods. We combine a numerical simulation with the radiative
transfer code POLARIS that incorporates a physical dust model and the detailed grain alignment
physics of RATs. A dust model is designed to reproduce the spectral dependence of extinction of the
ISM. From a RAMSES simulation of interstellar turbulence, we extract a cube representative of the
diffuse ISM. We post-process the cube with POLARIS to get the grain temperature and RATs to simulate
synthetic dust polarization maps. Results. In our simulation the grain alignment efficiency is
correlated with gas pressure, but not with the RAT intensity. Because of the low dust extinction,
the magnitude of RATs varies little, decreasing only for high column densities $N_H$. Comparing
our maps with a uniform alignment efficiency, we find no systematic difference. The dependence
of polarization fraction $p$ with $N_H$ or polarization dispersion $S$ is similar. The drop of RATs
in dense regions barely affects the polarization pattern, the signal being dominated by the LOS
and magnetic field geometry. If a star is inserted, the polarization increases, with no specific
pattern around the star. The angle-dependence of RATs is not observed in the maps, and is weak using
a uniform magnetic field. Conclusions. RATs are compatible with Planck data for the diffuse ISM
such that both uniform alignment and RAT alignment lead to similar observations. To further test
the predictions of RATs where an important drop of grain alignment is expected, polarization observations
of dense regions must be confronted to numerical simulations sampling high column densities through
dense clouds, with enough statistics.
