We present ZTF18abvkwla (the "Koala"), a fast blue optical transient discovered in the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) One-Day Cadence (1DC) Survey. This event has a number of features in common with the
groundbreaking transient AT2018cow: blue colors at peak ($g-r\approx-0.5$), a short rise time
from half-max of under two days, a decay time of only three days, a high optical luminosity ($M_{g,\mathrm{peak}}\approx-20.8$),
a hot ($\gtrsim 40,000\,$K) featureless spectrum at peak light, and a luminous radio counterpart
($\nu L_\nu \gtrsim 10^{40}\,$erg sec$^{-1}$ at 10 GHz). The radio luminosity of ZTF18abvkwla
exceeds that of AT2018cow by an order of magnitude, and the late-time ($\Delta t\gtrsim80\,$days)
light curve resembles that of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The host galaxy is a dwarf
starburst galaxy ($M\approx5\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$, $\mathrm{SFR}\approx7\,M_\odot\,$year$^{-1}$)
that is moderately metal-enriched ($\log\mathrm{[O/H]} \approx 8.5$), similar to the hosts of
GRBs and superluminous supernovae. As in AT2018cow, the radio and optical emission in ZTF18abvkwla
likely arise from two separate components: the radio from fast-moving collimated ejecta and the
optical from shock-interaction with confined dense material ($<0.07\,M_\odot$ in $\sim 10^{15}\,$cm).
Compiling transients in the literature with $t_\mathrm{rise} <5\,$days and $M_\mathrm{peak}<-20$,
we find that a significant number are engine-powered,and suggest that the high peak optical luminosity
is directly related to the presence of this engine. From 18 months of the 1DC survey, we find that transients
in this rise-luminosity phase space are at least two orders of magnitude less common than CC SNe.
Finally, we discuss strategies for identifying such events with future facilities like the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope, and prospects for detecting accompanying X-ray and radio emission.
