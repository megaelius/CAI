Spectroscopy for 247 stars towards the young cluster NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud has been
combined with that for 116 targets from the VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars. Spectral classification
yields a sample of 47 O-type and 287 B-type spectra, while radial-velocity variations and/or spectral
multiplicity have been used to identify 45 candidate single-lined systems, 17 double-lined systems,
and one triple-lined system. Atmospheric parameters (T$_eff$ and log$g$) and projected rotational
velocities ($v_e$sin$i$) have been estimated using TLUSTY model atmospheres; independent estimates
of $v_e$sin$i$ were also obtained using a Fourier Transform method. Luminosities have been inferred
from stellar apparent magnitudes and used in conjunction with the T$_eff$ and $v_e$sin$i$ estimates
to constrain stellar masses and ages using the BONNSAI package. We find that targets towards the
inner region of NGC 346 have higher median masses and projected rotational velocities, together
with smaller median ages than the rest of the sample. There appears to be a population of very young
targets with ages of less than 2 Myr, which have presumably all formed within the cluster. The more
massive targets are found to have lower $v_e$sin$i$ consistent with previous studies. No significant
evidence is found for differences with metallicity in the stellar rotational velocities of early-type
stars, although the targets in the SMC may rotate faster than those in young Galactic clusters. The
rotational velocity distribution for single non-supergiant B-type stars is inferred and implies
that a significant number have low rotational velocity ($\simeq$10\% with $v_e$<40 km/s), together
with a peak in the probability distribution at $v_e \simeq$300 km/s. Larger projected rotational
velocity estimates have been found for our Be-type sample and imply that most have rotational velocities
between 200-450 km/s.
