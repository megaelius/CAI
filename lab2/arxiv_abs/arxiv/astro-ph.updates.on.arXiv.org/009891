Analysis of APOGEE DR12 stellar radial-velocities by Troup et al. (2016) affirmed the existence
of the well-known Brown-Dwarf Desert (BDD). They detected a dearth of spectroscopic binaries (SB)
with periods shorter than $\sim 10$ - $30$ days and secondaries with masses in the range of $\sim0.01$
- $0.1\, M_{\odot}$. We reconsider here their sample of binaries, focusing on 116 systems on the
main sequence of the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, with mostly K-dwarf primaries. Using our recently
devised algorithm to analyze the mass-ratio distribution of a sample of SBs we confirm the BDD existence
and delineate its boundaries. For the K-dwarf APOGEE $1$ - $25$ days binaries, the companion-mass
range of the BDD is $\sim0.02$ - $0.2\, M_{\odot}$. The mass ratio distribution of the long-period
($25$ - $500$ days) binaries does not show any dearth at the $q$-range studied. Instead, their distribution
displays a linear increase in $\log q$, implying a tendency towards low-$q$ values. The limits of
the BDD do not coincide with the frequently used mass limits of the brown-dwarf population, sometimes
defined as $0.013$ and $0.08\, M_{\odot}$, based on theoretically derived stellar minimum masses
for burning deuterium and hydrogen in their cores. Trying to draw the boundaries of the desert, we
suggest either a wedged or trapezoidal shape. We discuss briefly different scenarios that can account
for the formation of the BDD, in terms of differentiating between stellar secondaries and planets
in particular, and compare this desert to the Neptunian desert that can distinguish between Jovian
planets and super Earths of short periods.
