Aims. We aim to improve the understanding of the physical mechanisms behind the slower than free-fall
motion and the two-stage evolution (an initial phase of acceleration followed by an almost constant
velocity phase) detected in coronal rain events. Methods. Using the Mancha3D code, we solve the
2D ideal MHD equations. We represent the solar corona as an isothermal vertically stratified atmosphere
with a uniform vertical magnetic field and the plasma condensation as a density enhancement described
by a 2D Gaussian profile. We analyse the temporal evolution of the descending plasma and study its
dependence on parameters such as density and magnetic field strength. Results. We confirm previous
findings that the pressure gradient is the main force that opposes the action of gravity and slows
down the blob descent and that larger densities require larger pressure gradients to reach the constant
speed phase. We find that the shape of a condensation with a horizontal variation of density is distorted
as it falls, due to the denser parts of the blob falling faster than the lighter ones. This is explained
by the fact that the duration of the initial acceleration phase, and therefore the maximum falling
speed attained by the plasma, increases with the ratio of blob to coronal density. We also find that
the magnetic field plays a fundamental role in the evolution of the descending condensations. A
strong enough magnetic field (greater than 10 G in our simulations) forces each plasma element to
follow the path given by a particular field line, which allows to describe the evolution of each vertical
slice of the blob in terms of 1D dynamics, without influence of the adjacent slices. In addition,
under the typical conditions of the coronal rain events, the magnetic field prevents the development
of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
