The field of exoplanetary science is making rapid progress both in statistical studies of exoplanet
properties as well as in individual characterization. As space missions provide an emerging picture
of formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems, the search for habitable worlds becomes one
of the fundamental issues to address. To tackle such a complex challenge, we need to specify the conditions
favorable for the origin, development and sustainment of life as we know it. This requires the understanding
of global (astrospheric) and local (atmospheric, surface and internal) environments of exoplanets
in the framework of the physical processes of the interaction between evolving planet-hosting
stars along with exoplanetary evolution over geological timescales, and the resulting impact
on climate and habitability of exoplanets. Feedbacks between astrophysical, physico-chemical
atmospheric and geological processes can only be understood through interdisciplinary studies
with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary, Earth sciences,
astrobiology, and the origin of life communities. The assessment of the impacts of host stars on
the climate and habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets and potential exomoons around them may
significantly modify the extent and the location of the habitable zone and provide new directions
for searching for signatures of life. Thus, characterization of stellar ionizing outputs becomes
an important task for further understanding the extent of habitability in the universe. The goal
of this white paper is to identify and describe promising key research goals to aid the theoretical
characterization and observational detection of ionizing radiation from quiescent and flaring
upper atmospheres of planet hosts as well as properties of stellar coronal mass ejections and stellar
energetic particle events.
