To understand star formation in galaxies, we investigate the star formation rate (SFR) surface
density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) profiles for galaxies, based on a well-defined sample of 976 star-forming
MaNGA galaxies. We find that the typical $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ profiles within 1.5Re of normal SF galaxies
can be well described by an exponential function for different stellar mass intervals, while the
sSFR profile shows positive gradients, especially for more massive SF galaxies. This is due to the
more pronounced central cores or bulges rather than the onset of a `quenching' process. While galaxies
that lie significantly above (or below) the star formation main sequence (SFMS) show overall an
elevation (or suppression) of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ at all radii, this central elevation (or suppression)
is more pronounced in more massive galaxies. The degree of central enhancement and suppression
is quite symmetric, suggesting that both the elevation and suppression of star formation are following
the same physical processes. Furthermore, we find that the dispersion in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ within
and across the population is found to be tightly correlated with the inferred gas depletion time,
whether based on the stellar surface mass density or the orbital dynamical time. This suggests that
we are seeing the response of a simple gas-regulator system to variations in the accretion rate.
This is explored using a heuristic model that can quantitatively explain the dependence of $\sigma(\Sigma_{\rm
SFR})$ on gas depletion timescale. Variations in accretion rate are progressively more damped
out in regions of low star-formation efficiency leading to a reduced amplitude of variations in
star-formation. This idea is also supported by re-examination of some other quite independent
relations in the literature, including the comparison of compact and extended star-forming galaxies
in Wang et al. (2018a).
