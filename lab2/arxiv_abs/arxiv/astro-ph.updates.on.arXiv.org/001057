We present the results of multi-longitude observations of KV Cancri, an RR Lyrae star showing an
irregular Blazhko effect. With a pulsation period of 0.50208 day, the times of light curve maxima
are delayed by 6 minutes per day. This daily delay regularly leads to long periods of time without
maximum light curve observations for a given site. To cope with this observing time window problem,
we have organized a multi-longitude observation campaign including a telescope of the AAVSONet.
From the observed light curves, 92 pulsation maxima have been measured covering about six Blazhko
periods. The Fourier analysis of magnitudes at maximum light has revealed a main Blazhko period
of 77.6 days and also a secondary period of 40.5 days. A Fourier analysis of (O-C) values did not show
the secondary Blazhko period. The frequency spectrum of the complete light curve, from a Fourier
analysis and successive pre-whitening with PERIOD04, has shown triplet structures around the
two Blazhko modulation frequencies but with slightly different periods (77.8 and 42.4 days). The
second Blazhko frequency is statistically not a harmonic of the main Blazhko frequency. Besides
the two Blazhko modulations KV Cnc presents other particularities like irregularities from Blazhko
cycle to cycle and very fast magnitude variations which can reach a maximum of 2.5 magnitudes per
hour over a period of 15 minutes. This campaign shows that regular observations by amateur astronomers
remain important. Indeed such a detailed characterization of the Blazhko effect could not be obtained
from large-scale surveys, as cooperative long time-series observations are needed.
