Within the framework of resistive MHD, implementing the C7 equilibrium atmosphere model and a 3D
potential magnetic field realistic configuration, we simulate the formation of a plasm jet with
the morphology, upward velocity up to 130 km/s and timescale formation between 60 and 90 s after beginning
of simulation, similar to those expected for Type II spicules. Initial results of this simulation
were published in Paper (e.g., Gonz\'alez-Avil\'es et al. 2018) and present paper is devoted to
the analysis of transverse displacements and rotational type motion of the jet. Our results suggest
that 3D magnetic reconnection may be responsible for the formation of the jet in Paper (Gonz\'alez-Avil\'es
et al. 2018). In this paper, by calculating times series of the velocity components $v_x$ and $v_y$
in different points near to the jet for various heights we find transverse oscillations in agreement
with spicule observations. We also obtain a time-distance plot of the temperature in a cross-cut
at the plane $x=$0.1 Mm and find significant transverse displacements of the jet. By analyzing temperature
isosurfaces of $10^{4}$ K with the distribution of $v_x$, we find that if the line-of-sight (LOS)
is approximately perpendicular to the jet axis then there is both motion towards and away from the
observer across the width of the jet. This red-blue shift pattern of the jet is caused by rotational
motion, initially clockwise and anti-clockwise afterwards, which could be interpreted as torsional
motion. From a nearly vertical perspective of the jet the LOS velocity component shows a central
blue-shift region surrounded by red-shifted plasma.
