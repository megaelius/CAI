Context. Some of the most dynamic active regions are associated with complex photospheric magnetic
configurations such as quadrupolar regions, and especially ones with a $\delta$-spot configuration
and a strong Polarity Inversion Line (PIL). Aims. We study the formation and eruption of magnetic
flux ropes in quadrupolar regions. Methods. 3D MHD simulations of the partial emergence of a highly
twisted flux tube from the solar interior into a non-magnetized stratified atmosphere. Results.
We emerge two $\Omega$-shaped loops forming a quadrupolar region. The emerging flux forms two initially
separated bipoles, that later come in contact creating a $\delta$-spot central region. Above the
two bipoles, two magnetic lobes expand and interact through a series of current sheets at the interface
between them. Two recurrent confined eruptions are produced. In both cases, reconnection between
sheared low-lying field lines forms a flux rope. Reconnection between the two lobes high in the atmosphere
forms retracting field lines that push against the flux rope, creating a current sheet between them.
It also forms a third magnetic lobe between the two emerged ones, that later acts as a strapping field.
The flux rope eruptions are triggered when the reconnection between the flux ropes and the field
above them becomes efficient enough to remove the tension of the overlying field. These reconnection
events occur internally in the system. The first erupting flux rope almost fully reconnects with
the overlying field. The second eruption is confined by the overlying field. During the confined
eruption, the flux rope is enhanced in size, flux and twist, similar to confined-flare-to-flux-rope
observations. Proxies of the emission reveal the two erupting filaments channels. A flare arcade
is formed only in the second eruption due to the longer-lasting and more efficient reconnection
below the flux rope.
