Recent studies have shown that the proposal peer review processes employed by a variety of organizations
to allocate astronomical telescope time produce outcomes that are systematically biased depending
on whether proposal's principal investigator (PI) is a man or a woman. Using Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope (CFHT) and Gemini Observatory proposal statistics from Canada over 10 recent proposal
cycles, we assess whether or not the mean proposal scores assigned by the National Research Council's
(NRC's) Canadian Time Allocation Committee (CanTAC) also correlate significantly with PI sex.
Classical t-tests, bootstrap and jackknife replications show that proposals submitted by women
were rated significantly worse than those submitted by men. We subdivide the data in order to investigate
sex-disaggregated statistics in relation to PI career stage (faculty vs. non-faculty), telescope
requested, scientific review panel, observing semester, and the PhD year of faculty PIs. Consistent
with the bivariate results, a multivariate regression analysis controlling for other covariates
confirmed that PI sex is the only significant predictor of proposal rating scores for the sample
as a whole, although differences emerge for proposals submitted by faculty and non-faculty PIs.
While further research is needed to explain our results, it is possible that implicit social cognition
is at work. NRC and CanTAC have taken steps to mitigate this possibility by altering proposal author
lists in order to conceal the PI's identity among co-investigators. We recommend that the impact
of this measure on mitigating bias in future observing semesters be quantitatively assessed using
statistical techniques such as those employed here.
