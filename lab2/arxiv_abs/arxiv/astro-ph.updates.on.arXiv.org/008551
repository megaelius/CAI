Measures of exoplanet bulk densities indicate that small exoplanets with radius less than 3 Earth
radii ($R_\oplus$) range from low-density sub-Neptunes containing volatile elements to higher
density rocky planets with Earth-like or iron-rich (Mercury-like) compositions. Such astonishing
diversity in observed small exoplanet compositions may be the product of different initial conditions
of the planet-formation process and/or different evolutionary paths that altered the planetary
properties after formation. Planet evolution may be especially affected by either photoevaporative
mass loss induced by high stellar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) flux or giant impacts. Although
there is some evidence for the former, there are no unambiguous findings so far about the occurrence
of giant impacts in an exoplanet system. Here, we characterize the two innermost planets of the compact
and near-resonant system Kepler-107. We show that they have nearly identical radii (about $1.5-1.6~R_\oplus$),
but the outer planet Kepler-107c is more than twice as dense (about $12.6~\rm g\,cm^{-3}$) as the
innermost Kepler-107b (about $5.3~\rm g\,cm^{-3}$). In consequence, Kepler-107c must have a
larger iron core fraction than Kepler-107b. This imbalance cannot be explained by the stellar XUV
irradiation, which would conversely make the more-irradiated and less-massive planet Kepler-107b
denser than Kepler-107c. Instead, the dissimilar densities are consistent with a giant impact
event on Kepler-107c that would have stripped off part of its silicate mantle. This hypothesis is
supported by theoretical predictions from collisional mantle stripping, which match the mass
and radius of Kepler-107c.
