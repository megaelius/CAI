We measured the mean plane of the Kuiper belt as a function of semi-major axis. For the classical Kuiper
belt as a whole (the non-resonant objects in the semi-major axis range 42--48~au), we find a mean
plane of inclination $i_m=1.8^{\circ}$$^{+0.7^{\circ}}_{-0.4^{\circ}}$ and longitude of
ascending node $\Omega_m=77^{\circ}$$^{+18^{\circ}}_{-14^{\circ}}$ (in the J2000 ecliptic-equinox
coordinate system), in accord with theoretical expectations of the secular effects of the known
planets. With finer semi-major axis bins, we detect a statistically significant warp in the mean
plane near semi-major axes 40--42~au. Linear secular theory predicts a warp near this location
due to the $\nu_{18}$ nodal secular resonance, however the measured mean plane for the 40.3-42~au
semi-major axis bin (just outside the $\nu_{18}$) is inclined $\sim13^{\circ}$ to the predicted
plane, a nearly 3-$\sigma$ discrepancy. For the more distant Kuiper belt objects of semi-major
axes in the range 50--80~au, the expected mean plane is close to the invariable plane of the solar
system, but the measured mean plane deviates greatly from this: it has inclination $i_m=9.1^{\circ}$$^{+6.6^{\circ}}_{-3.8^{\circ}}$
and longitude of ascending node $\Omega_m=227^{\circ}$$^{+18^{\circ}}_{-44^{\circ}}$. We
estimate this deviation from the expected mean plane to be statistically significant at the $\sim97-99\%$
confidence level. We discuss several possible explanations for this deviation, including the
possibility that a relatively close-in ($a\lesssim100$~au), unseen small planetary-mass object
in the outer solar system is responsible for the warping.
