A long standing issue in peculiar velocity cosmology is whether the halo/galaxy velocity bias $b_v=1$
at large scale. The resolution of this important issue must resort to high precision cosmological
simulations. However, this is hampered by another long standing "sampling artifact" problem in
volume weighted velocity measurement. We circumvent this problem with a hybrid approach. We first
measure statistics free of sampling artifact, then link them to volume weighted statistics in theory,
and finally solve for the velocity bias. $b_v$ determined by our method is not only free of sampling
artifact, but also free of cosmic variance. We apply this method to a $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation
of $3072^3$ simulation particles and $1200 {\rm Mpc}/h$ box size. For the first time we determine
the halo velocity bias of various mass and redshift to $0.1\%$-$1\%$ accuracy. Major findings are
as follows. (1) $b_v\neq 1$ at $k>0.1h/{\rm Mpc}$. The deviation from unity ($|b_v-1|$) increases
with $k$. Depending on halo mass and redshift, it may reach $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ at $k=0.2h/{\rm
Mpc}$ and $\mathcal{O}(0.05)$ at $k\sim 0.3h/{\rm Mpc}$. The discovered $b_v\neq 1$ has statistically
significant impact on structure growth rate measurement by spectroscopic redshift surveys, including
DESI, Euclid and SKA. (2) Both the sign and the amplitude of $b_v-1$ depend on mass and redshift. These
results disagree with the peak model prediction on proto-halos in that $b_v$ has much weaker deviation
from unity, varies with redshift, and can be bigger than unity. (3) Most of the mass and redshift dependences
can be compressed into a single dependence on the halo density bias. Based on this finding, we provide
an approximate two-parameter fitting formula.
