Current Cherenkov telescopes have identified a population of ultra-high-frequency peaked BL
Lac objects (UHBLs), also known as extreme blazars, that exhibit exceptionally hard TeV spectra,
including 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 0347-121, RGB J0710+591, 1ES 1101-232, and 1ES 1218+304. Although
one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models have been generally successful in interpreting
the high-energy emission observed in other BL Lac objects, they are problematic for UHBLs, necessitating
very large Doppler factors and/or extremely high minimum Lorentz factors of the emitting leptonic
population. In this context, we have investigated alternative scenarios where hadronic emission
processes are important, using a newly developed (lepto-)hadronic numerical code to systematically
explore the physical parameters of the emission region that reproduces the observed spectra while
avoiding the extreme values encountered in pure SSC models. Assuming a fixed Doppler factor $\delta=30$,
two principal parameter regimes are identified, where the high-energy emission is due to: 1) proton-synchrotron
radiation, with magnetic fields $B \sim 1-100\ \textrm{G}$ and maximum proton energies $E_{p;max}
\lesssim 10^{19}$ eV; and 2) synchrotron emission from p-$\gamma$-induced cascades as well as
SSC emission from primary leptons, with $B \sim 0.1-1\ \textrm{G}$ and $E_{p;max} \lesssim 10^{17}$
eV. This can be realized with plausible, sub-Eddington values for the total (kinetic plus magnetic)
power of the emitting plasma, in contrast to hadronic interpretations for other blazar classes
that often warrant highly super-Eddington values.
