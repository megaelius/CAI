The so-called Lidov-Kozai oscillation is very well known and applied to various problems in solar
system dynamics. This mechanism makes the orbital inclination and eccentricity of the perturbed
body in the circular restricted three-body system oscillate with a large amplitude under certain
conditions. It is widely accepted that the theoretical framework of this phenomenon was established
independently in the early 1960s by a Soviet Union dynamicist (Michail L'vovich Lidov) and by a Japanese
celestial mechanist (Yoshihide Kozai). A large variety of studies has stemmed from the original
works by Lidov and Kozai, now having the prefix of "Lidov-Kozai" or "Kozai- Lidov." However, from
a survey of past literature published in late nineteenth to early twentieth century, we have confirmed
that there already existed a pioneering work using a similar analysis of this subject established
in that period. This was accomplished by a Swedish astronomer, Edvard Hugo von Zeipel. In this monograph,
we first outline the basic framework of the circular restricted three-body problem including typical
examples where the Lidov-Kozai oscillation occurs. Then, we introduce what was discussed and learned
along this line of studies from the early to mid-twentieth century by summarizing the major works
of Lidov, Kozai, and relevant authors. Finally, we make a summary of von Zeipel's work, and show that
his achievements in the early twentieth century already comprehended most of the fundamental and
necessary formulations that the Lidov-Kozai oscillation requires. By comparing the works of Lidov,
Kozai, and von Zeipel, we assert that the prefix "von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai" should be used for designating
this theoretical framework, and not just Lidov-Kozai or Kozai-Lidov.
