[Abridged and Edited] We investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 ATLAS3D galaxies for which the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging is available and compare them to the large scale kinematics
obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph. Specific angular momentum, lambda_R,
correlates with the shape of nuclear light profiles, where cores are typically found in slow rotators
and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. Cores are found only in massive galaxies and only in systems
with the stellar mass M>8x10^10 Msun. Based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal
distribution of nuclear slopes. The best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellar velocity
dispersion within an effective radius, sigma_e, and specific angular momentum, where cores are
found for lambda_R<0.25 and sigma_e>160 km/s. We estimate that only about 10% of nearby early-type
galaxies contain cores. Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators
with cores. We also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematically and dynamically
different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast rotators could harbour black holes of similar
masses to those in core slow rotators, but typically more massive than those found in core-less fast
rotators. Core-less galaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are under-luminous in
the diffuse X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high X-ray luminosities. We
postulate a possible population of core-less galaxies among slow rotators, which can not be explained
as face-on discs, but comprise a genuine sub-population of slow rotators. These galaxies are typically
less massive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamical cold structures
and exponential photometric components. We discuss possible processes for formation of cores
and their subsequent preservation.
