The composition of the Sun is an essential piece of reference data for astronomy, cosmology, astroparticle,
space and geo-physics. This article, dealing with the intermediate-mass elements Na to Ca, is the
first in a series describing the comprehensive re-determination of the solar composition. In this
series we severely scrutinise all ingredients of the analysis across all elements, to obtain the
most accurate, homogeneous and reliable results possible. We employ a highly realistic 3D hydrodynamic
solar photospheric model, which has successfully passed an arsenal of observational diagnostics.
To quantify systematic errors, we repeat the analysis with three 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres
(MARCS, MISS and Holweger & M\"uller 1974) and a horizontally and temporally-averaged version
of the 3D model ($\langle$3D$\rangle$). We account for departures from LTE wherever possible.
We have scoured the literature for the best transition probabilities, partition functions, hyperfine
and other data, and stringently checked all observed profiles for blends. Our final 3D+NLTE abundances
are: $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Na}}=6.21\pm0.04$, $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Mg}}=7.59\pm0.04$,
$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Al}}=6.43\pm0.04$, $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Si}}=7.51\pm0.03$,
$\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{P}}=5.41\pm0.03$, $\log \epsilon_{\mathrm{S}}=7.13\pm0.03$, $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{K}}=5.04\pm0.05$
and $\log\epsilon_{\mathrm{Ca}}=6.32\pm0.03$. The uncertainties include both statistical
and systematic errors. Our results are systematically smaller than most previous ones with the
1D semi-empirical Holweger & M\"uller model. The $\langle$3D$\rangle$ model returns abundances
very similar to the full 3D calculations. This analysis provides a complete description and a slight
update of the Na to Ca results presented in Asplund, Grevesse, Sauval & Scott ( arXiv:0909.0948
), with full details of all lines and input data.
