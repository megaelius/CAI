We present new ALMA observations and physical properties of a Lyman Break Galaxy at $z=7.15$. Our
target, B14-65666, has a bright ultra-violet (UV) absolute magnitude, Muv ~ -22.3, and has been
spectroscopically identified in Ly$\alpha$ with a small rest-frame equivalent width of ~ 4 \AA.
With ALMA, we have detected spatially resolved [OIII] 88 $\mu$m, [CII] 158 $\mu$m, and dust continuum
emission at 5.8$\sigma$, 10.6$\sigma$, and 5.3$\sigma$ respectively. The [OIII] and [CII] lines
have consistent redshifts of $7.1520\pm0.0003$, and the [OIII] luminosity, $(28.6\pm4.8) \times
10^{8}$ $L_{\rm \odot}$, is twice higher than the [CII] luminosity, $(13.3\pm1.4) \times 10^{8}$
$L_{\rm \odot}$. Owing to our high spatial resolution data with beam sizes of $\approx 0''.3 \times
0''.2$ ($0''.3\times0''.3$) in Band 6 (Band 8), [CII] and [OIII] reveal velocity gradients of $\approx200$
km/s. Based on morphologies of [CII] and rest-frame UV emission, we argue that the velocity gradient
would be due to a merger event. The merger scenario is also supported from a significant dust mass,
$(1-6)\times10^{7}$ $M_{\rm \odot}$, which cannot be easily reproduced without considering
past star-formation activity. These results imply that B14-65666 is a merger induced starburst
galaxy. We also measure the Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset with respect to the ALMA lines. The value
$\Delta v_{\rm Ly\alpha} =772\pm45$ km/s is the largest so far detected among the z > 6 galaxy population.
Based on a sample of 17 galaxies with $\Delta v_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ measurements from this study and
the literature at z ~ 6-8, we find that $\Delta v_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ values become larger for galaxies
with brighter UV magnitudes or higher [CII] luminosities. These trends are consistent with the
idea that the visibility of Ly$\alpha$ during the reionizatin epoch is dependent of the objects'
luminosities.
