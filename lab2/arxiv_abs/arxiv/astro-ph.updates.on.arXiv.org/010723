The far side of the Milky Way's disk is one of the most concealed parts of the known Universe due to extremely
high interstellar extinction and point source density toward low Galactic latitudes. Large time-domain
photometric surveys operating in the near-infrared hold great potential for the exploration of
these vast uncharted areas of our Galaxy. We conducted a census of distant classical and type II Cepheids
along the southern Galactic mid-plane using near-infrared photometry from the VISTA Variables
in the V\'ia L\'actea survey. We performed a machine-learned classification of the Cepheids based
on their infrared light curves using a convolutional neural network. We have discovered 640 distant
classical Cepheids with up to ~40 magnitudes of visual extinction, and over 500 type II Cepheids,
most of them located in the inner bulge. Intrinsic color indices of individual Cepheids were predicted
from sparse photometric data using a neural network, allowing their use as accurate reddening tracers.
They revealed a steep, spatially varying near-infrared extinction curve toward the inner bulge.
Type II Cepheids in the Galactic bulge were also employed to measure robust mean selective-to-absolute
extinction ratios. They trace a centrally concentrated spatial distribution of the old bulge population
with a slight elongation, consistent with earlier results from RR Lyrae stars. Likewise, the classical
Cepheids were utilized to trace the Galactic warp and various substructures of the Galactic disk,
and to uncover significant vertical and radial age gradients of the thin disk population at the far
side of the Milky Way.
