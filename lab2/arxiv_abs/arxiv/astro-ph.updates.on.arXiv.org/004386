We report on a new open-source, user-friendly numerical relativity code package called SENR/NRPy+.
Our code extends previous implementations of the BSSN reference-metric formulation to a much broader
class of curvilinear coordinate systems, making it ideally-suited to modeling physical configurations
with approximate or exact symmetries. In the context of modeling black hole dynamics, it is orders
of magnitude more efficient than other widely used open-source numerical relativity codes. NRPy+
provides a Python-based interface in which equations are written in natural tensorial form and
output at arbitrary finite difference order as highly efficient C code, putting complex tensorial
equations at the scientist's fingertips without the need for an expensive software license. SENR
provides the algorithmic framework that combines the C codes generated by NRPy+ into a functioning
numerical relativity code. We validate against two other established, state-of-the-art codes,
and achieve excellent agreement. For the first time we demonstrate--in the context of puncture,
trumpet, and dual black hole evolutions--nearly exponential convergence of constraint violation
and gravitational waveform errors to zero as the order of spatial finite difference derivatives
is increased, while holding the spherical-like coordinate grids fixed at moderate resolution.
Such behavior outside the horizons is remarkable, as numerical errors do not converge to zero inside
horizons, and all points along the polar axis are coordinate singularities. The formulation addresses
such coordinate singularities via cell-centered grids and a simple change of basis that analytically
regularizes tensor components with respect to the coordinates. Future plans include extending
this formulation to allow dynamical coordinate grids and bispherical-like distribution of points
to efficiently capture orbiting compact binary dynamics.
