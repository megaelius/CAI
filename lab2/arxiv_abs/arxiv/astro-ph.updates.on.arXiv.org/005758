We seek to understand the transition from nearly axisymmetric configurations at solar rotation
rates to nonaxisymmetric configurations for rapid rotation using 3D numerical simulations of
turbulent convection and considering rotation rates between 1 and 30 times the solar value. We find
a transition from axi- to nonaxisymmetric solutions at around 1.8 times the solar rotation rate.
This transition coincides with a change in the rotation profile from antisolar- to solar-like differential
rotation with a faster equator and slow poles. In the solar-like rotation regime, the field configuration
consists of an axisymmetric oscillatory field accompanied by an m=1 azimuthal mode (two active
longitudes), which also shows temporal variability. At slow (rapid) rotation, the axisymmetric
(nonaxisymmetric) mode dominates. The axisymmetric mode produces latitudinal dynamo waves with
polarity reversals, while the nonaxisymmetric mode often exhibits a drift in the rotating reference
frame and the strength of the active longitudes changes cyclically over time between the different
hemispheres. Most of the obtained dynamo solutions exhibit cyclic variability either caused by
latitudinal or azimuthal dynamo waves. In an activity-period diagram, the cycle lengths normalized
by the rotation period form two different populations as a function of rotation rate or magnetic
activity level. The slowly rotating axisymmetric population lies close to what is called the inactive
branch in observations, while the rapidly rotating models are close to the superactive branch with
a declining cycle to rotation frequency ratio with increasing rotation rate. We can successfully
reproduce the transition from axi- to nonaxisymmetric dynamo solutions for high rotation rates,
but high-resolution simulations are required to limit the effect of rotational quenching of convection
at rotation rates above 20 times the solar value.
