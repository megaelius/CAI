Context. The importance of the magnetic field in high-mass-star formation is not yet fully clear
and there are still many open questions concerning its role in the accretion processes and generation
of jets and outflows. In the past few years, masers have been successfully used to probe the magnetic
field morphology and strength at scales of a few au around massive protostars, by measuring linear
polarisation angles and Zeeman splitting. The massive protostar IRAS 18089-1732 is a well studied
high-mass-star forming region, showing a hot core chemistry and a disc-outflow system. Previous
SMA observations of polarised dust revealed an ordered magnetic field oriented around the disc
of IRAS 18089-1732. Aims. We want to determine the magnetic field in the dense region probed by 6.7
GHz methanol maser observations and compare it with observations in dust continuum polarisation,
to investigate how the magnetic field in the compact maser region relates to the large-scale field
around massive protostars. Methods. We reduced MERLIN observations at 6.7 GHz of IRAS 18089-1732
and we analysed the polarised emission by methanol masers. Results. Our MERLIN observations show
that the magnetic field in the 6.7 GHz methanol maser region is consistent with the magnetic field
constrained by the SMA dust polarisation observations. A tentative detection of circularly polarised
line emission is also presented. Conclusions. We found that the magnetic field in the maser region
has the same orientation as in the disk. Thus the large-scale field component, even at the au scale
of the masers, dominates over any small-scale field fluctuations. We obtained, from the circular
polarisation tentative detection, a field strength along the line of sight of 5.5 mG which appeared
to be consistent with the previous estimates.
