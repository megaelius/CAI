In the past decade, Astrochemistry has witnessed an impressive increase in the number of detections
of complex organic molecules. Some of these species are of prebiotic interest such as glycolaldehyde,
the simplest sugar, or amino acetonitrile, a possible precursor of glycine. Recently, we have reported
the detection of two new nitrogen-bearing complex organics, glycolonitrile and Z-cyanomethanimine,
known to be intermediate species in the formation process of ribonucleotides within theories of
a primordial ribonucleic acid (RNA)-world for the origin of life. In this paper, we present deep
and high-sensitivity observations toward two of the most chemically rich sources in the Galaxy:
a Giant Molecular Cloud in the center of the Milky Way (G+0.693-0.027) and a proto-Sun (IRAS16293-2422
B). Our aim is to explore whether the key precursors considered to drive the primordial RNA-world
chemistry, are also found in space. Our high-sensitivity observations reveal that urea is present
in G+0.693-0.027 with an abundance of about 5x10-11. This is the first detection of this prebiotic
species outside a star-forming region. Urea remains undetected toward the proto-Sun IRAS16293-2422
B (upper limit to its abundance of less than 2x10-11). Other precursors of the RNA-world chemical
scheme such as glycolaldehyde or cyanamide are abundant in space, but key prebiotic species such
as 2- amino-oxazole, glyceraldehyde or dihydroxyacetone are not detected in either source. Future
more sensitive observations targeting the brightest transitions of these species will be needed
to disentangle whether these large prebiotic organics are certainly present in space.
