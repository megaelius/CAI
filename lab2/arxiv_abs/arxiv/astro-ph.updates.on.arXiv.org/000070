We investigate machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting the number of galaxies (N_gal)
that occupy a halo, given the halo's properties. These types of mappings are crucial for constructing
the mock galaxy catalogs necessary for analyses of large-scale structure. The ML techniques proposed
here distinguish themselves from traditional halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling as
they do not assume a prescribed relationship between halo properties and N_gal. In addition, our
ML approaches are only dependent on parent halo properties (like HOD methods), which are advantageous
over subhalo-based approaches as identifying subhalos correctly is difficult. We test 2 algorithms:
support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) regression. We take galaxies and
halos from the Millennium simulation and predict N_gal by training our algorithms on the following
6 halo properties: number of particles, M_200, \sigma_v, v_max, half-mass radius and spin. For
Millennium, our predicted N_gal values have a mean-squared-error (MSE) of ~0.16 for both SVM and
kNN. Our predictions match the overall distribution of halos reasonably well and the galaxy correlation
function at large scales to ~5-10%. In addition, we demonstrate a feature selection algorithm to
isolate the halo parameters that are most predictive, a useful technique for understanding the
mapping between halo properties and N_gal. Lastly, we investigate these ML-based approaches in
making mock catalogs for different galaxy subpopulations (e.g. blue, red, high M_star, low M_star).
Given its non-parametric nature as well as its powerful predictive and feature selection capabilities,
machine learning offers an interesting alternative for creating mock catalogs.
