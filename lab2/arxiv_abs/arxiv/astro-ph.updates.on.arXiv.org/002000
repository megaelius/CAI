We measure the strength of HeII$\lambda$4686 nebular emission in passively evolving ("retired")
galaxies, aiming to constrain their populations of hot accreting white dwarfs (WDs) in the context
of the single degenerate (SD) scenario of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In the SD scenario, as a WD burns
hydrogen-rich material accreted from a companion star, it becomes a powerful source of ionizing
UV emission. If significant populations of such sources exist in galaxies, strong emission in the
recombination lines of HeII should be expected from the interstellar medium. To explore this conjecture,
we select from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ~11 500 emission line galaxies with stellar ages >1
Gyr showing no signs of AGN activity and co-add their spectra in bins of stellar population age. For
the first time, we detect HeII$\lambda$4686 nebular emission in retired galaxies and find it to
be significantly weaker than that expected in the SD scenario, especially in the youngest age bin
(1-4 Gyr) where the SN Ia rate is the highest. Instead, the strength of the observed HeII$\lambda$4686
nebular emission is consistent with post-asymptotic giant branch stars being the sole ionizing
source in all age bins. These results limit populations of accreting WDs with photospheric temperatures
($T_{\rm eff}$) in the range ~(1.5-6)$\cdot 10^5$ K to the level at which they can account for no more
than ~5-10% of the observed SN Ia rate. Conversely, should all WD progenitors of SN Ia go through the
phase of steady nuclear burning with $T_{\rm eff}$~(1.5-6)$\cdot 10^5$ K, they do not increase
their mass by more than ~0.03 $M_\odot$ in this regime.
