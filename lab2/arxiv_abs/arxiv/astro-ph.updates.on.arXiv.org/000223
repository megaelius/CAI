A {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\it HST}) / Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) study of the structural
properties of 85 luminous and ultraluminous ($L_{\rm IR} > 10^{11.4}$ L$_\odot$) infrared
galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) sample is presented.
Two-dimensional GALFIT analysis has been performed on F814W "{\it I}-band" images to decompose
each galaxy, as appropriate, into bulge, disk, central PSF and stellar bar components. The fraction
of bulge-less disk systems is observed to be higher in LIRGs (35%) than in ULIRGs (20%), with the disk+bulge
systems making up the dominant fraction of both LIRGs (55%) and ULIRGs (45%). Further, bulge+disk
systems are the dominant late-stage merger galaxy type and are the dominant type for LIRGs and ULIRGs
at almost every stage of galaxy-galaxy nuclear separation. The mean {\it I}-band host absolute
magnitude of the GOALS galaxies is $-22.64\pm$0.62 mag (1.8$^{+1.4}_{-0.4}$ L$^*_I$), and the
mean bulge absolute magnitude in GOALS galaxies is about 1.1 magnitude fainter than the mean host
magnitude. Almost all ULIRGs have bulge magnitudes at the high end (-20.6 to - 23.5 mag) of the GOALS
bulge magnitude range. Mass ratios in the GOALS binary systems are consistent with most of the galaxies
being the result of major mergers, and an examination of the residual-to-host intensity ratios
in GOALS binary systems suggests that smaller companions suffer more tidal distortion than the
larger companions. We find approximately twice as many bars in GOALS disk+bulge systems (32.8%)
than in pure-disk mergers (15.9%) but most of the disk+bulge systems that contain bars are disk-dominated
with small bulges. The bar-to-host intensity ratio, bar half-light radius, and bar ellipticity
in GOALS galaxies are similar to those found in nearby spiral galaxies.(abridged)
