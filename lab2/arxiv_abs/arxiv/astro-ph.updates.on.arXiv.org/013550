We present high resolution, deep imaging of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov taken with the \textit{Hubble
Space Telescope}/Wide Field Camera 3 before, during and after its perihelion passage on 2019 October
12, November 16, December 9, 23-25, January 29 and February 24 UTC \citep[][]{Jewitt2019hst, MeechHST2019b,JewittHST2019b}.
This also pre-dates its outburst and fragmentation observed by ground \citep[][]{Drahus2020Atel,Jehin2020CBET}
and space-based observations \citep[][]{Jewitt2020Atel, Bolin2020Atel} thus potentially
observing the comet in a relatively undisrupted state. Deep image stacks of 2I on all dates reveal
no discernible signal from a nucleus suggesting that the coma is a strong component of 2I's total
sunlight scattering cross-section. We locate jet-like structures near the optocenter of 2I 1-2\arcsec,
or 2,000 - 3,000 km in length that appears to change positions independent of the orbital velocity
and anti-solar vectors over the four observation dates indicating a possible rotational variation
of the morphology but does not show short term variability during the $\sim$14 orbit, $\sim$70 h
duration of the observations on 2019 December 23-25 UTC. Using the 14 orbit dataset from 2019 December
23-25, we see slight, $\lesssim$0.05 magnitude variation in the brightness of the lightcurve corresponding
to a possible double-peaked period of $\sim$11 h, though the small amplitude variation could be
due to short-term changes in the activity of 2I. In addition, we use deep image stacks from the highest
spatial resolution observations to estimate a $\sim$1-2 km diameter consistent with previous
high-resolution ground and space-based observations \citep[][]{Bolin2019a,Jewitt2019hst}
