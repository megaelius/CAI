Based on extensive air shower simulations it is shown that the electron distributions with respect
to the two angles, determining electron direction at a given shower age, for a fixed electron energy
and lateral distance, are universal. It means that the distributions do not depend on the primary
particle energy or mass (thus, neither on the interaction model), shower zenith angle or shower
to shower fluctuations, if they are taken at the same shower age. Together with previous work showing
the universality of the distributions of the electron energy, of the lateral distance (integrated
over angles) and of the angle (integrated over lateral distance) for fixed electron energy this
paper completes a full universal description of the electron states at various shower ages. Analytical
parametrizations of the full electron states are given. It is also shown that some distributions
can be described by a smaller than five numbers of variables, the new ones being products of the old
ones raised to some powers. The accuracy of the present parametrization is sufficiently good for
applying to showers with the primary energy uncertainty of 14% (as it is at the Pierre Auger Observatory).
The shower fluctuations in the chosen bins of the multidimensional variable space are about 6%,
determining the minimum uncertainty needed for parametrization of the universal distributions.
An analytical way of estimation of the effect of the geomagnetic field is given. Thanks to the universality
of the electron distributions in any shower a new method of shower reconstruction can be worked out
from data of the observatories using the fluorescence technique. The light fluxes (both fluorescence
and Cherenkov) for any shower age can be exactly predicted for a shower with any primary energy and
shower maximum depth, so that the two quantities can be obtained by best fitting the predictions
to the measurements
