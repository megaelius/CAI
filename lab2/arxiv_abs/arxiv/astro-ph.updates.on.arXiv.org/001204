We analyse the structures of all the clusters in the DAFT/FADA survey for which XMM-Newton and/or
a sufficient number of galaxy redshifts in the cluster range is available, with the aim of detecting
substructures and evidence for merging events. These properties are discussed in the framework
of standard cold dark matter cosmology.XMM-Newton data were available for 32 clusters, for which
we derive the X-ray luminosity and a global X-ray temperature for 25 of them. For 23 clusters we were
able to fit the X-ray emissivity with a beta-model and subtract it to detect substructures in the
X-ray gas. A dynamical analysis based on the SG method was applied to the clusters having at least
15 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts in the cluster range: 18 X-ray clusters and 11 clusters with no
X-ray data. Only major substructures will be detected. Ten substructures were detected both in
X-rays and by the SG method. Most of the substructures detected both in X-rays and with the SG method
are probably at their first cluster pericentre approach and are relatively recent infalls. We also
find hints of a decreasing X-ray gas density profile core radius with redshift. The percentage of
mass included in substructures was found to be roughly constant with redshift with values of 5-15%,
in agreement both with the general CDM framework and with the results of numerical simulations.
Galaxies in substructures show the same general behaviour as regular cluster galaxies; however,
in substructures, there is a deficiency of both late type and old stellar population galaxies. Late
type galaxies with recent bursts of star formation seem to be missing in the substructures close
to the bottom of the host cluster potential well. However, our sample would need to be increased to
allow a more robust analysis.
