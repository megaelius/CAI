Statistical pattern recognition methods have provided competitive solutions for variable star
classification at a relatively low computational cost. In order to perform supervised classification,
a set of features is proposed and used to train an automatic classification system. Quantities related
to the magnitude density of the light curves and their Fourier coefficients have been chosen as features
in previous studies. However, some of these features are not robust to the presence of outliers and
the calculation of Fourier coefficients is computationally expensive for large data sets. We propose
and evaluate the performance of a new robust set of features using supervised classifiers in order
to look for new Be star candidates in the OGLE-IV Gaia south ecliptic pole field. We calculated the
proposed set of features on six types of variable stars and on a set of Be star candidates reported
in the literature. We evaluated the performance of these features using classification trees and
random forests along with K-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, and gradient boosted
trees methods. We tuned the classifiers with a 10-fold cross-validation and grid search. We validated
the performance of the best classifier on a set of OGLE-IV light curves and applied this to find new
Be star candidates. The random forest classifier outperformed the others. By using the random forest
classifier and colour criteria we found 50 Be star candidates in the direction of the Gaia south ecliptic
pole field, four of which have infrared colours consistent with Herbig Ae/Be stars. Supervised
methods are very useful in order to obtain preliminary samples of variable stars extracted from
large databases. As usual, the stars classified as Be stars candidates must be checked for the colours
and spectroscopic characteristics expected for them.
