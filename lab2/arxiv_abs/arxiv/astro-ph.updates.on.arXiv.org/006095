HST/STIS observations of Uranus in 2015 show that the depletion of upper tropospheric methane has
been relatively stable and that the polar region has been brightening over time as a result of increased
aerosol scattering, which is confirmed by near-IR imaging from HST and from Keck/NIRC2 adaptive
optics imaging. Our analysis of the 2015 spectra, as well as prior spectra from 2012, shows that there
is a X 3 decrease in the effective upper tropospheric methane mixing ratio between 30 deg N and 70 deg
N. The absolute value of the deep CH4 mixing ratio, likely independent of latitude, is lower than
our previous estimate, and depends significantly on the style of aerosol model that we assume, ranging
from a high of 3.5+/-0.5% for conservative non-spherical particles with a simple Henyey-Greenstein
phase function to a low of 2.7+/-0.3% for conservative spherical particles. Our previous higher
estimate of 4+/-0.5% was a due to a forced consistency with occultation results of Lindal et al. (1987,
JGR 92, 14987-15001). That requirement was abandoned in our new analysis because new work of Orton
et al. (2014, Icarus 243, 494-513) and Lellouch et al. (2015, Astron. & AstroPhys. 579, A121) called
into question the occultation results. For the main cloud layer we found that both large and small
particle solutions are possible for spherical particle models. The small-particle solution has
a mean particle radius near 0.3 microns, a real refractive index of 1.7-1.9, and a total column mass
of 0.03 mg/cm^2, while the large-particle solution has a particle radius near 1.5 microns, a real
index near 1.24, and a total column mass 30 X larger. The main cloud layer extends between about 1.1
and 3 bars, within which H2S is the only plausible condensable. Since its real refractive index is
1.9, the small-particle solution provides the closest physical match to the most plausible cloud
constituent.
