Finding solar siblings - stars which formed in the same cluster as the Sun - will yield information
about the conditions at the Sun's birthplace. Finding the lost solar siblings is not an easy task
since they are already spread widely around the Galaxy. In this work we search for solar sibling candidates
among the very large spectra-base of solar vicinity stars - AMBRE. Since the solar siblings have
very similar age and chemical abundances as the Sun, we carried out a chemsitry and age based search
for solar sibling candidates. We used the high-resolution spectra to derive precise stellar parameters
and chemical abundances of the stars. We used these spectroscopic parameters together with the
Gaia DR2 astrometric data to derive stellar isochronal ages. The Gaia data was also used to study
the kinematics of the sibling candidates. From the about 17000 stars characterized within the AMBRE
project we first select 55 stars that have metallicities closest to the solar value (-0.1 < [Fe/H]
< 0.1 dex). For these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, alpha-
and neutron-capture elements with which to select 12 solar sibling candidates with average abundances
and metallicity between -0.03 to 0.03 dex. Our further selection left us with four candidates which
have stellar ages compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the two
of the hottest candidates we derived the carbon isotopic ratios finding these to be compatible with
the solar value. HD186302 is the most precisely characterized and probably the best candidate among
our four best candidates. We propose that besides typical chemical tagging the study of isotopic
ratios can give further important information about the relation of sibling candidates with the
Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic age determinations of the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise
isochronal ages.
