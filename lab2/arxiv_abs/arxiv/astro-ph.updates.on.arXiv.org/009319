We propose an expression for a local planetesimal formation rate proportional to the instantaneous
radial pebble flux. The result --- a radial planetesimal distribution --- can be used as initial
condition to study the formation of planetary embryos. We follow the idea that one needs particle
traps to locally enhance the dust-to-gas ratio sufficiently such that particle gas interactions
can no longer prevent planetesimal formation on small scales. The location of these traps can emerge
everywhere in the disk. Their occurrence and lifetime is subject of ongoing research, thus they
are implemented via free parameters. This enables us to study the influence of the disk properties
on the formation of planetesimals, predicting their time dependent formation rates and location
of primary pebble accretion. We show that large $\alpha$-values of $0.01$ (strong turbulence)
prevent the formation of planetesimals in the inner part of the disk, arguing for lower values of
around $0.001$ (moderate turbulence), at which planetesimals form quickly at all places where
they are needed for proto-planets. Planetesimals form as soon as dust has grown to pebbles ($\sim\mathrm{mm}$
to $\mathrm{dm}$) and the pebble flux reaches a critical value, which is after a few thousand years
at $2-3\,$AU and after a few hundred thousand years at $20-30\,$AU. Planetesimal formation lasts
until the pebble supply has decreased below a critical value. The final spatial planetesimal distribution
is steeper compared to the initial dust and gas distribution which helps to explain the discrepancy
between the minimum mass solar nebula and viscous accretion disks.
