Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies from Planck have estimated
lower value of the optical depth to reionization ($\tau$) compared to WMAP. A significant period
in the reionization history, therefore falls within $6<{\rm redshift} (z)< 10$ where overlap with
the galaxies detected with Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) program and independent estimation of
neutral hydrogen in the inter galactic medium by Lyman-$\alpha$ observations becomes important.
This overlap calls for an analysis of cosmic reionization which allows a direct combination of CMB
and astrophysical measurements. For the first time we reconstruct reionization histories where
the photo-ionization and recombination rates are assumed to be free-form using the Planck CMB (temperature
and polarization anisotropies and lensing) and a selection of astrophysical data allowing underlying
cosmological parameters to vary. This conservative approach removes model bias, explores degeneracies
between reionization and other cosmological parameters in a framework that allows sharp to extended
histories of reionization. We find that CMB and astrophysical datasets cannot agree if reionization
process is sharp. In this joint estimation, we report a derived conservative constraint $\tau=0.063^{+0.005\,+0.02}_{-0.013\,-0.017}$
(68.3\% and 95\% C.L.). We find the duration of reionization, redshift interval between 10\% ionization
and nearly complete ionization, to be $2.4<\Delta^{\rm reion}_{z}<11.9$ at 95\% C.L. We do not
obtain any evidences for double reionization; and within allowed possibilities we find monotonic
histories are preferred over other scenarios when CMB and astrophysical data are combined.
