We investigate the influence of magnetic fields on the evolution of binary neutron-star (BNS) merger
remnants via three-dimensional (3D) dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations. We evolve a postmerger remnant with an initial poloidal magnetic field, resolve
the magnetoturbulence driven by shear flows, and include a microphysical finite-temperature
equation of state (EOS). A neutrino leakage scheme that captures the overall energetics and lepton
number exchange is also included. We find that turbulence induced by the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) in the hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) amplifies magnetic field to beyond magnetar-strength
($10^{15}\, \mathrm{G}$). The ultra-strong toroidal field is able to launch a relativistic jet
from the HMNS. We also find a magnetized wind that ejects neutron-rich material with a rate of $\dot{M}_{\mathrm{ej}}
\simeq 1 \times10^{-1}\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}\, s^{-1}}$. The total ejecta mass in our simulation
is $5\times 10^{-3}\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. This makes the ejecta from the HMNS an important component
in BNS mergers and a promising source of $r$-process elements that can power a kilonova. The jet from
the HMNS reaches a terminal Lorentz factor of $\sim 5$ in our highest-resolution simulation. The
formation of this jet is aided by neutrino-cooling preventing the accretion disk from protruding
into the polar region. As neutrino pair-annihilation and radiative processes in the jet (which
were not included in the simulations) will boost the Lorentz factor in the jet further, our simulations
demonstrate that magnetars formed in BNS mergers are a viable engine for short gamma-ray bursts
(sGRBs).
