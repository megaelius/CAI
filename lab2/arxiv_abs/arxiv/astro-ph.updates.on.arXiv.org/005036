Using test particle simulations we study electron acceleration at collisionless shocks with a
two-component model turbulent magnetic field with slab component including dissipation range.
We investigate the importance of shock normal angle $\theta_{Bn}$, magnetic turbulence level
$\left(b/B_0\right)^2$, and shock thickness on the acceleration efficiency of electrons. It
is shown that at perpendicular shocks the electron acceleration efficiency is enhanced with the
decreasing of $\left(b/B_0\right)^2$, and at $\left(b/B_0\right)^2=0.01$ the acceleration
becomes significant due to strong drift electric field with long time particles staying near the
shock front for shock drift acceleration (SDA). In addition, at parallel shocks the electron acceleration
efficiency is increasing with the increasing of $\left(b/B_0\right)^2$, and at $\left(b/B_0\right)^2=10.0$
the acceleration is very strong due to sufficient pitch-angle scattering for diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA), as well as due to large local component of magnetic field perpendicular to shock normal angle
for SDA. On the other hand, the high perpendicular shock acceleration with $\left(b/B_0\right)^2=0.01$
is stronger than the high parallel shock acceleration with ($\left(b/B_0\right)^2=10.0$), the
reason might be the assumption that SDA is more efficient than DSA. Furthermore, for oblique shocks,
the acceleration efficiency is small no matter the turbulence level is low or high. Moreover, for
the effect of shock thickness on electron acceleration at perpendicular shocks, we show that there
exists the bend-over thickness, $L_{\text{diff,b}}$. The acceleration efficiency does not change
evidently if the shock thickness is much smaller than $L_{\text{diff,b}}$. However, if the shock
thickness is much larger than $L_{\text{diff,b}}$, the acceleration efficiency starts to drop
abruptly.
