Active Region (AR) 12192 is the biggest AR observed in solar cycle 24 so far. This was a long-lived
AR which survived for four Carrington rotations (CR) and exhibited several unusual phenomena.
We measure the horizontal subsurface flows in this active region in multiple rotation using the
ring-diagram technique of local helioseismology and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG+)
Dopplergrams, and investigate how different was the plasma flow in AR 12192 from that in AR 10486.
Both regions produced several high M- and X-class flares but had different CME productivity. Our
analysis suggests that these ARs had unusually large horizontal flow amplitude with distinctly
different directions. While meridional flow in AR 12192 was poleward that supports the flux transport
to poles, it was equatorward in AR 10486. Furthermore, there was a sudden increase in the magnitude
of estimated zonal flow in shallow layers in AR 12192 during the X3.1 flare, however, it reversed
direction in AR 10486 with X17.2 flare. These flow patterns produced strong twists in horizontal
velocity with depth in AR 10486 that persisted throughout the disk passage as opposed to AR 12192,
which produced a twist only after the eruption of the X3.1 flare that disappeared soon after. Our
study indicates that the sunspot rotation combined with the re-organization of magnetic field
in AR 10486 was not sufficient to decrease the flow energy even after several large flares that might
have triggered CMEs. Furthermore, in the absence of sunspot rotation in AR 12192, this re-organization
of magnetic field contributed significantly to the substantial release of flow energy after the
X3.1 flare.
