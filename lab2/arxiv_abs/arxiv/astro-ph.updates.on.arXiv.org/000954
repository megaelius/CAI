"Changing look" Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are a subset of Seyfert galaxies characterized by
rapid transitions between Compton-thin and Compton-thick regimes. In their Compton-thin state,
the central engine is less obscured, hence spectroscopy or timing observations can probe their
innermost structures. However, it is not clear if the observed emission features and the Compton
hump are associated with relativistic reflection onto the accretion disc, or complex absorption
by distant, absorbing gas clouds passing by the observer's line-of-sight. Here, we investigate
these two scenarios under the scope of X-ray polarimetry, providing the first polarisation predictions
for an archetypal "changing look" AGN: NGC 1365. We explore the resulting polarisation emerging
from lamp-post emission and scattering off an accretion disc in the immediate vicinity of a supermassive
black hole. The computed polarisation signatures are compared to the results of an absorption-dominated
model, where high column density gas partially covers the central source. While the shape of the
polarisation spectrum is similar, the two models differ in net polarisation percentage, with the
relativistic reflection scenario producing significantly stronger polarisation. Additionally,
the variation of the polarisation position angle is distinctly different between both scenarios:
the reflection-dominated model produces smooth rotations of the polarisation angle with photon
energy whereas circumnuclear absorption causes an orthogonal switch of the polarisation angle
between the soft and the hard X-ray bands. By comparing the predicted polarisation of NGC 1365 to
the detectability levels of X-ray polarimetry mission concepts proposed in the past, we demonstrate
that with a large, soft X-ray observatory or a medium-sized mission equipped with a hard (6 - 35 keV)
polarimeter, the correct interpretation would be unambiguous.
