As the number of complex organic molecules (COMs) detected in the interstellar medium increases,
it becomes important to place meaningful constraints on the formation pathways of these species.
The molecular cloud SgrB2(N) is host to several hot molecular cores in the early stage of star formation,
where a great variety of COMs are detected in the gas phase. Because of its exposure to the extreme
conditions of the the Galactic center region, SgrB2(N) is one of the best targets to study the impact
of environmental conditions on the production of COMs. Our main goal is to characterize the physico-chemical
evolution of SgrB2(N)'s sources in order to explain their chemical differences and constrain their
environmental conditions. The chemical composition of SgrB2(N)'s hot cores, N2, N3, N4, and N5
is derived by modeling their 3mm emission spectra extracted from the EMoCA imaging spectral line
survey performed with ALMA. We derive the density distribution in the envelope of the sources based
on the masses computed from the ALMA dust continuum emission maps. We use the radiative transfer
code RADMC-3D to compute temperature profiles based on the COM rotational temperatures derived
from population diagrams. We use published results of 3D RMHD simulations of high-mass star formation
to estimate the time evolution of the sources properties. We employ the chemical code MAGICKAL to
compute time-dependent chemical abundances in the sources and investigate how physical properties
and environmental conditions influence the production of COMs. We find that chemical models with
a cosmic-ray ionization rate of 7e-16s-1 best reproduce the abundances with respect to methanol
of ten COMs observed toward SgrB2(N2-N5). We also show that COMs still form efficiently on dust grains
with minimum dust temperatures in the prestellar phase as high as 15K, but that minimum temperatures
higher than 25K are excluded.
