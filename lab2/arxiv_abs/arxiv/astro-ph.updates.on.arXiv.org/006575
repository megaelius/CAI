We review astronomical results in the visible (lambda <1 micron) with adaptive optics and note the
status the MagAO system and the recent upgrade to visible camera's Simultaneous/Spectra Differential
Imager (SDI to SDI+) mode. Since mid-2013 there has been a rapid increase visible AO with over 50 refereed
science papers published in just 2015-2016 timeframe. The main focus of this paper is another large
(D=6.5m Magellan telescope) AO system (MagAO) which has been very productive in the visible (particularly
at the H-alpha emission line). MagAO is an advanced Adaptive Secondary Mirror (ASM) AO system at
the Magellan in Chile. This ASM secondary has 585 actuators with <1 msec response times (0.7 ms typically).
MagAO utilizes a 1 kHz pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). The relatively small actuator pitch (~22
cm/subap, 300 modes, upgraded to 30 pix dia. PWFS) allows moderate Strehls to be obtained in the visible
(0.63-1.05 microns). Long exposures (60s) achieve <30mas resolutions and 30% Strehls at 0.62 microns
(r') with the VisAO camera (0.5-1.0 microns) in 0.5" seeing with bright R < 9 mag stars (~10% Strehls
can be obtained on fainter R~12 mag guide stars). Differential Spectral Imaging (SDI) at H-alpha
has been very important for accreting exoplanet detection. There is also a 1-5micron science camera
(Clio; Morzinski et al. 2016). These capabilities have led to over 35 MagAO refereed science publications.
Here we review the key steps to having good performance in the visible and review the exciting new
AO visible science opportunities and science results. The recent rapid increase in the scientific
publications and power of visible AO is due to the maturity of the next-generation of AO systems and
our new ability probe circumstellar regions with very high (10-30 mas) spatial resolutions that
would otherwise require much larger (>10m) diameter telescopes in the infrared.
