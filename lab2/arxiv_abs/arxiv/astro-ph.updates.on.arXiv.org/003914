We present data for 16 galaxies in the overdensity JKCS 041 at $z \simeq 1.80$ as part of the K-band
Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) Cluster Survey (KCS). With 20-hour integrations, we have obtained
deep absorption-line spectra from which we derived velocity dispersions for seven quiescent galaxies.
We combined photometric parameters derived from Hubble Space Telescope images with the dispersions
to construct a fundamental plane (FP) for quiescent galaxies in JKCS 041. From the zero-point evolution
of the FP, we derived a formation redshift for the galaxies of $z_{form} = 3.0\pm0.3$, corresponding
to a mean age of $1.4\pm0.2$ Gyrs. We tested the effect of structural and velocity dispersion evolution
on our FP zero point and found a negligible contribution when using dynamical mass-normalized parameters
($\sim 3\%$), but a significant contribution from stellar-mass-normalized parameters ($\sim
42 \%$). From the relative velocities of the galaxies, we probed the three-dimensional structure
of these 16 confirmed members of JKCS 041, and found that a group of galaxies in the south west of the
overdensity had systematically higher velocities. We derived ages for the galaxies in the different
groups from the FP. We found the east-extending group had typically older galaxies ($2.1\substack{+0.3\\-0.2}$
Gyrs), than those in the south-west group ($0.3\pm0.2$ Gyrs). Although based on small numbers,
the overdensity dynamics, morphology, and age results could indicate that JKCS 041 is in formation
and may comprise two merging groups of galaxies. The result could link large-scale structure to
ages of galaxies for the first time at this redshift.
