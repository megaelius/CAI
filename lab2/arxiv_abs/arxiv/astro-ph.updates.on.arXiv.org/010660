The formation, properties, and evolution of massive stars remain subject to considerable uncertainty;
impacting on fields as diverse as galactic feedback and the nature of the progenitors of both electromagnetic
and gravitational wave transients. The clusters many such stars reside within provide a unique
laboratory for addressing these issues, and in this work we provide a comprehensive stellar census
of Westerlund 1 to underpin such efforts. 69 new members were identified via I-band spectroscopy,
yielding a total cluster population of 166 stars with initial masses of ~25Msun to ~50Msun, with
more massive stars already lost to supernova. The stellar population follows a smooth and continuous
morphological sequence from late-O giant through to OB supergiant. Subsequently, the progression
bifurcates, with one branch yielding mid- to late-B hypergiants and cool super-/hypergiants,
and the other massive blue stragglers, prior to a diverse population of H-depleted Wolf-Rayets.
A substantial population of O-type stars with anomalously broad Paschen series lines are seen,
a property which we attribute to binarity. Binary interaction is clearly required to yield the uniquely
rich cohort of hypergiants, which includes both mass-stripped primaries and rejuvenated secondaries/stellar
mergers. As a consequence future observations of Wd1 and similar stellar aggregates hold out the
prospect of characterising both single- and binary- evolutionary channels for massive stars and
determining their relative contributions. This in turn will permit the physical properties of
such objects at the point of core-collapse to be predicted; of direct relevance for understanding
the formation of relativistic remnants such as the magnetars associated with Wd1 and other young
massive clusters (Abridged).
