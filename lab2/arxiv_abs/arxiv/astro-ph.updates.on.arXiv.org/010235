Reverberation mapping (RM) is a powerful approach for determining the nature of the broad-line
region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei. However, inferring physical BLR properties from an observed
spectroscopic time series is a difficult inverse problem. Here, we present a blind test of two widely
used RM methods: MEMEcho (developed by Horne) and CARAMEL (developed by Pancoast and collaborators).
The test data are simulated spectroscopic time series that track the H$\alpha$ emission line response
to an empirical continuum light curve. The underlying BLR model is a rotating, biconical accretion
disc wind, and the synthetic spectra are generated via self-consistent ionization and radiative
transfer simulations. We generate two mock data sets, representing Seyfert galaxies and QSOs.
The Seyfert model produces a largely *negative* response, which neither method can recover. However,
both fail $``gracefully''$, neither generating spurious results. For the QSO model both CARAMEL
and expert interpretation of MEMEcho's output both capture the broadly annular, rotation-dominated
nature of the line-forming region, though MEMEcho analysis overestimates its size by 50%, but CARAMEL
is unable to distinguish between additional inflow and outflow components. Despite fitting individual
spectra well, the CARAMEL velocity-delay maps and RMS line profiles are strongly inconsistent
with the input data. Finally, since the H$\alpha$ line-forming region is rotation dominated, neither
method recovers the disc wind nature of the underlying BLR model. Thus considerable care is required
when interpreting the results of RM analyses in terms of physical models.
