Since the discovery of Jupiter-sized planets in extremely close orbits around Sun-like stars,
several mechanisms have been proposed to form these "hot Jupiters". None of them addressed their
pile-up at 0.05 AU observed in stellar radial velocity surveys, their longterm orbital stability
in the presence of stellar tides, and their occurrence rate of 1.2 (+-0.38) % at the same time. Here
we calculate the combined torques on the planet from both the dissipation by the stellar dynamical
tide and from a 2D non-isothermal viscous disk in the type II migration regime. We show that the torques
from star-planet and planet-disk interaction can add up to zero beyond the co-rotation radius around
young, solar-type stars and inwards migration can stop. Monte Carlo simulations with plausible
variations of our nominal star-disk-planet model parameterization predict a survival rate of
28.4 % against tidal destruction. Once the protoplanetary disk has gone, the surviving hot Jupiters
are pushed outward from their tidal migration barrier and pile up near 0.05 AU, as we demonstrate
using a numerical implementation of a stellar dynamical tide model coupled with stellar evolution
tracks. Orbital decay is negligible on a billion year time scale due to the contraction of the highly
dissipative convective envelopes in young Sun-like stars. The lower pile-up efficiency around
metal-poor stars partly explains the absence of a hot Jupiter pile-up in the Kepler data. When combined
with the observed hot Jupiter occurrence rate, our results for the survival rate imply a hot Jupiter
formation rate of 4.2 (+-1.3) % around sun-like stars. This value depends on the distribution of
the relevant star and disk properties and can change by a factor of a few within reasonable margins.
Our scenario reconciles models and observations of young spinning stars with the observed hot Jupiter
pile up and hot Jupiter occurrence rates.
