Upcoming X-ray surveys like eROSITA require precise calibration between X-ray observables and
mass down to the low mass regime to set tight constraints on the fundamental cosmological parameters.
Since an individual mass measurement is only possible for a relatively small number of objects it
is crucial to have robust and well understood scaling relations that relate the total mass to easily
observable quantities. The main goal of this work is to constrain the galaxy group scaling relations
corrected for selection effects, and to quantify the influence of non-gravitational physics at
the low-mass regime. We analyzed XMM-Newton observations for a complete sample of galaxy groups
selected from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and we compared the derived scaling properties with a galaxy
cluster sample. To investigate the role played by the different non-gravitational processes we
then compared the observational data with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations. After
applying the correction for selection effects (e.g. Malmquist bias) the L-M relation is steeper
than the observed one. Its slope is also steeper than the value obtained by using the more massive
systems of the HIFLUGCS sample. This behaviour can be explained by a gradual change of the true L-M
relation which should be taken into account when converting the observational parameters into
masses. The other observed scaling relations (not corrected for selection biases) do not show any
break although the comparison with the simulations suggests that feedback processes play an important
role in the formation and evolution of galaxy groups. Thanks to our master sample of 82 objects spanning
two order of magnitude in mass we tightly constrain the dependence of the gas mass fraction on the
total mass, finding almost a factor of two difference between groups and clusters.
