We present new two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric neutrino radiation/hydrodynamic models of
core-collapse supernova (CCSN) cores. We use the CASTRO code, which incorporates truly multi-dimensional,
multi-group, flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport, including all relevant $\mathcal{O}(v/c)$
terms. Our main motivation for carrying out this study is to compare with recent 2D models produced
by other groups who have obtained explosions for some progenitor stars and with recent 2D VULCAN
results that did not incorporate $\mathcal{O}(v/c)$ terms. We follow the evolution of 12, 15, 20,
and 25 solar-mass progenitors to approximately 600 milliseconds after bounce and do not obtain
an explosion in any of these models. Though the reason for the qualitative disagreement among the
groups engaged in CCSN modeling remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying ``ray-by-ray'
approach employed by all other groups may be compromising their results. We show that ``ray-by-ray'
calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal variations of the neutrino fluxes, which
we argue are better captured by our multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On the other hand, our 2D models
also make approximations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions concerning the root
of the differences between groups. We discuss some of the diagnostics often employed in the analyses
of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate relationship between the various explosion conditions
that have been proposed. Finally, we explore the ingredients that may be missing in current calculations
that may be important in reproducing the properties of the average CCSNe, should the delayed neutrino-heating
mechanism be the correct mechanism of explosion.
