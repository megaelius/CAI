PTF11kx was a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) that showed time-variable absorption features, including
saturated Ca II H&K lines that weakened and eventually went into emission. The strength of the
emission component of H{\alpha} increased, implying that the SN was undergoing significant interaction
with its circumstellar medium (CSM). These features were blueshifted slightly and showed a P-Cygni
profile, likely indicating that the CSM was directly related to, and probably previously ejected
by, the progenitor system itself. These and other observations led Dilday et al. (2012) to conclude
that PTF11kx came from a symbiotic nova progenitor like RS Oph. In this work we extend the spectral
coverage of PTF11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. These spectra of PTF11kx
are dominated by H{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s), strong Ca II emission features
(~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue "quasi-continuum" due to many overlapping narrow lines of Fe II.
Emission from oxygen, He I, and Balmer lines higher than H{\alpha} is weak or completely absent at
all epochs, leading to large observed H{\alpha}/H{\beta} intensity ratios. The broader (~2000
km/s) H{\alpha} emission appears to increase in strength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently
decreases significantly along with the Ca II emission. Our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility
of newly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the red wing of H{\alpha}. During
the same epochs, multiple narrow emission features from the CSM temporally vary in strength. The
weakening of the H{\alpha} and Ca II emission at late times is possible evidence that the SN ejecta
have overtaken the majority of the CSM and agrees with models of other strongly interacting SNe Ia.
The varying narrow emission features, on the other hand, may indicate that the CSM is clumpy or consists
of multiple thin shells.
