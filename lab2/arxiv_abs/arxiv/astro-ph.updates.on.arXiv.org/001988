Barred galaxies have very interesting morphological features. Here we examine the barlens, a lens-like
component whose extent along the bar major axis is shorter than that of the bar and whose outline is
oval or circular. We show that such a component can also be found in a number of N-body plus SPH simulations.
We analyse its properties by converting simulation snapshots into images, which we then analyse
in the same way as images of observed galaxies. We make extensive comparisons with galaxies from
the NIRS0S (Near Infrared S0 Survey) and the S$^4$G (Spitzer Stellar Structure Survey of Galaxies)
samples and find very good agreement. These comparisons include morphology, radial projected
density profiles, shapes, sizes and fluxes. We observe the barlens component in our simulations
from different viewing angles. This reveals that {\it barlenses are the vertically thick part of
the bar seen face-on, i.e. that a barlens seen edge-on is a boxy/peanut/X bulge}. This finding makes
it possible to follow barlens dynamics in terms of already studied families of periodic orbits.
Some barlenses, notably those with near-circular projected isodensity curves, can be mistaken
for classical bulges in morphological studies and classifications. This can introduce severe
errors in modelling of individual galaxies, since the dynamics of classical bulges is very different
from that of peanuts, and a bias in statistical morphological studies, leading to overestimates
of the true frequency and mass of classical bulges. Thus, properly accounting for the barlens component
will show that the fraction of disc galaxies lacking a classical bulge can be much larger than so far
believed. Finally, based on the shape of the isodensity curves, we propose a rule of thumb for measuring
the barlens extent along the bar major axis of galaxies sufficiently far from edge-on for the peanut
not to be visible.
