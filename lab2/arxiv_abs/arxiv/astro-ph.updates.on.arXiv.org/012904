Traveling across several order of magnitude in distance, relativistic jets from strong gravity
region to asymptotic flat spacetime region are believed to consist of several general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) processes. We present a semi-analytical approach for modeling the
global structures of a trans-fast magnetosonic relativistic jet, which should be ejected from
a plasma source nearby a black hole in a funnel region enclosed by dense accreting flow and also disk
corona around the black hole. Our model consistently includes the inflow and outflow part of the
GRMHD solution along the magnetic field lines penetrating the black hole horizon. After the rotational
energy of the black hole is extracted electromagnetically by the negative energy GRMHD inflow,
the huge electromagnetic energy flux then propagates from the inflow to the outflow region across
the plasma source, and in the outflow region the electromagnetic energy converts to the fluid kinetic
energy. Eventually, the accelerated outflow must exceed the fast-magnetosonic wave speed. We
apply the semi-analytical trans-fast magnetosonic flow model to the black hole magnetosphere
for both parabolic and split-monopole magnetic field configurations, and discuss the general
flow properties; that is, jet acceleration, jet magnetization, and the locations of some characteristic
surfaces of the black hole magnetosphere. We have confirmed that, at large distance, the GRMHD jet
solutions are in good agreement with the previously known trans-fast special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(SRMHD) jet properties, as expected. The flexibility of the model provides a prompt and heuristic
way to approximate the global GRMHD trans-fast magnetosonic jet properties.
