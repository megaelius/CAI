The spectral shape of the hard X-ray continuum of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be ascribed to
inverse Compton scattering of optical/UV seed photons from the accretion disc by a hot corona of
electrons. This physical process produces a polarization signal which is strongly sensitive to
the geometry of the scattering medium (i.e. the hot corona) and of the radiation field. MoCA (Monte
Carlo code for Comptonisation in Astrophysics) is a versatile code which allows for different geometries
and configurations to be tested for Compton scattering in compact objects. A single photon approach
is considered as well as polarisation and Klein-Nishina effects. In this work, we selected four
different geometries for the scattering electrons cloud above the accretion disc, namely an extended
slab, an extended spheroid and two compact spheroids. We discuss the first application of the MoCA
model to reproduce the hard X-ray primary continuum of the bare Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, using different
geometries for the hot corona above the accretion disc. We report on the spectral analysis of the
simultaneous 2013 and 2014 XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations of the source. A general agreement
is found between the best fit values of the hot coronal parameters obtained with MoCA and the ones
inferred using other Comptonisation codes from the literature. The expected polarization signal
from the best fits with MoCA is then presented and discussed, in view of the launch in 2021 of the Imaging
X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We find that none of the tested geometries for the hot corona
(extended slab and extended/compact spheroids) can be statistically preferred, based on spectroscopy
solely. In the future, an IXPE observation less than 1 Ms long will clearly distinguish between an
extended slab or a spherical hot corona.
