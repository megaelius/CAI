We present the SPHINX suite of cosmological adaptive mesh refinement simulations, the first radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations to simultaneously capture large-scale reionization and the escape of ionizing radiation
from thousands of resolved galaxies. Our $5$ and $10$ co-moving Mpc volumes resolve haloes down
to the atomic cooling limit and model the inter-stellar medium with better than $\approx10$ pc resolution.
The project has numerous goals in improving our understanding of reionization and making predictions
for future observations. In this first paper we study how the inclusion of binary stars in computing
stellar luminosities impacts reionization, compared to a model that includes only single stars.
Owing to the suppression of galaxy growth via strong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement
with observational estimates of the galaxy luminosity function. We find that binaries have a significant
impact on the timing of reionization: with binaries, our boxes are $99.9$ percent ionized by volume
at $z\approx 7$, while without them our volumes fail to reionize by $z=6$. These results are robust
to changes in volume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The escape of ionizing radiation
from individual galaxies varies strongly and frequently. On average, binaries lead to escape fractions
of $\approx 7-10$ percent, about $3.5$ times higher than with single stars only. The higher escape
fraction is a result of a shallower decline in ionizing luminosity with age, and is the primary reason
for earlier reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with binaries also plays
a sub-dominant role.
