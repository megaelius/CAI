Astrometry is one of the main science case which drives the requirements of the next multiconjugate
adaptive optics (MCAO) systems for future extremely large telescopes. The small diffraction limited
point-spread function (PSF) and the high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of these instruments, promise
astrometric precision at the level of micro-arcseconds. However, optical distortions have to
be as low as possible to achieve the high demanding astrometry requirements. In addition to static
distortions, the opto-mechanical instabilities cause astrometric errors that can be major contributors
to the astrometry error budget. The present article describes the analysis, at design level, of
the effects of opto-mechanical instabilities when coupled with optical surface irregularities
due to the manufacturing process. We analyse the notable example of the Multi-conjugate Adaptive
Optics RelaY (MAORY) for the extremely large telescope (ELT). Ray-tracing simulations combined
with a Monte Carlo approach are used to estimate the geometrical structure and magnitude of field
distortion resulting from the optical design. We consider the effects of distortion on the MCAO
correction showing that it is possible achieve the micro-arcseconds astrometric precision once
corresponding accuracy is obtained by both optical design and manufacturing. We predict that for
single-epoch observations, an astrometric error below 50$\mu$as can be achieved for exposure
times up to 2 min, provided about 100 stars are available to remove fifth-order distortions. Such
performance could be reproducible for multi-epoch observations despite the time-variable distortion
induced by instrument instabilities.
