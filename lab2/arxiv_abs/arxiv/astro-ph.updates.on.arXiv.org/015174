We present a data-driven method to estimate absolute magnitudes for O- and B-type stars from the
LAMOST spectra, which we combine with {\it Gaia} parallaxes to infer distance and binarity. The
method applies a neural network model trained on stars with precise {\it Gaia} parallax to the spectra
and predicts $K_{\rm s}$-band absolute magnitudes $M_{Ks}$ with a precision of 0.25\,mag, which
corresponds to a precision of 12\% in spectroscopic distance. For distant stars (e.g. $>5$\,kpc),
the inclusion of constraints from spectroscopic $M_{Ks}$ significantly improves the distance
estimates compared to inferences from {\it Gaia} parallax alone. Our method accommodates for emission
line stars by first identifying them via PCA reconstructions and then treating them separately
for the $M_{Ks}$ estimation. We also take into account unresolved binary/multiple stars, which
we identify through deviations in the spectroscopic $M_{Ks}$ from the geometric $M_{Ks}$ inferred
from {\it Gaia} parallax. This method of binary identification is particularly efficient for unresolved
binaries with near equal-mass components and thus provides an useful supplementary way to identify
unresolved binary or multiple-star systems. We present a catalog of spectroscopic $M_{Ks}$, extinction,
distance, flags for emission lines, and binary classification for 16,002 OB stars from LAMOST DR5.
As an illustration of the method, we determine the $M_{Ks}$ and distance to the enigmatic LB-1 system,
where Liu et al. (2019) had argued for the presence of a black hole and incorrect parallax measurement,
and we do not find evidence for errorneous {\it Gaia} parallax.
