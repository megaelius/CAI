This article aims to highlight the impact for ground based astronomical observations in different
windows of the electromagnetic spectrum coming from the deployment of fleets of telecommunications
satellites. A particular attention is given to the problem of crowding of circumterrestrial space
by medium/small size orbiting objects. Depending on their altitude and surface reflectivity,
their contribution to the sky brightness is not negligible for professional ground based observations.
With the huge amount of about 50,000 new artificial satellites for telecommunications planned
to be launched in Medium and Low Earth Orbit, the mean density of artificial objects will be of >1 satellite
for square sky degree; this will inevitably harm professional astronomical images leaving trails
on them. Only one of these project, Starlink@SpaceX's, authorized by US Federal Communication
Commission, plans to deploy about 42,000 not geostationary satellites, which will shine in sky
after sunset and before sun dawn. Satellites will be observed in deep field images and particularly
negative for scientific large area images used to search for Near Earth Objects, predicting and,
eventually, avoiding possible impact events. Serious concerns are also common to other wavelengths
eligible for ground based investigation, in particular for radio-astronomy, whose detectors
are already saturated by the ubiquitous irradiation of satellites communication from Space stations
as well as from the ground. The risk of running into the "Kessler syndrome" is also noteworthy. Understanding
the risk for astronomical community, a set of actions are proposed in this paper to mitigate and contain
the most dangerous effects arising from such changes in the population of small satellites. A dedicate
strategy for urgent intervention to safeguard and protect each astronomical band observable from
the ground is outlined.
