On January 1st 2019, the New Horizons spacecraft flew by the classical Kuiper belt object (486958)
Arrokoth (provisionally designated 2014 MU69), possibly the most primitive object ever explored
by a spacecraft. The I/F of Arrokoth is analyzed and fit with a photometric function that is a linear
combination of the Lommel-Seeliger (lunar) and Lambert photometric functions. Arrokoth has a
geometric albedo of p_V = 0.21_(-0.04)^(+0.05) at a wavelength of 550 nm and ~0.24 at 610 nm. Arrokoth's
geometric albedo is greater than the median but consistent with a distribution of cold classical
Kuiper belt objects whose geometric albedos were determined by fitting a thermal model to radiometric
observations. Thus, Arrokoth's geometric albedo adds to the orbital and spectral evidence that
it is a cold classical Kuiper belt object. Maps of the normal reflectance and hemispherical albedo
of Arrokoth are presented. The normal reflectance of Arrokoth's surface varies with location,
ranging from ~0.10-0.40 at 610 nm with an approximately Gaussian distribution. Both Arrokoth's
extrema dark and extrema bright surfaces are correlated to topographic depressions. Arrokoth
has a bilobate shape and the two lobes have similar normal reflectance distributions: both are approximately
Gaussian, peak at ~0.25 at 610 nm, and range from ~0.10-0.40, which is consistent with co-formation
and co-evolution of the two lobes. The hemispherical albedo of Arrokoth varies substantially with
both incidence angle and location, the average hemispherical albedo at 610 nm is 0.063 +/- 0.015.
The Bond albedo of Arrokoth at 610 nm is 0.062 +/- 0.015.
