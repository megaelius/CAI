The Fresnel Diffractive Array Imager (FDAI) is based on a new optical concept for space telescopes,
developed at Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Plan\'etologie (IRAP), Toulouse, France.
For the visible and near-infrared it has already proven its performances in resolution and dynamic
range. We propose it now for astrophysical applications in the ultraviolet with apertures from
6 to 30 meters, aimed at imaging in UV faint astrophysical sources close to bright ones, as well as
other applications requiring high dynamic range. Of course the project needs first a probatory
mission at small aperture to validate the concept in space. In collaboration with institutes in
Spain and Russia, we will propose to board a small prototype of Fresnel imager on the International
Space Station (ISS), with a program combining technical tests and astrophysical targets. The spectral
domain should contain the Lyman-$\alpha$ line ($\lambda= 121$ nm). As part of its preparation,
we improve the Fresnel array design for a better Point Spread Function in UV, presently on a small
laboratory prototype working at 260 nm. Moreover, we plan to validate a new optical design and chromatic
correction adapted to UV. In this article we present the results of numerical propagations showing
the improvement in dynamic range obtained by combining and adapting three methods : central obturation,
optimization of the bars mesh holding the Fresnel rings, and orthogonal apodization. We briefly
present the proposed astrophysical program of a probatory mission with such UV optics. Keywords:
