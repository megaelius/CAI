We investigate quasar outflows at $z \geq 6$ by performing zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations. By employing the SPH code GADGET-3, we zoom in the $2 R_{200}$ region around a $2 \times
10^{12} M_{\odot}$ halo at $z = 6$, inside a $(500 ~ {\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving volume. We compare the
results of our AGN runs with a control simulation in which only stellar/SN feedback is considered.
Seeding $10^5 M_{\odot}$ BHs at the centers of $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ halos, we find the following results.
BHs accrete gas at the Eddington rate over $z = 9 - 6$. At $z = 6$, our most-massive BH has grown to $M_{\rm
BH} = 4 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. Fast ($v_{r} > 1000$ km/s), powerful ($\dot{M}_{\rm out} \sim 2000
M_{\odot}$/yr) outflows of shock-heated low-density gas form at $z \sim 7$, and propagate up to
hundreds kpc. Star-formation is quenched over $z = 8 - 6$, and the total SFR (SFR surface density near
the galaxy center) is reduced by a factor of $5$ ($1000$). We analyse the relative contribution of
multiple physical process: (i) disrupting cosmic filamentary cold gas inflows, (ii) reducing
central gas density, (iii) ejecting gas outside the galaxy; and find that AGN feedback has the following
effects at $z = 6$. The inflowing gas mass fraction is reduced by $\sim 12 \%$, the high-density gas
fraction is lowered by $\sim 13 \%$, and $\sim 20 \%$ of the gas outflows at a speed larger than the escape
velocity ($500$ km/s). We conclude that quasar-host galaxies at $z \geq 6$ are accreting non-negligible
amount of cosmic gas, nevertheless AGN feedback quenches their star formation dominantly by powerful
outflows ejecting gas out of the host galaxy halo.
