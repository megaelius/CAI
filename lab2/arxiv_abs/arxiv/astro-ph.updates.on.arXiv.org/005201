Equatorial density enhancements (EDEs) are a very common astronomical phenomenon. Studies of
the circumstellar environments (CSE) of young stellar objects and of evolved stars have shown that
these objects often possess these features. These are believed to originate from different mechanisms,
ranging from binary interactions to the gravitational collapse of interstellar material. Quantifying
the effect of the presence of this type of EDE on the observables is essential for a correct interpretation
of high-resolution data. We seek to investigate the manifestation in the observables of a circumstellar
EDE, to assess which properties can be constrained, and to provide an intuitive bedrock on which
to compare and interpret upcoming high-resolution data (e.g. \emph{ALMA} data) using 3D models.
We develop a simplified analytical parametrised description of a 3D EDE, with a possible substructure
such as warps, gaps, and spiral instabilities. In addition, different velocity fields (Keplerian,
radial, super-Keplerian, sub-Keplerian and rigid rotation) are considered. The effect of a bipolar
outflow is also investigated. The geometrical models are fed into the 3D radiative transfer code
{\tt LIME}, that produces 3D intensity maps throughout velocity space. We investigate the spectral
signature of the $J$=3$-$2 up to $J$=7$-$6 rotational transitions of CO in the models, as well as
the spatial aspect of this emission by means of channel maps, wide-slit position-velocity (PV)
diagrams, stereograms, and spectral lines. Additionally, we discuss methods of constraining
the geometry of the EDE, the inclination, the mass-contrast between the EDE and the bipolar outflow,
and the global velocity field. Finally, we simulated \emph{ALMA} observations...
