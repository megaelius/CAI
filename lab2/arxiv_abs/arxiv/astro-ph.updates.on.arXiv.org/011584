We analyze high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of a flux emerging region (FER)
in order to understand its magnetic and kinematic structure. Our spectropolarimetric observations
in the He I 1083.0 nm spectral region of a FER are recorded with GRIS at the 1.5 m aperture GREGOR telescope.
A Milne-Eddington based inversion code was employed to extract the photospheric information of
the Si I spectral line, whereas the He I triplet line was analyzed with the Hazel inversion code, which
takes into account the joint action of the Hanle and the Zeeman effect. The spectropolarimetric
analysis of Si I line displays a complex magnetic structure near the vicinity of FER. Moreover, we
find supersonic downflows of 40 km/sec appears near the footpoints of loops connecting two pores
of opposite polarity, whereas a strong upflows of 22 km/sec appears near the apex of the loops. Furthermore,
non-force-free field extrapolations were performed separately at two layers in order to understand
the magnetic field topology of the FER. We determine, using extrapolations from the photosphere
and the observed chromospheric magnetic field, that the average formation height of the He triplet
line is 2 Mm from the solar surface. The reconstructed loops using photospheric extrapolations
along an arch filament system have a maximum height of 10.5 Mm from the solar surface with a foot-points
separation of 19 Mm, whereas the loops reconstructed using chromospheric extrapolations are around
8.4 Mm high from the solar surface with a foot-point separation of 16 Mm at the chromospheric height.
The magnetic topology in the FER suggests the presence of small-scale loops beneath the large loops.
Under suitable conditions, due to magnetic reconnection, these loops can trigger various heating
events in the vicinity of the FER.
