Guillemot et al. recently reported the discovery of $\gamma$-ray pulsations from the 22.7ms pulsar
(pulsar A) in the famous double pulsar system J0737-3039A/B. The $\gamma$-ray light curve (LC)
of pulsar A has two peaks separated by approximately half a rotation, and these are non-coincident
with the observed radio and X-ray peaks. This suggests that the $\gamma$-ray emission originates
in a part of the magnetosphere distinct from where the radio and X-ray radiation is generated. Thus
far, three different methods have been applied to constrain the viewing geometry of pulsar A (its
inclination and observer angles $\alpha$ and $\zeta$): geometric modelling of the radio and $\gamma$-ray
light curves, modelling of the position angle sweep in phase seen in the radio polarisation data,
and independent studies of the time evolution of the radio pulse profile of pulsar A. These three
independent, complementary methods have yielded consistent results: pulsar A's rotation axis
is likely perpendicular to the orbital plane of the binary system, and its magnetic axis close to
lying in the orbital plane (making this pulsar an orthogonal rotator). The observer is furthermore
observing emission close to the magnetic axis. Thus far, however, current models could not reproduce
all the characteristics of the radio and $\gamma$-ray light curves, specifically the large radio-to-$\gamma$
phase lag. In this paper we discuss some preliminary modelling attempts to address this problem,
and offer ideas on how the LC fits may be improved by adapting the standard geometric models in order
to reproduce the profile positions more accurately.
