Generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) elliptic polarization due to the Cotton-Mouton
(CM) effect in a cosmic magnetic field is studied. We concentrate on the generation of CMB circular
polarization and on the rotation angle of the CMB polarization plane from the decoupling time until
at present. For the first time, a rather detailed analysis of the CM effect for an arbitrary direction
of the cosmic magnetic field with respect to photon direction of propagation and arbitrary magnetic
field profile is done. Considering the CMB linearly polarized at the decoupling time, it is shown
that the CM effect is one of the most substantial effects in generating circular polarization especially
in the low part of the CMB spectrum. It is shown that in the frequency range $10^8$ Hz $\leq \nu_0\leq
10^9$ Hz, the degree of circular polarization of the CMB at present for perpendicular propagation
with respect to the cosmic magnetic field is in the range $1.19\times 10^{-10}\lesssim P_C(t_0)\lesssim
7.65\times 10^{-7}$ or Stokes circular polarization parameter $3.25 \times 10^{-10}$ K $\lesssim
V(t_0)\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-6}$ K for realistic values of the cosmic magnetic field amplitude.
On the other hand, for not perpendicular propagation with respect to the cosmic magnetic field we
find $10^{-14}\lesssim P_C(t_0)\lesssim 4\times 10^{-12}$ or $2.72 \times 10^{-14}$ K $\lesssim
V(t_0)\lesssim 10^{-11}$ K. Estimates on the rotation angle of the CMB polarization plane $\delta\psi_0$
due to the CM effect and constraints on the cosmic magnetic field amplitude from current constraints
on $\delta\psi_0$ due to a combination of the CM and Faraday effects are found.
