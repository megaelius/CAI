Ellerman bombs (EBs) have been widely studied in recent years due to their dynamic, explosive nature
and apparent links to the underlying photospheric magnetic field implying that they may be formed
by magnetic reconnection in the photosphere. Despite a plethora of researches discussing the morphologies
of EBs, there has been a limited investigation of how these events appear at the limb, specifically,
whether they manifest as vertical extensions away from the disc. In this article, we make use of high-resolution,
high-cadence observations of an AR at the solar limb, collected by the CRISP instrument, to identify
EBs and infer their physical properties. The upper atmosphere is also probed using the SDO/AIA.
We analyse 22 EB events evident within these data, finding that 20 appear to follow a parabolic path
away from the solar surface at an average speed of 9 km s^(-1), extending away from their source by
580 km, before retreating back at a similar speed. These results show strong evidence of vertical
motions associated with EBs, possibly explaining the dynamical `flaring' (changing in area and
intensity) observed in on-disc events. Two in-depth case studies are also presented which highlight
the unique dynamical nature of EBs within the lower solar atmosphere. The viewing angle of these
observations allows for a direct linkage between these EBs and other small-scale events in the H-alpha
line wings, including a potential flux emergence scenario. The findings presented here suggest
that EBs could have a wider-reaching influence on the solar atmosphere than previously thought,
as we reveal a direct linkage between EBs and an emerging small-scale loop, and other near-by small-scale
explosive events. However, as previous research found, these extensions do not appear to impact
upon the H-alpha line core, and are not observed by the SDO/AIA EUV filters.
