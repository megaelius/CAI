We present a grid of forward model transmission spectra, adopting an isothermal temperature-pressure
profile, alongside corresponding equilibrium chemical abundances for 117 observationally significant
hot exoplanets (Equilibrium Temperatures of 547-2710 K). This model grid has been developed using
a 1D radiative-convective-chemical equilibrium model termed ATMO, with up-to-date high temperature
opacities. We present an interpretation of observations of ten exoplanets, including best fit
parameters and $\chi^{2}$ maps. In agreement with previous works, we find a continuum from clear
to hazy/cloudy atmospheres for this sample of hot Jupiters. The data for all the 10 planets are consistent
with sub-solar to solar C/O ratio, 0.005 to 10 times solar metallicity and water rather than a methane
dominated infrared spectra. We then explore the range of simulated atmospheric spectra for different
exoplanets, based on characteristics such as temperature, metallicity, C/O-ratio, haziness
and cloudiness. We find a transition value for the metallicity between 10 and 50 times solar, which
leads to substantial changes in the transmission spectra. We also find a transition value of C/O
ratio, from water to carbon species dominated infrared spectra, as found by previous works, revealing
a temperature dependence of this transition point ranging from $\sim$0.56 to $\sim$1-1.3 for equilibrium
temperatures from $\sim$900 to $\sim$2600 K. We highlight the potential of the spectral features
of HCN and C$_2$H$_2$ to constrain the metallicities and C/O ratios of planets, using JWST observations.
Finally, our entire grid ($\sim$460,000 simulations) is publicly available and can be used directly
with the JWST simulator PandExo for planning observations.
