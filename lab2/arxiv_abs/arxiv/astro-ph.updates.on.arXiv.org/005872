We measure the gravitational lensing signal around satellite galaxies in a sample of galaxy clusters
at $z<0.15$ by combining high-quality imaging data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope with
a large sample of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members. We use extensive image simulations
to assess the accuracy of shape measurements of faint, background sources in the vicinity of bright
satellite galaxies. We find a small but significant bias, as light from the lenses makes the shapes
of background galaxies appear radially aligned with the lens. We account for this bias by applying
a correction that depends on both lens size and magnitude. We also correct for contamination of the
source sample by cluster members. We use a physically-motivated definition of subhalo mass, namely
the mass bound to the subhalo, $m_\mathrm{bg}$, similar to definitions used by common subhalo finders
in numerical simulations. Binning the satellites by stellar mass we provide a direct measurement
of the subhalo-to-stellar-mass relation, $\log m_\mathrm{bg}/\mathrm{M}_\odot = (11.54\pm0.05)
+ (0.95\pm0.10)\log[m_\star/(2\times10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot)]$. This best-fitting relation
implies that, at a stellar mass $m_\star\sim3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, subhalo masses
are roughly 50 per cent of those of central galaxies, and this fraction decreases at higher stellar
masses. We find some evidence for a sharp change in the total-to-stellar mass ratio around the clusters'
scale radius, which could be interpreted as galaxies within the scale radius having suffered more
strongly from tidal stripping, but remain cautious regarding this interpretation.
