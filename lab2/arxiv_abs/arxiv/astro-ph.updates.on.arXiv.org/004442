The radiation force on dust grains may be dynamically important in driving turbulence and outflows
in rapidly star-forming galaxies. Recent studies focus on the highly optically-thick limit relevant
to the densest ultra-luminous galaxies and super star clusters, where reprocessed infrared photons
provide the dominant source of electromagnetic momentum. However, even among starburst galaxies,
the great majority instead lie in the so-called "single-scattering" limit, where the system is
optically-thick to the incident starlight, but optically-thin to the re-radiated infrared. In
this paper we present a stability analysis and multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations
exploring the stability and dynamics of isothermal dusty gas columns in this regime. We describe
our algorithm for full angle-dependent radiation transport based on the discontinuous Galerkin
finite element method. For a range of near-Eddington fluxes, we show that the medium is unstable,
producing convective-like motions in a turbulent atmosphere with a scale height significantly
inflated compared to the gas pressure scale height and mass-weighted turbulent energy densities
of $\sim 0.01-0.1$ of the midplane radiation energy density, corresponding to mass-weighted velocity
dispersions of Mach number $\sim 0.5-2$. Extrapolation of our results to optical depths of $10^3$
implies maximum turbulent Mach numbers of $\sim20$. Comparing our results to galaxy-averaged
observations, and subject to the approximations of our calculations, we find that radiation pressure
does not contribute significantly to the effective supersonic pressure support in star-forming
disks, which in general are substantially sub-Eddington. We further examine the time-averaged
vertical density profiles in dynamical equilibrium and comment on implications for radiation-pressure-driven
galactic winds.
