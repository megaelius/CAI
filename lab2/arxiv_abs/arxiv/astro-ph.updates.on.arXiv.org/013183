Wide hot subdwarf B (sdB) binaries with main-sequence companions are outcomes of stable mass transfer
from evolved red giants. The orbits of these binaries show a strong correlation between their orbital
periods and mass ratios. The origins of this correlation have, so far, been lacking a conclusive
explanation. We aim to find a binary evolution model which can explain the observed correlation.
Radii of evolved red giants, and hence the resulting orbital periods, strongly depend on their metallicity.
We have performed a small but statistically significant binary population synthesis study with
the binary stellar evolution code MESA. We have used a standard model for binary mass loss and a standard
metallicity history of the Galaxy. The resulting sdB systems were selected based on the same criteria
as used in observations and then compared with the observed population. We have achieved an excellent
match to the observed period - mass ratio correlation without using any free parameters. Furthermore,
our models produce a very good match to the observed period - metallicity correlation. We predict
several new correlations which link the observed sdB binaries to their progenitors, and a correlation
between the orbital period, metallicity and core mass for subdwarfs and young low-mass white dwarfs.
We also predict a new population of sdB binaries in the galactic bulge. We demonstrate, for the first
time, how the metallicity history of the Milky Way is imprinted in the properties of the observed
post-mass transfer binaries. We show that Galactic chemical evolution is an important factor in
binary population studies of any systems containing at least one evolved low-mass ($M_{\rm init}
< 1.6\,M_{\odot}$) component. Finally, we provide an observationally supported model of mass
transfer from low-mass red giants onto main-sequence stars.
