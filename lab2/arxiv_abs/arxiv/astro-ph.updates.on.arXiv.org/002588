(abridged) Context: Solar-like differential rotation is characterized by a rapidly rotating
equator and slower poles. However, theoretical models and numerical simulations can result in
a slower equator and faster poles when the rotation is slow. Aims: We study the critical rotational
influence under which differential rotation flips from solar-like (fast equator, slow poles)
to an anti-solar one (slow equator, fast poles). We estimate the non-diffusive ($\Lambda$ effect)
and diffusive (turbulent viscosity) contributions to the Reynolds stress. Methods: We present
the results of three-dimensional numerical simulations of mildly turbulent convection in spherical
wedge geometry. Here we apply a fully compressible setup which would suffer from a prohibitive time
step constraint if the real solar luminosity was used. We regulate the convective velocities by
varying the amount of heat transported by thermal conduction, turbulent diffusion, and resolved
convection. Results: Increasing the efficiency of resolved convection leads to a reduction of
the rotational influence on the flow and a sharp transition from solar-like to anti-solar differential
rotation for Coriolis numbers around 1.3. We confirm the recent finding of a large-scale flow bistability:
contrasted with running the models from an initial condition with unprescribed differential rotation,
the initialization of the model with certain kind of rotation profile sustains the solution over
a wider parameter range. Conclusions: Our results may have implications for real stars that start
their lives as rapid rotators implying solar-like rotation in the early main-sequence evolution.
As they slow down, they might be able to retain solar-like rotation for lower Coriolis numbers before
switching to anti-solar rotation. This could partially explain the puzzling findings of anti-solar
rotation profiles for models in the solar parameter regime.
