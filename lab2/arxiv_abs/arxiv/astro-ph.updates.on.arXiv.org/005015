We investigate the connection between environment and the different quenching channels that galaxies
are prone to follow in the rest-frame NUVrK (i.e., NUV-r vs. r-K) colour diagram, as identified by
Moutard et al. (2016b). Namely, the (fast) quenching channel followed by ($young$) low-mass galaxies
and the (slow) quenching channel followed by ($old$) high-mass ones. We make use of the >22 deg$^2$
covered the VIPERS Multi-Lambda Survey (VIPERS-MLS) to select a galaxy sample complete down to
stellar masses of $M_* > 10^{9.4} M_\odot$ at $z < 0.65$ ($M_* > 10^{8.8} M_\odot$ at $z < 0.5$) and
including 33,500 (43,000) quiescent galaxies properly selected at $0.2 < z < 0.65$, while being
characterized by reliable photometric redshifts ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)} \leq 0.04$) that
we use to measure galaxy local densities. We find that (1) the quiescence of low-mass [$M_* \leq 10^{9.7}
M_\odot$] galaxies requires a strong increase of the local density, which confirms the lead role
played by environment in their fast quenching and, therefore, confirms that the low-mass upturn
observed in the stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies is due to $environmental$ $quenching$.
We also observe that (2) the reservoir of low-mass galaxies prone to environmental quenching has
grown between $z \sim 0.6$ and $ z \sim 0.4$ whilst the share of low-mass galaxies in the quiescent
population may have simultaneously increased, which may be consistent with a rising importance
of $environmental$ $quenching$ with cosmic time, compared to $mass$ $quenching$. We finally discuss
the composite picture of such environmental quenching of low-mass galaxies and, in particular,
how this picture may be consistent with a $delayed$-$then$-$rapid$ quenching scenario.
