The discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube kicked off a new line of research
to identify the electromagnetic counterparts producing these neutrinos. Among the extragalactic
sources, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and in particular Blazars, are promising candidate neutrino
emitters. Their structure, with a relativistic jet pointing to the Earth, offers a natural accelerator
of particles and for this reason a perfect birthplace of high energy neutrinos. A good characterisation
of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these sources can improve the understanding of the
physical composition of the source and the emission processes involved. Starting from our previous
works in which we assumed a correlation between the $\gamma$-ray and the neutrino flux of the BL Lacs
of the 2FHL catalogue (detected by Fermi above 50GeV), we select those BL Lac in spatial correlation
with the IceCube events. We obtain a sample of 7 sources and we start an observational campaign to
have a better characterisation of the synchrotron peak. During the analysis of the data a new source
has been added because of its position inside the angular uncertainty of a muon track event detected
by IceCube. This source, namely TXS0506+056, was in a high-state during the neutrino event and we
will consider it as benchmark to check the proprieties of the other sources of the sample during the
related neutrino detection. We obtain a better characterisation of the SED for the sources of our
sample. A prospective extreme Blazar, a very peculiar low synchrotron peak (LSP) source with a large
separation of the two peaks and a \textit{twin} of TXS0506+056 come up. We also provide the $\gamma$-ray
light curve to check the trend of the sources around the neutrino detection but no clears patterns
are in common among the sources.
