Time-delay cosmography of lensed quasars has achieved 2.4% precision on the measurement of the
Hubble Constant, $H_0$. As part of an ongoing effort to uncover and control systematic uncertainties,
we investigate three potential sources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight effects, 3- deflector
mass model. To meet this goal in a quantitative way, we mimic closely the H0LiCOW/SHARP/STRIDES
procedures (i.e., TDCOSMO), and we find the following. First, stellar kinematics cannot be a dominant
source of error or bias given current uncertainties. Second, we find no bias arising from incorrect
estimation of the line-of-sight effects. Third, we show that elliptical composite (stars + dark
matter halo), power-law, and cored power-law mass profiles have the flexibility to yield a broad
range in $H_0$ values. However, the TDCOSMO procedures to model the data with both composite and
power-law mass profiles are informative. If the models agree, as we observe in real systems owing
to the "bulge-halo" conspiracy, $H_0$ is recovered precisely by both models. If the two models disagreed,
as in the case of some pathological models illustrated here, the TDCOSMO procedure would either
be able to discriminate between them through the goodness of fit, or account for the discrepancy
in the final error bars provided by the analysis. This conclusion is consistent with a reanalysis
of the TDCOSMO (real) lenses: the composite model yields $H_0=74.2^{+1.6}_{-1.6}$ ${\, \mathrm{km}\,
\mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, while the power-law model yields $74.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$
${\, \mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. In conclusion, we find no evidence
of bias or errors larger than the current statistical uncertainties reported by TDCOSMO.
