Radiative shocks are shocks in a gas where the radiative energy and flux coming from the very hot post-shock
material are non-negligible in the shock's total energy budget, and are often large enough to heat
the material ahead of the shock. Many simulations of radiative shocks, both in the contexts of astrophysics
and laboratory experiments, use a grey treatment of radiative transfer coupled to the hydrodynamics.
However, the opacities of the gas show large variations as a function of frequency and this needs
to be taken into account if one wishes to reproduce the relevant physics. We have performed radiation
hydrodynamics simulations of radiative shocks in Ar using multigroup (frequency dependent) radiative
transfer with the HERACLES code. The opacities were taken from the ODALISC database. We show the
influence of the number of frequency groups used on the dynamics and morphologies of subcritical
and supercritical radiative shocks in Ar gas, and in particular on the extent of the radiative precursor.
We find that simulations with even a low number of groups show significant differences compared
to single-group (grey) simulations, and that in order to correctly model such shocks, a minimum
number of groups is required. Results appear to eventually converge as the number of groups increases
above 50. We were also able to resolve in our simulations of supercritical shocks the adaptation
zones which connect the cooling layer to the final post-shock state and the precursor. Inside these
adaptation zones, we find that the radiative flux just ahead of the shock in one or several high-opacity
groups can heat the gas to a temperature higher than the post-shock temperature. Through the use
of Hugoniot curves, we have checked the consistency of our radiation hydrodynamics scheme by showing
that conservation of mass, momentum and energy (including radiative flux) holds. ABRIDGED.
