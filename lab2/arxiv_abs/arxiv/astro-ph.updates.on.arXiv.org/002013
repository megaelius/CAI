The narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line is one of the main signatures of the reprocessing of X-ray radiation
from the material surrounding supermassive black holes, and it has been found to be omnipresent
in the X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work we study the characteristics of
the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in different types of AGN. Using the results of a large Suzaku study we
find that Seyfert 2s have on average lower Fe K$\alpha$ luminosities than Seyfert 1s for the same
10-50 keV continuum luminosity. Simulating dummy Sy1s and Sy2s populations using physical torus
models of X-ray reflected emission, we find that this difference can be explained by means of different
average inclination angles with respect to the torus, as predicted by the unified model. Alternative
explanations include differences in the intensities of Compton humps or in the photon index distributions.
We show that the ratio between the flux of the broad and narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in the 6.35-6.45 keV
range depends on the torus geometry considered, and is on average $<25\%$ and $<15\%$ for
type I and type II AGN, respectively. We find evidence of absorption of the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line
flux in Compton-thick AGN, which suggests that part of the reflecting material is obscured. We estimate
that on average in obscured AGN the reflected radiation from neutral material is seen through a column
density which is 1/4 of that absorbing the primary X-ray emission. This should be taken into account
in synthesis models of the CXB and when studying the luminosity function of heavily obscured AGN.
We detect the first evidence of the X-ray Baldwin effect in Seyfert 2s, with the same slope as that
found for Seyfert 1s, which suggests that the mechanism responsible for the decrease of the equivalent
width with the continuum luminosity is the same in the two classes of objects.
