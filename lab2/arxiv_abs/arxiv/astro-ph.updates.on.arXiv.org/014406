The SEDs of some nearby stars show mid-infrared excesses from warm habitable zone dust, known as
exozodiacal dust. This dust may originate in collisions in a planetesimal belt before being dragged
inwards. This paper presents an analytical model for the size distribution of particles at different
radial locations in such a scenario, considering evolution due to destructive collisions and Poynting-Robertson
(P-R) drag. Results from more accurate but computationally expensive numerical simulations of
this process are used to validate the model and fit its free parameters. The model predicts 11 $\mu$m
excesses ($R_{11}$) for discs with a range of dust masses and planetesimal belt radii using realistic
grain properties. We show that P-R drag should produce exozodiacal dust levels detectable with
the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) ($R_{11} > 0.1\%$) in systems with known outer
belts; non-detection may indicate dust depletion, e.g. by an intervening planet. We also find that
LBTI could detect exozodiacal dust dragged in from a belt too faint to detect at far-infrared wavelengths,
with fractional luminosity $f\sim 10^{-7}$ and radius $\sim 10-80$ au. Application to systems
observed with LBTI shows that P-R drag can likely explain most (5/9) of the exozodiacal dust detections
in systems with known outer belts; two systems ($\beta$ Uma and $\eta$ Corvi) with bright exozodi
may be due to exocomets. We suggest that the three systems with exozodiacal dust detections but no
known belt may have cold planetesimal belts too faint to be detectable in the far-infrared. Even
systems without outer belt detections could have exozodiacal dust levels $R_{11} > 0.04\%$ which
are problematic for exo-Earth imaging.
