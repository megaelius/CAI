The astrophysical $^{3}{\rm He}(\alpha, \gamma)^{7}{\rm Be}$ and $^{3}{\rm H}(\alpha, \gamma)^{7}{\rm
Li}$ direct capture processes are studied in the framework of the two-body model with the potentials
of a simple Gaussian form, which describe correctly the phase-shifts in the s-, p-, d-, and f-waves,
as well as the binding energy and the asymptotic normalization constant (ANC) of the ground $p_{3/2}$
and the first excited $p_{1/2}$ bound states. It is shown that the E1-transition from the initial
s-wave to the final p-waves is strongly dominant in the both capture reactions. On this basis the
s-wave potential parameters are adjusted to reproduce the new data of the LUNA collaboration around
100 keV and the newest data at the Gamov peak estimated with the help of the observed neutrino fluxes
from the Sun, $S_{34}$(23$^{+6}_{-5}$ keV)=0.548$\pm$0.054 keV b for the astrophysical S-factor
of the capture process $^{3}{\rm He}(\alpha, \gamma)^{7}{\rm Be}$. The resulting model describes
well the astrophysical S-factor in low-energy BBN region of 180-400 keV. The energy dependence
of the S-factor is mostly consistent with the data and the results of the NCSMC model, but substantially
different from the FMD model predictions. Two-body potentials, adjusted to the properties of the
$^7$Be nucleus, are able to reproduce the properties of the $^7$Li nucleus, phase shifts in the partial
waves and the binding energies of the ground 3/2$^-$ and first excited 1/2$^-$ states. Most importantly,
these potential models can successfully describe both absolute value and energy dependence of
the existing experimental data for the mirror astrophysical $^{3}{\rm H}(\alpha, \gamma)^{7}{\rm
Li}$ capture reaction without any additional adjustment of the parameters.
