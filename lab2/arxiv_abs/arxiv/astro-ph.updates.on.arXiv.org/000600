Global VLBI observations at 5 GHz have been performed to study the source morphology in 10 compact
steep-spectrum (CSS) sources selected from the Peacock & Wall catalogue with the aim of finding
asymmetric structures produced by the interaction with the ambient medium. The combination of
these data and earlier 1.7-GHz observations allows the study of the spectral index distribution
across the source structure and the unambiguous determination of the nature of each component.
In seven sources we detected the core component with a flat or inverted spectrum. In six sources the
radio emission has a two-sided morphology and comes mainly from steep-spectrum extended structures,
like lobes, jets, and hotspots. Only one source, 0319+121, has a one-sided core-jet structure.
In three out of the six sources with a two-sided structure the flux density arising from the lobes
is asymmetric, and the brightest lobe is the one closest to the core, suggesting that the jets are
expanding in an inhomogeneous ambient medium which may influence the source growth. The interaction
between the jet and the environment may slow down the source expansion and enhance the luminosity
due to severe radiative losses, likely producing an excess of CSS radio sources in flux density limited
samples. The lobes of the other three asymmetric sources have a brighter-when-farther behaviour,
in agreement with what is expected by projection and relativistic effects. Simultaneous VLA observations
carried out to investigate the polarization properties of the targets detected significant polarized
emission (~5.5%) only from the quasar 0319+121.
