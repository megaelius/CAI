The statistics of peaks in weak lensing convergence maps is a promising tool to investigate both
the properties of dark matter haloes and constrain the cosmological parameters. We study how the
number of detectable peaks and its scaling with redshift depend upon the cluster dark matter halo
profiles and use peak statistics to constrain the parameters of the mass - concentration (MC) relation.
We investigate which constraints the Euclid mission can set on the MC coefficients also taking into
account degeneracies with the cosmological parameters. To this end, we first estimate the number
of peaks and its redshift distribution for different MC relations. We find that the steeper the mass
dependence and the larger the normalisation, the higher is the number of detectable clusters, with
the total number of peaks changing up to $40\%$ depending on the MC relation. We then perform a Fisher
matrix forecast of the errors on the MC relation parameters as well as cosmological parameters.
We find that peak number counts detected by Euclid can determine the normalization $A_v$, the mass
$B_v$ and redshift $C_v$ slopes and intrinsic scatter $\sigma_v$ of the MC relation to an unprecedented
accuracy being $\sigma(A_v)/A_v = 1\%$, $\sigma(B_v)/B_v = 4\%$, $\sigma(C_v)/C_v = 9\%$, $\sigma(\sigma_v)/\sigma_v
= 1\%$ if all cosmological parameters are assumed to be known. Should we relax this severe assumption,
constraints are degraded, but remarkably good results can be restored setting only some of the parameters
or combining peak counts with Planck data. This precision can give insight on competing scenarios
of structure formation and evolution and on the role of baryons in cluster assembling. Alternatively,
for a fixed MC relation, future peaks counts can perform as well as current BAO and SNeIa when combined
with Planck.
