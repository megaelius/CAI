One of the main unsolved problems of cosmology is how to maximize the extraction of information from
nonlinear data. If the data are nonlinear the usual approach is to employ a sequence of statistics
(N-point statistics, counting statistics of clusters, density peaks or voids etc.), along with
the corresponding covariance matrices. However, this approach is computationally prohibitive
and has not been shown to be exhaustive in terms of information content. Here we instead develop a
Bayesian approach, expanding the likelihood around the maximum posterior of linear modes, which
we solve for using optimization methods. By integrating out the modes using perturbative expansion
of the likelihood we construct an initial power spectrum estimator, which for a fixed forward model
contains all the cosmological information if the initial modes are gaussian distributed. We develop
a method to construct the window and covariance matrix such that the estimator is explicitly unbiased
and nearly optimal. We then generalize the method to include the forward model parameters, including
cosmological and nuisance parameters, and primordial non-gaussianity. We apply the method in
the simplified context of nonlinear structure formation, using either simplified 2-LPT dynamics
or N-body simulations as the nonlinear mapping between linear and nonlinear density, and 2-LPT
dynamics in the optimization steps used to reconstruct the initial density modes. We demonstrate
that the method gives an unbiased estimator of the initial power spectrum, providing among other
a near optimal reconstruction of linear baryonic acoustic oscillations.
