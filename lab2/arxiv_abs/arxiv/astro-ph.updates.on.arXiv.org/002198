To investigate parsec-scale jet flow conditions during GeV gamma-ray flares detected by the Fermi
Large Angle Telescope, we obtained centimeter-band total flux density and linear polarization
monitoring observations from 2009.5 through 2012.5 with the 26-meter Michigan radio telescope
for a sample of core-dominated blazars. We use these data to constrain radiative transfer simulations
incorporating propagating shocks oriented at an arbitrary angle to the flow direction in order
to set limits on the jet flow and shock parameters during flares temporally associated with gamma-ray
flares in 0420-014, OJ 287, and 1156+295; these AGN exhibited the expected signature of shocks in
the linear polarization data. Both the number of shocks comprising an individual radio outburst
(3-4) and the range of the compression ratios of the individual shocks (0.5-0.8) are similar in all
three sources; the shocks are found to be forward-moving with respect to the flow. While simulations
incorporating transverse shocks provide good fits for 0420-014 and 1156+295, oblique shocks are
required for modeling the OJ~287 outburst, and an unusually-low value of the low energy cutoff of
the radiating particles' energy distribution is also identified. Our derived viewing angles and
shock speeds are consistent with independent VLBA results. While a random component dominates
the jet magnetic field, as evidenced by the low fractional linear polarization, to reproduce the
observed spectral character requires that a significant fraction of the magnetic field energy
is in an ordered axial component. Both straight and low pitch angle helical field lines are viable
scenarios.
