In Astronomy, the brightness of a source is typically expressed in terms of magnitude. Conventionally,
the magnitude is defined by the logarithm of the received flux. This relationship is known as the
Pogson formula. For received flux with a small signal to noise ratio (S/N), however, the formula
gives a large magnitude error. We investigate whether the use of Inverse Hyperbolic Sine function
(after this referred to as the Asinh magnitude) in the modified formulae could allow for an alternative
calculation of magnitudes for small S/N flux, and whether the new approach is better for representing
the brightness of that region. We study the possibility of increasing the detection level of gravitational
microlensing using 40 selected microlensing light curves from 2013 and 2014 season and by using
the Asinh magnitude. The photometric data of the selected events is obtained from the Observational
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We found that the utilization of the Asinh magnitude
makes the events brighter compared to using the logarithmic magnitude, with an average of about
$3.42 \times10^{-2}$ magnitude and the average of the difference of error between the logarithmic
and the Asinh magnitude is about $2.21 \times10^{-2}$ magnitude. The microlensing events, OB 140847
and OB 140885 are found to have the largest difference values among the selected events. Using a Gaussian
fit to find the peak for OB140847 and OB140885, we conclude statistically that the Asinh magnitude
gives better mean squared values of the regression and narrower residual histograms than the Pogson
magnitude. Based on these results, we also attempt to propose a limit of magnitude value from which
the use of the Asinh magnitude is optimal for small S/N data.
