We present a joint cosmological analysis of weak gravitational lensing observations from the Kilo-Degree
Survey (KiDS-1000), with redshift-space galaxy clustering observations from the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and galaxy-galaxy lensing observations from the overlap between
KiDS-1000, BOSS and the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS). This combination
of large-scale structure probes breaks the degeneracies between cosmological parameters for
individual observables, resulting in a constraint on the structure growth parameter $S_8=\sigma_8
\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.766^{+0.020}_{-0.014}$, that has the same overall precision as
that reported by the full-sky cosmic microwave background observations from Planck. The recovered
$S_8$ amplitude is low, however, by $8.3 \pm 2.6$ % relative to Planck. This result builds from a series
of KiDS-1000 analyses where we validate our methodology with variable depth mock galaxy surveys,
our lensing calibration with image simulations and null-tests, and our optical-to-near-infrared
redshift calibration with multi-band mock catalogues and a spectroscopic-photometric clustering
analysis. The systematic uncertainties identified by these analyses are folded through as nuisance
parameters in our cosmological analysis. Inspecting the offset between the marginalised posterior
distributions, we find that the $S_8$-difference with Planck is driven by a tension in the matter
fluctuation amplitude parameter, $\sigma_8$. We quantify the level of agreement between the CMB
and our large-scale structure constraints using a series of different metrics, finding differences
with a significance ranging between $\sim\! 3\,\sigma$, when considering the offset in $S_{8}$,
and $\sim\! 2\,\sigma$, when considering the full multi-dimensional parameter space.
