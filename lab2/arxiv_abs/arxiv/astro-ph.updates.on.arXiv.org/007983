We study the impact of merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the central regions of massive
early-type galaxies (ETGs) using a series of merger simulations with varying mass ratios. The ETG
models include realistic stellar and dark matter components and are evolved with the GADGET based
regularized tree code KETJU. We show that observed key properties of the nuclear stellar populations
of massive ETGs, namely flat stellar density distributions (cores), tangentially biased velocity
distributions and kinematically decoupled (counter-)rotation can naturally result from a single
process $-$ the scouring by SMBHs. Major mergers with mass ratios of $q>1/3$ produce flat, tangentially
biased cores with kinematically distinct components. These features originate from spin reversals
during the decay of the SMBH orbits caused by gravitational torques from tidally expelled nuclear
material. Minor mergers ($q\lesssim1/3$) on the other hand, form non-rotating cores and the tidal
reversal becomes less important. Low-density stellar cores scoured in (multiple) minor mergers
are less tangentially biased. This implies that the nuclear stellar properties of massive ETGs
can be solely explained by stellar dynamical processes during their final assembly without any
need for `feedback' from accreting black holes. We predict a strong correlation between decoupled
cores, central anisotropy and merger history: decoupled cores form in binary mergers and we predict
them to occur in elliptical galaxies with the strongest central anisotropy. Measurements of the
central orbital structure are the key to understanding the number of mergers a given galaxy has experienced.
