White dwarfs that have accreted rocky planetary bodies provide unique insights regarding the bulk
composition of exoplanetary material. The analysis presented here uses observed white dwarf atmospheric
abundances to constrain both where in the planetary system the pollutant bodies originated, and
the geological and collisional history of the pollutant bodies. At least one, but possibly up to
nine, of the 17 systems analysed have accreted a body dominated by either core-like or mantle-like
material. The approximately even spread in the core mass fraction of the pollutants and the lack
of crust-rich pollutants in the 17 systems studied here suggest that the pollutants are often the
fragments produced by the collision of larger differentiated bodies. The compositions of many
pollutants exhibit trends related to elemental volatility, which we link to the temperatures and,
thus, the locations at which these bodies formed. Our analysis found that the abundances observed
in 11 of the 17 systems considered are consistent with the compositions of nearby stars in combination
with a trend related to elemental volatility. The even spread and large range in the predicted formation
location of the pollutants suggests that pollutants arrive in white dwarf atmospheres with a roughly
equal efficiency from a wide range of radial locations. Ratios of elements with different condensation
temperatures such as Ca/Mg, Na/Mg, and O/Mg distinguish between different formation temperatures,
whilst pairs of ratios of siderophilic and lithophilic elements such as Fe/Mg, Ni/Mg and Al/Mg,
Ca/Mg distinguish between temperature dependent trends and geological trends.
