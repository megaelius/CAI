This study is part of the FOssil Groups Origin (FOGO) project which aims at carrying out a systematic
and multiwavelength study of a large sample of fossil systems. Here we focus on the relation between
the optical luminosity (Lopt) and X-ray luminosity (Lx). Out of a sample of 28 candidate fossil systems,
we consider a sample of 12 systems whose fossil classification has been confirmed by a companion
study. They are compared with the complementary sample of 16 systems whose fossil nature is not confirmed
and with a subsample of 102 galaxy systems from the RASS-SDSS galaxy cluster survey. Fossil and normal
systems span the same redshift range 0<z<0.5 and have the same Lx distribution. For each fossil
system, the Lx in the 0.1-2.4 keV band is computed using data from the ROSAT All Sky Survey. For each
fossil and normal system we homogeneously compute Lopt in the r-band within the characteristic
cluster radius, using data from the SDSS DR7. We sample the Lx-Lopt relation over two orders of magnitude
in Lx. Our analysis shows that fossil systems are not statistically distinguishable from the normal
systems both through the 2D KS test and the fit of the Lx-Lopt relation. The optical luminosity of
the galaxy system does strongly correlate with the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas component, independently
of whether the system is fossil or not. We conclude that our results are consistent with the classical
"merging scenario" of the brightest galaxy formed via merger/cannibalism of other group galaxies,
with conservation of the optical light. We find no evidence for a peculiar state of the hot intracluster
medium.
