The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will measure exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectroscopy
at un-precedented precisions to better understand planet structure, dynamics, chemistry and
formation. These are essential tools on the march towards biosignature searches on potentially
habitable planets. We explore a range of exoplanet atmospheric conditions and forecast the expected
results with JWST. We take realistic CHIMERA models that match existing Spitzer and HST results
and simulate the spectra achievable with the JWST MIRI + NIRCam Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
survey. We then retrieve atmospheric parameters from these spectra to estimate the precision to
which the planets' atmospheric compositions can be measured. We find that emission spectra have
well-constrained unimodal solutions but transmission spectra near 10X solar abundance and solar
C/O ratios can suffer from bimodal solutions. Broad wavelength coverage as well as higher precision
data can resolve bimodal solutions and provide dramatically better atmospheric parameter constraints.
We find that metallicities can be measured to within 20% to 170%, which approaches the precisions
on Solar System planets, and C/O ratios can be constrained to ~10% to 60%, assuming that observers
can leverage short wavelength data to select the correct solution from the bimodal posteriors.
These compositional precisions are sufficient to validate or refute predictions from disk formation
models on final atmospheric abundances as long as their history is not erased by planet evolution
processes. We also show the extent to which eclipse mapping with JWST is possible on our brightest
system HD 189733 b.
