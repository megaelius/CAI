We perform two-dimensional and three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations to study
cold clouds accelerated by radiation pressure on dust in the environment of rapidly star-forming
galaxies dominated by infrared flux. We utilize the reduced speed of light approximation to solve
the frequency-averaged, time-dependent radiative transfer equation. We find that radiation
pressure is capable of accelerating the clouds to hundreds of kilometers per second while remaining
dense and cold, consistent with observations. We compare these results to simulations where acceleration
is provided by entrainment in a hot wind, where the momentum injection of the hot flow is comparable
to the momentum in the radiation field. We find that the survival time of the cloud accelerated by
the radiation field is significantly longer than that of a cloud entrained in a hot outflow. We show
that the dynamics of the irradiated cloud depends on the initial optical depth, temperature of the
cloud, and the intensity of the flux. Additionally, gas pressure from the background may limit cloud
acceleration if the density ratio between the cloud and background is $\lesssim 10^{2}$. In general,
a 10 pc-scale optically thin cloud forms a pancake structure elongated perpendicular to the direction
of motion, while optically thick clouds form a filamentary structure elongated parallel to the
direction of motion. The details of accelerated cloud morphology and geometry can also be affected
by other factors, such as the cloud lengthscale, the reduced speed of light approximation, spatial
resolution, initial cloud structure, and the dimensionality of the run, but these have relatively
little affect on the cloud velocity or survival time.
