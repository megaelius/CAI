AIMS. This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source luminosity and obscuration,
in order to identify and charaterise biases which could affect conclusions in studies. METHODS.
We study IR-selected AGN in the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey
(COSMOS). The AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into unobscured
(type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical spectroscopy data. Specifically
in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic luminosity taking into account the estimated column
density (N_H). We also take the chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting
different methods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies, we also
find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing source AGN X-ray luminosity.
For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population (43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency
also worsens with increasing obscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time
of the obscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted type-1/type-2
classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN IR-selection is genuinely biased toward
unobscured AGN, but only at intermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN
IR-selection is more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are intrinsically
more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in more type-1 AGN being selected
the shallower the IR survey is. [ABRIDGED: Conclusion on survey strategy. See manuscript.] Finally,
when the James Webb Space Telescope comes online, the broad-band filters 2.0um, 4.4um, 7.7um, and
18um will be key to disentangle AGN from non-AGN dominated SEDs at depths where spectroscopy becomes
impractical.
