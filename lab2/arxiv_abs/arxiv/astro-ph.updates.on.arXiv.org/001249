We study the far-infrared properties of 498 Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) at z=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5 in the
Extended Chandra Deep Field-South, using 250, 350 and 500 micron data from the Herschel Multi-tiered
Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) and 870 micron data from the LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey (LESS).
None of the 126, 280 or 92 LAEs at z=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5, respectively, are individually detected in the
far-infrared data. We use stacking to probe the average emission to deeper flux limits, reaching
$1\sigma$ depths of ~0.1 to 0.4 mJy. The LAEs are also undetected at $\ge3\sigma$ in the stacks, although
a $2.5\sigma$ signal is observed at 870 micron for the z=2.8 sources. We consider a wide range of far-infrared
spectral energy distributions (SEDs), including a M82 and an Sd galaxy template, to determine upper
limits on the far-infrared luminosities and far-infrared-derived star-formation rates of the
LAEs. These star-formation rates are then combined with those inferred from the Ly$\alpha$ and
UV emission to determine lower limits on the LAEs Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$)).
For the Sd SED template, the inferred LAEs $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$) are $\gtrsim30%$ ($1\sigma$)
at z=2.8, 3.1 and 4.5, which are all significantly higher than the global $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$)
at these redshifts. Thus, if the LAEs $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$) follows the global evolution then
they have warmer far-infrared SEDs than the Sd galaxy template. The average and M82 SEDs produce
lower limits on the LAE $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$) of ~10 to 20% ($1\sigma$), all of which are slightly
higher than the global evolution of $f_{\rm esc}($Ly$\alpha$) but consistent with it at the 2 to
3$\sigma$ level.
