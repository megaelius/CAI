(abridged) Even if the HARPS spectrograph has been operational for more than 15 years and it provides
among the most precise Doppler measurements, improvements are still possible. One known problem,
for instance, is the non-fully regular block-stitching of the CCDs, which introduces, in some cases,
one-year period parasitic signals in the measured radial velocity. The aim is to improve the wavelength
calibration of HARPS to push further its planet-detection capabilities. The properties of the
CCD stitching-induced pixel-size anomalies are determined with LED flat-field frames, and then
a physical, gap-corrected map of the CCDs is used for the fitting model of the spectral orders. We
also use a new thorium line list, based on much higher-accuracy measurements than the one used up
to now. We derive new wavelength solutions for the 15 years of HARPS data, both before and after the
2015 fibre upgrade. We demonstrate that we correct the gap anomalies by computing the wavelength
solutions of laser frequency comb exposures, both with and without taking the gap correction into
account. By comparing the rms of the most stable stars of the HARPS sample, we show that we globally
decrease the radial velocity dispersion of the data, especially for the data acquired after the
change of fibres. Finally, the comparative analysis of several individual systems shows that we
manage to attenuate the periodogram power at one year in most cases. The analysis of the RVs derived
from individual stellar lines also shows that we correct the stitching-induced RV variation. This
improved calibration of the HARPS spectrograph allows to go deeper in the search for low-amplitude
radial-velocity signals. It will be further improved by combining the thorium calibration spectra
with laser frequency comb and Fabry-Perot calibration spectra, and not only for HARPS but notably
also for HARPS-N and ESPRESSO.
