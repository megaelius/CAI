Context. Propyne (CH$_3$CCH) has been detected in a variety of environments, from Galactic star-forming
regions to extragalactic sources. Such molecules are excellent tracers of the physical conditions
in star-forming regions. Aims. This study explores the emission of CH$_3$CCH in the low-mass protostellar
binary, IRAS 16293$-$2422, examining the spatial scales traced by this molecule, as well as its
formation and destruction pathways. Methods. ALMA observations from the Protostellar Interferometric
Line Survey (PILS) are used to determine the abundances and excitation temperatures of CH$_3$CCH
towards both protostars, exploring spatial scales from 70 to 2400 au. The three-phase chemical
kinetics model MAGICKAL is also used, to explore the chemical reactions of this molecule. Results.
CH$_3$CCH is detected towards both IRAS 16293A and IRAS 16293B and is found to trace the hot corino
component around each source in the PILS dataset. Eighteen transitions above 3$\sigma$ are detected,
enabling robust excitation temperatures and column densities to be determined in each source.
In IRAS 16293A, an excitation temperature of 90 K and a column density of 7.8$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$
best fits the spectra. In IRAS 16293B, an excitation temperature of 100 K and 6.8$\times$10$^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ best fits the spectra. The chemical modelling finds that in order to reproduce the observed
abundances, both gas-phase and grain-surface reactions are needed. Conclusions. CH$_3$CCH is
a molecule whose brightness and abundance in many different regions can be utilised to provide a
benchmark of molecular variation with the physical properties of star-forming regions. It is essential
when making such comparisons, that the abundances are determined with a good understanding of the
spatial scale of the emitting region, to ensure that accurate abundances are derived.
