Stars formed in clusters can encounter other stars at close distances. These encounters strongly
perturb planetary systems, directly causing ejection of planets or their capture by the intruding
star, as well as exciting orbital eccentricities and leading to long-term destabilisation. Using
extensive $N$-body simulations, we study fly-by encounters between two planetary systems, each
a Solar System analogue with four giant planets from Jupiter to Neptune. We quantify the rates of
loss and capture immediately after encounter, finding that one third of the planets lost from the
host are indeed captured by the flying-by star. Interactions between planets during the fly-by
encounters are found to be negligible. We then perform long-term (up to 1 Gyr) simulations investigating
the ensuing post-encounter evolution, paying close attention to how captured planets interact
with the original planetary systems. It is found that large numbers of planets are removed from systems
due to planet--planet interactions. Captured planets are found to further enhance the frequency
of system instability. While encounters between two planetary systems can initially leave a planetary
system containing more planets immediately after a fly-by, the long-term evolution post encounter
tends to lead to the ejection of planets as the system becomes unstable, thus leading in general to
a reduction in the number of planets a system contains. We find that one half of the surviving captured
planets end up on retrograde orbits. Thus, encounters between planetary systems are a channel to
place planets on wide retrograde orbits that may be detectable through astrometry or direct imaging.
