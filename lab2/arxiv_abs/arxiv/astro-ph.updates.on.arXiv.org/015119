We present the analysis of high-resolution images of MOA-2013-BLG-220, taken with the Keck adaptive
optics system 6 years after the initial observation, identifying the lens as a solar-type star hosting
a super-Jupiter mass planet. The masses of planets and host-stars discovered by microlensing are
often not determined from light curve data, while the star-planet mass-ratio and projected separation
in units of Einstein ring radius are well measured. High-resolution follow-up observations after
the lensing event is complete can resolve the source and lens. This allows direct measurements of
flux, and the amplitude and direction of proper motion, giving strong constraints on the system
parameters. Due to the high relative proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel,Geo} = 12.62\pm0.11$ mas/yr,
the source and lens were resolved in 2019, with a separation of $77.1\pm0.5$ mas. Thus, we constrain
the lens flux to $K_{\rm Keck,lens}= 17.92\pm0.02$. By combining constraints from the model and
Keck flux, we find the lens mass to be $M_L = 0.88\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ at $D_L = 6.72\pm0.59$ kpc. With
a mass-ratio of $q=(3.00\pm0.03)\times10^{-3}$ the planet's mass is determined to be $M_P = 2.74\pm0.17\
M_{J}$ at a separation of $r_\perp = 3.03\pm0.27$ AU. The lens mass is much higher than the prediction
made by the Bayesian analysis that assumes all stars have an equal probability to host a planet of
the measured mass ratio, and suggests that planets with mass ratios of a few 10$^{-3}$ are more common
orbiting massive stars. This demonstrates the importance of high-resolution follow-up observations
for testing theories like these.
