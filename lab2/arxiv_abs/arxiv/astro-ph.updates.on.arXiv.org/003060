One of the key observations regarding the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is its near-universality
in the Milky Way (MW), which provides a powerful way to constrain different star formation models
that predict the IMF. However, those models are almost universally "cloud-scale" or smaller --
they take as input or simulate single molecular clouds (GMCs), clumps, or cores, and predict the
resulting IMF as a function of the cloud properties. Without a model for the progenitor properties
of all clouds which formed the stars at different locations in the MW (including ancient stellar
populations formed in high-redshift, likely gas-rich dwarf progenitor galaxies that looked little
like the Galaxy today), the predictions cannot be fully explored, nor safely applied to "live" cosmological
calculations of the IMF in different galaxies at different cosmological times. We therefore combine
a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations (from the Feedback In Realistic Environments
project), which form MW-like galaxies with reasonable star formation properties and explicitly
resolve massive GMCs, with various proposed cloud-scale IMF models. We apply the models independently
to every star particle formed in the simulations to synthesize the predicted IMF in the present-day
galaxy. We explore models where the IMF depends on Jeans mass, sonic or turbulent Bonner-Ebert mass,
fragmentation with a polytropic equation-of-state, or where it is self-regulated by protostellar
feedback. We show that all of these models, except the feedback-regulated ones, predict far more
variation ($\sim 0.6-1$ dex $1\,\sigma$ scatter in the IMF turnover mass) in the simulations than
is observed in the MW.
