We present a spectroscopic redshift catalog from the LAMOST Complete Spectroscopic Survey of Pointing
Area (LaCoSSPAr) in the Southern Galactic Cap (SGC), which is designed to observe all sources (Galactic
and extra-galactic) by using repeating observations with a limiting magnitude of $r=18.1~mag$
in two $20~deg^2$ fields. The project is mainly focusing on the completeness of LAMOST ExtraGAlactic
Surveys (LEGAS) in the SGC, the deficiencies of source selection methods and the basic performance
parameters of LAMOST telescope. In both fields, more than 95% of galaxies have been observed. A post-processing
has been applied to LAMOST 1D spectrum to remove the majority of remaining sky background residuals.
More than 10,000 spectra have been visually inspected to measure the redshift by using combinations
of different emission/absorption features with uncertainty of $\sigma_{z}/(1+z)<0.001$. In
total, there are 1528 redshifts (623 absorption and 905 emission line galaxies) in Field A and 1570
redshifts (569 absorption and 1001 emission line galaxies) in Field B have been measured. The results
show that it is possible to derive redshift from low SNR galaxies with our post-processing and visual
inspection. Our analysis also indicates that up to 1/4 of the input targets for a typical extra-galactic
spectroscopic survey might be unreliable. The multi-wavelength data analysis shows that the majority
of mid-infrared-detected absorption (91.3%) and emission line galaxies (93.3%) can be well separated
by an empirical criterion of $W2-W3=2.4$. Meanwhile, a fainter sequence paralleled to the main
population of galaxies has been witnessed both in $M_r$/$W2-W3$ and $M_*$/$W2-W3$ diagrams, which
could be the population of luminous dwarf galaxies but contaminated by the edge-on/highly inclined
galaxies ($\sim30\%$).
