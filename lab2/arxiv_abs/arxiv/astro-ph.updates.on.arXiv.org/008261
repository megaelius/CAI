We present the first images of the transition disk around the close binary system HD 34700A in polarized
scattered light using the Gemini Planet Imager instrument on Gemini South. The J and H band images
reveal multiple spiral-arm structures outside a large (R = 0.49" = 175 au) cavity along with a bluish
spiral structure inside the cavity. The cavity wall shows a strong discontinuity and we clearly
see significant non-azimuthal polarization Uphi consistent with multiple scattering within
a disk at an inferred inclination ~42deg. Radiative transfer modeling along with a new Gaia distance
suggest HD 37400A is a young (~5 Myr) system consisting of two intermediate-mass (~2Msun) stars
surrounded by a transitional disk and not a solar-mass binary with a debris disk as previously classified.
Conventional assumptions of the dust-to-gas ratio would rule out a gravitational instability
origin to the spirals while hydrodynamical models using the known external companion or a hypothetical
massive protoplanet in the cavity both have trouble reproducing the relatively large spiral arm
pitch angles (~30deg) without fine tuning of gas temperature. We explore the possibility that material
surrounding a massive protoplanet could explain the rim discontinuity after also considering
effects of shadowing by an inner disk. Analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope data suggests
the disk is rotating counterclockwise as expected from the spiral arm structure and revealed a new
low-mass companion at 6.45" separation. We include an appendix which sets out clear definitions
of Q, U, Qphi, Uphi, correcting some confusion and errors in the literature.
