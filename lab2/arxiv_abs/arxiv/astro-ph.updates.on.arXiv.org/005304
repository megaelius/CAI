Binary neutron star mergers are believed to be candidates to eject significant mass with different
velocities. Once this ejected material begins to be decelerated by a homogeneous medium, a power-law
distribution of electrons is mainly cooled down by synchrotron radiation generating a multiwavelength
long-lived afterglow. Analytic and numerical methods illustrate that the outermost spherical
layer, the so-called merger shock-breakout material can be described with a kinetic energy $\propto
(\beta\Gamma)^{-\alpha_s}$ with $\alpha_s$ varying from 1.1(1.6) for $\beta\Gamma\gg$ 1 up
to 5.2(6.9) for $\beta\Gamma\ll$ 1 when the polytropic index is $n_p=3$(3/2). Considering the
material fraction moving towards the observer which dominates the observed emission, the kinetic
energy associated to it becomes much smaller $E\propto \Gamma^{-\delta}$ and the bulk Lorentz
factor decays slower $\Gamma \propto t^{-\frac{3}{\delta+8}}$ with $\delta=\alpha_s+2$. As
a particular case, we successfully describe the X-ray, optical and radio light curves and the spectral
energy distribution at 15 and 110 days from the recently discovered gravitational-wave transient
GW170817 when the merger shock-breakout material moves with mildly relativistic velocities near-Newtonian
phase $\Gamma\sim 3$ ($\alpha_s=4.2$ for $n_p=$3/2). We found that X-ray, optical and radio fluxes
evolve as $F_\nu\propto t^{0.8}\nu^{-0.6}$ between the synchrotron spectral breaks. This analytical
model predicts that the X-ray flux will begin changing its evolution at $\sim$140 - 160 days first
to $F_\nu\sim t^{0.5}$ because the cooling energy will fall below the X-ray band and then to $F_\nu\propto
t^{0.2}$ (plateau phase) due to decelerated material entering the non-relativistic regime.
