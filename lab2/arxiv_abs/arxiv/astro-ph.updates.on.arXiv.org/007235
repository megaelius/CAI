Extension of radio interferometric baselines into space is inevitable if a diffraction-limited
angular resolution defined by the Earth diameter at a given observing wavelength limits a pursuit
of specific scientific goals. This was understood in the early1960s, at the very dawn of the era of
Earth-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Since then, three VLBI missions operated
in Space thus enabling baselines longer than the Earth diameter. These are the Tracking and Data
Relay Satellite Orbital VLBI experiment (1986 - 1988), the VLBI Space Observatory Program (VSOP,
1997 - 2003) and RadioAstron (2011 - present time). These Space VLBI (SVLBI) systems enabled studies
of celestial radio sources with an unprecedentedly sharp angular resolution reaching 0.1 nanoradian
(tens of microarcseconds) and sharper. The first generation SVLBI missions provided cutting-edge
results in several topics of modern radio astronomy. These include discoveries of ultra-compact
galactic hydroxyl and water vapor masers, radio emission in active galactic nuclei with the brightness
exceeding conventional theoretical limits, and detection of pulsar emission at meter wavelengths
shedding a new light on the properties of the interstellar medium. One of the Space VLBI missions,
the RadioAstron, also ventured into the domain of fundamental physics by sing its onboard Hydrogen
maser local oscillators for experimental verification of the Einstein Equivalence Principle.
The paper provides a brief review these discoveries and lessons learned over the first half a century
of Space VLBI. This comparison, together with the review of technological achievements of the three
SLBI missions, creates a fundament for projecting the development of space-based radio interferometry
into the next decades.
