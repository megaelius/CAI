Aims: Our aim is to obtain more information about the physical nature of B-type asteroids and extend
on the previous work by studying their physical properties derived from fitting an asteroid thermal
model to their NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data. We also examine the Pallas
collisional family, a B-type family with a moderately high albedo in contrast to the large majority
of B-types. Methods: We apply a combination of the NEATM and a model of the reflected sunlight to WISE
asteroid data in order to derive effective diameter (D), the so-called infrared beaming parameter
(\eta), ratio of infrared to visible albedo (R_p = p_{IR}/p_V) and visible geometric albedo (p_V).
Results: We obtained parameter values for $\ga$ 100 B-types asteroids and plotted the value distributions
of p_V, R_p and \eta (p_V = 0.07 +- 0.03$, R_p = 1.0 +- 0.2, and \eta = 1.0 +- 0.1). By combining the IR and
visible albedos with 2.5-micron reflectances from the literature we obtained the ratio of reflectances
at 3.4 and 2.5 micron, from which we found statistically significant indications that the presence
of a 3-micron absorption band related to water may be commonplace among the B-types. Finally, the
Pallas collisional family members studied ($\sim$ 50 objects) present moderately high values
of p_V (p_V = 0.14 +- 0.05), significantly higher than the average albedo of B-types. In addition,
this family presents the lowest and most homogeneously distributed R_p-values of our whole sample,
which shows that this group is clearly different from the rest, likely because its members are pieces
probably originating from the same region of (2) Pallas, a particularly high-albedo B-type asteroid.
