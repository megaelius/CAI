Formation of massive stars within embedded star clusters starts a complex interplay between their
feedback, inflowing gas and stellar dynamics, which often includes close stellar encounters.
Hydrodynamical simulations usually resort to substantial simplifications to model embedded
clusters. Here, we address the simplification which approximates the whole star cluster by a single
sink particle, which completely neglects the internal stellar dynamics. In order to model the internal
stellar dynamics, we implement a Hermite predictor-corrector integration scheme to the hydrodynamic
code FLASH. As we illustrate by a suite of tests, this integrator significantly outperforms the
current leap-frog scheme, and it is able to follow the dynamics of small compact stellar systems
without the necessity to soften the gravitational potential. We find that resolving individual
massive stars instead of representing the whole cluster by a single energetic source has a profound
influence on the gas component: for clusters of mass less than $\lesssim 3 \times 10^3 M_{\odot}$,
it slows gas expulsion by a factor of $\approx 5$ to $\approx 1$ Myr, and it results in substantially
more complex gas structures. With increasing cluster mass (up to $\approx 3\times 10^3 M_{\odot}$),
the gas expulsion time-scale slightly decreases. However, more massive clusters ($\gtrsim 5\times
10^3 M_{\odot}$) are unable to clear their natal gas with photoionising radiation and stellar winds
only if they form with a star formation efficiency (SFE) of $1/3$. This implies that the more massive
clusters are either cleared with another feedback mechanism or they form with a SFE higher than $1/3$.
