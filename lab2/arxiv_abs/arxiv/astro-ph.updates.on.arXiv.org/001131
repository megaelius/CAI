Self-consistent N-body simulations are an efficient tool to study galactic dynamics. However,
it can be challenging to use them for the detailed study of individual trajectories (or ensembles
of trajectories). Such orbital studies are important to shed light on global phase space properties,
which are the underlying cause of observed structures. The potentials needed to describe self-consistent
models are in this case time-dependent. For this reason, we aim to investigate the different dynamical
properties (such as regular and chaotic motion) of a non-autonomous galactic system, whose time-dependent
potential adequately mimics certain realistic trends arising from N-body barred galaxy simulations.
We construct a fully time-dependent analytical model, which manages to capture and reproduce several
features of an N-body simulation. We model the gravitational potentials of three components (disc,
bar and dark matter halo), whose time-dependent parameters are derived from an N-body simulation.
We start by studying the dynamical stability of its reduced time-independent 2-degrees of freedom
model by charting the different islands of stability associated with certain orbital morphologies
and detecting the chaotic and regular regions. We then turn our interest to the full 3-degrees of
freedom time-dependent case, where we show a few representative trajectories which experience
different typical dynamical behaviours, i.e., an interplay between regular and chaotic motion
for different epochs. Finally, we focus on the study of the underlying global dynamical transitions
of the time-dependent system in terms of estimating the relative total fraction of (un)stable motion
of an ensemble of initial conditions taken from the simulation and evolved with the time-dependent
potential. We find that, for such an ensemble, the fraction of regular motion increases with time.
