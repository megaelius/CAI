We perform an analysis of the line-of-sight (LOS) observables of the SDO/HMI for models of the solar
atmosphere heated by precipitating high-energy electrons during solar flares. The radiative
hydrodynamic (RADYN) flare models are obtained from the F-CHROMA database. The Stokes profiles
for the Fe 6173 A line observed by SDO/HMI are calculated using the radiative transfer code RH1.5D
assuming statistical equilibrium for atomic level populations and imposing uniform background
vertical magnetic field of various strength. The SDO/HMI observing sequence and LOS data processing
pipeline algorithm are applied to derive the observables (continuum intensity, line depth, Doppler
velocity, LOS magnetic field). Our results reveal that the strongest deviations of the observables
from the actual spectroscopic line parameters are found for the model with a total energy deposited
of $E_{total}=1.0\times{}10^{12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, injected with power-law spectral index of
$\delta=3$ above a low-energy cutoff of $E_{c}=25$ keV. The magnitudes of the velocity and magnetic
field deviations depend on the imposed magnetic field, and can reach 0.35 km/s for LOS velocities,
90 G for LOS magnetic field, and 3\% for continuum enhancement for the 1000 G imposed LOS magnetic
field setup. For $E_{total}\geq{}3.0\times{}10^{11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ models, the velocity and
magnetic field deviations are most strongly correlated with the energy flux carried by $\sim$50
keV electrons, and the continuum enhancement is correlated with the synthesized $\sim$55-60 keV
hard X-ray photon flux. The relatively low magnitudes of perturbations of the observables and absence
of magnetic field sign reversals suggest that the considered radiative hydrodynamic beam heating
models augmented with the uniform vertical magnetic field setups cannot explain strong transient
changes found in the SDO/HMI observations.
