Thermal inflation models (which feature two inflationary stages) can display damped primordial
curvature power spectra on small scales which generate damped matter fluctuations. For a reasonable
choice of parameters, thermal inflation models naturally predict a suppression of the matter power
spectrum on galactic and sub-galactic scales, mimicking the effect of warm or interacting dark
matter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an excess of power (w.r.t.
the standard $\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below the suppression scale. By running a suite
of N-body simulations we investigate the non-linear growth of structure in models of thermal inflation.
We measure the non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the halo mass
function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model
and in other models with damped matter fluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered
here produce measurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\Lambda$CDM at redshifts
$z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all redshifts. The halo mass function
at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an enhancement of around $\sim 20\%$ w.r.t. $\Lambda$CDM
and a damping at lower halo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of
the free parameter in the model. The enhancement in the halo mass function (w.r.t. $\Lambda$CDM
) increases with redshift, reaching $\sim 40\%$ at $z=5$. We also study the accuracy of the analytical
Press-Schechter approach, using different filters to smooth the density field, to predict halo
statistics for thermal inflation. We find that the predictions with the smooth-$k$ filter agree
with the simulation results over a wider range of halo masses than is the case with other filters commonly
used in the literature.
