We continue our systematic statistical study of various components in gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical
lightcurves. We decompose the early onset bump and the late re-brightening bump with empirical
fits and analyze their statistical properties. Among the 146 GRBs that have well-sampled optical
lightcurves, the onset and re-brightening bumps are observed in 38 and 26 GRBs, respectively. It
is found that the typical rising and decaying slopes for both the onset and re-brightening bumps
are ~1.5 and -1.15, respectively. No early onset bumps in the X-ray band are detected to be associated
with the optical onset bumps, while an X-ray re-brightening bump is detected for half of the re-brightening
optical bumps. The peak luminosity is anti-correlated with the peak time, L_p\propto t_{p}^{-1.81+/-0.32}
and L_p\propto t_{p}^{-0.83+/-0.17} for the onset and re-brightening bumps, respectively. Both
L_p and the isotropic energy release of the onset bumps are correlated with E_{\gamma, iso}, whereas
no similar correlation is found for the re-brightening bumps. Taking the onset bumps as probes for
the properties of the fireballs and their ambient medium, we find that the typical power-law index
of the relativistic electrons is 2.5 and the medium density profile behaves as n\propto r^{-1} within
the framework of the synchrotron external shock models. With the medium density profile obtained
from our analysis, we also confirm the correlation between initial Lorentz factor (\Gamma_0) and
E_{\gamma, iso} in our previous work. The jet component that produces the re-brightening bump seems
to be on-axis and independent of the prompt emission jet component. Its typical kinetic energy budget
would be about one order of magnitude larger than the prompt emission component, but with a lower
\Gamma_0, typically several tens.
