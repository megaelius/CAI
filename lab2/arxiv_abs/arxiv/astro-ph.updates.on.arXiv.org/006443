A wide variety of phenomena such as gentle but persistent brightening, dynamic slender features
(~100 km), and compact (~1'') ultraviolet (UV) bursts are associated with the heating of the solar
chromosphere. High spatio-temporal resolution is required to capture the finer details of the
likely magnetic reconnection-driven, rapidly evolving bursts. Such observations are also needed
to reveal their similarities to large-scale flares, which are also thought to be reconnection driven,
and more generally their role in chromospheric heating. Here we report observations of chromospheric
heating in the form of a UV burst obtained with the balloon-borne observatory, SUNRISE. The observed
burst displayed a spatial morphology similar to that of a large-scale solar flare with circular
ribbon. While the co-temporal UV observations at 1.5'' spatial resolution and 24s cadence from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory showed a compact brightening, the SUNRISE observations at diffraction-limited
spatial resolution of 0.1'' at 7s cadence revealed a dynamic sub-structure of the burst that it is
composed of extended ribbon-like features and a rapidly evolving arcade of thin (~0.1'' wide) magnetic
loop-like features, similar to post-flare loops. Such a dynamic sub-structure reveals the small-scale
nature of chromospheric heating in these bursts. Furthermore, based on magnetic field extrapolations,
this heating event is associated with a complex fan-spine magnetic topology. Our observations
strongly hint at a unified picture of magnetic heating in the solar atmosphere from some large-scale
flares to small-scale bursts, all being associated with such a magnetic topology.
