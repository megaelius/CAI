We make use of the high photometric precision of Kepler to search for periodic variations among 14
normal (DA- and DB-type, likely non-magnetic) hot white dwarfs (WDs) observed by the mission. In
seven of the WDs, we detect periodic, ~2 hr to 10 d, variations, with semi-amplitudes of 40 to 2000
ppm, lower than ever seen in WDs. We consider various explanations for the observed variations:
WD rotation combined with magnetic cool spots; rotation combined with magnetic dichroism; rotation
combined with hot spots from an interstellar-medium accretion flow, channeled onto weak magnetic
poles; transits by size ~50-200 km objects; relativistic beaming due to reflex motion caused by
a cool companion WD; or reflection/re-radiation of the primary WD light by a brown-dwarf companion,
or by a giant planet of about Jupiter radius, undergoing illumination phases as it orbits the WD.
Each of these mechanisms could be behind some of the variable WDs, but could not be responsible for
all seven variable cases. Alternatively, the periodicity may arise from UV metal-line opacity,
associated with accretion of rocky material, a phenomenon seen in ~50% of hot WDs. Slightly non-uniform
UV opacity, combined with WD rotation and fluorescent optical re-emission of the absorbed UV energy,
could potentially explain our findings. Even if reflection of the WD light by a planet is the cause
in only a few of the seven cases, it would imply that hot Jupiters are very common around WDs. Alternatively,
if some of the rotation-related mechanisms are at work, it would indicate that normal WDs rotate
as slowly as do peculiar WDs, the only kind for which precise rotation measurements have been possible
to date. Followup observations for this sample, and the larger numbers of additional WDs now being
monitored as part of the K2 Kepler mission extension, will soon discriminate among these possibilities.
