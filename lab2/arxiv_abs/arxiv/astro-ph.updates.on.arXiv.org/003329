We investigate the effects of interactions between ions and neutrals on the chromosphere and overlying
corona using 2.5D radiative MHD simulations with the Bifrost code. We have extended the code capabilities
implementing ion-neutral interaction effects using the Generalized Ohm's Law, i.e., we include
the Hall term and the ambipolar diffusion (Pedersen dissipation) in the induction equation. Our
models span from the upper convection zone to the corona, with the photosphere, chromosphere and
transition region partially ionized. Our simulations reveal that the interactions between ionized
particles and neutral particles have important consequences for the magneto-thermodynamics
of these modeled layers: 1) ambipolar diffusion increases the temperature in the chromosphere;
2) sporadically the horizontal magnetic field in the photosphere is diffused into the chromosphere
due to the large ambipolar diffusion; 3) ambipolar diffusion concentrates electrical currents
leading to more violent jets and reconnection processes, resulting in 3a) the formation of longer
and faster spicules, 3b) heating of plasma during the spicule evolution, and 3c) decoupling of the
plasma and magnetic field in spicules. Our results indicate that ambipolar diffusion is a critical
ingredient for understanding the magneto-thermo-dynamic properties in the chromosphere and
transition region. The numerical simulations have been made publicly available, similar to previous
Bifrost simulations. This will allow the community to study realistic numerical simulations with
a wider range of magnetic field configurations and physics modules than previously possible.
