We present a flare catalog of the {\it Kepler} mission using the long-cadence data of Data Release
25. This catalog comprises 3420 flare stars and 162,262 flare events. A comparison shows that the
flare catalogs of previous studies are seriously polluted by various false positive signals and
artifacts. The incidence of flare stars rises with decreasing temperature, which accords with
the theoretical analysis. The flare frequency distributions (FFDs) from F-type stars to M-type
stars obey a power-law relation with $\alpha \sim 2$, indicating that they have the same mechanism
on generating flares. The remarkable incidence and the deviation of FFDs on A-type flare stars imply
that they generate flares in a different way. The activity--rotation relation is consistent with
previous studies at low temperature band, whereas it becomes dispersive with increasing temperature.
Combined with the Gyrochronology, we find that the mixing of stars of two different dynamos gives
rise to the dispersion. We thereby propose a scenario on understanding the activity--rotation
relation across the H-R diagram. Based on the scenario and the correspondence of dynamo with regard
to activity and rotation, we suggest a new expression on the activity--rotation relation, in which
the segmentation is on the basis of the dynamo rather than the rotation period. The rotation distribution
of flare stars shows that about 70\% of flare stars rotate faster than 10 days and the rate approaches
95\% at 30 days. Based on the incidence and the rotation distribution of flare stars, we estimate
that a superflare with energy $\sim 10^{34}$ erg occurs on the Sun at least once in 5500 years.
