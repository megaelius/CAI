Recent measurements of large-scale peculiar velocities from the cumulative kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect using WMAP data and X-ray selected clusters from ROSAT have identified a bulk flow of galaxy
clusters at $\sim 600-1,000$ km s$^{-1}$ on scales of $\sim0.5-1$ Gpc, roughly aligned with the
all-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole. The flow is inferred from the detection of a residual
dipole generated by CMB fluctuations exclusively in the direction of galaxy clusters, and measured
within apertures containing zero monopole. Consistent with this interpretation, the amplitude
of the dipole correlates with the X-ray luminosity of the clusters. To enable this measurement,
the CMB data need to be filtered to remove the primary CMB, thereby increasing the data's signal-to-noise
ratio. Filtering cannot imprint a signal with the mentioned properties at cluster positions; however,
an inadequately designed filter can greatly suppress such a signal. We show here that recent studies
that failed to detect a large-scale flow with various filters indeed adopted flawed implementations;
when correctly implemented, these alternative filters lead to results that are in fact consistent
with the Dark Flow signal. The discrepancies can be traced to the likely presence of residual dipoles
caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, to assumptions about cluster profiles incompatible
with the data as well as failure to compute dipoles at the zero monopole aperture. PLANCK maps, with
their large frequency coverage and a 217 GHz channel, will be instrumental to probe bulk flows, to
remove spurious dipole signals and to help identify filtering schemes appropriate for this measurement.
