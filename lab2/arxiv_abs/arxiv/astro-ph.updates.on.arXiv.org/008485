We present the most comprehensive analysis to date of the Upper Centaurus Lupus eclipsing binary
MML 53 (2.097892 d), and for the first time, confirm the bound-nature of the third star (~9yr orbit).
Our analysis uses new and archival spectra and time-series photometry. We determined the temperature
of the primary star to be 4880+-100 K. The study of the close binary incorporated treatment of spots
and dilution by the tertiary in the light curves, allowing for the robust measurement of the masses
of the eclipsing components within 1% (M1=1.0400+-0.0067 and M2=0.8907+-0.0058 Msun), their
radii within 4.5% (R1=1.283+-0.043 and R2=1.107+-0.049 Rsun), and the secondary temperature
(4379+-100K). From the analysis of the eclipse timings, and the change in systemic velocity of the
eclipsing binary and the radial velocities of the third star, we measured the mass of the outer companion
to be 0.7 Msun within 20%. The age we derived from the evolution of the temperature ratio between the
eclipsing components is fully consistent with previous estimates of the age of UCL (16+-2 Myr).
At this age, the tightening of the MML 53 eclipsing binary has already occurred, thus supporting
close-binary formation mechanisms that act early in their evolution. The eclipsing stars roughly
follow the same theoretical isochrone, but appear to be inflated in radius (by 20% for the primary
and 10% for the secondary). However, our primary radius measurement of is in full agreement with
the independent measurement of the secondary of NP Per which has the same mass and a similar age. The
eclipsing stars of MML 53 are found to be larger but not cooler than predicted by non-magnetic models,
it is not clear what is the mechanism that is causing the radius inflation given that activity, spots
and/or magnetic fields slowing their contraction, require the inflated stars to be cooler to remain
in thermal equilibrium.
