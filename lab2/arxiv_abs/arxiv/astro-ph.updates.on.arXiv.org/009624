Aims. To date, more than 600 multi-planetary systems have been discovered. Due to the limitations
of the detection methods, our knowledge of the systems is usually far from complete. In particular,
for planetary systems discovered with the radial velocity (RV) technique, the inclinations of
the orbital planes, and thus the mutual inclinations and planetary masses, are unknown. Our work
aims to constrain the spatial configuration of several RV-detected extrasolar systems that are
not in a mean-motion resonance. Methods. Through an analytical study based on a first-order secular
Hamiltonian expansion and numerical explorations performed with a chaos detector, we identified
ranges of values for the orbital inclinations and the mutual inclinations, which ensure the long-term
stability of the system. Our results were validated by comparison with n-body simulations, showing
the accuracy of our analytical approach up to high mutual inclinations (approx. 70{\deg}-80{\deg}).
Results. We find that, given the current estimations for the parameters of the selected systems,
long-term regular evolution of the spatial configurations is observed, for all the systems, i)
at low mutual inclinations (typically less than 35{\deg}) and ii) at higher mutual inclinations,
preferentially if the system is in a Lidov-Kozai resonance. Indeed, a rapid destabilisation of
highly mutually inclined orbits is commonly observed, due to the significant chaos that develops
around the stability islands of the Lidov-Kozai resonance. The extent of the Lidov-Kozai resonant
region is discussed for ten planetary systems (HD 11506, HD 12661, HD 134987, HD 142, HD 154857, HD
164922, HD 169830, HD 207832, HD 4732, and HD 74156).
