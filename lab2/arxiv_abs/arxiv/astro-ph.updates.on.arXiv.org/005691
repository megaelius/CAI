We gathered more than 1130 high-resolution optical spectra for more than 250 Galactic classical
Cepheids. The spectra were collected with different optical spectrographs: UVES at VLT, HARPS
at 3.6m, FEROS at 2.2m MPG/ESO, and STELLA. To improve the effective temperature estimates, we present
more than 150 new line depth ratio (LDR) calibrations that together with similar calibrations already
available in the literature allowed us to cover a broad range in wavelength (between 5348 and 8427
angstrom) and in effective temperatures (between 3500 and 7700 K). This means the unique opportunity
to cover both the hottest and coolest phases along the Cepheid pulsation cycle and to limit the intrinsic
error on individual measurements at the level of ~100 K. Thanks to the high signal-to-noise ratio
of individual spectra we identified and measured hundreds of neutral and ionized lines of heavy
elements, and in turn, have the opportunity to trace the variation of both surface gravity and microturbulent
velocity along the pulsation cycle. The accuracy of the physical parameters and the number of Fe
I (more than one hundred) and Fe II (more than ten) lines measured allowed us to estimate mean iron
abundances with a precision better than 0.1 dex. Here we focus on 14 calibrating Cepheids for which
the current spectra cover either the entire or a significant portion of the pulsation cycle. The
current estimates of the variation of the physical parameters along the pulsation cycle and of the
iron abundances agree quite well with similar estimates available in the literature. Independent
homogeneous estimates of both physical parameters and metal abundances based on different approaches
that can constrain possible systematics are highly encouraged.
