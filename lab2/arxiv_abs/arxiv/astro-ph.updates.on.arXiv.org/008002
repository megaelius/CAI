It is important to understand the origin of molecular line intensities and chemical composition
in the molecular-cloud scale in the Galactic sources because it serves as a benchmark to compare
with the chemical compositions of extragalactic sources. Recent observations of the 3-mm spectra
averaged over the 10-pc scale show similar spectral pattern among sources for molecular lines HCN,
HCO$^+$, CCH, HNC, HNCO, c-C$_3$H$_2$, CS, SO, N$_2$H$^+$, and CN. To constrain the average physical
property emitting such spectral pattern, we model molecular spectra using a time-dependent gas-grain
chemical model followed by a radiative transfer calculation. We use a grid of physical parameters
such as the density $n=3 \times 10^2 - 3\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$, the temperature, $T=10-30$ K, the
visual extinction $A_{\rm V} = 2,4,10$ mag, the cosmic-ray ionization rate $\zeta = 10^{-17} - 10^{-16}$
s$^{-1}$, and the sulfur elemental abundance $S/H = 8\times 10^{-8} - 8\times 10^{-7}$. Comparison
with the observed spectra indicates that spectra are well reproduced with the relatively low density
of $n=(1-3) \times 10^3\,$cm$^{-3}$, $T=10\,$K, $\zeta = 10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, and the short chemistry
timescale of $10^5$ yrs. This short chemistry timescale may indicate that molecular clouds are
constantly affected by the turbulence, and exposed to low-density, low $A_{\rm V}$ regions that
"refreshes" the chemical clock by UV radiation. The relatively low density obtained is orders of
magnitude lower than the commonly-quoted critical density in the optically thin case. Meanwhile,
this range of density is consistent with results from recent observational analysis of molecular-cloud-scale
mapping.
