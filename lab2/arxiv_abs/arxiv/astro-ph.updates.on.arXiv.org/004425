We present updated metallicity relations for the spectral database of star-forming galaxies (SFGs)
found in the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey (KISS). New spectral observations of emission-line
galaxies (ELGs) obtained from a variety of telescope facilities provide oxygen abundance information.
A nearly four-fold increase in the number of KISS objects with robust metallicities relative to
our previous analysis provides for an empirical abundance calibration to compute self-consistent
metallicity estimates for all SFGs in the sample with adequate spectral data. In addition, a sophisticated
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting routine has provided robust calculations of stellar
mass. With these new and/or improved galaxy characteristics, we have developed luminosity-metallicity
($L$-$Z$) relations, mass-metallicity ($M_{*}$-$Z$) relations, and the so-called Fundamental
Metallicity Relation (FMR) for over 1,450 galaxies from the KISS sample. This KISS $M_{*}$-$Z$
relation is presented for the first time and demonstrates markedly lower scatter than the KISS $L$-$Z$
relation. We find that our relations agree reasonably well with previous publications, modulo
modest offsets due to differences in the SEL metallicity calibrations used. We illustrate an important
bias present in previous $L$-$Z$ and $M_{*}$-$Z$ studies involving direct-method ($T_{e}$) abundances
that may result in systematically lower slopes in these relations. Our KISS FMR shows consistency
with those found in the literature, albeit with a larger scatter. This is likely a consequence of
the KISS sample being biased toward galaxies with high levels of activity.
