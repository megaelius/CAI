Statistical studies of galaxy-galaxy interactions often utilise net change in physical properties
of progenitors as a function of the separation between their nuclei to trace both the strength and
the observable timescale of their interaction. In this study, we use two-point auto, cross and mark
correlation functions to investigate the extent to which small-scale clustering properties of
star forming galaxies can be used to gain physical insight into galaxy-galaxy interactions between
galaxies of similar optical brightness and stellar mass. The Halpha star formers, drawn from the
highly spatially complete Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, show an increase in clustering
on small separations. Moreover, the clustering strength shows a strong dependence on optical brightness
and stellar mass, where (1) the clustering amplitude of optically brighter galaxies at a given separation
is larger than that of optically fainter systems, (2) the small scale clustering properties (e.g.
the strength, the scale at which the signal relative to the fiducial power law plateaus) of star forming
galaxies appear to differ as a function of increasing optical brightness of galaxies. According
to cross and mark correlation analyses, the former result is largely driven by the increased dust
content in optically bright star forming galaxies. The latter could be interpreted as evidence
of a correlation between interaction-scale and optical brightness of galaxies, where physical
evidence of interactions between optically bright star formers, likely hosted within relatively
massive halos, persist over larger separations than those between optically faint star formers.
