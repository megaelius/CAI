A large-scale hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, Horizon-AGN, is used to investigate the
alignment between the spin of galaxies and the large-scale cosmic filaments above redshift one.
The analysis of more than 150 000 galaxies with morphological diversity in a 100 Mpc/h comoving box
size shows that the spin of low-mass, rotation-dominated, blue, star-forming galaxies is preferentially
aligned with their neighbouring filaments. High-mass, dispersion-dominated, red, quiescent
galaxies tend to have a spin perpendicular to nearby filaments. The reorientation of the spin of
massive galaxies is provided by galaxy mergers which are significant in the mass build up of high-mass
galaxies. We find that the stellar mass transition from alignment to misalignment happens around
3.10^10 M_sun. This is consistent with earlier findings of a dark matter mass transition for the
orientation of the spin of halos (5.10^11 M_sun at the same redshift from Codis et al., 2012). With
these numerical evidence, we advocate a scenario in which galaxies form in the vorticity-rich neighbourhood
of filaments, and migrate towards the nodes of the cosmic web as they convert their orbital angular
momentum into spin. The signature of this process can be traced to the physical and morphological
properties of galaxies, as measured relative to the cosmic web. We argue that a strong source of feedback
such as Active Galactic Nuclei is mandatory to quench in situ star formation in massive galaxies.
It allows mergers to play their key role by reducing post-merger gas inflows and, therefore, keeping
galaxy spins misaligned with cosmic filaments. It also promotes diversity amongst galaxy properties.
