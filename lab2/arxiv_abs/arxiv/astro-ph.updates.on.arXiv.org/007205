The Hubble Ultra Deep field (HUDF) is the deepest region ever observed with the Hubble Space Telescope.
With the main objective of unveiling the nature of galaxies up to $z \sim 7-8$, the observing and reduction
strategy have focused on the properties of small and unresolved objects, rather than the outskirts
of the largest objects, which are usually over-subtracted. We aim to create a new set of WFC3/IR mosaics
of the HUDF using novel techniques to preserve the properties of the low surface brightness regions.
We created ABYSS: a pipeline that optimises the estimate and modelling of low-level systematic
effects to obtain a robust background subtraction. We have improved four key points in the reduction:
1) creation of new absolute sky flat fields, 2) extended persistence models, 3) dedicated sky background
subtraction and 4) robust co-adding. The new mosaics successfully recover the low surface brightness
structure removed on the previous HUDF published reductions. The amount of light recovered with
a mean surface brightness dimmer than $\overline{\mu}=26$ mar arcsec$^{-2}$ is equivalent to
a m=19 mag source when compared to the XDF and a m=20 mag compared to the HUDF12. We present a set of techniques
to reduce ultra-deep images ($\mu>32.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, $3\sigma$ in $10\times10$ arcsec
boxes), that successfully allow to detect the low surface brightness structure of extended sources
on ultra deep surveys. The developed procedures are applicable to HST, JWST, EUCLID and many other
space and ground-based observatories. We will make the final ABYSS WFC3/IR HUDF mosaics publicly
