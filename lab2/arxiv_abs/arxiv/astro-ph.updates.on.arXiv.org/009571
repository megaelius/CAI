Faraday rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic radio sources provide information on line-of-sight
magnetic fields, including contributions from our Galaxy, source environments, and the intergalactic
medium (IGM). Looking at differences in RMs, $\Delta$RM, between adjacent sources on the sky can
help isolate these different components. In this work, we classify adjacent polarized sources
in the NVSS as random or physical pairs. We recompute and correct the uncertainties in the NVSS RM
catalog, since these were significantly overestimated. Our sample contains 317 physical and 5111
random pairs, all with Galactic latitudes $|b|\ge20^{\circ}$, polarization fractions $\ge2\%$,
and angular separations between $1.^{'},$ and $20^{'}$. We find an rms $\Delta$RM of $14.9\pm0.4\,$rad
m$^{-2}$ and $4.6\pm1.1\,$rad m$^{-2}$ for random and physical pairs, respectively. This means
polarized extragalactic sources that are close on the sky, but at different redshifts, have larger
differences in RM than two components of one source. This difference of $\sim10\,$rad m$^{-2}$
is significant at $5\sigma$, and persists in different data subsamples. While there have been other
statistical studies of $\Delta$RM between adjacent polarized sources, this is the first unambiguous
demonstration that some of this RM difference must be extragalactic, thereby providing a firm upper
limit on the RM contribution of the IGM. If the $\Delta$RMs originate local to the sources, then the
local magnetic field difference between random sources is a factor of two larger than between components
of one source. Alternatively, attributing the difference in $\Delta$RMs to the intervening IGM
yields an upper limit on the IGM magnetic field strength of $40\,$nG.
