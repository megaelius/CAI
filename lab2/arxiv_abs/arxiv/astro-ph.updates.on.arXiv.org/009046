We present Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope 610 MHz observations of 14 Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) clusters, including new data for nine. The sample includes 73\% of ACT equatorial clusters
with $M_{500} > 5 \times 10^{14}\;M_\odot$. We detect diffuse emission in three of these (27$^{+20}_{-14}$\%):
we detect a radio mini-halo in ACT-CL J0022.2$-$0036 at $z=0.8$, making it the highest-redshift
mini-halo known; we detect potential radio relic emission in ACT-CL J0014.9$-$0057 ($z=0.533$);
and we confirm the presence of a radio halo in low-mass cluster ACT-CL J0256.5+0006, with flux density
$S_{610} = 6.3\;\pm\;0.4$ mJy. We also detect residual diffuse emission in ACT-CL J0045.9$-$0152
($z=0.545$), which we cannot conclusively classify. For systems lacking diffuse radio emission,
we determine radio halo upper limits in two ways and find via survival analysis that these limits
do not significantly affect radio power scaling relations. Several clusters with no diffuse emission
detection are known or suspected mergers, based on archival X-ray and/or optical measures; given
the limited sensitivity of our observations, deeper observations of these disturbed systems are
required in order to rule out the presence of diffuse emission consistent with known scaling relations.
In parallel with our diffuse emission results, we present catalogs of individual radio sources,
including a few interesting extended sources. Our study represents the first step towards probing
the occurrence of diffuse emission in high-redshift ($z\gtrsim0.5$) clusters, and serves as a
pilot for statistical studies of larger cluster samples with the new radio telescopes available
in the pre-SKA era.
