The final performance of current and future instruments dedicated to exoplanet detection and characterization
(such as SPHERE on the European Very Large Telescope, GPI on Gemini North, or future instruments
on Extremely Large Telescopes) is limited by uncorrected quasi-static aberrations. These aberrations
create long-lived speckles in the scientific image plane, which can easily be mistaken for planets.
Common adaptive optics systems require dedicated components to perform wave-front analysis.
The ultimate wave-front measurement performance is thus limited by the unavoidable differential
aberrations between the wavefront sensor and the scientific camera. To reach the level of detectivity
required by high-contrast imaging, these differential aberrations must be estimated and compensated
for. In this paper, we characterize and experimentally validate a wave-front sensing method that
relies on focal-plane data. Our method, called COFFEE (for COronagraphic Focal-plane wave-Front
Estimation for Exoplanet detection), is based on a Bayesian approach, and it consists in an extension
of phase diversity to high-contrast imaging. It estimates the differential aberrations using
only two focal-plane coronagraphic images recorded from the scientific camera itself. In this
paper, we first present a thorough characterization of COFFEE's performance by means of numerical
simulations. This characterization is then compared with an experimental validation of COFFEE
using an in-house adaptive optics bench and an apodized Roddier & Roddier phase mask coronagraph.
An excellent match between experimental results and the theoretical study is found. Lastly, we
present a preliminary validation of COFFEE's ability to compensate for the aberrations upstream
of a coronagraph.
