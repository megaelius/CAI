Here we present the discovery of 895 s-process-rich candidates from 454,180 giant stars observed
by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) using a data-driven
approach. This sample constitutes the largest number of s-process enhanced stars ever discovered.
Our sample includes 187 s-process-rich candidates that are enhanced in both barium and strontium,
49 stars with significant barium enhancement only and 659 stars that show only a strontium enhancement.
Most of the stars in our sample are in the range of effective temperature and log g typical of red giant
branch (RGB) populations, which is consistent with our observational selection bias towards finding
RGB stars. We estimate that only a small fraction (0.5 per cent) of binary configurations are favourable
for s-process enriched stars. The majority of our s-process-rich candidates (95 per cent) show
strong carbon enhancements, whereas only five candidates (less than 3 percent) show evidence of
sodium enhancement. Our kinematic analysis reveals that 97 percent of our sample are disc stars,
with the other 3 percent showing velocities consistent with the Galactic halo. The scaleheight
of the disc is estimated to be zh=0.634kpc, comparable with values in the literature. A comparison
with the yields from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models suggests that the main neutron source
responsible for the Ba and Sr enhancements is the 13C(alpha,n)16O reaction. We conclude that the
s-process-rich candidates may have received their overabundances via mass transfer from a previous
ABG companion with an initial mass in the range 1-3Msun.
