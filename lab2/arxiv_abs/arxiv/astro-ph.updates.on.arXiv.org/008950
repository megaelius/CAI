As the closest example of a galactic nucleus, the Galactic center (GC) presents an exquisite laboratory
for learning about supermassive black holes (SMBH) and their environment. We describe several
exciting new research directions that, over the next 10 years, hold the potential to answer some
of the biggest scientific questions raised in recent decades: Is General Relativity (GR) the correct
description for supermassive black holes? What is the nature of star formation in extreme environments?
How do stars and compact objects dynamically interact with the supermassive black hole? What physical
processes drive gas accretion in low-luminosity black holes? We describe how the high sensitivity,
angular resolution, and astrometric precision offered by the next generation of large ground-based
telescopes with adaptive optics will help us answer these questions. First, it will be possible
to obtain precision measurements of stellar orbits in the Galaxy's central potential, providing
both tests of GR in the unexplored regime near a SMBH and measurements of the extended dark matter
distribution that is predicted to exist at the GC. Second, we will probe stellar populations at the
GC to significantly lower masses than are possible today, down to brown dwarfs. Their structure
and dynamics will provide an unprecedented view of the stellar cusp around the SMBH and will distinguish
between models of star formation in this extreme environment. This increase in depth will also allow
us to measure the currently unknown population of compact remnants at the GC by observing their effects
on luminous sources. Third, uncertainties on the mass of and distance to the SMBH can be improved
by a factor of $\sim$10. Finally, we can also study the near-infrared accretion onto the black hole
at unprecedented sensitivity and time resolution, which can reveal the underlying physics of black
hole accretion.
