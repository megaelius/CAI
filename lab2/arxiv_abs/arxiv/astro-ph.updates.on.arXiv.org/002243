On 2011 August 11, INTEGRAL discovered the hard X-ray source IGR J17361-4441 near the centre of the
globular cluster NGC 6388. Follow up observations with Chandra showed the position of the transient
was inconsistent with the cluster dynamical centre, and thus not related to its possible intermediate
mass black hole. The source showed a peculiar hard spectrum (Gamma \approx 0.8) and no evidence of
QPOs, pulsations, type-I bursts, or radio emission. Based on its peak luminosity, IGR J17361-4441
was classified as a very faint X-ray transient, and most likely a low-mass X-ray binary. We re-analysed
200 days of Swift/XRT observations, covering the whole outburst of IGR J17361-4441 and find a t^{-5/3}
trend evident in the light curve, and a thermal emission component that does not evolve significantly
with time. We investigate whether this source could be a tidal disruption event, and for certain
assumptions find an accretion efficiency epsilon \approx 3.5E-04 (M_{Ch}/M) consistent with
a massive white dwarf, and a disrupted minor body mass M_{mb}=1.9E+27(M/M_{Ch}) g in the terrestrial-icy
planet regime. These numbers yield an inner disc temperature of the order kT_{in} \approx 0.04 keV,
consistent with the blackbody temperature of kT_{in} \approx 0.08 keV estimated by spectral fitting.
Although the density of white dwarfs and the number of free-floating planets are uncertain, we estimate
the rate of planetary tidal disruptions in NGC 6388 to be in the range 3E-06 to 3E-04 yr^{-1}. Averaged
over the Milky Way globular clusters, the upper limit value corresponds to 0.05 yr^{-1}, consistent
with the observation of a single event by INTEGRAL and Swift.
