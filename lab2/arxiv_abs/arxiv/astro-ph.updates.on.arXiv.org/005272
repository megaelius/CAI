We evaluated the bias and variability on the fitted age and convective core overshooting parameter
for evolved binary stars accounting for observational and internal uncertainties. We considered
a binary system composed of a 2.50 $M_{\sun}$ primary star coupled with a 2.38 $M_{\sun}$ secondary
in three evolutionary stages (primary at the end of the central helium burning; at the bottom of the
RGB; and in the helium core burning). The simulations have been carried out for two values of accuracy
on the mass determination (1% and 0.1%). We found that the fitted age and overshooting efficiency
are always biased towards low values. The underestimation is relevant for a primary in the central
helium burning stage, reaching -8.5% in age and -0.04 (-25% relative error) in the overshooting
parameter $\beta$. In the other scenarios, an undervaluation of the age by about 4% occurs. A large
variability in the fitted values between simulations was found: for an individual system calibration,
the value of $\beta$ can vary from 0.0 to 0.26. For an error of 0.1% on the masses the global variability
is suppressed by a factor of two. We accounted for a systematic offset in the effective temperature
of the stars by $\pm 150$ K. For a mass error of 1% $\beta$ is largely biased towards the edges of the
explored range, while for the lower mass uncertainty it is basically unconstrained from 0.0 to 0.2.
We evaluated the possibility of individually recovering the $\beta$ value for both stars. We found
that this is impossible for a primary near to central hydrogen exhaustion, while in the other cases
the fitted $\beta$ are consistent, but always biased. Finally, the possibility to distinguish
between models computed with mild overshooting from models with no overshooting resulted in a reassuring
power of 80%. However, the scenario with a primary in the central helium burning showed a power lower
than 5%.
