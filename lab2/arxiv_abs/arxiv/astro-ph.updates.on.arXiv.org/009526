The interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is composed of a turbulent magnetized plasma. In order
to quantitatively measure relevant turbulent parameters of the ISM, a wide variety of statistical
techniques and metrics have been developed that are often tested using numerical simulations and
analytic formalism. These metrics are typically based on the Fourier power spectrum, which does
not capture the Fourier phase information that carries the morphological characteristics of images.
In this work we use density slices of magnetohydrodyanmic turbulence simulations to demonstrate
that a modern tool, convolutional neural networks, can capture significant information encoded
in the Fourier phases. We train the neural network to distinguish between two simulations with different
levels of magnetization. We find that, even given a tiny slice of simulation data, a relatively simple
network can distinguish sub-Alfv\'enic (strong magnetic field) and super-Alfv\'enic (weak magnetic
field) turbulence >98% of the time, even when all power spectral information is stripped from the
images. In order to better understand how the neural network is picking out differences betweem
the two classes of simulations we apply a neural network analysis method called "saliency maps".
The saliency map analysis shows that sharp ridge-like features are a distinguishing morphological
characteristic in such simulations. Our analysis provides a way forward for deeper understanding
of the relationship between magnetohydrodyanmic turbulence and gas morphology and motivates
further applications of neural networks for studies of turbulence. We make publicly available
all data and software needed to reproduce our results.
