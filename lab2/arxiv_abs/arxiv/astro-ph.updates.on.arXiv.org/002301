(Abridged) We study metal absorption around 854 $z\approx$2.4 star-forming galaxies taken from
the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS). The galaxies examined in this work lie in the fields of
15 hyper-luminous background QSOs, with galaxy impact parameters ranging from 35 proper kpc (pkpc)
to 2 proper Mpc (pMpc). Using the pixel optical depth technique, we present the first galaxy-centred
2-D maps of the median absorption by OVI, NV, CIV, CIII, and SIV, as well as updated results for HI.
At small galactocentric radii we detect a strong enhancement of the absorption relative to randomly
located regions that extend out to at least 180 pkpc in the transverse direction, and $\pm$240 km/s
along the line-of-sight (LOS, ~1 pMpc in the case of pure Hubble flow) for all ions except NV. For CIV
(and HI) we detect a significant enhancement of the absorption signal out to 2 pMpc in the transverse
direction, corresponding to the maximum impact parameter in our sample. After normalising the
median absorption profiles to account for variations in line strengths and detection limits, in
the transverse direction we find no evidence for a sharp drop-off in metals distinct from that of
HI. We argue instead that non-detection of some metal line species in the extended circumgalactic
medium is consistent with differences in the detection sensitivity. We also present measurements
of covering fractions and equivalent widths as a function of projected galaxy distance. Limiting
the sample to the 340 galaxies with redshifts measured from nebular emission lines does not decrease
the extent of the enhancement along the LOS compared to that in the transverse direction. This rules
out redshift errors as the source of the observed redshift-space anisotropy and thus implies that
we have detected the signature of gas peculiar velocities from infall, outflows, or virial motions
for HI, OVI, CIV, CIII, and CIV.
