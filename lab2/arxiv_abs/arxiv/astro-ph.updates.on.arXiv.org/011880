We present an empirical relation between the cold gas surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm gas}$) and
the optical extinction (${\rm A_V}$) in a sample of 103 galaxies from the Extragalactic Database
for Galaxy Evolution (EDGE) survey. This survey provides CARMA interferometric CO observations
for 126 galaxies included in the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. The matched,
spatially resolved nature of these data sets allows us to derive the $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$-${\rm A_V}$
relation on global, radial, and kpc (spaxel) scales. We determine ${\rm A_V}$ from the Balmer decrement
(H$\alpha$/H$\beta$). We find that the best fit for this relation is $\Sigma_{\rm gas} ({\rm M_\odot
pc^{-2}})\sim~26~\times~ {\rm A_V}({\rm mag})$, and that it does not depend on the spatial scale
used for the fit. However, the scatter in the fits increases as we probe smaller spatial scales, reflecting
the complex relative spatial distributions of stars, gas, and dust. We investigate the $\Sigma_{\rm
gas}$/ ${\rm A_V}$ ratio on radial and spaxel scales as a function of ${\rm EW(H\alpha)}$. We find
that at larger values of ${\rm EW(H\alpha)}$ (i.e., actively star-forming regions) this ratio
tend to converge to the value expected for dust-star mixed geometries ($\sim$ 30 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}
\,pc^{-2}\,mag^{-1}}$). On radial scales, we do not find a significant relation between the $\Sigma_{\rm
gas}$/${\rm A_V}$ ratio and the ionized gas metallicity. We contrast our estimates of $\Sigma_{\rm
gas}$ using ${\rm A_V}$ with compilations in the literature of the gas fraction on global and radial
scales as well as with well known scaling relations such as the radial star-formation law and the
$\Sigma_{\rm gas}$-$\Sigma_*$ relation. These tests show that optical extinction is a reliable
proxy for estimating $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ in the absence of direct sub/millimeter observations
of the cold gas.
