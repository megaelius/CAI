Deciphering the assembly history of the Milky Way is a formidable task, which becomes possible only
if one can produce high-resolution chrono-chemo-kinematical maps of the Galaxy. Data from large-scale
astrometric and spectroscopic surveys will soon provide us with a well-defined view of the current
chemo-kinematical structure of the Milky Way, but will only enable a blurred view on the temporal
sequence that led to the present-day Galaxy. As demonstrated by the (ongoing) exploitation of data
from the pioneering photometric missions CoRoT, Kepler, and K2, asteroseismology provides the
way forward: solar-like oscillating giants are excellent evolutionary clocks thanks to the availability
of seismic constraints on their mass and to the tight age-initial-mass relation they adhere to.
In this paper we identify five key outstanding questions relating to the formation and evolution
of the Milky Way that will need precise and accurate ages for large samples of stars to be addressed,
and we identify the requirements in terms of number of targets and the precision on the stellar properties
that are needed to tackle such questions. By quantifying the asteroseismic yields expected from
PLATO for red-giant stars, we demonstrate that these requirements are within the capabilities
of the current instrument design, provided that observations are sufficiently long to identify
the evolutionary state and allow robust and precise determination of acoustic-mode frequencies.
This will allow us to harvest data of sufficient quality to reach a 10% precision in age. This is a fundamental
pre-requisite to then reach the more ambitious goal of a similar level of accuracy, which will only
be possible if we have to hand a careful appraisal of systematic uncertainties on age deriving from
our limited understanding of stellar physics, a goal which conveniently falls within the main aims
of PLATO's core science.
