We report the discovery of shocked molecular and ionized gas resulting from jet-driven feedback
in the compact radio galaxy 4C 31.04 using near-IR imaging spectroscopy. 4C 31.04 is a $\sim 100$
pc double-lobed Compact Steep Spectrum source believed to be a very young AGN. It is hosted by a giant
elliptical with a $\sim 10^{9}~\rm M_\odot$ multi-phase gaseous circumnuclear disc. We used high
spatial resolution, adaptive optics-assisted $H$- and $K$-band integral field Gemini/NIFS observations
to probe (1) the warm ($\sim 10^3~\rm K$) molecular gas phase, traced by ro-vibrational transitions
of $\rm H_2$, and (2), the warm ionized medium, traced by the [Fe II]$_{1.644~\rm \mu m}$ line. The
[Fe II] emission traces shocked gas ejected from the disc plane by a jet-blown bubble $300-400~\rm
pc$ in diameter, whilst the $\rm H_2$ emission traces shock-excited molecular gas in the interior
$\sim 1~\rm kpc$ of the circumnuclear disc. Hydrodynamical modelling shows that the apparent discrepancy
between the extent of the shocked gas and the radio emission can occur when the brightest regions
of the synchrotron-emitting plasma are temporarily halted by dense clumps, whilst less bright
plasma can percolate through the porous ISM and form an energy-driven bubble that expands freely
out of the disc plane. This bubble is filled with low surface-brightness plasma not visible in existing
VLBI observations of 4C 31.04 due to insufficient sensitivity. Additional radial flows of jet plasma
may percolate to $\sim \rm kpc$ radii in the circumnuclear disc, driving shocks and accelerating
clouds of gas, giving rise to the $\rm H_2$ emission.
