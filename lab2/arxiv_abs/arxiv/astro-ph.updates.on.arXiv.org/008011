Our knowledge of the lower solar atmosphere is mainly obtained from spectropolarimetric observations,
which are often carried out in the red or infrared spectral range and almost always cover only a single
or a few spectral lines. Here we compare the quality of Stokes inversions of only a few spectral lines
with many-line inversions. We investigate the feasibility of spectropolarimetry in the short-wavelength
range, 3000 \AA{} - 4300 \AA{}, where the line density but also the photon noise are considerably
higher than in the red, so that many-line inversions could be particularly attractive in that wavelength
range. This is also timely because this wavelength range will be the focus of a new spectropolarimeter
in the third science flight of the balloon-borne solar observatory SUNRISE. For an ensemble of MHD
atmospheres we synthesize exemplarily spectral regions around 3140 \AA{}, 4080 \AA{}, and 6302
\AA{}. The spectral coverage is chosen such that at a spectral resolving power of 150000 the spectra
can be recorded by a 2K detector. The synthetic Stokes profiles are degraded with a typical photon
noise and afterwards inverted. The atmospheric parameters of the inversion of noisy profiles are
compared with the inversion of noise-free spectra. We find that significantly more information
can be obtained from many-line inversions than from a traditionally used inversion of only a few
spectral lines. We further find that information on the upper photosphere can be significantly
more reliably obtained at short wavelengths. In the mid and lower photosphere, the many-line approach
at 4080 \AA{} provides equally good results as the many-line approach at 6302 \AA{} for the magnetic
field strength and the LOS velocity, while the temperature determination is even more precise by
a factor of three. We conclude that many-line spectropolarimetry should be the preferred option
in the future.
