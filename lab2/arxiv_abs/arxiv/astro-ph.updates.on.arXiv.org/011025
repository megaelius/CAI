We present the first statistical analysis of exoplanet direct imaging surveys combining adaptive
optics imaging at small separations with deep seeing-limited observations at large separations
allowing us to study the entire orbital separation domain from 5 to 5000~au simultaneously. Our
sample of 344 stars includes only confirmed members of nearby young associations and is based on
all AO direct-imaging detection limits readily available online, with addition of our own previous
seeing limited surveys. Assuming that the companion distribution in mass and semi-major axis follows
a power law distribution and adding a dependence on the mass of the host star, such as $d^2n\propto
fM^{\alpha}a^{\beta} (M_\star/M_{\odot})^{\gamma}$d$ M $d$a$, we constrain the parameters
to obtained $\alpha=-0.18^{+0.77}_{-0.65}$, $\beta=-1.43^{+0.23}_{-0.24}$, and $\gamma=0.62^{+0.56}_{-0.50}$,at
a 68\% confidence level, and we obtain $f=0.11^{+0.11}_{-0.05}$, for the overall planet occurrence
rate for companions with masses between 1 to 20~\mj\ in the range 5--5000~au. Thus, we find that occurrence
of companions is negatively correlated with semi-major axis and companion mass (marginally) but
is positively correlated with the stellar host mass. Our inferred mass distribution is in good agreement
with other distributions found previously from direct imaging surveys for planets and brown dwarfs,
but is shallower as a function of mass than the distributions inferred by radial velocity surveys
of gas giants in the 1--3\,au range. This may suggest that planets at these wide and very-wide separations
represent the low-mass tail of the brown dwarfs and stellar companion distribution rather than
an extension of the distribution of the inner planets.
