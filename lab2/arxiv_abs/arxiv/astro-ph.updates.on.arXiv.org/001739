Observations of protoplanetary disks show that some characteristics seem recurrent, even in star
formation regions that are physically distant such as surface mass density profiles varying as
$r^{-1}$, or aspect ratios about 0.03 to 0.23. Accretion rates are also recurrently found around
$10^{-8} - 10^{-6}~\mathrm{M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}}$ for disks already evolved (Isella et al., 2009,
Andrews et al., 2009, 2010). Several models have been developed in order to recover these properties.
However, most of them usually simplify the disk geometry if not its mid-plane temperature. This
has major consequences for modeling the disk evolution over million years and consequently planet
migration. In the present paper, we develop a viscous evolution hydrodynamical numerical code
that determines simultaneously the disk photosphere geometry and the mid-plane temperature.
We then compare our results of long-term simulations with similar simulations of disks with a constrained
geometry along the Chiang & Goldreich (1997) prescription (dlnH/dlnr = 9/7). We find that the
constrained geometry models provide a good approximation of the disk surface density evolution.
However, they differ significantly regarding the temperature time evolution. In addition, we
find that shadowed regions naturally appear at the transition between viscously dominated and
radiation dominated regions that falls in the region of planetary formation. We show that $\chi$
(photosphere height to pressure scale height ratio) cannot be considered as a constant, consistently
with Watanabe et al. (2008). Comparisons with observations show that all disk naturally evolve
toward a shallow surface density disk ($\Sigma \propto r^{-1}$). The mass flux across the disk stabilizes
in about 1 million year typically.
