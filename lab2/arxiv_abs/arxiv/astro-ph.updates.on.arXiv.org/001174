We investigate the possibility for classical metric signature change in a straightforward generalization
of the first order formulation of gravity, dubbed "Cartan gravity". The mathematical structure
of this theory mimics the electroweak theory in that the basic ingredients are an $SO(1,4)$ Yang-Mills
gauge field $A^{ab}_{\phantom{ab}\mu}$ and a symmetry breaking Higgs field $V^{a}$, with no metric
or affine structure of spacetime presupposed. However, these structures can be recovered, with
the predictions of General Relativity exactly reproduced, whenever the Higgs field breaking the
symmetry to $SO(1,3)$ is forced to have a constant (positive) norm $V^aV_a$. This restriction is
usually imposed "by hand", but in analogy with the electroweak theory we promote the gravitational
Higgs field $V^a$ to a genuine dynamical field, subject to non-trivial equations of motion. Even
though we limit ourselves to actions polynomial in these variables, we discover a rich phenomenology.
Most notably we derive classical cosmological solutions exhibiting a smooth transition between
Euclidean and Lorentzian signature in the four-metric. These solutions are non-singular and arise
whenever the $SO(1,4)$ norm of the Higgs field changes sign i.e. the signature of the metric of spacetime
is determined dynamically by the gravitational Higgs field. It is possible to find a plethora of
such solutions and in some of them this dramatic behaviour is confined to the early universe, with
the theory asymptotically tending to Einstein gravity at late times. Curiously the theory can also
naturally embody a well-known dark energy model: Peebles-Ratra quintessence.
