Aims. The orbital structure of galaxies is strongly influenced by the accuracy of the force calculation
during orbit integration. We explore the accuracy of force calculations for two expansion methods
and determine which one is preferable for orbit integration. Methods. We specifically compare
two methods, one was introduced by Hernquist \& Ostriker (HO), which uses a spherical coordinate
system and was built specifically for the Hernquist model, and the other by Vasiliev \& Athanassoula
(CylSP) has a cylindrical coordinate system. Our comparisons include the Dehnen profile, its triaxial
extension (of which the Hernquist profile is a special case) and a multicomponent system including
a bar and disk density distributions for both analytical models and $N$-body realizations.We specifically

For the generalized Dehnen density, the CylSP method is more accurate than the HO method for nearly
all inner power-law indices and shapes at all radii. For $N$-body realizations of the Dehnen model,
or snapshots of an $N$-body simulation, the CylSP method is more accurate than the HO method in the
central region for the oblate, prolate, and triaxial Hernquist profiles if the particle number
is more than $5\times 10^5$. For snapshots of the Hernquist models with spherical shape, the HO method
is preferred. (Abridged)
