The traditional picture of post-starburst galaxies as dust- and gas-poor merger remnants, rapidly
transitioning to quiescence, has been recently challenged. Unexpected detections of a significant
ISM in many post-starbursts raise important questions. Are they truly quiescent and, if so, what
mechanisms inhibit further star formation? What processes dominate their ISM energetics? We present
an infrared spectroscopic and photometric survey of 33 SDSS-selected E+A post-starbursts, aimed
at resolving these questions. We find compact, warm dust reservoirs with high PAH abundances, and
total gas and dust masses significantly higher than expected from stellar recycling alone. Both
PAH/TIR and dust-to-burst stellar mass ratios are seen to decrease with post-burst age, indicative
of the accumulating effects of dust destruction and an incipient transition to hot, early-type
ISM properties. Their infrared spectral properties are unique, with dominant PAH emission, very
weak nebular lines, unusually strong H$_{2}$ rotational emission, and deep ${\rm [C\, II]}$ deficits.
There is substantial scatter among SFR indicators, and both PAH and TIR luminosities provide overestimates.
Even as potential upper limits, all tracers show that the SFR has typically experienced a more than
two order-of-magnitude decline since the starburst, and that the SFR is considerably lower than
expected given both their stellar masses and molecular gas densities. These results paint a coherent
picture of systems in which star formation was, indeed, rapidly truncated, but in which the ISM was
$\textit{not}$ completely expelled, and is instead supported against collapse by latent or continued
injection of turbulent or mechanical heating. The resulting aging burst populations provide a
"high-soft" radiation field which seemingly dominates the E+As' unusual ISM energetics.
