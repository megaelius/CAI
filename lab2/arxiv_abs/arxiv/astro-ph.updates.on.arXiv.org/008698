We report on our three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of cylindrical
weakly twisted flux tubes emerging from 18 Mm below the photosphere. We perform a parametric study,
by varying the initial magnetic field strength ($B_0$), radius ($R$), twist ($\alpha)$ and length
of the emerging part of the flux tube ($\lambda$) to investigate how these parameters affect the
transfer of the magnetic field from the convection zone to the photosphere. We show that the efficiency
of emergence at the photosphere (i.e. how strong the photospheric field will be in comparison to
$B_0$) depends not only on the $B_0$ but also the morphology of the emerging field and the twist. We
show that parameters such as $B_0$ and magnetic flux cannot alone determine whether a flux tube will
emerge to the solar surface. For instance, high-$B_0$ (weak-$B_0$) fields may fail (succeed) to
emerge at the photosphere, depending on their geometrical properties. We also show that the photospheric
magnetic field strength can vary greatly for flux tubes with the same $B_0$ but different geometric
properties. Moreover, in some cases we have found scaling laws, whereby the magnetic field strength
scales with the local density as $B\propto \rho^\kappa$, where $\kappa \approx 1$ deeper in the
convection zone and $\kappa <1$, close to the photosphere. The transition between the two values
occurs approximately when the local pressure scale ($H_p$) becomes comparable to the diameter
of the flux tube ($H_p\approx2R$). We derive forms to explain how and when these scaling laws appear
and compare them with the numerical simulations.
