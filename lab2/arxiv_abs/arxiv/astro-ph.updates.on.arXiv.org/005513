The Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades are well studied stellar clusters that anchor important secondary
stellar age indicators. Recent studies have shown that main sequence turn off-based ages for these
clusters may depend on the degree of rotation in the underlying stellar models. Rotation induces
structural instabilities that can enhance the chemical mixing of a star, extending its fuel supply.
In addition, rotation introduces a modulation of the star's observed magnitude and color due to
the effects of gravity darkening. We aim to investigate the extent to which stellar rotation affects
the age determination of star clusters. We utilize the MESA stellar evolution code to create models
that cover a range of rotation rates corresponding to $\Omega/\Omega_c=0.0$ to $0.6$ in $0.1$ dex
steps, allowing the assessment of variations in this dimension. The statistical analysis package,
MATCH, is employed to derive ages and metallicities by fitting our MESA models to Tycho $B_T$, $V_T$
and 2MASS $J$, $K_s$ color-magnitude diagrams. We find that the derived ages are relatively insensitive
to the effects of rotation. For the Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades, we derive ages based on synthetic
populations that model a distribution of rotation rates or a fixed rate. Across each case, derived
ages tend to agree roughly within errors, near $680$, $590$, and $110-160$ Myr for the Hyades, Praesepe,
and Pleiades, respectively. These ages are in agreement with Li depletion boundary-based ages
and previous analyses that used non-rotating isochrones. Our methods do not provide a strong constraint
on the metallicities of these clusters.
