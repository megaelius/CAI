The analysis of the surface texture from the particle (grain size, shape and internal structure)
to its organization (surface roughness) provides information on the geological processes. CRISM
multi-angular observations (varied emission angles) allow to characterize the surface scattering
behavior which depends on the composition but also the material physical properties (e.g., grain
size, shape, internal structure, the surface roughness). After an atmospheric correction by the
Multi-angle Approach for Retrieval of the Surface Reflectance from CRISM Observations, the surface
reflectances at different geometries are analyzed by inverting the Hapke photometric model depending
on the single scattering albedo, the 2-term phase function, the macroscopic roughness and the 2-term
opposition effects. Surface photometric maps are created to observe the spatial variations of
surface scattering properties as a function of geological units at the CRISM spatial resolution
(200m/pixel). An application at the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) landing sites located at Gusev
Crater and Meridiani Planum where orbital and in situ observations are available, is presented.
Complementary orbital observations (e.g. CRISM spectra, THermal EMission Imaging System, High
Resolution Imaging Science Experiment images) are used for interpreting the estimated Hapke photometric
parameters in terms of physical properties. The in situ observations are used as ground truth to
validate the interpretations. Varied scattering properties are observed inside a CRISM observation
(5x10km) suggesting that the surfaces are controlled by local geological processes (e.g. volcanic
resurfacing, aeolian and impact processes) rather than regional or global. Consistent results
with the in situ observations are observed thus validating the approach and the use of photometry
for the characterization of Martian surface physical properties.
