We present a measurement of the two-point autocorrelation function of photometrically-selected,
high-$z$ quasars over $\sim$ 100 deg$^2$ on the Sloan Digitial Sky Survey Stripe 82 field. Selection
is performed using three machine-learning algorithms, trained on known high-$z$ quasar colors,
in a six-dimensional, optical/mid-infrared color space. Optical data from the Sloan Digitial
Sky Survey is combined with overlapping deep mid-infrared data from the \emph{Spitzer} IRAC Equatorial
Survey and the \emph{Spitzer}-HETDEX Exploratory Large-area survey. The selected quasar sample
consists of 1378 objects and contains both spectroscopically-confirmed quasars and photometrically-selected
quasar candidates. These objects span a redshift range of $2.9 \leq z \leq 5.1$ and are generally
fainter than $i=20.2$; a regime which has lacked sufficient number density to perform autocorrelation
function measurements of photometrically-classified quasars. We compute the angular correlation
function of these data, marginally detecting quasar clustering. We fit a single power-law with
an index of $\delta = 1.39 \pm 0.618$ and amplitude of $\theta_0 = 0.71 \pm 0.546$ arcmin. A dark-matter
model is fit to the angular correlation function to estimate the linear bias. At the average redshift
of our survey ($\langle z \rangle = 3.38$) the bias is $b = 6.78 \pm 1.79$. Using this bias, we calculate
a characteristic dark-matter halo mass of 1.70--9.83$\times 10^{12}h^{-1} M_{\odot}$. Our bias
estimate suggests that quasar feedback intermittently shuts down the accretion of gas onto the
central super-massive black hole at early times. If confirmed, these results hint at a level of luminosity
dependence in the clustering of quasars at high-$z$.
