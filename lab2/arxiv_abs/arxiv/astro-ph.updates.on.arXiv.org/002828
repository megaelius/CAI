The structure formed by the shocked winds of a massive star and a non-accreting pulsar in a binary
system suffers periodic and random variations of orbital and non-linear dynamical origin. The
characterization of the evolution of the two-wind interaction region is necessary to understand
the non-thermal emission from radio to gamma rays. For the first time, we simulate in 3D the interaction
of isotropic stellar and relativistic pulsar winds along one full orbit, on scales well beyond the
binary size. We also investigate the impact of grid resolution and size. We carry out, with the code
PLUTO, relativistic hydrodynamical simulations in 2 and 3D of the interaction of a slow dense wind
and a mildly relativistic wind along one full orbit, up to ~100 times the binary size. The 2-dimensional
simulations are carried out with equal and larger grid resolution and size than in 3D. The simulations
in 3D confirm previous results in 2D, showing a strong shock induced by Coriolis forces that terminates
the pulsar wind in all directions, strong bending of the interaction structure against the pulsar
motion, and the generation of turbulence. The shocked flows are also subject to a faster development
of instabilities in 3D, which enhances the presence of shocks, two-wind mixing, and the disruption
of the interaction structure on large scales. In 2D, higher resolution simulations confirm lower
resolution results, and simulations with larger grid sizes strengthen the case for the loss of global
coherence of the interaction structure. Simulations in 3D confirm that the interaction of stellar
and pulsar winds yields structures that evolve non-linearly and get strongly entangled. The evolution
is accompanied by strong kinetic energy dissipation, rapid changes in flow orientation and speed,
and turbulent motion. The loss of global coherence is strongly enhanced in 3D and as the resolution
increases.
