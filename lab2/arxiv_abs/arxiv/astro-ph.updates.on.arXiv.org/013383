We study the chemical evolution of galaxy clusters by measuring the iron mass in the ICM after dissecting
the abundance profiles into different components. We use Chandra archival observations of 186
morphologically regular clusters in the redshift range [0.04, 1.07]. For each cluster we compute
the iron abundance and gas density profiles. We aim at identifying in the iron distribution a central
peak associated with the BCG, and an approximately constant plateau associated with early enrichment.
We are able to firmly identify the two components in a significant fraction of the sample, simply
relying on the fit of the abundance profile. We compute the iron mass included in the iron peak and
plateau, and the gas mass-weighted iron abundance out to $r_{500}$. While the iron plateau shows
no evolution, we find marginal decrease with redshift in the iron peak. We measure that the fraction
of iron peak mass is typically a few percent (~1%) of the total iron mass within $r_{500}$. Therefore,
since the total iron mass budget is dominated by the plateau, we find consistently that the global
gas mass-weighted iron abundance does not evolve significantly. We are also able to reproduce past
claims of evolution in the global iron abundance, which turn out to be due to the use of cluster samples
with different selection methods combined to the use of emission-weighted instead of gas mass-weighted
abundance values. Finally, while the intrinsic scatter in the iron plateau mass is consistent with
zero, the iron peak mass exhibits a large scatter, in line with the fact that the peak is produced after
the virialization of the halo and depends on the formation of the hosting cool core and the associated
feedback processes. We conclude that only a spatially-resolved approach can resolve the issue
of the ICM iron evolution, reconciling the contradictory results obtained in the last ten years.
