The search and study of close pairs of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is important in the study
of galaxy mergers which can possibly trigger active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and in the
context of their evolution into the gravitational wave emitting regime. The quasar SDSS~J1048+0055
was identified as a SMBH binary candidate based on the observed double-peaked \OIII$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007
emission lines and two distinct radio components separated by $\sim 20$~pc \citep{2004ApJ...604L..33Z}.
To ascertain the binary nature of this source, we analyzed multi-frequency, multi-epoch very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) data to investigate its pc-scale radio properties. The source
shows double components with the western feature being brighter than the eastern one. This brighter
component has a brightness temperature of $\sim 10^{10}$~K, spectral index of $\alpha = -0.09 \pm
0.09$ (flat) and is indicative of mildly relativistic beaming. In contrast, the faint component
has a lower brightness temperature of $\sim 10^{8-9}$~K and steep spectrum. These clues are consistent
with a core--jet structure, moreover, the apparent separation speed between the two components
is much higher than the expected orbital motion in a binary SMBH. Thus the present study excludes
the association of the two VLBI components with the cores of a SMBH binary, although the SMBH binary
possibility (e.g., a pair of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs) is not fully ruled out. In the single
active galactic nucleus (AGN) scenario, the double-peaked optical emission lines can originate
from the jet interacting with the narrow-line region as indicated by a change in the jet direction
at $\sim$ 140 pc.
