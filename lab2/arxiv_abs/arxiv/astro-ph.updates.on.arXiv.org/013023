Can one distinguish a binary black hole undergoing a merger from a binary neutron star if the individual
compact companions have masses that fall inside the so-called mass gap of $3-5\ M_\odot$? For neutron
stars, achieving such masses typically requires extreme compactness and in this work we present
initial data and evolutions of binary neutron stars initially in quasiequilibrium circular orbits
having a compactness $C=0.336$. These are the most compact, nonvacuum, quasiequilibrium binary
objects that have been constructed and evolved to date, including boson stars. The compactness
achieved is only slightly smaller than the maximum possible imposed by causality, $C_{\rm max}=0.355$,
which requires the sound speed to be less than the speed of light. By comparing the emitted gravitational
waveforms from the late inspiral to merger and postmerger phases between such a binary neutron star
vs a binary black hole of the same total mass we identify concrete measurements that serve to distinguish
them. With that level of compactness, the binary neutron stars exhibit no tidal disruption up until
merger, whereupon a prompt collapse is initiated even before a common core forms. Within the accuracy
of our simulations the black hole remnants from both binaries exhibit ringdown radiation that is
not distinguishable from a perturbed Kerr spacetime. However, their inspiral leads to phase differences
of the order of $\sim 5$ rad over an $\sim 81$ km separation (1.7 orbits) while typical neutron stars
exhibit phase differences of $\geq 20$ rad. Although a difference of $\sim 5$ rad can be measured
by current gravitational wave laser interferometers (e.g., aLIGO/Virgo), uncertainties in the
individual masses and spins will likely prevent distinguishing such compact, massive neutron
stars from black holes.
