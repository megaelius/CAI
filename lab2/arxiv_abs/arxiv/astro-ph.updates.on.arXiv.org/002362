Detached shells are believed to be created during a thermal pulse, and constrain the time scales
and physical properties of one of the main drivers of late stellar evolution. We aim at determining
the morphology of the detached dust shells around the carbon AGB stars R Scl and V644 Sco, and compare
this to observations of the detached gas shells. We observe the polarised, dust-scattered stellar
light around these stars using the PolCor instrument mounted on the ESO 3.6m telescope. Observations
were done with a coronographic mask to block out the direct stellar light. The polarised images clearly
show the detached shells. Using a dust radiative transfer code to model the dust-scattered polarised
light, we constrain the radii and widths of the shells to 19.5 arcsec and 9.4 arcsec for the detached
dust shells around R Scl and V644 Sco, respectively. Both shells have an overall spherical symmetry
and widths of approx. 2 arcsec. For R Scl we can compare the observed dust emission directly with high
spatial-resolution maps of CO(3-2) emission from the shell observed with ALMA. We find that the
dust and gas coincide almost exactly, indicating a common evolution. The data presented here for
R Scl are the most detailed observations of the entire dusty detached shell to date. For V644 Sco these
are the first direct measurements of the detached shell. Also here we find that the dust most likely
coincides with the gas shell. The observations are consistent with a scenario where the detached
shells are created during a thermal pulse. The determined radii and widths will constrain hydrodynamical
models describing the pre-pulse mass loss, the thermal pulse, and post-pulse evolution of the star.
