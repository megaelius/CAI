The stellar mass in the halo of the Milky Way is notoriously difficult to determine, owing to the paucity
of its stars in the solar neighbourhood. With tentative evidence from $\it{Gaia}$ that the nearby
stellar halo is dominated by a massive accretion event -- referred to as $\it{Gaia-Enceladus}$
or Sausage -- these constraints are now increasingly urgent. We measure the mass in kinematically
selected mono-abundance populations (MAPs) of the stellar halo between $-3 <$ [Fe/H] $< -1$ and
$0.0 <$ [Mg/Fe] $< 0.4$ using red giant star counts from APOGEE DR14. We find that MAPs are well fit
by single power laws on triaxial ellipsoidal surfaces, and we show that that the power law slope $\alpha$
changes such that high $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]}$ populations have $\alpha \sim 4$, whereas low [Mg/Fe]
MAPs are more extended with shallow slopes, $\alpha \sim 2$. We estimate the total stellar mass to
be $M_{*,\mathrm{tot}} = 1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times10^{9}\ \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, of which we
estimate $\sim 0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \times 10^{9} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ to be accreted. We estimate
that the mass of accreted stars with $e > 0.7$ is $M_{*,\mathrm{accreted},e>0.7} = 3 \pm 1\ \mathrm{(stat.)}\pm
1\ \mathrm{(syst.)}\times10^{8}\ \mathrm{M_\odot}$, or $\sim 30-50\%$ of the accreted halo
mass. If the majority of these stars $\it{are}$ the progeny of a massive accreted dwarf, this places
an upper limit on its stellar mass, and implies a halo mass for the progenitor of $\sim 10^{10.2\pm0.2}\
\mathrm{M_\odot}$. This constraint not only shows that the $\it{Gaia-Enceladus}$/Sausage progenitor
may not be as massive as originally suggested, but that the majority of the Milky Way stellar halo
was accreted. These measurements are an important step towards fully reconstructing the assembly
history of the Milky Way.
