We analyse the electron--energy and angular distribution of the neutron beta decay with polarized
neutron and electron and unpolarized proton, calculated in Phys. Rev. C 95, 055502 (2017) within
the Standard Model (SM), by taking into account the contributions of interactions beyond the SM.
After the absorption of vector and axial vector contributions by the axial coupling constant and
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element (Bhattacharya et al., Phys. Rev. D 85, 054512
(2012) and so on) these are the contributions of scalar and tensor interactions only. The neutron
lifetime, correlation coefficients and their averaged values, and asymmetries of the neutron
beta decay with polarized neutron and electron are adapted to the analysis of experimental data
on searches of contributions of interactions beyond the SM. Using the obtained results we propose
some estimates of the values of the scalar and tensor coupling constants of interactions beyond
the SM. We use the estimate of the Fierz interference term "b_F = - 0.0028 +/- 0.0026" by Hardy and Towner
(Phys. Rev. C 91, 025501 (2015)), the neutron lifetime "tau_n = 880.2(1.0)s"(Particle Data Group,
Chin. Phys. C 40, 100001 (2016)) and the experimental data "N_{\exp} = 0.067 +/- 0.011_{\rm stat.}
+/- 0.004_{\rm syst.}" for the averaged value of the correlation coefficient of the neutron-electron
spin-spin correlations, measured by Kozela et al. (Phys. Ref. C 85, 045501 (2012)). The contributions
of G-odd correlations are calculated and found at the level of 10^{-5} in agreement with the results
obtained by Gardner and Plaster (Phys. Rev. C 87, 065504 (2013)).
