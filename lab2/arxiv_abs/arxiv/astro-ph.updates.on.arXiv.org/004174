Light bridges (LBs) are elongated structures with enhanced intensity embedded in sunspot umbra
and pores. We studied the properties of a sample of 60 LBs observed with the Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS). Using IRIS near- and far-ultraviolet spectra, we measured the line intensity,
width, and Doppler shift; followed traces of LBs in the chromosphere and transition region (TR);
and compared LB parameters with umbra and quiet Sun. There is a systematic emission enhancement
in LBs compared to nearby umbra from the photosphere up to the TR. Light bridges are systematically
displaced toward the solar limb at higher layers: the amount of the displacement at one solar radius
compares well with the typical height of the chromosphere and TR. The intensity of the LB sample compared
to the umbra sample peaks at the middle/upper chromosphere where they are almost permanently bright.
Spectral lines emerging from the LBs are broader than the nearby umbra. The systematic redshift
of the Si IV line in the LB sample is reduced compared to the quiet Sun sample. We found a significant
correlation between the line width of ions arising at temperatures from 3x10^4 to 1.5x10^5 K as there
is also a strong spatial correlation among the line and continuum intensities. In addition, the
intensity-line width relation holds for all spectral lines in this study. The correlations indicate
that the cool and hot plasma in LBs are coupled. Light bridges comprise multi-temperature and multi-disciplinary
structures extending up to the TR. Diverse heating sources supply the energy and momentum to different
layers, resulting in distinct dynamics in the photosphere, chromosphere, and TR.
