Measuring the temperature and abundance patterns of clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM) provides
an observational basis for models of the physical conditions within the clouds, which play an important
role in studies of star and planet formation. The Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph
(CHESS) is a far ultraviolet rocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular
transitions within diffuse molecular and translucent cloud regions. The final two flights of the
instrument observed $\beta^{1}$ Scorpii ($\beta$ Sco) and $\gamma$ Arae. We present flight results
of interstellar molecular hydrogen (H$_{\rm 2}$) excitation on the sightlines, including measurements
of the column densities and temperatures. These results are compared to previous values that were
measured using the damping wings of low J$^{\prime \prime}$ H$_{\rm 2}$ absorption features (Savage
et al. 1977). For $\beta$ Sco, we find that the derived column density of the J$^{\prime \prime}$
= 1 rotational level differs by a factor of 2-3 when compared to the previous observations. We discuss
the discrepancies between the two measurements and show that the source of the difference is due
to the opacity of higher rotational levels contributing to the J$^{\prime \prime}$ = 1 absorption
wing, increasing the inferred column density in the previous work. We extend this analysis to 9 $Copernicus$
and 13 $FUSE$ spectra to explore the interdependence of the column densities of different rotational
levels and how the H$_{\rm 2}$ kinetic temperature is influenced by these relationships. We find
a revised average gas kinetic temperature of the diffuse molecular ISM of T$_{01}$ = 68 $\pm$ 13 K,
12% lower than the value found previously.
