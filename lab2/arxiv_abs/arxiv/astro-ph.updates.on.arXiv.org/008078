We present a tomographic cosmic shear analysis of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) combined with the
VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING). This is the first time that a full optical to
near-infrared data set has been used for a wide-field cosmological weak lensing experiment. This
unprecedented data, spanning $450~$deg$^2$, allows us to improve significantly the estimation
of photometric redshifts, such that we are able to include robustly higher-redshift sources for
the lensing measurement, and - most importantly - solidify our knowledge of the redshift distributions
of the sources. Based on a flat $\Lambda$CDM model we find $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3}=0.737_{-0.036}^{+0.040}$ in a blind analysis from cosmic shear alone. The tension between
KiDS cosmic shear and the Planck-Legacy CMB measurements remains in this systematically more robust
analysis, with $S_8$ differing by $2.3\sigma$. This result is insensitive to changes in the priors
on nuisance parameters for intrinsic alignment, baryon feedback, and neutrino mass. KiDS shear
measurements are calibrated with a new, more realistic set of image simulations and no significant
B-modes are detected in the survey, indicating that systematic errors are under control. When calibrating
our redshift distributions by assuming the 30-band COSMOS-2015 photometric redshifts are correct
(following the Dark Energy Survey and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey), we find the tension with Planck
is alleviated. The COSMOS-2015-calibrated KiDS redshift distributions are however discrepant
with the results from our extensive spectroscopic calibration sample and the distributions recovered
using angular clustering measurements, which we deem more reliable. The robust determination
of source redshift distributions remains one of the most challenging aspects for future cosmic
shear surveys.
