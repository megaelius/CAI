Optical and near-infrared Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs, are low-temperature
detectors with inherent spectral resolution that are able to instantly register individual photons
with potentially no false counts or readout noise. These properties make MKIDs transformative
for exoplanet direct imaging by enabling photon-statistics-based planet-discrimination techniques
as well as performing conventional noise-subtraction techniques on shorter timescales. These
detectors are in the process of rapid development, and as such, the full extent of their performance
enhancing potential has not yet be quantified. MKID Exoplanet Direct Imaging Simulator, or MEDIS,
is a general-purpose end-to-end numerical simulator for high-contrast observations with MKIDs.
The simulator exploits current optical propagation libraries and augments them with a new MKIDs
simulation module to provide a pragmatic model of many of the degradation effects present during
the detection process. We use MEDIS to demonstrate how changes in various MKID properties affect
the contrast-separation performance when conventional differential imaging techniques are
applied to low-flux, short duration observations. We show that to improve performance at close
separations will require increasing the maximum count rate or pixel sampling when there is high
residual flux after the coronagraph. We predict that taking pixel yield from the value achieved
by current instruments of 80% and increasing it to 100% would result in an improvement in contrast
of a factor of $\sim$ 4 at 3$\lambda/D$ and $\sim$ 8 at 6$\lambda/D$. Achieving better contrast performance
in this low flux regime would then require exploiting the information encoded in the photon arrival
time statistics.
