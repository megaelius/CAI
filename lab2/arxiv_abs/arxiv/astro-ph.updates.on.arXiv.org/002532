Using numerical hydrodynamics simulations we studied the gravitational collapse of pre-stellar
cores of sub-solar mass embedded into a low-density external environment. Four models with different
magnitude and direction of rotation of the external environment with respect to the central core
were studied and compared with an isolated model. We found that the infall of matter from the external
environment can significantly alter the disk properties as compared to those seen in the isolated
model. Depending on the magnitude and direction of rotation of the external environment, a variety
of disks can form including compact (<= 200 AU) ones shrinking in size due to infall of external
matter with low angular momentum, as well as extended disks forming due to infall of external matter
with high angular momentum. The former are usually stable against gravitational fragmentation,
while the latter are prone to fragmentation and formation of stellar systems with sub-stellar/very-low-mass
companions. In the case of counterrotating external environment, very compact (< 5 AU) and short-lived
(<= a few * 10^5 yr) disks can form when infalling material has low angular momentum. The most interesting
case is found for the infall of counterrotating external material with high angular momentum, leading
to the formation of counterrotating inner and outer disks separated by a deep gap at a few tens AU.
The gap migrates inward due to accretion of the inner disk onto the protostar, turns into a central
hole, and finally disappears giving way to the outer strongly gravitationally unstable disk. This
model may lead to the emergence of a transient stellar system with sub-stellar/very-low-mass components
counterrotating with respect to that of the star.
