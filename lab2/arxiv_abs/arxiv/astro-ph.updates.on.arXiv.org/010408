We study the resonance line emission from the rotating plane optically thick accretion disc, consisting
of free electrons and resonant atoms. We use the standard assumption that the source of continuum
radiation is located near central plane of the accretion disc, where the temperature is the highest.
This corresponds to the Milne problem consideration for continuum. We shortly discuss the impossibility
of the Milne problem for the resonance radiation. We assume that the resonant atoms are located in
a thin layer of an accretion disc near the surface. In this case the resonance line emission arises
due to scattering of a continuum on the resonant atoms. In thin layer we can neglect the multiple scattering
of the resonance radiation on the resonant atoms. We consider the axially symmetric problems, where
the Stokes parameter U =0. We take into account the Doppler effect for the frequencies of the resonance
line. The three types of the resonant atom sources are considered (see Figs.1-3). The first source
is the axially symmetric continuous distribution of the resonant atoms along the circular orbit.
The second spot-like source rotates in the orbit. The third type presents two spot-like sources
located in the orbit contrary one to another. In the first and third cases the shape of the emitting
resonance line is symmetric, i.e. the right and left wings have the similar shapes. In the second
case the resonance line has asymmetric shape. The shape of the emerging line depends significantly
on the ratio of the rotation velocity value to the velocity, characterizing the Doppler width. It
also depends on the ratio of the electron number density to the number density of resonant atoms.
The results of the calculations characterize the different observational effects of H$\alpha$
radiation in the accretion discs and can be used for estimations of the parameters mentioned above.
