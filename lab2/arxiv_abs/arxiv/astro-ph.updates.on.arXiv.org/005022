We present two-dimensional stellar and gaseous kinematics of the inner 0.7 $\times$ 1.2 kpc$^{2}$
of the Seyfert galaxy ESO 362-G18, derived from optical spectra obtained with the GMOS/IFU on the
Gemini South telescope at a spatial resolution of $\approx$170 pc and spectral resolution of 36
km s$^{-1}$. ESO 362-G18 is a strongly perturbed galaxy of morphological type Sa or S0/a, with a minor
merger approaching along the NE direction. Previous studies have shown that the [O\,{\sc iii}]
emission shows a fan-shaped extension of $\approx$ 10\arcsec\ to the SE. We detect the [O\,{\sc
iii}] doublet, [N\,{\sc ii}] and H${\alpha}$ emission lines throughout our field of view. The stellar
kinematics is dominated by circular motions in the galaxy plane, with a kinematic position angle
of $\approx$137$^{\circ}$. The gas kinematics is also dominated by rotation, with kinematic position
angles ranging from 122$^{\circ}$ to 139$^{\circ}$. A double-Gaussian fit to the [O\,{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007
and H${\alpha}$ lines, which have the highest signal to noise ratios of the emission lines, reveal
two kinematic components: (1) a component at lower radial velocities which we interpret as gas rotating
in the galactic disk; and (2) a component with line of sight velocities 100--250 km s$^{-1}$ higher
than the systemic velocity, interpreted as originating in the outflowing gas within the AGN ionization
cone. We estimate a mass outflow rate of 7.4 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the SE ionization
cone (this rate doubles if we assume a biconical configuration), and a mass accretion rate on the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) of 2.2 $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The total ionized
gas mass within $\sim$84 pc of the nucleus is 3.3 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$; infall velocities
of $\sim$34 km s$^{-1}$ in this gas would be required to feed both the outflow and SMBH accretion.
