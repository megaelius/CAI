We present the VIMOS Spectroscopic Survey of a Supercluster in the COSMOS field (VIS3COS) at z~0.84.
We use VIMOS high-resolution spectra (GG475 filter) to spectroscopically select 490 galaxies
in and around the super-structure and an additional 481 galaxies in the line of sight. We present
the redshift distribution, the catalog to be made public and the first results on the properties
of individual galaxies and stacked spectra (3500{\AA}<\lambda<4200{\AA} rest-frame). We probe
a wide range of densities and environments (from low-density field to clusters and rich groups).
We find a decrease in the median star formation rate from low to high density environments in all bins
of stellar mass and a sharp rise of the quenched fraction (from ~10% to ~40-60%) of intermediate stellar
mass galaxies $(10<\log_{10}\left(M_\star/\mathrm{M_\odot}\right)<10.75)$ from filaments
to clusters. The quenched fraction for massive galaxies shows little dependence on the environment
being constant at ~30-40%. We find a break in the strength of the [OII] emission, with nearly constant
line equivalent widths at lower densities (~-11{\AA}) and then a drop to ~-2.5{\AA} towards higher
densities. The break in the [OII] line strength happens at similar densities ($\log_{10}(1+\delta)\sim0.0-0.5$)
as the observed rise in the quenched fraction. Our results may provide further clues regarding the
different environmental processes affecting galaxies with different stellar masses and highlight
the advantages of a single dataset in the COSMOS field probing a wide range of stellar masses and environments.
We hypothesize that quenching mechanisms are enhanced in high-density regions.
