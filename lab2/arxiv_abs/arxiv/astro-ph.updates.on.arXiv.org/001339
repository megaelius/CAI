Using robotic telescopes of the Universitatssternwarte Bochum near Cerro Armazones in Chile,
we monitored the z=0.0377 Seyfert 1 galaxy WPVS48 (2MASX J09594263-3112581) in the optical (B and
R) and near-infrared (NIR, J and Ks) with a cadence of two days. The light curves show unprecedented
variability details. The NIR variation features of WPVS48 are consistent with the corresponding
optical variations, but the features appear sharper in the NIR than in the optical, suggesting that
the optical photons undergo multiple scatterings. The J and Ks emission, tracing the hot (1600 K)
dust echo, lags the B and R variations by on average 64 +/- 4 days and 71 +/- 5 days, respectively (restframe).
WPVS48 lies on the known tau-M_V relationship. However, the observed lag is about three times shorter
than expected from the dust sublimation radius r_sub inferred from the optical-UV luminosity,
and explanations for this common discrepancy are searched for. The sharp NIR echos argue for a face-on
torus geometry and allow us to put forward two potential scenarios: 1) as previously proposed, in
the equatorial plane of the accretion disk the inner region of the torus is flattened and may come
closer to the accretion disk. 2) The dust torus with inner radius r_sub is geometrically and optically
thick, so that the observer only sees the facing rim of the torus wall, which lies closer to the observer
than the torus equatorial plane and therefore leads to an observed foreshortened lag. Both scenarios
are able to explain the factor three discrepancy between tau and r_sub. Longer-wavelength dust
reverberation data might enable one to distinguish between the scenarios.
