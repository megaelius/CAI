Surveys in the next decade will deliver large samples of galaxy clusters that transform our understanding
of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and cosmology studies will become systematics limited
with samples of this magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters
provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this is only realized
if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way. Here we introduce the \textsc{Mock-X}
analysis framework, a multiwavelength tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological
simulations and derives halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating
optical, Compton-$y$ and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image analysis method, we
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring hydrostatic mass bias for the IllustrisTNG,
BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations. Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant
bias $b\approx0.13$ with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or subgrid physics.
However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic observations is mass-dependent, increasing
to $b=0.3$ for the most massive clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum
produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure equilibrium. The spectroscopic
temperature and mass estimate are biased low by cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic
density dependence. The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical
method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current observations and future surveys
will contain sufficient samples of massive clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic
bias.
