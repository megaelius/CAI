Planck has produced detailed all-sky observations over nine frequency bands between 30 and 857
GHz. These observations allow robust reconstruction of the primordial cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature fluctuations over nearly the full sky, as well as new constraints on Galactic
foregrounds. This paper describes the component separation framework adopted by Planck. We test
four foreground-cleaned CMB maps derived using qualitatively different component separation
algorithms. The quality of our reconstructions is evaluated through detailed simulations and
internal comparisons, and shown through various tests to be internally consistent and robust for
CMB power spectrum and cosmological parameter estimation up to l = 2000. The parameter constraints
on LambdaCDM cosmologies derived from these maps are consistent with those presented in the cross-spectrum
based Planck likelihood analysis. We choose two of the CMB maps for specific scientific goals. We
also present maps and frequency spectra of the Galactic low-frequency, CO, and thermal dust emission.
The component maps are found to provide a faithful representation of the sky, as evaluated by simulations.
For the low-frequency component, the spectral index varies widely over the sky, ranging from about
beta = -4 to -2. Considering both morphology and prior knowledge of the low frequency components,
the index map allows us to associate a steep spectral index (beta < -3.2) with strong anomalous
microwave emission, corresponding to a spinning dust spectrum peaking below 20 GHz, a flat index
of beta > -2.3 with strong free-free emission, and intermediate values with synchrotron emission.
