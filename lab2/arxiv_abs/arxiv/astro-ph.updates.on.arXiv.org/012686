The evolution of galaxies through cosmic time is studied observationally by means of extragalactic
surveys. The OTELO survey aims to provide the deepest narrow-band survey to date in terms of minimum
detectable flux and emission line equivalent width in order to detect the faintest extragalactic
emission line systems. In this way, OTELO data will complements other broad-band, narrow-band,
and spectroscopic surveys. The red tunable filter of the OSIRIS instrument on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio
Canarias (GTC) is used to scan a spectral window centred at $9175 \AA$, which is free from strong sky
emission lines, with a sampling interval of $6 \AA$ and a bandwidth of $12 \AA$ in the most deeply explored
Extended Groth Strip region. Careful data reduction using improved techniques for sky ring subtraction,
accurate astrometry, photometric calibration, and source extraction enables us to compile the
OTELO catalogue. This catalogue is complemented with ancillary data ranging from deep X-ray to
far-infrared, including high resolution HST images, which allow us to segregate the different
types of targets, derive precise photometric redshifts, and obtain the morphological classification
of the extragalactic objects detected. The OTELO multi-wavelength catalogue contains 11237 entries
and is 50\% complete at AB magnitude 26.38. Of these sources, 6600 have photometric redshifts with
an uncertainty $z_{phot}$ better than $0.2 (1+z_{phot})$. A total of 4336 of these sources correspond
to preliminary emission line candidates, which are complemented by 81 candidate stars and 483 sources
that qualify as absorption line systems. The OTELO survey products were released to the public on
2019.
