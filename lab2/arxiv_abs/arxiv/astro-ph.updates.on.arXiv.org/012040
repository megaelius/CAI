We present the first-ever measurements of the surface colors and rotational properties of a recently
discovered distant object in an unusual orbit 2016 ND21. In 2017, this object was close to its perihelion,
which allowed us to observe it with a 2.0-m telescope at the Peak Terskol observatory. Broadband
photometric observations of 2016 ND21 were carried out in October and December of 2017 in standard
BVR filters of the Johnson-Cousins photometric system. During our observations, we did not detect
any cometary activity. We found the rotational period of 17.53{\pm}0.02 hr, while another a little
longer value of 17.65{\pm}0.02 hr is also possible. Assuming an equatorial aspect of observations,
a peak-to-peak amplitude of A = 0.31{\pm}0.05 mag (or even higher since only one maximum and one minimum
were well-measured) corresponds to an elongated body with an axis ratio a/b ~1.3. The lightcurve
behavior indicates a complex, possibly non-convex, shape of this object. The visible absolute
magnitude is HV =12.4{\pm}0.1 mag, which was estimated by using the linear phase slope 0.04 mag/deg
as the most probable value from our observations. Assuming a surface albedo in the range of 0.04-0.10,
the size of 2016 ND21 should be about 15-23 km. From our multi-color observations, we determined
surface colors V-R = 0.69{\pm}0.04 mag, B-R = 1.79{\pm}0.08 mag, and B-V = 1.10{\pm}0.08 mag. The
measured colors indicate an extremely red surface of this object. A very red surface is unusual for
comets, which is in agreement with the fact, that no cometary activity was detected for 2016 ND21.
The B-R color is higher than the typical B-R colors of the red D-type asteroids, but it is consistent
with colors of the red Centaurs and TNOs classified as RR type in TNOs classification. This result
gives a first evidence of a possible outer belt origin of this small body.
