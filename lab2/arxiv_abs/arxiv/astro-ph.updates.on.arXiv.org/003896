In the last decade, astronomers have found a new type of supernova called `superluminous supernovae'
(SLSNe) due to their high peak luminosity and long light-curves. These hydrogen-free explosions
(SLSNe-I) can be seen to z~4 and therefore, offer the possibility of probing the distant Universe.
We aim to investigate the possibility of detecting SLSNe-I using ESA's Euclid satellite, scheduled
for launch in 2020. In particular, we study the Euclid Deep Survey (EDS) which will provide a unique
combination of area, depth and cadence over the mission. We estimated the redshift distribution
of Euclid SLSNe-I using the latest information on their rates and spectral energy distribution,
as well as known Euclid instrument and survey parameters, including the cadence and depth of the
EDS. We also applied a standardization method to the peak magnitudes to create a simulated Hubble
diagram to explore possible cosmological constraints. We show that Euclid should detect approximately
140 high-quality SLSNe-I to z ~ 3.5 over the first five years of the mission (with an additional 70
if we lower our photometric classification criteria). This sample could revolutionize the study
of SLSNe-I at z>1 and open up their use as probes of star-formation rates, galaxy populations, the
interstellar and intergalactic medium. In addition, a sample of such SLSNe-I could improve constraints
on a time-dependent dark energy equation-of-state, namely w(a), when combined with local SLSNe-I
and the expected SN Ia sample from the Dark Energy Survey. We show that Euclid will observe hundreds
of SLSNe-I for free. These luminous transients will be in the Euclid data-stream and we should prepare
now to identify them as they offer a new probe of the high-redshift Universe for both astrophysics
and cosmology.
