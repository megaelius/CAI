We study the relativistic accretion flow around a generic stationary axisymmetric space-time
and obtain an effective potential ($\Phi^{\rm eff}$) that accurately mimics the general relativistic
features of Kerr black hole having spin $0\le a_k <1$. Considering the accretion disc confined around
the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole and using the relativistic equation of state, we examine
the properties of the relativistic accretion flow and compare it with the same obtained form semi-relativistic
as well as non-relativistic accretion flows. Towards this, we first investigate the transonic
properties of the accretion flow around the rotating black hole where good agreement is observed
for relativistic and semi-relativistic flows. Further, we study the non-linearities such as shock
waves in accretion flow. Here also we find that the shock properties are in agreement for both relativistic
and semi-relativistic flows irrespective of the black hole spin ($a_k$), although it deviates
significantly for non-relativistic flow. In fact, when the particular shocked solutions are compared
for flows with identical outer boundary conditions, the positions of shock transition in relativistic
and semi-relativistic flows agree well with deviation of $6-12\%$ for $0 \le a_k \le 0.99$, but vast
disagreement is observed for non-relativistic flow. In addition, we compare the parameter space
for shock to establish the fact that relativistic as well as semi-relativistic accretion flow dynamics
do show close agreement irrespective of $a_k$ values, whereas non-relativistic flow fails to do
so. With these findings, we point out that semi-relativistic flow including $\Phi^{\rm eff}$ satisfactorily
mimics the relativistic accretion flows around Kerr black hole. Finally, we discuss the possible
implications of this work in the context of dissipative advective accretion flow around Kerr black
holes.
