A very large dynamic range with simultaneous capture of both large- and small-scales in the simulations
of cosmic structures is required for correct modelling of many cosmological phenomena, particularly
at high redshift. This is not always available, or when it is, it makes such simulations very expensive.
We present a novel sub-grid method for modelling low-mass ($10^5\,M_\odot\leq M_{\rm halo}\leq
10^9\,M_\odot$) haloes, which are otherwise unresolved in large-volume cosmological simulations
limited in numerical resolution. In addition to the deterministic halo bias that captures the average
property, we model its stochasticity that is correlated in time. We find that the instantaneous
binned distribution of the number of haloes is well approximated by a log-normal distribution,
with overall amplitude modulated by this "temporal correlation bias". The robustness of our new
scheme is tested against various statistical measures, and we find that temporally correlated
stochasticity generates mock halo data that is significantly more reliable than that from temporally
uncorrelated stochasticity. Our method can be applied for simulating processes that depend on
both the small- and large-scale structures, especially for those that are sensitive to the evolution
history of structure formation such as the process of cosmic reionization. As a sample application,
we generate a mock distribution of medium-mass ($ 10^{8} \leq M/M_{\odot} \leq 10^{9}$) haloes
inside a 500 Mpc$\,h^{-1}$, $300^3$ grid simulation box. This mock halo catalogue bears a reasonable
statistical agreement with a halo catalogue from numerically-resolved haloes in a smaller box,
and therefore will allow a very self-consistent sets of cosmic reionization simulations in a box
large enough to generate statistically reliable data.
