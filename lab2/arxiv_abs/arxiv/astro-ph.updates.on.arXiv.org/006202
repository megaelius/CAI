We present a comprehensive evolutionary model of the Sun's protoplanetary disk. The model predicts
from first principles the gas densities and temperatures, and abundances of calcium-rich, aluminum-rich
inclusions (CAIs) and refractory lithophile elements (Ca, Al, Ti, etc.). A central assumption
is that Jupiter's core formed early ($< 1$ Myr) at 3 AU, opening a gap and creating a pressure maximum
beyond it in which CAIs were trapped, thereby resolving the "CAI Storage Problem" of meteoritics.
Carbonaceous chondrites formed in this pressure trap, while ordinary and enstatite chondrites
formed from material inside Jupiter depleted in CAIs by aerodynamic drag. We match the model outputs
at different times and locations to each of 11 chondrites, 5 achondrites, and the embryos of Earth
and Mars, finding excellent agreement with known meteoritic constraints, and making specific,
testable predictions where constraints are lacking. We predict the embryos of the terrestrial
planets formed rapidly, in $< 2$ Myr, and that dynamical scattering of asteroids was limited. We
predict CI chondrites are depleted in refractory elements relative to the Sun, by about 9\% (0.04
dex). The model demands low levels of turbulence ($\alpha \sim 10^{-4}$) inside 1 AU, falling to
lower levels ($\sim 10^{-5}$) beyond 10 AU, suggesting angular momentum transport was dominated
by hydrodynamical instabilities augmented by magnetic disk winds, and not by the magnetorotational
instability. By 4 Myr, gas had vanished interior to Jupiter, but persisted beyond Jupiter, so that
the solar nebula was a transition disk. The model demonstrates the power of meteoritic data to constrain
astrophysical disk processes.
