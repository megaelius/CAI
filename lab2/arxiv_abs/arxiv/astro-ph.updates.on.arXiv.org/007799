The compact radio source Sagittarius~A$^*$ (Sgr~A$^*$)in the Galactic Center is the primary supermassive
black hole candidate. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of the
accretion flow around Sgr\,A$^*$ predict the presence of sub-structure at observing wavelengths
of $\sim 3$\,mm and below (frequencies of 86\,GHz and above). For very long baseline interferometry
(VLBI) observations of Sgr\,A$^*$ at this frequency the blurring effect of interstellar scattering
becomes subdominant, and arrays such as the High Sensitivity Array (HSA) and the global mm-VLBI
Array (GMVA) are now capable of resolving potential sub-structure in the source. Such investigations
improve our understanding of the emission geometry of the mm-wave emission of Sgr\,A$^*$, which
is crucial for constraining theoretical models and for providing a background to interpret 1\,mm
VLBI data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We performed high-sensitivity very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) observations of Sgr\,A$^*$ at 3\,mm using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
and the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in Mexico on two consecutive days in May 2015, with the second
epoch including the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We find an overall source geometry that matches
previous findings very closely, showing a deviation in fitted model parameters less than 3\% over
a time scale of weeks and suggesting a highly stable global source geometry over time. The reported
sub-structure in the 3\,mm emission of Sgr\,A$^*$ is consistent with theoretical expectations
of refractive noise on long baselines. However, comparing our findings with recent results from
1\,mm and 7\,mm VLBI observations, which also show evidence for east-west asymmetry, an intrinsic
origin cannot be excluded. Confirmation of persistent intrinsic substructure will require further
VLBI observations spread out over multiple epochs.
