In the course of the selection of the scientific themes of the second and third L-class missions of
the Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 program of the European Space Agency, the exploration of the ice giant
planets Uranus and Neptune was defined "a timely milestone, fully appropriate for an L class mission".
Among the proposed scientific themes, in the white paper "The ODINUS Mission Concept" we discussed
the scientific case of exploring both planets and their satellites in the framework of a single L-class
mission and proposed a mission scenario that could allow to achieve this result. In this work we present
an updated and more complete discussion of the scientific rationale for a comparative exploration
of the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune and of their satellite systems. The first goal of comparatively
studying these two similar yet extremely different systems is to shed new light on the ancient past
of the Solar System and on the processes that shaped its formation and evolution. This, in turn, would
reveal whether the Solar System and the very diverse extrasolar systems discovered so far all share
a common origin or if different environments and mechanisms were responsible for their formation.
A space mission to the ice giants would also open up the possibility to use Uranus and Neptune as templates
in the study of one of the most abundant type of extrasolar planets in the galaxy. Finally, such a mission
would allow a detailed study of the interplanetary and gravitational environments at a range of
distances from the Sun poorly covered by direct exploration, improving the constraints on the fundamental
theories of gravitation and on the behaviour of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field.
