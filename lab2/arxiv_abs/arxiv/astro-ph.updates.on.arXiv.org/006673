We undertake a critical and comprehensive comparison of the radial velocities and the main stellar
atmospheric parameters for stars in common between the latest data releases from the APOGEE and
the LAMOST surveys. There is a total of 42,420 dwarfs/giants stars in common between the APOGEE DR14
- LAMOST DR3 stellar catalogs. A comparison between the RVs shows an offset of 4.54 $\pm$ 0.03 km/s,
with a dispersion of 5.8 km/s, in the sense that APOGEE RVs are larger. We observe a small offset in
the Teff of about 13 K, with a scatter of 155 K. Small offset in [Fe/H] of about 0.06 dex together with
a scatter of 0.13 dex is also observed. We notice that the largest offset between the surveys occurs
in the surface gravities. Using only surface gravities in calibrated red giants from APOGEE DR14,
where there are 24,074 stars in common, a deviation of 0.14 dex is found with substantial scatter.
There are 17,482 red giant stars in common between APOGEE DR14 and those in LAMOST tied to APOGEE DR12
via the Cannon. There is generally good agreement between the two data-sets. However, we find dependencies
of the differences of the stellar parameters on effective temperature. For metal-rich stars, a
different trend for the [Fe/H] discrepancies is found. Surprisingly, we see no correlation between
the internal APOGEE DR14 - DR12 differences in Teff and those in DR14 - LAMOST tied to DR12, where a
correlation should be expected since LAMOST has been calibrated to APOGEE DR12. We also find no correlation
between the [Fe/H] discrepancies, suggesting that LAMOST/Cannon is not well coupled to the APOGEE
DR12 stellar parameters scale. A [Fe/H] dependence between the stellar parameters in APOGEE DR12
and those in DR14 is reported. We find a weak correlation in the differences between APOGEE DR14 -
DR12 and LAMOST on DR12 surface gravity for stars hotter than 4800 K and in the log g range between 2.0
and 2.8.
