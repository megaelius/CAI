Context: Protostellar jets in high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) play a key role in the understanding
of star formation and provide us with an excellent tool to study fundamental properties of HMYSOs.
Aims: We aim at studying the physical and kinematic properties of the near-IR (NIR) jet of IRAS\,13481-6124
from au to parsec scales. Methods: Our study includes NIR data from the Very Large Telescope instruments
SINFONI, CRIRES, and ISAAC. Information about the source and its immediate environment is retrieved
with SINFONI. The technique of spectro-astrometry is performed with CRIRES to study the jet on au
scales. The parsec-scale jet and its kinematic and dynamic properties are investigated using ISAAC.
Results: The SINFONI spectra in the $H$ and $K$ band are rich in emission lines that are mainly associated
with ejection and accretion processes. Spectro-astrometry is applied to the Br$\gamma$ line,
and for the first time, to the Br$\alpha$ line, revealing their jet origin with milliarcsecond-scale
photocentre displacements ($11-15$\,au). This allows us to constrain the kinematics of the au-scale
jet and to derive its position angle ($\sim216^{\circ}$). ISAAC spectroscopy reveals H$_2$ emission
along the parsec-scale jet, which allows us to infer kinematic and dynamic properties of the NIR
parsec-scale jet. The mass-loss rate inferred for the NIR jet is $\dot{M}_\mathrm{ejec}\sim10^{-4}\mathrm{\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$
and the thrust is $\dot{P}\sim10^{-2}\mathrm{\,M_\odot\,yr^{-1}\,km\,s^{-1}}$ , which is
roughly constant for the formation history of the young star. A tentative estimate of the ionisation
fraction is derived for the massive jet by comparing the radio and NIR mass-loss rates. An ionisation
fraction $\lesssim8\%$ is obtained, which means that the bulk of the ejecta is traced by the NIR jet
and that the radio jet only delineates a small portion of it.
