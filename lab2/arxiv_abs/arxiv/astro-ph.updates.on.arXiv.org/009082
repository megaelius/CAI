We present the results of relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of tidal disruptions
of stars by rotating supermassive black holes, for a wide range of impact parameters and black hole
spins. For deep encounters, we find that: relativistic precession creates debris geometries impossible
to obtain with the Newtonian equations; part of the fluid can be launched on plunging orbits, reducing
the fallback rate and the mass of the resulting accretion disc; multiple squeezings and bounces
at periapsis may generate distinctive X-ray signatures resulting from the associated shock breakout;
disruptions can occur inside the marginally bound radius, if the angular momentum spread launches
part of the debris on non-plunging orbits. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find relativistic effects
important in partial disruptions, where the balance between self-gravity and tidal forces is so
precarious that otherwise minor relativistic effects can have decisive consequences on the stellar
fate. In between, where the star is fully disrupted but relativistic effects are mild, the difference
resides in a gentler rise of the fallback rate, a later and smaller peak, and longer return times.
However, relativistic precession always causes thicker debris streams, both in the bound part
(speeding up circularization) and in the unbound part (accelerating and enhancing the production
of separate transients). We discuss various properties of the disruption (compression at periapsis,
shape and spread of the energy distribution) and potential observables (peak fallback rate, times
of rise and decay, duration of super-Eddington fallback) as a function of the impact parameter and
the black hole spin.
