A rotating fluid star, endowed with a magnetic field, can undergo a form of free precession, where
the fluid motion is a sum of rigid-body free precession and a non-rigid response. On secular timescales
this precessional motion is dissipated by bulk and shear viscous processes in the stellar interior
and magnetospheric braking in the exterior, changing the inclination angle between the rotation
and magnetic axes. Using our recent solutions for the non-rigid precessional dynamics, and viscous
dissipation integrals derived in this paper, we are able to make the only self-consistent calculation
to date of these dissipation rates. We present the first results for the full coupled evolution of
spindown and inclination angle for a model of a late-stage proto-neutron star with a strong toroidal
magnetic field, allowing for both electromagnetic torques and internal dissipation when evolving
the inclination angle. We explore the inclination-angle and spindown evolution for a range of initial
inclination angles, rotation rates and magnetic field strengths. For fixed initial inclination
angle, our results indicate that the neutron-star population naturally evolves into two classes:
near-aligned and near-orthogonal rotators -- with typical pulsars falling into the latter category.
Millisecond magnetars can evolve into the near-aligned rotators which mature magnetars appear
to be, but only for small initial inclination angle and internal toroidal fields stronger than roughly
$5\times 10^{15}$ G. Once any model has evolved to either an aligned or orthogonal state, there appears
to be no further evolution away from this state at later times.
