The solar wind shows periods of highly Alfv\'enic activity, where velocity fluctuations and magnetic
fluctuations are aligned or anti-aligned with each other. It is generally agreed that solar wind
plasma velocity and magnetic field fluctuations observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during the
first encounter are mostly highly Alfv\'enic. However, quantitative measures of Alfv\'enicity
are needed to understand how the characterization of these fluctuations compares with standard
measures from prior missions in the inner and outer heliosphere, in fast wind and slow wind, and at
high and low latitudes. To investigate this issue, we employ several measures to quantify the extent
of Alfv\'enicity -- the Alfv\'en ratio $r_A$, {normalized} cross helicity $\sigma_c$, {normalized}
residual energy $\sigma_r$, and the cosine of angle between velocity and magnetic fluctuations
$\cos\theta_{vb}$. We show that despite the overall impression that the Alfv\'enicity is large
in the solar wind sampled by PSP during the first encounter, during some intervals the cross helicity
starts decreasing at very large scales. These length-scales (often $> 1000 d_i$) are well inside
inertial range, and therefore, the suppression of cross helicity at these scales cannot be attributed
to kinetic physics. This drop at large scales could potentially be explained by large-scale shears
present in the inner heliosphere sampled by PSP. In some cases, despite the cross helicity being
constant down to the noise floor, the residual energy decreases with scale in the inertial range.
These results suggest that it is important to consider all these measures to quantify Alfv\'enicity.
