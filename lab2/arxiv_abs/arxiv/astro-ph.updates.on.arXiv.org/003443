We present observations of two new hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSN-I), iPTF15esb
and iPTF16bad, showing late-time H-alpha emission with line luminosities of (1-3)e+41 erg/s and
velocity widths of (4000-6000) km/s. Including the previously published iPTF13ehe, this makes
up a total of three such events to date. iPTF13ehe is one of the most luminous and the slowest evolving
SLSNe-I, whereas the other two are less luminous and fast decliners. We interpret this as a result
of the ejecta running into a neutral H-shell located at a radius of ~ 1.0e+16cm. This implies that
violent mass loss must have occurred several decades before the supernova explosion. Such a short
time interval suggests that eruptive mass loss could be common shortly prior to the death of a massive
star as a SLSN. And more importantly, helium is unlikely to be completely stripped off the progenitor
stars and could be present in the ejecta. It is a mystery why helium features are not detected, even
though non-thermal energy sources, capable of ionizing He atoms, may exist as suggested by the O
II absorption series in the early time spectra. At late times (+240d), our spectra appear to have
intrinsically lower [O I]6300A luminosities than that of SN2015bn and SN2007bi, possibly an indication
of smaller oxygen masses (<10-30Msun). The blue-shifted H-alpha emission relative to the hosts
for all three events may be in tension with the binary star model proposed for iPTF13ehe. Finally,
iPTF15esb has a peculiar light curve with three peaks separated from one another by ~ 22 days. The
LC undulation is higher in bluer bands. One possible explanation is eject-CSM interaction.
