Combining visual and spectroscopic orbits of binary stars leads to a determination of the full 3D
orbit, individual masses, and distance to the system. We present a full analysis of the evolved binary
system $\delta$ Delphini using astrometric data from the MIRC and PAVO instruments on the CHARA
long-baseline interferometer, 97 new spectra from the Fairborn Observatory, and 87 unpublished
spectra from Lick Observatory. We determine the full set of orbital elements for $\delta$ Del, along
with masses of $1.78 \pm 0.07$ $M_{\odot}$ and $1.62 \pm 0.07$ $M_{\odot}$ for each component, and
a distance of $63.61 \pm 0.89$ pc. These results are important in two contexts: for testing stellar
evolution models and defining the detection capabilities for future planet searches. We find that
the evolutionary state of this system is puzzling, as our measured flux ratios, radii, and masses
imply a $\sim$ 200 Myr age difference between the components using standard stellar evolution models.
Possible explanations for this age discrepancy include mass transfer scenarios with a now ejected
tertiary companion. For individual measurements taken over a span of 2 years we achieve $<10$ $\mu$-arcsecond
precision on differential position with 10-minute observations. The high precision of our astrometric
orbit suggests that exoplanet detection capabilities are within reach of MIRC at CHARA. We compute
exoplanet detection limits around $\delta$ Del, and conclude that if this precision is extended
to wider systems we should be able to detect most exoplanets $>2$ M$_{J}$ on orbits $>0.75$ AU around
individual components of hot binary stars via differential astrometry.
