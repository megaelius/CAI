We investigate cosmological solutions of f(R,T) modified theories of gravity for perfect fluid
in spatially FLRW metric through phase space analysis, where R is Ricci scalar and T denotes the trace
of energy-momentum tensor of matter content. We explore and analyze three general theories with
Lagrangians of a minimal $g(R)+h(T)$, a pure non--minimal g(R)h(T) and a non-minimal $g(R)(1+h(T))$
couplings through dynamical system procedure. We introduce a few variables and dimensionless
parameters to simplify equations in more concise forms. The conservation of energy-momentum tensor
leads to a constraint equation that, in the minimal gravity, confines functionality of h(T) to a
particular one, hence, relates the dynamical variables. In this case, acceptable cosmological
solutions which contain a long enough matter dominated era followed by a late-time accelerated
expansion are found. To support theoretical results, we also obtain numerical solutions for a few
functions of g(R), and results of the corresponding models confirm the predictions. We classify
solutions in six classes which demonstrate more acceptable solutions and there is more freedom
to have the matter dominated era than in the f(R) gravity. In particular, there is a new fixed point
which can represent late-time acceleration. We draw different diagrams of the matter densities
(consistent with the present values), the corresponding scale factors and effective equation
of state. The corresponding diagrams of parameters illustrate that there is a saddle acceleration
era which is a middle era before final stable acceleration de Sitter era for some models. All presented
diagrams determine radiation, matter and late-time acceleration eras very well.
