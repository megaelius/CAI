Recent observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) detected far-infrared
emission lines such as the [OIII] 88 \mu m line from galaxies at $z \sim 7 - 9$. Far-infrared lines can
be used to probe the structure and kinematics of such high-redshift galaxies as well as to accurately
determine their spectroscopic redshifts. We use a cosmological simulation of galaxy formation
to study the physical properties of [OIII] 88 \mu m emitters. In a comoving volume of 50 $h^{-1}$ Mpc
on a side, we locate 34 galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^8\ {\rm M_\odot}$ at $z = 9$,
and more than 270 such galaxies at $z = 7$. We calculate the [OIII] 88 \mu m luminosities ($L_{\rm OIII}$)
by combining a physical model of HII regions with emission line calculations using the photoionization
code CLOUDY. We show that the resulting $L_{\rm OIII}$, for a given star formation rate, is slightly
higher than predicted from the empirical relation for local galaxies, and is consistent with recent
observations of galaxies at redshifts 7 - 9. Bright [OIII] emitters with $L_{\rm OIII} > 10^8 {\rm
L_\odot}$ have stellar masses greater than $10^9\ {\rm M_\odot}$, star formation rates higher
than $3\ {\rm M_\odot\ yr}^{-1}$, and the typical metallicity is $\sim 0.1\ {\rm Z_\odot}$. The
galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos with masses greater than $10^{10.5}\ {\rm M_\odot}$. Massive
galaxies show characteristic structure where the [OIII] emitting gas largely overlaps with young
stars, but the emission peak is separated from the main stellar population, suggesting the stochastic
and localized nature of star formation in the first galaxies. We propose to use the [OIII] 5007 \AA\
line, to be detected by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), to study the properties of galaxies whose
[OIII] 88 \mu m line emission has been already detected with ALMA.
