Neutrinos produced in extragalactic sources may experience flavor-oscillations and decoherence
on their way to Earth due to their interaction with dark matter (DM). As a result, they may be detected
in pointer-states other than the flavor states at the source. The oscillation pattern and the structure
of the pointer-states can give us information on the characteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction
that has taken place. From this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the
local evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by the presence of
DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider different DM density profiles, masses and
interactions. Starting from the eigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the
flavor-states with the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions with
DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the resulting probabilities.
In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles, e.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White
density distribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we identify
pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM model. Due to the interaction
with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the extent of which depends on the DM density profile.
The interaction with DM produces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence
effects may take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino flavor-states by
letting them interact with DM. The features of the calculated response seem to support the notion
that these neutrinos can be taken as DM tracers. From a theoretical point of view, the coexistence
and/or competition of decoherence and MSW effects is sustained by the results.
