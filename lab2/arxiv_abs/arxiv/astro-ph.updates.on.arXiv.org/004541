There are two goals in this study. One is to investigate how frequently white-light flares (WLFs)
occur in a flare-productive active region (NOAA active region 11515). The other is to investigate
the relationship between WLFs and magnetic transients (MTs). We use the full-disk continuum filtergrams
and line-of-sight magnetograms taken by SDO/HMI to identify WLFs and MTs, respectively. Images
taken by SDO/AIA are also used to show the morphology of the flares in the upper atmosphere. We found
at least 20 WLFs out of a total of 70 flares above C class (28.6%) in NOAA active region 11515 during
its passage across the solar disk. Each of these WLFs occurred in a small region, with a short duration
of about 5 minutes. The enhancement of white-light continuum intensity is usually small, with an
average enhancement of 8.1%. The 20 WLFs observed were found along an unusual configuration of the
magnetic field characterized by a narrow ribbon of negative field. Furthermore, the WLFs were found
to be accompanied by MTs, with radical changes in magnetic field strength (or even a sign reversal)
observed during the flare. In contrast, there is no obvious signature of MTs in those 50 flares without
white-light enhancements. Our results suggest that WLFs occur much more frequently than what was
previously thought, with most WLFs being fairly weak enhancements. This may explain why WLFs are
not frequently reported. Our observations also suggest that MTs and WLFs are closely related and
appear co-spatial and co-temporal, when considering HMI data. A larger enhancement of WL emission
is often accompanied by a larger change of the line-of-sight component of the unsigned magnetic
field. Considering the close relationship between MTs and WLFs, many previously reported flares
with MTs may be WLFs.
