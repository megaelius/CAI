We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIb supernova
(SN) 2011dh for the first 100 days. We complement our extensive dataset with SWIFT ultra-violet
(UV) and Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) data to build a UV to MIR bolometric lightcurve using both photometric
and spectroscopic data. Hydrodynamical modelling of the SN based on this bolometric lightcurve
have been presented in Bersten (2012). We find that the absorption minimum for the hydrogen lines
is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approaches this value as the lines get weaker. This suggests that
the interface between the helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity in
agreement with the Bersten et al. (2012) He4R270 ejecta model. Spectral modelling of the hydrogen
lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusion and we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar
masses to be consistent with the observed spectral evolution. We estimate that the photosphere
reaches the helium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15 days, close
to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40 days. This suggests that increasing
non-thermal excitation due to decreasing optical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early
evolution of these lines. We also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the
SN site which shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellow supergiant coincident
with SN 2011dh. The B, V and r band decline rates of 0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively
are consistent with the remaining flux being emitted by the SN. Hence we find that the star was indeed
the progenitor of SN 2011dh as previously suggested by Maund et al. (2011) and which is also consistent
with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.
