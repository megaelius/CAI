In our quest to identify the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we first update the nucleosynthesis
yields both for near-Chandrasekhar (Ch) and sub-Ch mass white dwarfs (WDs), for a wide range of metallicity,
with our two-dimensional hydrodynamical code and the latest nuclear reaction rates. We then include
the yields in our galactic chemical evolution code to predict the evolution of elemental abundances
in the solar neighborhood and dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies: Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans, and
Carina. In the observations of the solar neighborhood stars, Mn shows an opposite trend to $\alpha$
elements, showing an increase toward higher metallicities, which is very well reproduced by deflagration-detonation
transition of Ch-mass WDs, but never by double detonations of sub-Ch-mass WDs alone. The problem
of Ch-mass SNe Ia was the Ni over-production at high metallicities. However, we found that Ni yields
of Ch-mass SNe Ia are much lower with the solar-scaled initial composition than in previous works,
which keeps the predicted Ni abundance within the observational scatter. From the evolutionary
trends of elemental abundances in the solar neighborhood, we conclude that the contribution of
sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia in chemical enrichment is up to 25\%. In dSph galaxies, however, larger enrichment
from sub-Ch-mass SNe Ia than in the solar neighborhood is required, which causes a decrease in [(Mg,
Cr, Mn, Ni)/Fe] at lower metallicities. The observed high [Mn/Fe] ratios in Sculptor and Carina
may also require additional enrichment from pure deflagrations, possibly as Type Iax supernovae.
Future observations of dSph stars will provide more stringent constraints on the progenitor systems
and explosion mechanism of SNe Ia.
