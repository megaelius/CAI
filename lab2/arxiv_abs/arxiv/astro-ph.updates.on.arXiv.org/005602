The second Gaia data release (GDR2) provides precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions,
proper motions and parallaxes) for an unprecedented amount of sources (more than $1.3$ billion,
mostly stars). The use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how does
one properly infer from these data the astrophysical parameters of interest? The main - but not only
- focus of this paper is the issue of the estimation of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined
with other information. We start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain
distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on how to use parallaxes
more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian methods. In particular also we show that
negative parallaxes, or parallaxes with relatively larger uncertainties still contain valuable
information. Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric data
for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and parallaxes and the handling
of covariances in the uncertainties. The paper contains examples based on simulated Gaia data to
illustrate the problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods
proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the Gaia archive documentation
that provide practical examples and a good starting point for the application of the recommendations
to actual problems. In all cases the source code for the analysis methods is provided. Our main recommendation
is to always treat the derivation of (astro-) physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular
when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a
full Bayesian approach.
