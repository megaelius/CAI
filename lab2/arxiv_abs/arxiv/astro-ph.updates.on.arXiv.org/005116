Using numerical simulations, we investigate the onset and suppression of parametric decay instability
(PDI) in the solar wind, focusing on the suppression effect by the wind acceleration and expansion.
We also discuss the role of PDI in generating the density fluctuation in the solar wind and the cross-helicity
evolution up to $1 {\rm \ au}$. Numerical simulations from the coronal base to 1 au are conducted in
a self-consistent manner; we take into account the feedback of wave energy and pressure in the background.
Monochromatic waves with various injection frequencies $f_0$ are injected to discuss the suppression
of PDI, while broadband waves are applied to compare the numerical results with observation. We
find, via the simulations with monochromatic waves, that high-frequency ($f_0 \gtrsim10^{-3}
{\rm \ Hz}$) Alfv\'en waves are subject to PDI. Meanwhile, the maximum growth rate of the PDI of low-frequency
($f_0 \lesssim10^{-4} {\rm \ Hz}$) Alfv\'en waves becomes negative due to acceleration and expansion
effects. Medium-frequency ($f_0 \approx 10^{-3.5} {\rm \ Hz}$) Alfv\'en waves have a positive
growth rate but do not show the signature of PDI up to 1 au because the growth rate is too small. The medium-frequency
waves experience neither PDI nor reflection so they propagate through the solar wind most efficiently.
This is called the frequency-filtering mechanism of the solar wind. The simulations with broadband
waves indicate that the observed trend of the density fluctuation is well explained by the evolution
of PDI while the observed cross-helicity evolution is in agreement with low-frequency wave propagation.
