We constrain the distributions of projected radial alignment angles of satellite galaxy shapes
within the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey group catalogue. We identify the galaxy groups using
spectroscopic redshifts and measure galaxy projected ellipticities from Sloan Digital Sky Survey
imaging. With a sample of 3,850 groups with 13,655 satellite galaxies with high quality shape measurements,
we find a less than 2-sigma signal of radial alignments in the mean projected ellipticity components
and the projected position angle when using galaxy shape estimates optimized for weak lensing measurements.
Our radial alignment measurement increases to greater than 3-sigma significance relative to the
expectation for no alignments if we use 2-D S\'ersic model fits to define galaxy orientations. Our
weak measurement of radial alignments is in conflict with predictions from dark matter N-body simulations,
which we interpret as evidence for large mis-alignments of baryons and dark matter in group and cluster
satellites. Within our uncertainties, that are dominated by our small sample size, we find only
weak and marginally significant trends of the radial alignment angle distributions on projected
distance from the group centre, host halo mass, and redshift that could be consistent with a tidal
torquing mechanism for radial alignments. Using our lensing optimized shape estimators, we estimate
that intrinsic alignments of galaxy group members may contribute a systematic error to the mean
differential projected surface mass density of groups inferred from weak lensing observations
by -1 +/- 20% at scales around 300 kpc/h from the group centre assuming a photometric redshift r.m.s.
