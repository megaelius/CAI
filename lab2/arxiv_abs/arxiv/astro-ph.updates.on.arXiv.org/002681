We use quasar absorption lines to study the physical conditions in the circumgalactic medium of
redshift $z\approx 2.3$ star-forming galaxies taken from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS).
In Turner et al. 2014 we used the pixel optical depth technique to show that absorption by HI and the
metal ions OVI, NV, CIV, CIII and SiIV is strongly enhanced within $|\Delta v|\lesssim170$ km/s
and projected distances $|d|\lesssim180$ proper kpc from sightlines to the background quasars.
Here we demonstrate that the OVI absorption is also strongly enhanced at fixed HI, CIV, and SiIV optical
depths, and that this enhancement extends out to $\sim350$ km/s. At fixed HI the increase in the median
OVI optical depth near galaxies is 0.3-0.7 dex and is detected at 2--3-$\sigma$ confidence for all
seven HI bins that have $\log_{10}\tau_{\rm HI}\ge-1.5$. We use ionisation models to show that
the observed strength of OVI as a function of HI is consistent with enriched, photoionised gas for
pixels with $\tau_{\rm HI}\gtrsim10$. However, for pixels with $\tau_{\rm HI} \lesssim 1$ this
would lead to implausibly high metallicities at low densities if the gas were photoionised by the
background radiation. This indicates that the galaxies are surrounded by gas that is sufficiently
hot to be collisionally ionised ($T > 10^5\,$K) and that a substantial fraction of the hot gas
has a metallicity $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ of solar. Given the high metallicity and large velocity extent
(out to $\sim1.5\times v_{\rm circ}$) of this gas, we conclude that we have detected hot, metal enriched
outflows arising from star-forming galaxies.
