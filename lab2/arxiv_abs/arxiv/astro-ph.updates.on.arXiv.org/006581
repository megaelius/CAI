We explore the origin of the trend of heavy elements in observed massive exoplanets. Coupling of
better measurements of mass ($M_p$) and radius of exoplanets with planet structure models enables
estimating the total heavy element mass ($M_Z$) in these planets. The corresponding relation is
characterized by a power-law profile, $M_Z \propto M_p^{3/5}$. We develop a simplified, but physically
motivated analysis to investigate how the power-law profile can be produced under the current picture
of planet formation. Making use of the existing semi-analytical formulae of accretion rates of
pebbles and planetesimals, our analysis shows that the relation can be reproduced well if it traces
the final stage of planet formation. In the stage, planets accrete solids from gapped planetesimal
disks and gas accretion is limited by disk evolution. We also find that dust accretion accompanying
with gas accretion does not contribute to $M_Z$ for planets with $M_p < 10^3 M_{\oplus}$. Our findings
are broadly consistent with that of previous studies, yet we explicitly demonstrate how planetesimal
dynamics is crucial for better understanding the relation. While our approach is simple, we can
also reproduce the trend of a correlation between planet metallicity and $M_p$ that is obtained
by detailed population synthesis calculations, when the same assumption is adopted. Our analysis
suggests that pebble accretion would not play a direct role at the final stage of planet formation,
whereas radial drift of pebbles might be important indirectly for metal enrichment of planets.
Detailed numerical simulations and more observational data are required for confirming our analysis.
