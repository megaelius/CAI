The origin of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars and their possible connection with the chemical
elements produced by the first stellar generation is still highly debated. In contrast to the Galactic
halo, not many CEMP stars have been found in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the Milky Way. Here
we present detailed abundances from ESO VLT/UVES high-resolution spectroscopy for ET0097, the
first CEMP star found in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal. This star has $\text{[Fe/H]}=-2.03\pm0.10$,
$\text{[C/Fe]}=0.51\pm0.10$ and $\text{[N/Fe]}=1.18\pm0.20$. The traditional definition
of CEMP stars is $\text{[C/Fe]}\geq0.70$, but taking into account that this luminous red giant
branch star has undergone mixing, it was intrinsically less nitrogen enhanced and more carbon-rich
when it was formed, and so it falls under the definition of CEMP stars, as proposed by Aoki et al. (2007)
to account for this effect. By making corrections for this mixing, we conclude that the star had $\text{[C/Fe]}\approx0.8$
during its earlier evolutionary stages. Apart from the enhanced C and N abundances, ET0097 shows
no peculiarities in other elements lighter than Zn, and no enhancement of the heavier neutron-capture
elements (Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Dy), making this a CEMP-no star. However, the star does show signs
of the weak $r$-process, with an overabundance of the lighter neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y,
Zr). To explain the abundance pattern observed in ET0097, we explore the possibility that this star
was enriched by primordial stars. In addition to the detailed abundances for ET0097, we present
estimates and upper limits for C abundances in 85 other stars in Sculptor derived from CN molecular
lines, including 11 stars with $\text{[Fe/H]}\leq-2$. Combining these limits with observations
from the literature, the fraction of CEMP-no stars in Sculptor seems to be significantly lower than
in the Galactic halo.
