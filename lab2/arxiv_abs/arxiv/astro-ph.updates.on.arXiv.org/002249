Broad-line radio galaxies (BLRGs) are active galactic nuclei that produce powerful, large-scale
radio jets, but appear as Seyfert 1 galaxies in their optical spectra. In the X-ray band, BLRGs also
appear like Seyfert galaxies, but with flatter spectra and weaker reflection features. One explanation
for these properties is that the X-ray continuum is diluted by emission from the jet. Here, we present
two NuSTAR observations of the BLRG 3C 382 that show clear evidence that the continuum of this source
is dominated by thermal Comptonization, as in Seyfert 1 galaxies. The two observations were separated
by over a year and found 3C 382 in different states separated by a factor of 1.7 in flux. The lower flux
spectrum has a photon-index of $\Gamma=1.68^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, while the photon-index of the
higher flux spectrum is $\Gamma=1.78^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. Thermal and anisotropic Comptonization
models provide an excellent fit to both spectra and show that the coronal plasma cooled from $kT_e=330\pm
30$ keV in the low flux data to $231^{+50}_{-88}$ keV in the high flux observation. This cooling behavior
is typical of Comptonizing corona in Seyfert galaxies and is distinct from the variations observed
in jet-dominated sources. In the high flux observation, simultaneous Swift data are leveraged
to obtain a broadband spectral energy distribution and indicates that the corona intercepts $\sim
10$% of the optical and ultraviolet emitting accretion disk. 3C 382 exhibits very weak reflection
features, with no detectable relativistic Fe K$\alpha$ line, that may be best explained by an outflowing
corona combined with an ionized inner accretion disk.
