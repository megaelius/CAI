We carry out a phase-curve analysis of the KELT-9 system using photometric observations from NASA's
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The measured secondary eclipse depth and peak-to-peak
atmospheric brightness modulation are $650^{+14}_{-15}$ ppm and $566\pm16$ ppm, respectively.
The planet's brightness variation reaches maximum $31\pm5$ minutes before the midpoint of the
secondary eclipse, indicating a $5\overset{\circ}{.}2\pm0\overset{\circ}{.}9$ eastward
shift in the dayside hot spot from the substellar point. We also detect stellar pulsations on KELT-9
with a period of $7.58695\pm0.00091$ hours. The dayside emission of KELT-9b in the TESS bandpass
is consistent with a blackbody brightness temperature of $4600\pm100$ K. The corresponding nightside
brightness temperature is $3040\pm100$ K, comparable to the dayside temperatures of the hottest
known exoplanets. In addition, we detect a significant phase-curve signal at the first harmonic
of the orbital frequency and a marginal signal at the second harmonic. While the amplitude of the
first harmonic component is consistent with the predicted ellipsoidal distortion modulation
assuming equilibrium tides, the phase of this photometric variation is shifted relative to the
expectation. Placing KELT-9b in the context of other exoplanets with phase-curve observations,
we find that the elevated nightside temperature and relatively low day-night temperature contrast
agree with the predictions of atmospheric models that include H$_{2}$ dissociation and recombination.
The nightside temperature of KELT-9b implies an atmospheric composition containing about 50%
molecular and 50% atomic hydrogen at 0.1 bar, a nightside emission spectrum that deviates significantly
from a blackbody, and a 0.5-2.0 $\mu$m transmission spectrum that is featureless at low resolution.
