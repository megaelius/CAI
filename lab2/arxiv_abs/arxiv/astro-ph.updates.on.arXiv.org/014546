Nearly 50% of all sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope are classified as blazars or
blazar candidates, one of the most elusive classes of active galaxies. Additional blazars can also
be hidden within the sample of unidentified or unassociated $\gamma$-ray sources (UGSs) that constitute
about one-third of all gamma-ray sources detected to date. We recently confirmed that the large
majority of Fermi blazars of the BL Lac subclass have an X-ray counterpart. Using the X-ray properties
of a BL Lac training set and combining these with archival multifrequency information, we aim to
search for UGSs that could have a BL Lac source within their $\gamma$-ray positional uncertainty
regions. We reduced and analyzed the Swift X-ray observations of a selected sample of 327 UGSs. We
then compared the X-ray fluxes and hardness ratios of all sources detected in the pointed fields
with those of known Fermi BL Lacs. We find at least one X-ray source, lying within the $\gamma$-ray
positional uncertainty at 95% confidence level, for 223 UGSs and a total of 464 X-ray sources in all
fields analyzed. The X-ray properties of a large fraction of them, eventually combined with radio,
infrared, and optical information, exhibit BL Lac multi-frequency behavior, thus allowing us
to select high-confidence BL Lac candidates; some of them were recently observed during our optical
spectroscopic campaign which confirmed their nature. We find that out of 50 X-ray sources that were
confirmed as BL Lacs through optical spectroscopy, 12 do not show canonical mid-infrared or radio
BL Lac properties. This indicates that the selection of X-ray BL Lac candidates is a strong method
to find new counterparts within Fermi UGSs. Finally, we pinpoint a sample of 32 Swift/XRT candidate
counterparts to Fermi UGSs that are most likely BL Lac objects.
