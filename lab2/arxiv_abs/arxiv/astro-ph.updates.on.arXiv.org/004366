The anisotropic distribution of satellites around the central galaxy of their host halo is well-documented.
However the relative impact of baryons and dark matter in shaping this distribution is still debated.
Using the simulation Horizon-AGN, the angular distribution of satellite galaxies with respect
to their central counterpart and halo is quantified. Below one Rvir, satellites cluster more strongly
in the plane of the central, rather than merely tracing the shape of their host halo. This is due to
the increased isotropy of inner haloes acquired through their inside-out assembly in vorticity-rich
flows along the cosmic web. While the effect of centrals decreases with distance, halos' triaxiality
increases, impacting more and more the satellite's distribution. Effects become comparable just
outside one virial radius. Above this scale, the filamentary infall also impacts the satellites
distribution, dominating above two virial radii. The central's morphology plays a governing role:
the alignment w.r.t. the central plane is four times stronger in haloes hosting stellar discs than
in spheroids. But the impact of the galactic plane decreases for lower satellite-to-central mass
ratios, suggesting this might not hold for dwarf satellites of the Local group. The orientation
of the Milky-Way's satellites traces their cosmic filament, their level of coplanarity is consistent
with systems of similar mass and cosmic location in Horizon-AGN. However, the strong impact of galactic
planes in massive groups and clusters bounds the likelihood of finding a relaxed region where satellites
can be used to infer halo shape. The minor-to-major axis ratios for haloes with log(M0/Msun)>13.5
is underestimated by 10%. This error soars quickly to 30-40% for individual halo measurements.
