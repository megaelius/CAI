The strong enhancement of the ultraviolet emission during solar flares is usually taken as an indication
of plasma heating in the lower solar atmosphere caused by the deposition of the energy released during
these events. Images taken with broadband ultraviolet filters by the {\em Transition Region and
Coronal Explorer} (TRACE) and {\em Atmospheric Imaging Assembly} (AIA 1600 and 1700~\AA) have
revealed the morphology and evolution of flare ribbons in great detail. However, the spectral content
of these images is still largely unknown. Without the knowledge of the spectral contribution to
these UV filters, the use of these rich imaging datasets is severely limited. Aiming to solve this
issue, we estimate the spectral contributions of the AIA UV flare and plage images using high-resolution
spectra in the range 1300 to 1900~\AA\ from the Skylab NRL SO82B spectrograph. We find that the flare
excess emission in AIA 1600~\AA\ is { dominated by} the \ion{C}{4} 1550~\AA\ doublet (26\%), \ion{Si}{1}
continua (20\%), with smaller contributions from many other chromospheric lines such as \ion{C}{1}
1561 and 1656~\AA\ multiplets, \ion{He}{2} 1640~\AA, \ion{Si}{2} 1526 and 1533~\AA. For the AIA
1700~\AA\ band, \ion{C}{1} 1656~\AA\ multiplet is the main contributor (38\%), followed by \ion{He}{2}
1640 (17\%), and accompanied by a multitude of other, { weaker} chromospheric lines, with minimal
contribution from the continuum. Our results can be generalized to state that the AIA UV flare excess
emission is of chromospheric origin, while plage emission is dominated by photospheric continuum
emission in both channels.
