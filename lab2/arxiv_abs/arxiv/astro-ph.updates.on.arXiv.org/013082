We present results of three-dimensional (3D), radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations
of core-collapse supernovae in full general relativity (GR), for the first time, with spectral
neutrino transport. In order to study the effects of progenitor's rotation and magnetic fields
on the dynamics and the emergent neutrino signals, we compute three models, where the precollapse
rotation rate and magnetic fields are included parametrically to a 20 M$_{\odot}$ star. While we
find no shock revival in our two non-magnetized models during our simulation times ($\sim500$ ms
after bounce), the magnetorotationally driven shock expansion immediately initiates after bounce
in our rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized model. We show that the expansion of the magnetorotationally-driven
flows toward the polar directions is predominantly driven by the magnetic pressure, whereas the
shock expansion toward the equatorial direction is supported by neutrino heating. After $\sim
150$ ms postbounce, the magnetorotationally-driven bipolar flows eventually cascades to an one-sided,
unipolar flow. Our detailed analysis indicates that the growth of the so-called kink instability
may hinder the collimation of jets, resulting in the formation of broader outflows. Furthermore
we find a clear signature of the lepton-number emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA), though
only in the MR explosion model, whose asymmetry is consistent with the unipolar explosion morphology.
We also report several unique neutrino signatures, which are significantly dependent on both the
time and the viewing angle, if observed, possibly providing a rich information regarding the onset
of the magnetorotationally-driven explosion.
