Context. Hypervelocity stars move fast enough to leave the gravitational field of their home galaxies
and venture into intergalactic space. The most extreme examples known have estimated speeds in
excess of 1000 km/s. These can be easily induced at the centres of galaxies via close encounters between
binary stars and supermassive black holes; however, a number of other mechanisms operating elsewhere
can produce them as well. Aims. Recent studies suggest that hypervelocity stars are ubiquitous
in the local Universe. In the Milky Way, the known hypervelocity stars are anisotropically distributed,
but it is unclear why. Here, we used Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) data to perform a systematic exploration
aimed at confirming or refuting these findings. Methods. We assume that the farther the candidate
hypervelocity stars are, the more likely they are to be unbound from the Galaxy. We used the statistical
analysis of both the spatial distribution and kinematics of these objects to achieve our goals.
Results. Focussing on nominal Galactocentric distances greater than 30 kpc, which are the most
distant candidates, we isolated a sample with speeds in excess of 500 km/s that exhibits a certain
degree of anisotropy but remains compatible with possible systematic effects. We find that the
effect of the Eddington-Trumpler-Weaver bias is important in our case: over 80% of our sources are
probably located further away than implied by their parallaxes; therefore, most of our velocity
estimates are lower limits. If this bias is as strong as suggested here, the contamination by disc
stars may not affect our overall conclusions. Conclusions. The subsample with the lowest uncertainties
shows stronger, but obviously systematic, anisotropies and includes a number of candidates of
possible extragalactic origin and young age with speeds of up to 2000 km/s.
