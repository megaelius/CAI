FU Orionis systems are outbursting protoplanetary disks where the accretion disks outshine the
central stars and strong disk winds are launched. Magnetic fields in these accretion disks have
previously been detected through their Zeeman effects in spectropolarimetry observations. We
carry out global radiation ideal MHD simulations to study FU Ori's inner accretion disk. We find
that (1) when the disk is threaded by vertical magnetic fields, most accretion occurs in the magnetically
dominated atmosphere at z$\sim$R, similar to the "surface accretion" mechanism in previous locally-isothermal
MHD simulations. (2) A moderate disk wind is launched in these vertical field simulations with terminal
speeds of $\sim$300-500 km/s and a mass loss rate of 1-10\% disk accretion rate. Both the speed and
loss rate are consistent with observations. Disk wind fails to be launched in net toroidal field
simulations. (3) The disk photosphere at the unit optical depth can be either in the wind launching
region or the accreting surface region, depending on the accretion rates and the disk radii. Magnetic
fields have drastically different directions and magnitudes between these two regions. Our fiducial
model agrees with previous optical Zeeman observations regarding both the field directions and
magnitudes. On the other hand, simulations indicate that future Zeeman observations at near-IR
wavelengths or towards other FU Orionis systems may reveal very different magnetic field structures.
(4) Due to energy loss by the disk wind, the disk photosphere temperature is lower than that predicted
by the thin disk theory, and the previously inferred disk accretion rate may be lower than the real
accretion rate by a factor of $\sim$2-3.
