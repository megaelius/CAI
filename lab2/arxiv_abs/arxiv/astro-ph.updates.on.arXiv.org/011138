Despite recent progress in understanding Lyman-alpha (Lya) emitters (LAEs), relatively little
is known regarding their typical black hole activity across cosmic time. Here, we study the X-ray
and radio properties of ~4000 LAEs at 2.2<z<6 from the SC4K survey in the COSMOS field. By exploring
deep Chandra Legacy data, we reach an X-ray luminosity of ~10^42.4 erg/s for the deepest, full sample
stack of ~480 Ms. We detect 254 (6.8+-0.4%) of the LAEs individually in the X-rays (S/N>3) and find
an average luminosity of 10^{44.07+-0.01} erg/s and an average black hole accretion rate (BHAR)
of 0.42+-0.01 Msun/yr, consistent with moderate to high accreting AGN. We detect 120 sources in
deep radio data, implying a LAE radio AGN fraction of 3.2+-0.3%. Approximately half of the LAEs detected
in the radio are also detected in the X-rays, resulting in a total AGN fraction of 8.6+-0.4% for >L*
LAEs. The total AGN fraction rises with Lya luminosity and declines with increasing redshift. For
AGN, we find that Lya luminosities correlate with the BHARs, suggesting that Lya luminosity becomes
an accretion rate indicator. Most LAEs (93.1+-0.6%) at 2<z<6 have no detectable X-ray emission
(BHARs<0.009 Msun/yr). We estimate the median star formation rate (SFR) of star-forming LAEs from
Lya and radio luminosities and find a SFR of 5.6^{+6.6}_{-2.8} Msun/yr. The black hole to galaxy
growth ratio (BHAR/SFR) for LAEs is <0.0016, consistent with typical star forming galaxies and
the local BHAR/SFR relation. We conclude that LAEs at 2<z<6 include two different populations:
an AGN population, where Lya luminosity traces BHAR, making them bright in Lya, and another with
low SFRs which remain undetected in even the deepest X-ray stacks but is detected in the radio stacks.
