Exomoons orbiting terrestrial or super-terrestrial exoplanets have not yet been discovered;
their possible existence and properties are therefore still an unresolved question. Here we explore
the collisional formation of exomoons through giant planetary impacts. We make use of smooth particle
hydrodynamical (SPH) collision simulations and survey a large phase-space of terrestrial/super-terrestrial
planetary collisions. We characterize the properties of such collisions, finding one rare case
in which an exomoon forms through a graze&capture scenario, in addition to a few graze&merge or hit&run
scenarios. Typically however, our collisions form massive circumplanetary discs, for which we
use follow-up N-body simulations in order to derive lower-limit mass estimates for the ensuing
exomoons. We investigate the mass, long-term tidal-stability, composition and origin of material
in both the discs and the exomoons. Our giant-impact models often generate relatively iron-rich
moons, that form beyond the synchronous radius of the planet, and would thus tidally evolve outward
with stable orbits, rather than be destroyed. Our results suggest that it is extremely difficult
to collisionally form currently-detectable exomoons orbiting super-terrestrial planets, through
single giant impacts. It might be possible to form massive, detectable exomoons through several
mergers of smaller exomoons, formed by multiple impacts, however more studies are required in order
to reach a conclusion. Given the current observational initiatives, the search should focus primarily
on more massive planet categories. However, about a quarter of the exomoons predicted by our models
are approximately Mercury-mass or more, and are much more likely to be detectable given a factor
2 improvement in the detection capability of future instruments, providing further motivation
for their development.
