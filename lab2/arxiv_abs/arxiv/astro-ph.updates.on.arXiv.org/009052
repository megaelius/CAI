Microlensing is the only method that can detect and measure mass of wide orbit, low mass, solar system
analog exoplanets. Mass measurements of such planets would yield massive science on planet formation,
exoplanet demographics, free floating planets, planet frequencies towards the galaxy. High res
follow-up observations of past microlens targets provide a mass measurement of microlens planets
and hosts at an uncertainty of <20%. This will be primary method for mass measurement with WFIRST.
We advocate for the fact that high resolution observations with AO, HST and JWST(in future) remain
necessary in coming decade to develop the methods, to determine the field and filter selection,
understand the systematics and to develop a robust pipeline to release high quality data products
from WFIRST microlensing survey such that the astronomy community can promptly engage in the science.
We also support future high res obs with US ELTs with advanced Laser AO systems in context of enhancing
the science return of WFIRST microlensing survey. We endorse the 2018 Exoplanet Science Strategy
report published by the National Academy. This white paper extends and complements the material
presented therein. In particular, this white paper supports the recommendation of the National
Academy Exoplanet Science Strategy report that: NASA should launch WFIRST to conduct its microlensing
survey of distant planets and to demonstrate the technique of coronagraphic spectroscopy on exoplanet
targets. This white paper also supports to the finding from that report which states "A number of
activities, including precursor and concurrent observations using ground- and space-based facilities,
would optimize the scientific yield of the WFIRST microlensing survey."
