Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an able alternative to collisionless dark matter. If dark
matter does have self-interactions, we would expect this to cause a separation between the collisionless
stars and the dark matter halo of a galaxy as it falls through a dark matter medium. For stars arranged
in a disk, this would generate a U-shaped warp. The magnitude of this warping depends on the SIDM cross
section, type of self-interaction, relative velocity of galaxy and background, halo structure,
and density of the dark matter medium. In this paper, we set constraints on long-range (light mediator)
dark matter self-interaction by means of this signal. We begin by measuring U-shaped warps in 3,213
edge-on disk galaxies within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We then forward-model the expected warp
from SIDM on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis by combining models of halo structure, density and velocity
field reconstructions, and models for the dark matter interactions. We find no evidence for a contribution
to the warps from SIDM. Our constraints are highly dependent on the uncertain velocities of our galaxies:
we find $\tilde{\sigma}/m_{\rm{DM}} \lesssim 3\times 10^{-13}~\rm{cm}^2/\rm{g}$ at fixed
velocity $v = 300~\rm{km/s}$ -- a bound that scales roughly linearly with increasing $v$. We also
consider galaxy velocities from the CosmicFlows-3 catalogue. These limits are stronger than those
from dwarf galaxy evaporation, and we show that they will scale well with additional data from the
next generation of photometric galaxy surveys. Finally, we forecast constraints for contact and
intermediate-range interactions that could be achieved with a similar sample of galaxies in cluster
environments, where multi-streaming and the fluid approximation are satisfied.
