We study the faint radio population using wide-field very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
observations of 2865 known radio sources in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field. The main
objective of the project was to determine where active galactic nuclei (AGN) are present. The combination
of number of sources, sensitivity, angular resolution and area covered by this project are unprecedented.
We have detected 468 radio sources, expected to be AGNs, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
at 1.4 GHz. This is, to date, the largest sample assembled of VLBI detected sources in the sub-mJy
regime. The input sample was taken from previous observations with the Very Large Array (VLA). We
present the catalogue with additional multiwavelength information. We find a detection fraction
of 20%, considering only those sources from the input catalogue which were in principle detectable
with the VLBA (2361). As a function of redshift, we see no evolution of the detection fraction over
the redshift range 0.5<z<3. In addition, we find that faint radio sources typically have a greater
fraction of their radio luminosity in a compact core: ~70% of the sub-mJy sources detected with the
VLBA have more than half of their total radio luminosity in a VLBI-scale component, whereas this
is true for only ~30% of the sources that are brighter than 10 mJy. This suggests that fainter radio
sources differ intrinsically from brighter ones. Across our entire sample, we find the predominant
morphological classification of the host galaxies of the VLBA detected sources to be early type
(57%), although this varies with redshift and at z>1.5 we find that spiral galaxies become the most
prevalent (48%). We demonstrate that wide-field VLBI observations, together with new calibration
methods such as multi-source self-calibration and mosaicing, result in information which is difficult
or impossible to obtain otherwise.
