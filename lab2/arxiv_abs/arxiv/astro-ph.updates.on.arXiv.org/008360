We carried out deep searches for CO line emission in the outer disk of M33, at R>7 kpc, and examined
the dynamical conditions that can explain variations in the mass distribution of the molecular
cloud throughout the disk of M33. We used the IRAM-30~m telescope to search for CO lines in the outer
disk toward 12 faint mid-infrared (MIR) selected sources and in an area of the southern outer disk
hosting MA1, a bright HII region. We detect narrow CO lines at the location of two MIR sources at galactocentric
distances of about 8 kpc that are associated with low-mass young stellar clusters, and at four locations
in the proximity of MA1. The paucity of CO lines at the location of weak MIR-selected sources probably
arises because most of them are not star-forming sites in M33, but background sources. Although
very uncertain, the total molecular mass of the detected clouds around MA1 is lower than expected
given the stellar mass of the cluster, because dispersal of the molecular gas is taking place as the
HII region expands. The mean mass of the giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in M33 decreases radially
by a factor 2 from the center out to 4 kpc, then it stays constant until it drops at R>7 kpc. We suggest
that GMCs become more massive toward the center because of the fast rotation of the disk, which drives
mass growth by coalescence of smaller condensations as they cross the arms. The analysis of both
HI and CO spectral data gives the consistent result that corotation of the two main arms in this galaxy
is at a radius of 4.7+-0.3 kpc, and spiral shock waves become subsonic beyond 3.9 kpc. Perturbations
are quenched beyond 6.5 kpc, where CO lines have been detected only around sporadic condensations
associated with UV and MIR emission.
