The majority of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent the stripped cores of evolved massive stars who
lost most of their hydrogen envelope. In low metallicity environments, such as the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC), stellar winds are weaker and binary interaction is expected to dominate WR-star formation.
However, the WR binary fraction appears to be ~40% at any metallicity. We use the recently determined
physical properties of the twelve known SMC WR stars to explore their possible formation channels
through comparisons with grids of SMC models, simulated with the detailed stellar evolution code
MESA. These include models of rapidly rotating single stars, which experience (partial) chemically
homogeneous evolution (CHE). We find that CHE is not able to account for the majority of the SMC WR
stars. However, the apparently single WN star SMC AB12 and the double WR system SMC AB5 (HD 5980) appear
consistent with this channel. We also analyze core helium burning stellar models assuming constant
hydrogen gradients in their envelopes. We find a dichotomy in the envelope hydrogen gradients required
to explain the observed temperatures of the SMC WR stars. Shallow gradients are found for the WR stars
with O star companions, consistent with binary models where mass transfer occurs early, which is
in agreement with their binary properties. On the other hand, much steeper hydrogen gradients are
inferred for the group of hot apparently single WR stars. Since the hydrogen profiles in post main
sequence models of massive stars become steeper with time, we conclude that these stars have most
likely been stripped by a companion during a phase of common envelope evolution. The companions,
either main sequence stars or compact objects, are expected to still be present. A corresponding
search might identify the first immediate double black hole binary progenitor with masses as high
as those detected in GW150914.
