Recently, it was shown that the complex dynamical behaviour of spicules has to be interpreted as
the result of simultaneous action of three kinds of motion: (1) field aligned flows, (2) swaying
motions, and (3) torsional motions. We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate
signs of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid blue-shifted excursions
(RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue wing of chromospheric spectral lines, were
identified as the disk counterpart of type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption
features in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted excursions (RREs).
RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in the same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity
of magnetic field concentrations. RREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar
lengths, widths, lifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to RBEs
implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and that spicules harbour
motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed on-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant
than RBEs and we interpret the higher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb
as an indication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the net Dopplershift.
Most RREs and RBEs are observed in isolation but we find many examples of parallel and touching RRE/RBE
pairs which appear to be part of the same spicule. We interpret the existence of these RRE/RBE pairs
as signs that torsional motion is an important characteristic of spicules. The fact that most RBEs
and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal swaying motion is another
important kinetic mode. We find examples of transitions from RRE to RBE and vice versa.
