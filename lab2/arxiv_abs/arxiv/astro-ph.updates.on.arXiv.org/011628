Three deep radio continuum surveys of the Andromeda galaxy, M 31, were performed at 11.3, 6.2, and
3.6 cm wavelength with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. At all wavelengths, the total and polarized
emission is concentrated in a ring-like structure between about 7 kpc and 13 kpc radius from the center.
Propagation of cosmic rays away from star-forming regions is evident. The ring of synchrotron emission
is wider than the ring of the thermal radio emission, and the radial scale length of synchrotron emission
is larger than that of thermal emission. The polarized intensity from the ring varies double-periodically
with azimuthal angle, indicating that the ordered magnetic field is almost oriented along the ring,
with a pitch angle of -14{\deg} $\pm$ 2{\deg}. Faraday rotation measures (RM) show a large-scale
sinusoidal variation with azimuthal angle, signature of an axisymmetric spiral (ASS) regular
magnetic field, plus a superimposed double-periodic variation of a bisymmetric spiral (BSS) field
with about 6x smaller amplitude. The dominating ASS field of M 31 is the most compelling case so far
of a field generated by the action of a mean-field dynamo. The RM amplitude between 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm
is about 50% larger than between 11.3 cm and 6.2 cm, indicating that Faraday depolarization at 11.3
cm is stronger than at 6.2 cm and 3.6 cm. The phase of the sinusoidal RM variation of -7{\deg} $\pm$
1{\deg} is interpreted as the average spiral pitch angle of the regular field. The average pitch
angle of the ordered field, as derived from the intrinsic orientation of the polarized emission
(corrected for Faraday rotation), is significantly smaller: -26{\deg} $\pm$ 3{\deg}. The difference
in pitch angle of the regular and the ordered fields indicates that the ordered field contains a significant
fraction of an anisotropic turbulent field that has a different pattern than the regular (ASS + BSS)
field.
