Open clusters exquisitely track the Galactic disc chemical properties and its time evolution:
a substantial number of studies and large spectroscopic surveys focus [mostly] on the chemical
content of relatively old clusters (age $\gtrsim$ 1 Gyr). Interestingly, the less-studied young
counterpart populating the solar surrounding has been found to be solar (at most), with a notable,
surprising lack of young metal-rich objects. While there is wide consensus about the moderately
above-solar composition of the Hyades cluster, the metallicity of Praesepe is still controversial.
Recent studies suggest these two clusters share identical chemical composition and age, but this
conclusion is disputed. With the aim of re-assessing the metallicity of Praesepe, and its difference
(if any) with the Hyades cluster, we present in this paper a spectroscopic investigation of 10 solar
type dwarf members. We exploited $GIARPS$ at the TNG to acquire high-resolution, high-quality
optical and NIR spectra and derived stellar parameters, metallicity ([Fe/H]), light, $\alpha$
and iron-peak elements, by using a strictly differential (line-by-line) approach. We also analysed
in the very same way the solar spectrum and the Hyades solar analogue HD 28099. Our findings suggest
that Praesepe is more metal-rich than the Hyades, at the level of $\Delta$[Fe/H]=+0.05$\pm$0.01
dex, with a mean value of [Fe/H]=+0.21$\pm0.01$ dex. All the other elements scale with iron, as expected.
This result seems to reject the hypothesis of a common origin for these two open clusters. Most important,
Presepe is currently the most metal-rich, young open cluster living in the solar neighbourhood.
