Context: Circumstellar disks are considered to be the environment for the formation of planets.
The growth of dust grains in these disks is the first step in the core accretion-gas capture planet
formation scenario. Indicators and evidence of disk evolution can be traced in spatially resolved
images and the spectral energy distribution (SED) of these objects. Aims: We develop a model for
the dust phase of the edge-on oriented circumstellar disk of the Butterfly Star which allows one
to fit observed multi-wavelength images and the SED simultaneously. Methods: Our model is based
on spatially resolved high angular resolution observations at 1.3 mm, 894 micron, 2.07 micron,
1.87 micron, 1.60 micron, and 1.13 micron and an extensively covered SED ranging from 12 micron to
2.7 mm, including a detailed spectrum obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope in the range from
12 micron to 38 micron. A parameter study based on a grid search method involving the detailed analysis
of every parameter was performed to constrain the disk parameters and find the best-fit model for
the independent observations. The individual observations were modeled simultaneously, using
our continuum radiative transfer code. Results: We derived a model that is capable of reproducing
all of the observations of the disk at the same time. We find quantitative evidence for grain growth
up to ~100 micron-sized particles, vertical settling of larger dust grains toward the disk midplane,
and radial segregation of the latter toward the central star. Within our best-fit model the large
grains have a distribution with a scale height of 3.7 AU at 100 AU and a radial extent of 175 AU compared
to a hydrostatic scale height of 6.9 AU at 100 AU and an outer disk radius of 300 AU. Our results are consistent
with current theoretical models for the evolution of circumstellar disks and the early stages of
planet formation.
