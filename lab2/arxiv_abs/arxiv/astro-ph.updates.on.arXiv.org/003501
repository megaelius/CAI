It has been realized in recent years that the accretion of pebble-sized dust particles onto planetary
cores is an important mode of core growth, which enables the formation of giant planets at large distances
and assists planet formation in general. The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit theory
of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For sufficiently large core mass (in the
"Hill regime"), essentially all particles of appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be
captured. However, the outer regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the magnetorotational
instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle orbits may affect the efficiency of pebble
accretion. We conduct shearing-box simulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI
turbulence (strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in the
presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to test the efficiency
of pebble accretion at a microphysical level. We find that accretion remains efficient for marginally
coupled particles (dimensionless stopping time tau_s ~ 0.1 - 1) even in the presence of strong MRI
turbulence. Though more dust particles are brought toward the core by the turbulence, this effect
is largely canceled by a reduction in accretion probability. As a result, the overall effect of turbulence
on the accretion rate is mainly reflected in the changes in the thickness of the dust layer. On the
other hand, we find that the efficiency of pebble accretion for strongly coupled particles (down
to tau_s ~ 0.01) can be modestly reduced by strong turbulence for low-mass cores.
