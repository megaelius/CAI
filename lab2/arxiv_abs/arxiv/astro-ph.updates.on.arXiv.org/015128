This article proposes a picture of magnetized accretion structures formed during the mass transfer
in the Beta Lyrae system. It is shown that the structure of the gaseous flows between the donor and
the gainer is due to the spatial configuration of the donor magnetic field. Its dipole axis is deviated
substantially from the line joining the centers of the components and is inclined to the orbital
plane of the binary system; the center of the magnetic dipole is displaced from the donor center toward
the gainer. The surface around the donor magnetic pole, which is close to the gainer, is a region of
an additional matter loss from the donor surface. The effective collision of the magnetized plasma
with the accretion disk is enhanced by the fast counter-rotation of this disk, especially in the
secondary quadrature phases, in which the high-temperature medium and the system of formed accretion
flows are observed. This concept is demonstrated, primarily, in the obvious correlations between
the phase variability of the donor magnetic field and the corresponding variability of the dynamic
and energy characteristics of the various complex lines. This refers to the behavior of the radial
velocity curves of the emission-absorption lines formed in the gaseous structures of type H$\alpha$,
HeI $\lambda$ 7065, or the variability of their equivalent width and intensity, and the variability
of conventional absorption lines of the donor atmosphere. This is true for the phase variability
of the absolute flux in the H$\alpha$ emission line and the fast varying of the continuum in the H$\alpha$
region as certain parameters, which reflect the phase variability of the donor magnetic field.
This approach made it possible to determine the phase boundaries of the location of the magnetic
polar region on the donor surface above which the matter outflows are formed.
