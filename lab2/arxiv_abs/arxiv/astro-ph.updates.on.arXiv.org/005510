We present a suite of six fully cosmological, three-dimensional simulations of the collapse of
an atomic cooling halo in the early Universe. We use the moving-mesh code arepo with an improved primordial
chemistry network to evolve the hydrodynamical and chemical equations. The addition of a strong
Lyman-Werner background suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling and permits the gas to evolve nearly
isothermally at a temperature of about 8000 K. Strong gravitational torques effectively remove
angular momentum and lead to the central collapse of gas, forming a supermassive protostar at the
center of the halo. We model the protostar using two methods: sink particles that grow through mergers
with other sink particles, and a stiff equation of state that leads to the formation of an adiabatic
core. We impose threshold densities of $10^8$, $10^{10}$, and $10^{12}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ for
the sink particle formation and the onset of the stiff equation of state to study the late, intermediate,
and early stages in the evolution of the protostar, respectively. We follow its growth from masses
$\simeq 10\,\text{M}_\odot$ to $\simeq 10^5\,\text{M}_\odot$, with an average accretion rate
of $\langle\dot{M}_\star\rangle \simeq 2\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for sink particles,
and $\simeq 0.8 - 1.4\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for the adiabatic cores. At the end of
the simulations, the HII region generated by radiation from the central object has long detached
from the protostellar photosphere, but the ionizing radiation remains trapped in the inner host
halo, and has thus not yet escaped into the intergalactic medium. Fully coupled, radiation-hydrodynamics
simulations hold the key for further progress.
