Aims: AT 2018hso is a new transient showing transitional properties between those of LRNe and the
class of intermediate luminosity red transients (ILRTs) similar to SN 2008S. Through the detailed
analysis of the observed parameters, our study support that it actually belongs to the LRN class,
and was likely produced by the coalescence of two massive stars. Methods: We obtained ten months
of optical and near-infrared photometric monitoring, and eleven epochs of low-resolution optical
spectroscopy of AT~2018hso. We compared its observed properties with those of other ILRTs and LRNe.
We also inspected the archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained about 15 years ago to
constrain the progenitor's properties. Results: The light curves of AT 2018hso show a first sharp
peak (Mr = -13.93 mag), followed by a broader and shallower second peak, that resembles a plateau
in the optical bands. The spectra dramatically change with time. Early time spectra show prominent
Balmer emission lines and a weak Ca II] doublet, which is usually observed in ILRTs. However, the
major decrease in the continuum temperature, the appearance of narrow metal absorption lines,
the major change in the H$\alpha$ strength and profile, and the emergence of molecular bands support
a LRN classification. The possible detection of an I ~ -8 mag source at the position of AT 2018hso in
HST archive images is consistent with expectations for a pre-merger massive binary, similar to
the precursor of the 2015 LRN in M101. Conclusions: We provide reasonable arguments to support a
LRN classification for AT~2018hso. This study reveals growing heterogeneity in the observables
of LRNe than thought in the past, making sometimes tricky the discrimination between LRNe and ILRTs.
This suggests the need of monitoring the entire evolution of gap transients to avoid misclassifications.
