We studied the polarised spectrum of the post-AGB binary system 89\,Herculis on the basis of data
collected with the high resolution \emph{Catania Astrophysical Observatory Spectropolarimeter},
\emph{HArps-North POlarimeter} and \emph{Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observation
of Stars}. We find the existence of linear polarisation in the strongest metal lines in absorption
and with low excitation potentials. Signals are characterized by complex Q and U morphologies varying
with the orbital period. As possible origin of this "Second Solar Spectrum"-like behaviour, we
rule out magnetic fields, continuum depolarisation due pulsations and hot spots. { The linear polarisation
we detected also in the Ca{\sc ii}\,8662\AA\, line is a clear evidence of optical pumping polarisation
and it rules out the scattering polarisation from free electrons of the circumbinary environment.}
In the framework of optical pumping due to the secondary star, the observed periodic properties
of the spectral line polarisation can be justied by two jets, flow velocity of few tens of km\,s$^{-1}$,
at the basis of that hour-glass structure characterising 89\,Herculis. We also discovered linear
polarisation across the emission profile of metal lines. Numerical simulations show that these
polarised profiles could be formed in an undisrupted circumbinary disk rotating at $\le$10 km\,s$^{-1}$
and whose orientation in the sky is in agreement with optical and radio interferometric results.
We conclude that the study of those aspherical enevlopes, whose origin is not yet completely understood,
of PNe and already present in the post-AGB's, can benefit of high resolution spectropolarimetry
and that this technique can shape envelopes still too far for interferometry.
