High precision cosmological distance measurements towards individual objects such as time delay
gravitational lenses or type Ia supernovae are affected by weak lensing perturbations by galaxies
and groups along the line of sight. In time delay gravitational lenses, "external convergence,"
kappa, can dominate the uncertainty in the inferred distances and hence cosmological parameters.
In this paper we attempt to reconstruct kappa, due to line of sight structure, using a simple halo
model. We use mock catalogues from the Millennium Simulation, and calibrate and compare our reconstructed
P(kappa) to ray-traced kappa "truth" values; taking into account realistic observational uncertainties.
We find that the reconstruction of kappa provides an improvement in precision of ~50% over galaxy
number counts. We find that the lowest-kappa lines of sight have the best constrained P(kappa).
In anticipation of large future samples of lenses, we find that selecting the third of the systems
with the highest precision kappa estimates gives a sample of unbiased time delay distance measurements
with just ~1% uncertainty due to line of sight external convergence effects. Photometric data are
sufficient to pre-select the best-constrained lines of sight, and can be done before investment
in light-curve monitoring. Conversely, we show that selecting lines of sight with high external
shear could, with the reconstruction model presented, induce biases of up to 1% in time delay distance.
We find that a major potential source of systematic error is uncertainty in the high mass end of the
stellar mass-halo mass relation; this could introduce ~2% biases on the time-delay distance if
completely ignored. We suggest areas for the improvement of this general analysis framework (including
more sophisticated treatment of high mass structures) that should allow yet more accurate cosmological
inferences to be made.
