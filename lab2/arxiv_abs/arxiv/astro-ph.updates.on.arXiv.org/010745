Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play a decisive role in driving space weather, especially, the fast
ones (e.g., with speeds above $800$~km~s$^{-1}$). Understanding the trigger mechanisms of fast
CMEs can help us gaining important information in forecasting them. The filament eruptions accompanied
with CMEs provide a good tracer in studying the early evolution of CMEs. Here we surveyed 66 filament-accompanied
fast CMEs to analyse the correlation between the trigger mechanisms, namely either magnetic reconnection
or ideal MHD process, associated flares, and CME speeds. Based on the data gathering from SDO, GONG
and STEREO, we find that: (1) Active region (AR) filament and intermediate filaments (IFs) eruptions
show a higher probability for producing fast CMEs than quiet Sun (QS) filaments, while the probability
of polar crown (PC) filament eruptions is zero in our statistic; (2) AR filament eruptions that produce
fast CMEs are more likely triggered by magnetic reconnection, while QS and IFs are more likely triggered
by ideal MHD process; (3) For AR filaments and IFs, it seems that the specific trigger mechanism does
not have a significant influence on the resulted CME speeds, while for the QS filaments, the ideal
MHD mechanism can more likely generate a faster CME; (4) Comparing with previous statistic study,
the onset heights of filament eruptions and the decay indexes of the overlying field show some differences:
for AR filaments and IFs, the decay indexes are larger and much closer to the theoretical threshold,
while for QS filaments, the onset heights are higher than those obtained in previous results.
