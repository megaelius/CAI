We determine the viability of exploiting lensing time delays to observe strongly gravitationally
lensed supernovae (gLSNe) from the moment of explosion. Assuming a plausible discovery strategy,
the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) will discover
$\sim$ 110 and $\sim$ 1 systems per year before the supernova (SN) explosion in the final image respectively.
Systems will be identified 11.7$^{+29.8}_{-9.3}$ days before the final explosion. We then explore
the possibility of constraining progenitor models with early phase observations for Type IIP and
Type Ia SNe in LSST discovered systems. Using a simulated Type IIP explosion, we predict that the
shock breakout in one trailing image per year will peak at $\lesssim$ 24.1 mag ($\lesssim$ 23.3)
in the $B$-band ($F218W$), however evolving over a timescale of $\sim$ 30 minutes. Using an analytic
model of Type Ia companion interaction, we find that in the $B$-band we should observe at least one
shock cooling emission event per year that peaks at $\lesssim$ 26.3 mag ($\lesssim$ 29.6) assuming
all Type Ia gLSNe have a 1 M$_\odot$ red giant (main sequence) companion. We perform Bayesian analysis
to investigate how well deep observations with 1 hour exposures on the European Extremely Large
Telescope would discriminate between Type Ia progenitor populations. We find that if all Type Ia
SNe evolved from the double-degenerate channel, then observations of the lack of early blue flux
in 10 (50) trailing images would rule out more than 27% (19%) of the population having 1 M$_\odot$
main sequence companions at 95% confidence.
