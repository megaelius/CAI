The search for periodic signals from blazars has become an actively pursued field of research in
recent years. This is because periodic signals bring us information about the processes occurring
near the innermost regions of blazars, which are mostly inaccessible to our direct view. Such signals
provide insights into some of the extreme conditions that take place in the vicinity of supermassive
black holes that lead to the launch of the relativistic jets. In addition, studies of characteristic
timescales in blazar light curves shed light on some of the challenging issues in blazar physics
that includes disk-jet connection, strong gravity near fast rotating supermassive black holes
and release of gravitational waves from binary supermassive black hole systems. However, a number
of issues associated with the search quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in blazar e.g., red-noise
dominance, modest significance of the detection, periodic modulation lasting for only a couple
of cycles and their transient nature, make it difficult to estimate the true significance of the
detection. Consequently, it also becomes difficult to make meaningful inferences about the nature
of the on-going processes. In this proceedings, results of study focused on searching QPOs in a number
of blazar multi-frequency light curves are summarized. The time series analyses of long term observations
of the blazars revealed presence of year-timescale QPOs in the sources including OJ 287 (optical),
Mrk 501 (gamma-ray), J1043+2408 (radio) and PKS 0219-164 (radio). As likely explanations, we discuss
a number of scenarios including binary supermassive black hole systems, Lense-Thirring precession,
and jet precession.
