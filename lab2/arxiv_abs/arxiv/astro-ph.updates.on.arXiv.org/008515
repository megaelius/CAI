We analyse a unique sample of 517 bright ($L>L^{*}$) LBGs at redshift z$\sim$3 in order to characterize
the distribution of their UV slopes $\beta$ and infer their dust extinction under standard assumptions.
We exploit multi-band observations over 750 arcmin$^2$ of the COSMOS field acquired with three
different ground based facilities: Large Binocular Camera (LBC) on the Large Binocular Telescope
(LBT), Suprime-Cam on the SUBARU telescope and VIRCAM on the VISTA telescope (ULTRAVISTA DR2).
Our multi-band photometric catalogue is based on a new method designed to maximize the signal-to-noise
ratio in the estimate of accurate galaxy colours from images with different point spread functions
(PSF). We adopt an improved selection criterion based on deep Y band data to isolate a sample of galaxies
at $z\sim 3$ minimizing selection biases. We measure the UV slopes ($\beta$) of the objects in our
sample and then recover the intrinsic probability density function of $\beta$ values (PDF($\beta$))
taking into account the effect of observational uncertainties through detailed simulations.
The galaxies in our sample are characterized by mildly red UV slopes with $<\beta>\simeq -1.70$
across all the luminosity range probed by our data ($-24\lesssim M_{1600}\lesssim -21$). The resulting
dust-corrected star formation rate density is $log(SFRD)\simeq-1.6 M_{\odot}/yr/Mpc^{3}$,
corresponding to a contribution of about 25% to the total SFRD at z$\sim$3 under standard assumptions.
Ultra-bright LBGs at $z \sim 3$ match the known trends with UV slopes being redder at decreasing redshifts,
and brighter galaxies being more dust-extincted and more star-forming than fainter ones. [abridged]
