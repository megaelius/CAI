The absorption features of olivine in visible and near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra are
the key spectral parameters in its mineralogical studies. Generally, these spectral parameters
can be obtained by exploiting the Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) with a proper continuum removal.
However, different continua may change the deconvolution results of these parameters. This paper
investigates the diagnostic spectral features of olivine with diverse chemical compositions.
Four different continuum removal methods with MGM for getting the deconvolution results are presented
and the regression equations for predicting the Mg-number (Fo#) are introduced. The results show
that different continua superimposed on the mineral absorption features will make the absorption
center shift, as well as the obvious alterations in shape, width, and strength of the absorption
band. Additionally, it is also found that the logarithm of a second-order polynomial continuum
can match the overall shape of the spectrum in logarithmic space, and the improved regression equations
applied to estimate the chemical composition of olivine-dominated spectra also have a better performance.
As an application example, the improved approach is applied to pulse laser irradiated olivine grains
to simulate and study the space weathering effects on olivine diagnostic spectral features. The
experiments confirm that space weathering can make the absorption band center shift toward longer
wavelength. Therefore, the Fo# estimated from remote sensing spectra may be less than its actual
chemical composition. These results may provide valuable information for revealing the difference
between the spectra of olivine grains and olivine-dominated asteroids.
