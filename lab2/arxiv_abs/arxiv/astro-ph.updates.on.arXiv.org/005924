Galaxies at low-redshift typically possess negative gas-phase metallicity gradients (centres
more metal-rich than their outskirts). Whereas, it is not uncommon to observe positive metallicity
gradients in higher-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 0.6$). Bridging these epochs, we present gas-phase
metallicity gradients of 84 star-forming galaxies between $0.08 < z < 0.84$. Using the galaxies
with reliably determined metallicity gradients, we measure the median metallicity gradient to
be negative ($-0.039^{+0.007}_{-0.009}$ dex/kpc). Underlying this, however, is significant
scatter: $(8\pm3)\%\ [7]$ of galaxies have significantly positive metallicity gradients, $(38
\pm 5)\%\ [32]$ have significantly negative gradients, $(31\pm5)\%\ [26]$ have gradients consistent
with being flat. (The remaining $(23\pm5)\%\ [19]$ have unreliable gradient estimates.) We notice
a slight trend for a more negative metallicity gradient with both increasing stellar mass and increasing
star formation rate (SFR). However, given the potential redshift and size selection effects, we
do not consider these trends to be significant. Indeed, once we normalize the SFR relative to that
of the main sequence, we do not observe any trend between the metallicity gradient and the normalized
SFR. This is contrary to recent studies of galaxies at similar and higher redshifts. We do, however,
identify a novel trend between the metallicity gradient of a galaxy and its size. Small galaxies
($r_d < 3$ kpc) present a large spread in observed metallicity gradients (both negative and positive
gradients). In contrast, we find no large galaxies ($r_d > 3$ kpc) with positive metallicity gradients,
and overall there is less scatter in the metallicity gradient amongst the large galaxies. These
large (well-evolved) galaxies may be analogues of present-day galaxies, which also show a common
negative metallicity gradient.
