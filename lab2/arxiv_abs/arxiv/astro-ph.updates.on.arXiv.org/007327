We present high angular resolution 0.2 arcsec continuum and molecular emission line Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of G17.64+0.16 in Band 6 (220GHz) taken
as part of a campaign in search of circumstellar discs around (proto)-O-stars. At a resolution of
400au the main continuum core is essentially unresolved and isolated from other strong and compact
emission peaks. At a resolution of 400au the main continuum core is essentially unresolved and isolated
from other strong and compact emission peaks. We detect SiO (5-4) emission that is marginally resolved
and elongated in a direction perpendicular to the large-scale outflow seen in the 13CO (2-1) line
using the main ALMA array in conjunction with the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). Morphologically,
the SiO appears to represent a disc-like structure. Using parametric models we show that the position-velocity
profile of the SiO is consistent with the Keplerian rotation of a disc around an object between 10-30Mo
in mass, only if there is also radial expansion from a separate structure. The radial motion component
can be interpreted as a disc wind from the disc surface. Models with a central stellar object mass
between 20 and 30Mo are the most consistent with the stellar luminosity (100000 Lo) and indicative
of an O-type star. The H30a millimetre recombination line (231.9GHz) is also detected, but spatially
unresolved, and is indicative of a very compact, hot, ionised region co-spatial with the dust continuum
core. Accounting for all observables, we suggest that G17.64 is consistent with a O-type young stellar
object in the final stages of protostellar assembly, driving a wind, but that has not yet developed
into a compact HII region. The existance and detection of the disc in G17.64 is likely related to its
isolated and possibly more evolved nature, traits which may underpin discs in similar sources.
