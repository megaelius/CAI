This paper is concerned with the comparison of semi-analytical and non-averaged propagation methods
for Earth satellite orbits. We analyse the total integration error for semi-analytical methods
and propose a novel decomposition into dynamical, model truncation, short-periodic, and numerical
error components. The first three are attributable to distinct approximations required by the
method of averaging, which fundamentally limit the attainable accuracy. In contrast, numerical
error, the only component present in non-averaged methods, can be significantly mitigated by employing
adaptive numerical algorithms and regularized formulations of the equations of motion. We present
a collection of non-averaged methods based on the integration of existing regularized formulations
of the equations of motion through an adaptive solver. We implemented the collection in the orbit
propagation code THALASSA, which we make publicly available, and we compared the non-averaged
methods to the semi-analytical method implemented in the orbit propagation tool STELA through
numerical tests involving long-term propagations (on the order of decades) of LEO, GTO, and high-altitude
HEO orbits. For the test cases considered, regularized non-averaged methods were found to be up
to two times slower than semi-analytical for the LEO orbit, to have comparable speed for the GTO,
and to be ten times as fast for the HEO (for the same accuracy). We show for the first time that efficient
implementations of non-averaged regularized formulations of the equations of motion, and especially
of non-singular element methods, are attractive candidates for the long-term study of high-altitude
and highly elliptical Earth satellite orbits.
