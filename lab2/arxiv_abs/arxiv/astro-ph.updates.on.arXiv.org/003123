The Madala hypothesis was proposed by members of the Wits-ATLAS group to account for several anomalies
in both ATLAS and CMS data at the LHC. This hypothesis extends the standard model through the addition
of two scalar bosons and a hidden sector that can provide a dark matter candidate. This hidden sector
interacts with the standard model only through the mediation of one of these scalars S. The couplings
of S are not amenable to investigation in current collider data and so are assumed to be Higgs-like
to reduce the parameter space of the model. Our previous work (Beck & Colafrancesco 2016) has shown
that these couplings can be limited via indirect dark matter detection experiments in gamma-rays
(for resonant annihilations into S). Here we will treat the dark matter and S masses independently,
and we generalise our previous work and examine what fraction of the cosmological dark matter abundance
can be accounted for by particles in the hidden sector of the Madala hypothesis dark matter when these
annihilate to standard model products via a Higgs-like S. We will also extend our gamma-ray analysis
of Madala hypothesis dark matter to include the constraints of diffuse radio data from the Coma galaxy
cluster in addition to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data from both this target and the Reticulum II dwarf
galaxy. Our analysis indicates that either the Madala hypothesis cannot provide the bulk of cosmological
dark matter, or the S boson cannot be simply Higgs-like. These apply unless the candidate particle
exceeds a mass of 200 GeV. Both these scenarios may reduce the attractiveness of the hypothesis as
the second case will imply that many free parameters must be added to describe S, greatly weakening
fits for the model. To investigate the full consequences of this further work will necessitate using
larger astrophysical data sets to strongly constrain details about S.
