In hierarchical triple systems, the inner binary is perturbed by a distant companion. For large
mutual inclinations, the Lidov-Kozai mechanism secularly excites large eccentricity and inclination
oscillations of the inner binary. The maximal eccentricity attained, $e_{\rm max}$ is simply derived
and widely used. However, for mildly hierarchical systems (i.e. the companion is relatively close
and massive), non-secular perturbations affect the evolution. Here we account for fast non-secular
variations and find new analytic formula for $e_{{\rm max}}$, in terms of the system's hierarchy
level, correcting previous work and reproducing the orbital flip criteria. We find that $e_{{\rm
max}}$ is generally enhanced, allowing closer encounters between the inner binary components,
thus significantly changing their interaction and its final outcome. We then extend our approach
to include additional relativistic and tidal forces. Using our results, we show that the merger
time of gravitational-wave (GW) sources orbiting massive black-holes in galactic nuclei is enhanced
compared with previous analysis accounting only for the secular regime. Consequently, this affects
the distribution and rates of such GW sources in the relevant mild-hierarchy regime. We test and
confirm our predictions with direct N-body and 2.5-level Post-Newtonian codes. Finally, we calculate
the formation and disruption rates of hot-Jupiters (HJ) in planetary systems using a statistical
approach, which incorporates our novel results for $e_{{\rm max}}$. We find that more HJ migrate
from further out, but they are also tidally disrupted more frequently. Remarkably, the overall
formation rate of HJs remains similar to that found in previous studies. Nevertheless, the different
rates could manifest in different underlying distribution of observed warm-Jupiters.
