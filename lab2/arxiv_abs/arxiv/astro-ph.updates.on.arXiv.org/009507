We report the discovery of the microlensing planet OGLE-2018-BLG-0740Lb. The planet is detected
with a very strong signal of $\Delta\chi^2\sim 4630$, but the interpretation of the signal suffers
from two types of degeneracies. One type is caused by the previously known close/wide degeneracy,
and the other is caused by an ambiguity between two solutions, in which one solution requires to incorporate
finite-source effects, while the other solution is consistent with a point-source interpretation.
Although difficult to be firmly resolved based on only the photometric data, the degeneracy is resolved
in strong favor of the point-source solution with the additional external information obtained
from astrometric and spectroscopic observations. The small astrometric offset between the source
and baseline object supports that the blend is the lens and this interpretation is further secured
by the consistency of the spectroscopic distance estimate of the blend with the lensing parameters
of the point-source solution. The estimated mass of the host is $1.0\pm 0.1~M_\odot$ and the mass
of the planet is $4.5\pm 0.6~M_{\rm J}$ (close solution) or $4.8\pm 0.6~M_{\rm J}$ (wide solution)
and the lens is located at a distance of $3.2\pm 0.5$~kpc. The bright nature of the lens, with $I\sim
17.1$ ($V\sim 18.2$), combined with its dominance of the observed flux suggest that radial-velocity
(RV) follow-up observations of the lens can be done using high-resolution spectrometers mounted
on large telescopes, e.g., VLT/ESPRESSO, and this can potentially not only measure the period and
eccentricity of the planet but also probe for close-in planets. We estimate that the expected RV
amplitude would be $\sim 60\sin i ~{\rm m~s}^{-1}$.
