We present a kinematic analysis of a sample of 23,908 G- and K-type dwarfs in the Galactic disk. Based
on the $\alpha$-abundance ratio, [$\alpha$/Fe], we separated our sample into low-$\alpha$ thin-disk
and high-$\alpha$ thick-disk stars. We find a $V_{\rm \phi}$ gradient of $-$28.2 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$
over [Fe/H] for the thin disk, and an almost flat trend of the velocity dispersions of $V_{\rm R}$,
$V_{\rm \phi}$, and $V_{\rm Z}$ components with [Fe/H]. The metal-poor (MP; [Fe/H] $<$ $-$0.3)
thin-disk stars with low-$V_{\rm \phi}$ velocities have high eccentricities ($e$) and small perigalacticon
distances ($r_{\rm p}$), while the high-$V_{\rm \phi}$ MP thin-disk stars possess low $e$ and large
$r_{\rm p}$. Interestingly, half of the super metal-rich ([Fe/H] $>$ $+$0.1) stars in the thin disk
exhibit low-$e$, solar-like orbits. Accounting for the inhomogeneous metallicity distribution
of the thin-disk stars with various kinematics requires radial migration by churning $-$ it apparently
strongly influences the current structure of the thin disk; we cannot rule out the importance of
blurring for the high-$e$ stars. We derive a rotation velocity gradient of $+$36.9 km s$^{-1}$ dex$^{-1}$
for the thick disk, and decreasing trends of velocity dispersions with increasing [Fe/H]. The thick-disk
population also has a broad distribution of eccentricity, and the number of high-$e$ stars increases
with decreasing [Fe/H]. These kinematic behaviors could be the result of a violent mechanism, such
as a gas-rich merger or the presence of giant turbulent clumps, early in the history of its formation.
Dynamical heating by minor mergers and radial migration may also play roles in forming the current
thick-disk structure.
