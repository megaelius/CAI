The next generation of large aperture ground based telescopes will offer the opportunity to perform
accurate stellar photometry in very crowded fields. This future capability will allow one to study
in detail the stellar population in distant galaxies. In this paper we explore the effect of photometric
errors on the stellar metallicity distribution derived from the color distribution of the Red Giant
Branch stars in the central regions of galaxies at the distance of the Virgo cluster. We focus on the
analysis of the Color-Magnitude Diagrams at different radii in a typical giant Elliptical galaxy
obtained from synthetic data constructed to exemplify observations of the European Extremely
Large Telescope. The simulations adopt the specifications of the first light high resolution imager
MICADO and the expected performance of the Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics Module MAORY. We find
that the foreseen photometric accuracy allows us to recover the shape of the metallicity distribution
with a resolution $\lesssim 0.4$ dex in the inner regions ($\mu_{\rm B}$ = 20.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$)
and $\simeq 0.2$ dex in regions with $\mu_{\rm B}$ = 21.6 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, that corresponds to
approximately half of the effective radius for a typical giant elliptical in Virgo. At the effective
radius ($\mu_{\rm B} \simeq 23$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$), the metallicity distribution is recovered
with a resolution of $\simeq 0.1$ dex. It will thus be possible to study in detail the metallicity
gradient of the stellar population over (almost) the whole extension of galaxies in Virgo. We also
evaluate the impact of moderate degradations of the Point Spread Function from the assumed optimal
conditions and find similar results, showing that this science case is robust.
