At least 30% of main sequence stars host planets with sizes between 1 and 4 Earth radii and orbital
periods of less than 100 days. We use N-body simulations including a model for gas-assisted pebble
accretion and disk-planet tidal interaction to study the formation of super-Earth systems. We
show that the integrated pebble mass reservoir creates a bifurcation between hot super-Earths
or hot-Neptunes ($\lesssim15M_{\oplus}$) and super-massive planetary cores potentially able
to become gas giant planets ($\gtrsim15M_{\oplus}$). Simulations with moderate pebble fluxes
grow multiple super-Earth-mass planets that migrate inwards and pile up at the disk's inner edge
forming long resonant chains. We follow the long-term dynamical evolution of these systems and
use the period ratio distribution of observed planet-pairs to constrain our model. Up to $\sim$95%
of resonant chains become dynamically unstable after the gas disk dispersal, leading to a phase
of late collisions that breaks the resonant configuration. Our simulations match observations
if we combine a dominant fraction ($\gtrsim95\%$) of unstable systems with a sprinkling ($\lesssim5\%$)
of stable resonant chains (the Trappist-1 system represents one such example). Our results demonstrate
that super-Earth systems are inherently multiple (${\rm N\geq2}$) and that the observed excess
of single-planet transits is a consequence of the mutual inclinations excited by the planet-planet
instability. In simulations in which planetary seeds are initially distributed in the inner and
outer disk, close-in super-Earths are systematically ice-rich. This contrasts with the interpretation
that most super-Earths are rocky based on bulk density measurements of super-Earths and photo-evaporation
modeling of their bimodal radius distribution. We investigate the conditions needed to form rocky
super-Earths. The formation of rocky super-Earths (abridged)
