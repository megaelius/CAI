We analyse interferometric data obtained for Regulus with AMBER (Astronomical Multi- BEam combineR)
at high spectral resolution ($\lambda/\delta\lambda \approx 12000$) across the Br$\gamma$ spectral
line. The study of the photocentre displacement allows us to constrain a large number of stellar
parameters -- equatorial radius $R_{\rm eq}$, equatorial velocity $V_{\rm eq}$, inclination
$i$, rotation-axis position angle $PA_{\rm rot}$, and flattening -- with an estimation of gravity-darkening
coefficient $\beta$ using previously published theoretical results. We use the Simulation Code
of Interferometric-observations for ROtators and CirCumstellar Objects (SCIROCCO), a semi-analytical
algorithm dedicated to fast rotators. We chose Regulus because it is a very well-known edge-on star,
for which an alternative approach is needed to check the previously published results. Our analysis
showed that a significant degeneracy of solution is present. By confronting the results obtained
by differential interferometry with those obtained by conventional long-base interferometry,
we obtain similar results (within the uncertainties), thereby validating our approach, where
$V_{eq}$ and $i$ are found separately. From the photocentre displacement, we can independently
deduce $PA_{rot}$. We use two minimization methods to restrict observed stellar parameters via
a fast rotator model: a non-stochastic method ($\chi^2$ fit) and a stochastic one (Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method), in order to check whether the correct global minimum is achieved particularly
with respect to the degeneracies of the gravity darkening parameter $\beta$, where we demonstrate,
using a quantitative analysis of parameters, that the estimate of $\beta$ is easier for stars with
an inclination angle of around $45^\circ$.
