Magnetic activity cycles are an important phenomenon in both the Sun and other stars. The shape of
the solar cycle is commonly characterised by a fast rise and a slower decline, but not much attention
has been paid to the shape of cycles in other stars. Our aim is to study whether the asymmetric shape
of the solar cycle is common in other stars as well, and compare the cycle asymmetry to other stellar
parameters. We also study the differences in the shape of the solar cycle, depending on what activity
indicator is used. The observations are also compared to simulated activity cycles. We use the chromospheric
Ca II H&K data from the Mount Wilson Observatory HK Project. From this data set we identify 47 individual
cycles from 18 stars. We use the statistical skewness of a cycle as a measure of its asymmetry, and
compare this to other stellar parameters. A similar analysis has been done to magnetic cycles extracted
from direct numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar-type convection zones. The shape
of the solar cycle (fast rise and slower decline) is common in other stars as well, although the Sun
has particularly asymmetric cycles. Cycle-to-cycle variations are large, but the average shape
of a cycle is still fairly well represented by a sinusoid. We find only slight correlations between
the cycle asymmetry and other stellar parameters. There are large differences in the shape of the
solar cycle, depending on what activity indicator is used. In the simulated cycles, there is a difference
in the symmetry of global simulations covering the full longitudinal range, hence capable of exciting
non-axisymmetric dynamo modes, versus wedge simulations covering a partial extent in longitude,
where only axisymmetric modes are possible. The former produce preferentially positive skewness,
while the latter a negative one.
