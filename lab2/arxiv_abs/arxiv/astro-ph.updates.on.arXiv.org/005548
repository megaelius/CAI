The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies ($\lambda_{\rm g}$) and for dark-matter
haloes ($\lambda_{\rm h}$), indicated both by simulations and observations, is naively interpreted
as a one-to-one correlation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to predict
galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via $R_{\rm e}\simeq\lambda_{\rm h} R_{\rm v}$, with $R_{\rm
e}$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and $R_{\rm v}$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites
of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we find that $\lambda_{\rm g}$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}$ are
in fact only barely correlated, especially at $z\geq 1$. A general smearing of this correlation
is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more recently accreted baryons through
streams gain and then lose significant angular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated
dark matter. Expecting the spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into $R_{\rm
v}$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between $\lambda_{\rm g}/\lambda_{\rm
h}$ and $\lambda_{\rm h}$, which can partly arise from mergers and a compact star-forming phase
that many galaxies undergo. On the other hand, the halo and galaxy spin vectors tend to be aligned,
with a median $\cos\theta=0.6$-0.7 between galaxy and halo, consistent with instreaming within
a preferred plane. The galaxy spin is better correlated with the spin of the inner halo, but this largely
reflects the effect of the baryons on the halo. Following the null spin correlation, $\lambda_{\rm
h}$ is not a useful proxy for $R_{\rm e}$. While our simulations reproduce a general relation of the
sort $R_{\rm e}=AR_{\rm vir}$, in agreement with observational estimates, the relation becomes
tighter with $A=0.02(c/10)^{-0.7}$, where $c$ is the halo concentration, which in turn introduces
a dependence on mass and redshift.
