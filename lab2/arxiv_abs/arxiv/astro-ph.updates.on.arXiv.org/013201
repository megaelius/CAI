SN 1993J is one of the best studied Type IIb supernovae. Spectropolarimetric data analyses were
published over two decades ago at a time when the field of supernova spectropolarimetry was in its
infancy. Here we present a new analysis of the spectropolarimetric data of SN 1993J and an improved
estimate of its interstellar polarization (ISP) as well as a critical review of ISP removal techniques
employed in the field. The polarization of SN 1993J is found to show significant alignment on the
$q-u$ plane, suggesting the presence of a dominant axis and therefore of continuum polarization.
We also see strong line polarization features, including $\mathrm{H\beta}$, He\,{\sc i} $\lambda
5876$, $\mathrm{H\alpha}$, He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 6678$, He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 7065$, and high velocity
(HV) components of He\,{\sc i} $\lambda 5876$ and $\mathrm{H\alpha}$. SN 1993J is therefore the
second example of a stripped envelope supernova, alongside iPTF13bvn, with prominent HV helium
polarization features, and the first to show a likely HV \halpha contribution. Overall, we determine
that the observed features can be interpreted as the superposition of anisotropically distributed
line forming regions over ellipsoidal ejecta. We cannot exclude the possibility of an off-axis
energy source within the ejecta. These data demonstrate the rich structures that are inaccessible
if solely considering the flux spectra but can be probed by spectropolarimetric observations.
In future studies, the new ISP corrected data can be used in conjunction with 3D radiative transfer
models to better map the geometry of the ejecta of SN 1993J.
