Neutrino-matter interactions play a key role in binary neutron star mergers. Thermodynamics conditions
at the surfaces where neutrinos decouple from matter influence neutrino spectra, ultimately affecting
the evolution of the remnant and the properties of the ejecta. In this work, we post-process results
of general relativistic merger simulations employing microphysical equations of state and approximate
neutrino transport to investigate the thermodynamics conditions at which weak and thermal equilibrium
freezes out (equilibrium surfaces), as well as conditions at which the transition between diffusion
and free-streaming regime occurs (diffusion surfaces). We find that the rest mass density and the
neutrino energy are the most relevant quantities in determining the location of the decoupling
surfaces. For mean energy neutrinos ($\langle E_{{\nu}_e} \rangle \approx 9~{\rm MeV}$, $\langle
E_{{\bar{\nu}}_e} \rangle \approx 15~{\rm MeV}$, $\langle E_{{\nu}_{\mu,\tau}} \rangle \approx
25~{\rm MeV}$), diffusion surfaces are located around $10^{11}{\rm g~cm^{-3}}$ for all neutrino
species, while equilibrium surfaces for heavy flavor neutrinos are significantly deeper (several
$10^{12}{\rm g~cm^{-3}}$) than the ones of $\bar{\nu}_e$ and $\nu_e$ ($\gtrsim 10^{11}{\rm g~cm^{-3}}$).
The resulting decoupling temperatures are in good agreement with the average neutrino energies
($\langle E_{\nu} \rangle \sim 3.15~T$), with the softer equation of state characterized by systematically
larger decoupling temperatures ($\Delta T \lesssim 1~{\rm MeV}$). Neutrinos streaming at infinity
with different energies come from very different regions of the remnant. The presence of a massive
NS or of a BH in the remnant influences the neutrino thermalization process.
