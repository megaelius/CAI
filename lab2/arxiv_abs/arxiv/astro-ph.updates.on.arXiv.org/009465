We propose a semi-analytical model for the self-intersection of the fallback stream in tidal disruption
events (TDEs). When the blackhole mass exceeds a critical value M_cr, a large fraction of the shocked
gas becomes unbound, in the form of a collision-induced outflow (CIO). This is because the large
apsidal precession causes the stream to self-intersect near the local escape speed at radius much
below the apocenter. The rest of the fallback gas is left in more tightly bound orbits and quickly
joins the accretion flow. We propose that the CIO is responsible for reprocessing the hard emission
from the accretion flow into the optical band. This picture naturally explains the large photospheric
radius (or low blackbody temperature) and typical widths of the H and/or He emission lines seen in
optically selected TDEs. We predict the CIO-reprocessed spectrum in the infrared to be L_\nu ~ \nu^{~0.5},
shallower than a blackbody. The partial sky coverage of the CIO also provides a unification of the
diverse X-ray behaviors of optically bright TDEs. According to this picture, optical surveys filter
out those TDEs with blackhole mass less than M_cr due to lack of a reprocessing layer. This filtering
causes the optical TDE rate to be lower than the total rate by a factor of ~10 or more. We also predict
that the volumetric rate of optically selected TDEs is nearly flat with respect to the blackhole
mass for M < 10^7 solar masses. When the CIO is decelerated by the ambient medium, radio emission at
the level of that in ASASSN-14li may be produced, but the timescales and peak luminosities can be
highly diverse. Finally, our method paves the way for global simulations of the disk formation process
by injecting gas at the intersection point according to the prescribed velocity and density profiles.
