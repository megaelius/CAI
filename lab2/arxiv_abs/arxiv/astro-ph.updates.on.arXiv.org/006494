The standard LambdaCDM model based on General Relativity (GR) including cold dark matter (CDM)
is very successful at fitting cosmological observations, but recent non-detections of candidate
dark matter (DM) particles mean that various modified-gravity theories remain of significant
interest. The latter generally involve modifications to GR below a critical acceleration scale
$\sim 10^{-10} \, m \, s^{-2}$. Wide-binary (WB) star systems with separations $> 5 \, kAU$ provide
an interesting test for modified gravity, due to being in or near the low-acceleration regime and
presumably containing negligible DM. Here, we explore the prospects for new observations pending
from the GAIA spacecraft to provide tests of GR against MOND or TeVes-like theories in a regime only
partially explored to date. In particular, we find that a histogram of (3D) binary relative velocities
against circular velocity predicted from the (2D) projected separations predicts a rather sharp
feature in this distribution for standard gravity, with an 80th (90th) percentile value close to
1.025 (1.14) with rather weak dependence on the eccentricity distribution. However, MOND/TeVeS
theories produce a shifted distribution, with a significant increase in these upper percentiles.
In MOND-like theories {\em without} an external field effect, there are large shifts of order unity.
With the external field effect included, the shifts are considerably reduced to $\sim 0.04 - 0.08$,
but are still potentially detectable statistically given reasonably large samples and good control
of contaminants. In principle, followup of GAIA-selected wide binaries with ground-based radial
velocities accurate to < 0.03 km/s should be able to produce an interesting new constraint on modified-gravity
theories.
