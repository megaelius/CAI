Comparing with a wide range of covariant energy density functional models based on the finite-range
meson-exchange representation, the relativistic mean-field models with the zero-range contact
interaction, namely the relativistic point-coupling models, are still infrequent to be utilized
in establishing nuclear equation of state (EoS) and investigating neutron star properties, although
comprehensive applications and achievements of them in describing many nuclear properties both
in ground and exited states are mature. In this work, the EoS of neutron star matter is established
constructively in the framework of the relativistic point-coupling models to study neutron star
physics. Taking two selected functionals DD-PC1 and PC-PK1 as examples, nuclear symmetry energies
and several neutron star properties including proton fractions, mass-radius relations, the core-crust
transition density, the fraction of crustal moment of inertia and dimensionless tidal deformabilities
are discussed. A suppression of pressure of neutron star matter found in the functional PC-PK1 at
high densities results in the difficulty of its prediction when approaching to the maximum mass
of neutron stars. In addition, the divergences between two selected functionals in describing
neutron star quantities mentioned above are still large, ascribing to the less constrained behavior
of these functionals at high densities. Then it is expected that the constraints on the dense matter
EoS from precise and massive modern astronomical observations, such as the tidal-deformabilities
taken from gravitational-wave events, would be essential to improve the parameterizing of the
relativistic point-coupling models.
