Supermassive black holes and intermediate mass black holes are believed to exist in the Universe.
There is no established astrophysical explanation for their origin and considerations have been
made in the literature that those massive black holes (MBHs) may be primordial black holes (PBHs),
black holes which are formed in the early universe (well before the matter-radiation equality)
due to the direct collapse of primordial overdensities. This paper aims at discussing the possibility
of excluding the PBH scenario as the origin of the MBHs. We first revisit the constraints on PBHs obtained
from the CMB distortion that the seed density perturbation causes. By adopting a recent computation
of the CMB distortion sourced by the seed density perturbation and the stronger constraint on the
CMB distortion set by the COBE/FIRAS experiment used in the literature, we find that PBHs in the mass
range $6\times 10^4~M_\odot \sim 5 \times 10^{13}~M_\odot$ are excluded. Since PBHs lighter than
$6 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ are not excluded from the non-observation of the CMB distortion, we propose
a new method which can potentially exclude smaller PBHs as well. Based on the observation that large
density perturbations required to create PBHs also result in the copious production of ultracompact
minihalos (UCMHs), compact dark matter halos formed at around the recombination, we show that weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as dark matter annihilate efficiently inside UCMHs to yield
cosmic rays far exceeding the observed flux. Our bound gives severe restriction on the compatibility
between the particle physics models for WIMPs and the PBH scenario as the explanation of MBHs.
