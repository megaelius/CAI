We present $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared light curves of 33 $\gamma$-ray
bright blazars over four years that we have been monitoring since 2008 August with multiple optical,
ground-based telescopes and the Swift satellite, and augmented by data from the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope and other publicly available data from Swift. The sample consists of 21 flat-spectrum
radio quasars (FSRQs) and 12 BL Lac objects (BL Lacs). We identify quiescent and active states of
the sources based on their $\gamma$-ray behavior. We derive $\gamma$-ray, X-ray, and optical spectral
indices, $\alpha_\gamma$, $\alpha_X$, and $\alpha_o$, respectively ($F_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha$),
and construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) during quiescent and active states. We analyze
the relationships between different spectral indices, blazar classes, and activity states. We
find (i) significantly steeper $\gamma$-ray spectra of FSRQs than for BL Lacs during quiescent
states, but a flattening of the spectra for FSRQs during active states while the BL Lacs show no significant
change; (ii) a small difference of $\alpha_X$ within each class between states, with BL Lac X-ray
spectra significantly steeper than in FSRQs; (iii) a highly peaked distribution of X-ray spectral
slopes of FSRQs at $\sim-$0.60, but a very broad distribution of $\alpha_X$ of BL Lacs during active
states; (iv) flattening of the optical spectra of FSRQs during quiescent states, but no statistically
significant change of $\alpha_o$ of BL Lacs between states; and (v) a positive correlation between
optical and $\gamma$-ray spectral slopes of BL Lacs, with similar values of the slopes. We discuss
the findings with respect to the relative prominence of different components of high-energy and
optical emission as the flux state changes.
