Context: The gravitational lensing time delay method provides a one-step determination of the
Hubble constant (H0) with an uncertainty level on par with the cosmic distance ladder method. However,
to further investigate the nature of the dark energy, a H0 estimate down to 1% level is greatly needed.
This requires dozens of strongly lensed quasars that are yet to be delivered by ongoing and forthcoming
all-sky surveys. Aims: In this work we aim to determine the spectroscopic redshift of PSOJ0147,
the first strongly lensed quasar candidate found in the Pan-STARRS survey. The main goal of our work
is to derive an accurate redshift estimate of the background quasar for cosmography. Methods: To
obtain timely spectroscopically follow-up, we took advantage of the fast-track service programme
that is carried out by the Nordic Optical Telescope. Using a grism covering 3200 - 9600 A, we identified
prominent emission line features, such as Ly-alpha, N V, O I, C II, Si IV, C IV, and [C III] in the spectra
of the background quasar of the PSOJ0147 lens system. This enables us to determine accurately the
redshift of the background quasar. Results: The spectrum of the background quasar exhibits prominent
absorption features bluewards of the strong emission lines, such as Ly-alpha, N V, and C IV. These
blue absorption lines indicate that the background source is a broad absorption line (BAL) quasar.
Unfortunately, the BAL features hamper an accurate determination of redshift using the above-mentioned
strong emission lines. Nevertheless, we are able to determine a redshift of 2.341+/-0.001 from
three of the four lensed quasar images with the clean forbidden line [C III]. In addition, we also
derive a maximum outflow velocity of ~ 9800 km/s with the broad absorption features bluewards of
the C IV emission line. This value of maximum outflow velocity is in good agreement with other BAL
quasars.
