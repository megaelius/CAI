We consider whether equilibrium size distributions from collisional cascades match the frequency
of impactors derived from New Horizons crater counts on Charon (Singer et al 2019). Using an analytic
model and a suite of numerical simulations, we demonstrate that collisional cascades generate
wavy size distributions; the morphology of the waves depends on the binding energy of solids $Q_d^\star$
and the collision velocity $v_c$. For an adopted minimum size of solids, $r_{min}$ = 1 micron, and
collision velocity $v_c$ = 1-3 km/sec, the waves are rather insensitive to the gravitational component
of $Q_d^\star$. If the bulk strength component of $Q_d^\star$ is $Q_s r^{e_s}$ for particles with
radius $r$, size distributions with small $Q_s$ are much wavier than those with large $Q_s$; systems
with $e_s \approx -0.4$ have stronger waves than systems with $e_s \approx 0$. Detailed comparisons
with the New Horizons data suggest that a collisional cascade among solids with a bulk strength intermediate
between weak ice (Leinhardt & Stewart 2012) and normal ice (Schlichting et al 2013) produces size
distributions fairly similar to the size distribution of impactors on Charon. If the surface density
$\Sigma$ of the protosolar nebula varies with semimajor axis $a$ as $\Sigma \approx 30~{\rm g~cm^{-2}}
(a / {\rm 1~au})^{-3/2}$, the time scale for a cascade to generate an approximate equilibrium is
100-300 Myr at 45 au and 10-30 Myr at 25 au. Although it is necessary to perform more complete evolutionary
calculations of the Kuiper belt, collisional cascades are a viable model for producing the size
distribution of solids that impacted Charon throughout its history.
