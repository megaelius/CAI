After the termination shock (TS) crossing, the Voyager 2 spacecraft has been observing strong variations
of the magnetic field and solar wind parameters in the heliosheath. Anomalous cosmic rays, electrons,
and galactic cosmic rays present strong intensity fluctuations. Several works suggested that
the fluctuations might be attributed to spatial variations within the heliosheath. Additionally,
the variability of the solar wind in this region is caused by different temporal events that occur
near the Sun and propagate to the outer heliosphere. To understand the spatial and temporal effects
in the heliosheath, it is important to study these effects separately. In this work we explore the
role of shocks as one type of temporal effects in the dynamics of the heliosheath. Although currently
plasma in the heliosheath is dominated by solar minima conditions, with increasing solar cycle
shocks associated with transients will play an important role. We used a 3D MHD multi-fluid model
of the interaction between the solar wind and the local interstellar medium to study the propagation
of a pair of forward-reverse shocks in the supersonic solar wind, interaction with the TS, and propagation
to the heliosheath. We found that in the supersonic solar wind the interaction region between the
shocks expands, the shocks weaken and decelerate. The fluctuation amplitudes of the plasma parameters
vary with heliocentric distance. The interaction of the pair of shocks with the TS creates a variety
of new waves and discontinuities in the heliosheath, which produce a highly variable solar wind
flow. The collision of the forward shock with the heliopause causes a reflection of fast magnetosonic
waves inside the heliosheath.
