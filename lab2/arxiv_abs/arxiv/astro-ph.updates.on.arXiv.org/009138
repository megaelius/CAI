Using the ligthcone from the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon-AGN, we produced
a photometric catalogue over $0<z<4$ with apparent magnitudes in COSMOS, DES, LSST-like, and Euclid-like
filters at depths comparable to these surveys. The virtual photometry accounts for the complex
star formation history and metal enrichment of Horizon-AGN galaxies, and consistently includes
magnitude errors, dust attenuation and absorption by inter-galactic medium. The COSMOS-like
photometry is fitted in the same configuration as the COSMOS2015 catalogue. We then quantify random
and systematic errors of photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates (SFR).
Photometric redshifts and redshift errors capture the same dependencies on magnitude and redshift
as found in COSMOS2015, excluding the impact of source extraction. COSMOS-like stellar masses
are well recovered with a dispersion typically lower than 0.1 dex. The simple star formation histories
and metallicities of the templates induce a systematic underestimation of stellar masses at $z<1.5$
by at most 0.12 dex. SFR estimates exhibit a dust-induced bimodality combined with a larger scatter
(typically between 0.2 and 0.6 dex). We also use our mock catalogue to predict photometric redshifts
and stellar masses in future imaging surveys. We stress that adding Euclid near-infrared photometry
to the LSST-like baseline improves redshift accuracy especially at the faint end and decreases
the outlier fraction by a factor $\sim$2. It also considerably improves stellar masses, reducing
the scatter up to a factor 3. It would therefore be mutually beneficial for LSST and Euclid to work
in synergy.
