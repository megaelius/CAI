We report the results of our spectropolarimetric monitoring of the weak-line T-Tauri stars (wTTSs)
Par 1379 and Par 2244, within the MaTYSSE (Magnetic Topologies of Young Stars and the Survival of
close-in giant Exoplanets) programme. Both stars are of a similar mass (1.6 and 1.8 M$_{\odot}$)
and age (1.8 and 1.1 Myr), with Par 1379 hosting an evolved low-mass dusty circumstellar disc, and
with Par 2244 showing evidence of a young debris disc. We detect profile distortions and Zeeman signatures
in the unpolarized and circularly polarized lines for each star, and have modelled their rotational
modulation using tomographic imaging, yielding brightness and magnetic maps. We find that Par
1379 harbours a weak (250 G), mostly poloidal field tilted $65^{\circ}$ from the rotation axis.
In contrast, Par 2244 hosts a stronger field (860 G) split 3:2 between poloidal and toroidal components,
with most of the energy in higher order modes, and with the poloidal component tilted $45^{\circ}$
from the rotation axis. Compared to the lower mass wTTSs, V819 Tau and V830 Tau, Par 2244 has a similar
field strength, but is much more complex, whereas the much less complex field of Par 1379 is also much
weaker than any other mapped wTTS. We find moderate surface differential rotation of $1.4\times$
and $1.8\times$ smaller than Solar, for Par 1379 and Par 2244, respectively. Using our tomographic
maps to predict the activity related radial velocity (RV) jitter, and filter it from the RV curves,
we find RV residuals with dispersions of 0.017 kms$^{-1}$ and 0.086 kms$^{-1}$ for Par 1379 and Par
2244, respectively. We find no evidence for close-in giant planets around either star, with $3\sigma$
upper limits of 0.56 and 3.54 M$_{\text{jup}}$ (at an orbital distance of 0.1 au).
