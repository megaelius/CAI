The stellar content of Galactic open clusters is gradually depleted during their evolution as a
result of internal relaxation and external interactions. The final residues of the evolution of
open clusters are called open cluster remnants, barely distinguishable from the field. We aimed
to characterise and compare the dynamical states of a set of 16 such objects. The sample also includes
7 objects that are catalogued as dynamically evolved open clusters. We used photometric data from
the 2MASS, astrometric data from the GAIA DR2 and a decontamination algorithm that was applied to
the three-dimensional astrometric space of proper motions and parallaxes for stars in the objects'
areas. The luminosity and mass functions and total masses for most open cluster remnants are derived
here for the first time. Our analysis used predictions of N-body simulations to estimate the initial
number of stars of the remnants from their dissolution timescales. The investigated open cluster
remnants present masses and velocity dispersions within well-defined ranges: M between ~10-40M_Sun
and sigma_v between ~1-7km/s. Some objects in the remnant sample have a limiting radius R_lim<~2pc,
which means that they are more compact than the investigated open clusters; other remnants have
R_lim between ~2-7pc, which is comparable to the open clusters. We suggest that the open cluster
NGC2180 is entering a remnant evolutionary stage. In general, our clusters show signals of depletion
of low-mass stars. This confirms their dynamically evolved states. We conclude that the open cluster
remnants we studied are in fact remnants of initially very populous open clusters (No~10^3-10^4
stars). The outcome of the long-term evolution is to bring the final residues of the open clusters
to dynamical states that are similar to each other, thus masking out the memory of the initial formation
conditions of star clusters.
