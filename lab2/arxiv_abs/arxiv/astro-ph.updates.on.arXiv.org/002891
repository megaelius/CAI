SNe Iax are proposed as one new sub-class of SNe Ia. SNe Iax have been estimated to account for ~5-30%
of the total SN Ia rate, and most SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. In addition,
observations constrain the progenitor systems of some SN Iax progenitors have ages of <80Myr.
Recently, the weak deflagration explosions of Ch-mass CO WDs seem to provide a viable physical scenario
for SNe Iax. Here, comparing theoretical predictions from BPS calculations with SN Iax observations,
we put constraints on the SD Ch-mass model as a possible Iax progenitor. A long delay times of >3Gyr
and low SN rates of ~3e-5/yr are found in our RG donor channel, indicating that this channel is unlikely
to produce SNe Iax. We predict that the Galactic rate from the MS (He) donor channel is ~1.5e-3/yr
(3e-4/yr), which is consistent with the observed Iax rate. The short delay times in the He channel
support the young host environments of SNe Iax. However, the relative long delay times in the MS donor
channel are less favourable for the observational constraints on the Iax progenitor ages. Finally,
we set an upper limit on the pre-SN mass-loss rate at < 10e-4 M_sun/yr (for V_wind=100 km/s). The
delay times in the SD Ch-mass model do not account for that most SNe Iax are located in late-type galaxies.
However, at least one Iax event (SN 2008ge) is hosted by a S0 galaxy with no signs of star formation.
Moreover, current X-ray observations cannot rule out the SD Ch-mass model. Taking all these into
account and considering the uncertainty of the observed rate for SNe Iax, we suggest that some SNe
Iax may be produced from weak deflagrations of Ch-mass CO WDs in SD progenitors, especially in the
He-star channel. This is consistent with recent analysis of HST observations for the SN Iax SN2012Z.
However, this SD deflagration model is still unlikely to be the most common progenitor scenario
for SNe Iax.
