We present a sample of supernovae Type IIn (SNe IIn) from the untargeted, magnitude-limited surveys
of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its successor, the intermediate PTF (iPTF). The SNe IIn
found and followed by the PTF/iPTF were used to select a sample of 42 events with useful constraints
on the rise times as well as with available post-peak photometry. The sample SNe were discovered
in 2009-2016 and have at least one low-resolution classification spectrum, as well as photometry
from the P48 and P60 telescopes at Palomar Observatory. We study the light-curve properties of these
SNe IIn using spline fits (for the peak and the declining portion) and template matching (for the
rising portion). We find that the typical rise times are divided into fast and slow risers at $20\pm6$
d and $50\pm11$ d, respectively. The decline rates are possibly divided into two clusters, but this
division has weak statistical significance. We find no significant correlation between the peak
luminosity of SNe IIn and their rise times, but the more luminous SNe IIn are generally found to be
more long-lasting. Slowly rising SNe IIn are generally found to decline slowly. The SNe in our sample
were hosted by galaxies of absolute magnitude $-22 \lesssim M_g \lesssim -13$ mag. The K-corrections
at light-curve peak of the SNe IIn in our sample are found to be within 0.2 mag for the observer's frame
$r$-band, for SNe at redshifts $z < 0.25$. By applying K-corrections and also including ostensibly
"superluminous" SNe IIn, we find that the peak magnitudes are $M_{\rm peak}^{r} = -19.18\pm1.32$
mag. We conclude that the occurrence of conspicuous light-curve bumps in SNe IIn, such as in iPTF13z,
are limited to $1.4^{+14.6}_{-1.0} \%$ of the SNe IIn. We also investigate a possible sub-type of
SNe IIn with a fast rise to a $\gtrsim 50$ d plateau followed by a slow, linear decline.
