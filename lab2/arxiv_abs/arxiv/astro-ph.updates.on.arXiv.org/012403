A planet's climate can be strongly affected by its orbital eccentricity and obliquity. Here we use
a 1-dimensional energy balance model modified to include a simple runaway greenhouse (RGH) parameterization
to explore the effects of these two parameters on the climate of Earth-like aqua planets - completely
ocean-covered planets - orbiting F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We find that the range of instellations
for which planets exhibit habitable surface conditions throughout an orbit decreases with increasing
eccentricity. However, the appearance of temporarily habitable conditions during an orbit creates
an eccentric habitable zone (EHZ) that is sensitive to orbital eccentricity and obliquity, planetary
latitude, and host star spectral type. We find that the fraction of a planet's orbit over which it
exhibits habitable surface conditions is larger on eccentric planets orbiting M-dwarf stars,
due to the lower broadband planetary albedos of these planets. Planets with larger obliquities
have smaller EHZs, but exhibit warmer climates if they do not enter a snowball state during their
orbits. We also find no transient runaway greenhouse state on planets at all eccentricities. Rather,
planets spend their entire orbits either in a RGH or not. For G-dwarf planets receiving 100% of the
modern solar constant and with eccentricities above 0.55, an entire Earth ocean inventory can be
lost in 3.6 Gyr. M-dwarf planets, due to their larger incident XUV flux, can become desiccated in
only 690 Myr with eccentricities above 0.38. This work has important implications for eccentric
planets that may exhibit surface habitability despite technically departing from the traditional
habitable zone as they orbit their host stars.
