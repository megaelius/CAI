Accurate instrumental bandpass corrections are essential for the reliable interpretation of
spectral lines from targeted and survey-mode observations with radio interferometers. Bandpass
correction is typically performed by comparing measurements of a strong calibrator source to an
assumed model, typically an isolated point source. The wide field-of-view and high sensitivity
of modern interferometers means that additional sources are often detected in observations of
calibrators. This can introduce errors into bandpass corrections and subsequently the target
data if not properly accounted for. Focusing on the standard calibrator PKS B1934-638, we perform
simulations to asses this effect by constructing a wide-field sky model. The cases of ASKAP (0.7-1.9
GHz), MeerKAT (UHF: 0.58-1.05 GHz; L-band: 0.87-1.67 GHz) and Band 2 (0.95-1.76 GHz) of SKA-MID
are examined. The use of a central point source model during bandpass calibration is found to impart
amplitude errors into spectra measured by the precursor instruments at the ~0.2-0.5% level dropping
to ~0.01% in the case of SKA-MID. This manifests itself as ripples in the source spectrum, the behaviour
of which is coupled to the distribution of the array baselines, the solution interval, the primary
beam size, the hour-angle of the calibration scan, as well as the weights used when imaging the target.
Calibration pipelines should routinely employ complete field models for standard calibrators
to remove this potentially destructive contaminant from the data, a recommendation we validate
by comparing our simulation results to a MeerKAT scan of PKS B1934-638, calibrated with and without
our expanded sky model.
