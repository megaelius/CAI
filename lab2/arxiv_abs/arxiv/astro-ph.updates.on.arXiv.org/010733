Shells are fine stellar structures identified by their arc-like shapes present around a galaxy
and currently thought to be vestiges of galaxy interactions and/or mergers. The study of their number,
geometry, stellar populations and gas content can help to derive the interaction/merger history
of a galaxy. Numerical simulations have proposed a mechanism of shell formation through phase wrapping
during a radial minor merger. Alternatively, there could be barely a space wrapping, when particles
have not made any radial oscillation yet, but are bound by their radial expansion, or produce an edge-brightened
feature. These can be distinguished, because they are expected to keep a high radial velocity. While
shells are first a stellar phenomenon, HI and CO observations have revealed neutral gas associated
with shells. Some of the gas, the most diffuse and dissipative, is expected to be driven quickly to
the center if it is travelling on nearly radial orbits. Molecular gas, distributed in dense clumps,
is less dissipative, and may be associated to shells, and determine their velocity, too difficult
to obtain from stars. We present here a search for molecular gas in nine shell galaxies with the IRAM-30m
telescope. Six of them are detected in their galaxy center, and in three galaxies, we clearly detect
molecular gas in shells. The derived amount of molecular gas varies from 1.5 10$^8$ to 3.4 10$^9$
M$_\odot$ in the shells. For two of them (Arp 10 and NGC 3656), the shells are characteristic of an
oblate system. Their velocity is nearly systemic, and we conclude that these shells are phase-wrapped.
For the third one (NGCB3934) the shells appear to participate to the rotation, and follow up with
higher spatial resolution is required to conclude.
