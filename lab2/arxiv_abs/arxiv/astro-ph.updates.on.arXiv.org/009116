The dark matter hypothesis, which is not called into question here, explains why typical rotation
curves of spiral galaxies do not follow a Keplerian profile. It is however not sufficient in itself
to explain why the whole matter distribution in spiral galaxies is such that the rotation curve generally
presents a flat profile in the disk region. To understand this property, a model considering general
relativistic effects is developed. It is stressed that the aim is not to explain the flat rotation
curve of spiral galaxies without dark matter. More specifically, the analytical stationary solution
of an axisymmetric rotating pressureless fluid for the linearized equations of the theory of general
relativity is determined. It is demonstrated that this solution leads to some constraints on the
rotation curve, by looking to its limit behavior when neglecting general relativistic effects.
In particular, the positiveness of the density imposes the rotation curve to be flat in the regions
where the density and general relativistic effects are small, such as in the disk region. General
relativistic effects hence remain negligible in the disk region, but their consideration proved
to be necessary to establish the aforementioned constraint. Such constraint cannot be derived
from a Newtonian approach. The model is finally applied on two specific cases to demonstrate its
ability to predict the rotation curve from a typical density profile along the galactic plane. These
examples suggest that for some galaxies, general relativistic effects can be significant close
to the bulge region and should be taken into account to have a proper understanding of their rotation
curve.
