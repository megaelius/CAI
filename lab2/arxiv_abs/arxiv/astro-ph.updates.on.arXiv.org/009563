In this work we examine the possibility that the dark energy (DE) density, $\rho_{de}$ can be dynamical
and appear as a power series expansion of the Hubble rate (and its derivatives), i.e.$\rho_{de}(H,\dot{H},...)$.
For the present universe, however, only the terms $H$, $\dot{H}$ and $H^2$ can be relevant, together
with an additive constant term. We fit these models to the current cosmological data on the main observables
SNIa+$H(z)$+BAO+LSS+CMB+BBN. Our analysis involves both the background as well as the cosmic
perturbation equations. The latter include, apart from the matter density perturbations, also
the DE density perturbations. We assume that matter and dynamical DE are separately self-conserved.
As a result the equation of state of the DE becomes a nontrivial function of the cosmological redshift,
$w_D=w_D(z)$. The particular subset of DE models of this type having no additive constant term in
$\rho_{de}$ include the so-called entropic-force and QCD-ghost DE models, as well as the pure linear
model $\rho_{de} \sim H$ all of which are strongly disfavored in our fitting analysis. In contrast,
the models that include the additive term plus one or both of the dynamical components $\dot{H}$
and $H^2$ appear more favored than the $\Lambda$CDM. In particular, the dynamical DE models provide
a value of $\sigma_8\simeq 0.74-0.77$ which is substantially lower than that of the $\Lambda$CDM
and hence more in accordance with the observations. This helps to significantly reduce the $\sigma_8$-tension
in the structure formation data. At the same time the predicted value for $H_0$ is in between the local
and Planck measurements, thus helping to alleviate this tension as well.
