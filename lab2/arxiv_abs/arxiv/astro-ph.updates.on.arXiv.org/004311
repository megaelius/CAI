We describe the afterglows of long gamma-ray-burst (GRB) within the context of a binary-driven
hypernova (BdHN). In this paradigm afterglows originate from the interaction between a newly born
neutron star ($\nu$NS), created by an Ic supernova (SN), and a mildly relativistic ejecta of a hypernova
(HN). Such a HN in turn result from the impact of the GRB on the original SN Ic. The observed power-law
afterglow in the optical and X-ray bands is shown to arise from the synchrotron emission of relativistic
electrons in the expanding magnetized HN ejecta. Two components contribute to the injected energy:
the kinetic energy of the mildly relativistic expanding HN and the rotational energy of the fast
rotating highly magnetized $\nu$NS. As an example we reproduce the observed afterglow of GRB 130427A
in all wavelengths from the optical ($10^{14}$~Hz) to the X-ray band ($10^{19}$~Hz) over times
from $604$~s to $5.18\times 10^6$~s relative to the Fermi-GBM trigger. Initially, the emission
is dominated by the loss of kinetic energy of the HN component. After $10^5$~s the emission is dominated
by the loss of rotational energy of the $\nu$NS, for which we adopt an initial rotation period of 2~ms
and a dipole/quadrupole magnetic field of $\lesssim \! 7\times 10^{12}$~G/$\sim \! 10^{14}$~G.
This approach opens new views on the roles of the GRB interaction with the SN ejecta, on the mildly
relativistic kinetic energy of the HN and on the pulsar-like phenomena of the $\nu$NS. This scenario
differs from the current ultra-relativistic treatments of the afterglow in the collapsar-fireball
model and it is, instead, consistent with the current observations of the mildly relativistic regimes
of X-ray flares, $\gamma$-ray flares and plateau emission in the BdHN.
