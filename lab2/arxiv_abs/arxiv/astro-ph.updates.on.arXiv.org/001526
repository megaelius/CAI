In order to empirically determine the timescale and environmental dependence of stellar cluster
disruption, we have undertaken an analysis of the unprecedented multi-pointing (seven), multi-wavelength
(U, B, V, H$\alpha$, and I) Hubble Space Telescope imaging survey of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxy
M83. The images are used to locate stellar clusters and stellar associations throughout the galaxy.
Estimation of cluster properties (age, mass, and extinction) was done through a comparison of their
spectral energy distributions with simple stellar population models. We constructed the largest
catalog of stellar clusters and associations in this galaxy to-date, with ~1800 sources with masses
above ~5000 M$_{\odot}$ and ages younger than ~300 Myr. In the present letter, we focus on the age
distribution of the resulting clusters and associations. In particular, we explicitly test whether
the age distributions are related with the ambient environment. Our results are in excellent agreement
with previous studies of age distributions in the centre of the galaxy, which gives us confidence
to expand out to search for similarities or differences in the other fields which sample different
environments. We find that the age distribution of the clusters inside M83 varies strongly as a function
of position within the galaxy, indicating a strong correlation with the galactic environment.
If the age distributions are approximated as a power-law of the form $dN/dt \propto t^{\zeta}$,
we find $\zeta$ values between 0 and -0.62 ( $\zeta$~-0.40 for the whole galaxy), in good agreement
with previous results and theoretical predictions.
