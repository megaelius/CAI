We present an analysis of the starspot evolution, the surface differential rotation (SDR), the
correlation between chromospheric activity indicators and the spatial connection between chromospheric
and photospheric activities on the active star Kepler-411, using time series photometry over 4
years from Kepler, and spectroscopic data from Keck I 10-m telescope and Lijiang 2.4-m telescope.
We constructed the light curve by re-performing photometry and reduction from the Target Pixel
Files and Cotrending Basis Vectors with a manually redefined aperture using the software PyKE3.
An efficient program, GEMC_LCM, was developed to apply a two-spots model to chosen light curve segments
with three spot groups at fixed latitudes (30, 45), (30, 60) and (45, 60). We found a periodic variation
of the starspots at period of about 660 days which independs on spot latitudes, and estimated the
lower limit of SDR as $P_{\text{eq}} = 9.7810(0.0169)$ days and $\alpha = 0.1016(0.0023)$. Simultaneously,
the relative variations of chromospheric activity indicators were derived by subtracting the
overall mean spectrum from individual spectrum. It is found that Ca II H and K emissions are strongly
correlated with each other, and there also exists a correlation between H$\alpha$ and Ca II H & K emissions,
with large dispersion, in accordance with previous results. Furthermore we find the correlation
between Ca II H and K emissions is different in 2011 and 2012. The chromospheric emission variation
shows a highly spatial anti-correlation with the light curve, suggesting a spatial connection
between the chromospheric active region and spot region.
