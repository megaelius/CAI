We investigate the linear properties of the steady stress-driven spin-down flow of a viscous fluid
inside a spherical shell, both within the incompressible and anelastic approximations, and in
the asymptotic limit of small viscosities. Neglecting buoyancy force, we find a steady-state to
settle in a viscous time for the incompressible flow. From boundary layer analysis, we derive an
analytical geostrophic solution for the 3D incompressible steady flow, inside and outside a cylinder
$\mathcal{C}$ that is tangent to the inner shell. The meridional circulation associated with the
spin-down flow in these two regions scales with the Ekman number $E$. A power expansion of the fields
with the small parameter $E^{1/3}$ corresponding to the width of the inner Stewartson shear layer
laying along the tangent cylinder, reveals it to be the site of an upwelling flow of amplitude $O(E^{1/3})$.
Despite its narrowness, this shear layer concentrates most of the global meridional kinetic energy
of the system. Furthermore, a stable stratification does not perturb the spin-down flow provided
the Prandtl number is small enough. If this is not the case, the Stewartson layer disappears and meridional
circulation is confined within the thermal layers. The scalings for the amplitude of the anelastic
secondary flow have been found to be the same as for the incompressible flow in all three regions,
at the lowest order. However, because the velocity no longer conforms the Taylor-Proudman theorem,
its shape differs outside the tangent cylinder $\mathcal{C}$, that is, where differential rotation
takes place. Finally, we find the settling of the steady-state to be reached on a viscous time for
the weakly, strongly and thermally unstratified incompressible flows. Large density variations
relevant to astro- and geophysical systems, tend to slightly shorten the transient.
