The (supermassive black hole mass, $M_\text{BH}$)-(bulge stellar mass, $M_{\rm*,sph}$) relation
is, obviously, derived using two quantities. We endeavor to provide accurate values for the latter
via detailed multi-component galaxy decompositions for the current full sample of 43 spiral galaxies
having directly measured $M_\text{BH}$ values - 35 of these galaxies have been alleged to contain
pseudobulges, 21 have water maser measurements, and three appear bulgeless. This more than doubles
the previous sample size of spiral galaxies with a finessed image analysis. We have analyzed near-infrared
images, accounting for not only the bulge, disk (exponential, truncated, or inclined), and bar,
but also for spiral arms and rings, and additional central components (active galactic nuclei,
etc.). A symmetric Bayesian analysis finds $M_{\rm BH}\propto M_{\rm*,sph}^{2.44\pm0.33}$.
The level of scatter equals that about the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma_*$ relation. The non-linear slope
rules out the idea that many mergers, coupled with the central limit theorem, produced this scaling
relation, and it corroborates previous observational studies, and simulations, which have reported
a near-quadratic slope at the low-mass end of the $M_\text{BH}$-$M_{\rm*,sph}$ diagram. Furthermore,
bulges with active galactic nuclei follow this relation, they are not offset by an order of magnitude,
and models that have invoked active galactic nuclei feedback to establish a linear $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_{\rm*,sph}$
relation need revisiting. We additionally present an updated $M_\text{BH}$-(S\'ersic index,
$n_\text{sph}$) relation for spiral galaxy bulges, with a comparable level of scatter, and a new
$M_{\rm*,sph}$-(spiral arm pitch angle, $\phi$) relation.
