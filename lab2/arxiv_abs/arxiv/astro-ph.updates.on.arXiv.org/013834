We perform a comparison, object-by-object and statistically, between the Munich semi-analytical
model, L-Galaxies, and the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations. By running L-Galaxies on
the IllustrisTNG dark matter-only merger trees, we identify the same galaxies in the two models.
This allows us to compare the stellar mass, star formation rate and gas content of galaxies, as well
as the baryonic content of subhaloes and haloes in the two models. We find that both the stellar mass
functions and the stellar masses of individual galaxies agree to better than $\sim0.2\,$dex. On
the other hand, specific star formation rates and gas contents can differ more substantially. At
$z=0$ the transition between low-mass star-forming galaxies and high-mass, quenched galaxies
occurs at a stellar mass scale $\sim0.5\,$dex lower in IllustrisTNG than in L-Galaxies. IllustrisTNG
also produces substantially more quenched galaxies at higher redshifts. Both models predict a
halo baryon fraction close to the cosmic value for clusters, but IllustrisTNG predicts lower baryon
fractions in group environments. These differences are due primarily to differences in modelling
feedback from stars and supermassive black holes. The gas content and star formation rates of galaxies
in and around clusters and groups differ substantially, with IllustrisTNG satellites less star-forming
and less gas-rich. We show that environmental processes such as ram-pressure stripping are stronger
and operate to larger distances and for a broader host mass range in IllustrisTNG. We suggest that
the treatment of galaxy evolution in the semi-analytic model needs to be improved by prescriptions
which capture local environmental effects more accurately.
