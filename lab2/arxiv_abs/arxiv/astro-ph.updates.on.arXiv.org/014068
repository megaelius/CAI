Ever since their discovery, Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are generally considered to be the sites
just at the onset of high-mass (HM) star formation. In recent years, it has been realized that not
all IRDCs harbour HM Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Only those IRDCs satisfying a certain mass-size
criterion, or equivalently above a certain threshold density, are found to contain HMYSOs. In all
cases, IRDCs provide ideal conditions for the formation of stellar clusters. In this paper, we study
the massive stellar content of IRDCs to re-address the relation between IRDCs and HM star formation.
For this purpose, we have identified all IRDCs associated to a sample of 12 Galactic molecular clouds
(MCs). The selected MCs have been the target of a systematic search for YSOs in an earlier study. The
catalogued positions of YSOs have been used to search all YSOs embedded in each identified IRDC.
In total, we have found 834 YSOs in 128 IRDCs. The sample of IRDCs have mean surface densities of 319
Mo/pc2, mean mass of 1062 Mo, and a mass function power-law slope -1.8, which are similar to the corresponding
properties for the full sample of IRDCs and resulting physical properties in previous studies.
We find that all those IRDCs containing at least one intermediate to high-mass young star satisfy
the often-used mass-size criterion for forming HM stars. However, not all IRDCs satisfying the
mass-size criterion contain HM stars. We find that the often used mass-size criterion corresponds
to 35% probability of an IRDC forming a massive star. Twenty five (20%) of the IRDCs are potential
sites of stellar clusters of mass more than 100 Mo.
