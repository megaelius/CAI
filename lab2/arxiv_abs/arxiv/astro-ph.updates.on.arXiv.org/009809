Galactic disc chemical evolution models generally ignore azimuthal surface density variation
that can introduce chemical abundance azimuthal gradients. Recent observations, however, have
revealed chemical abundance changes with azimuth in the gas and stellar components of both the Milky
Way and external galaxies. To quantify the effects of spiral arm density fluctuations on the azimuthal
variations of the oxygen and iron abundances in disc galaxies. We develop a new 2D galactic disc chemical
evolution model, capable of following not just radial but also azimuthal inhomogeneities. The
density fluctuations resulting from a Milky Way-like N-body disc formation simulation produce
azimuthal variations in the oxygen abundance gradients of the order of 0.1 dex. Moreover, in agreement
with the most recent observations in external galaxies, the azimuthal variations are more evident
in the outer galactic regions. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the largest fluctuations
with azimuth result near the spiral structure corotation resonance, where the relative speed between
spiral and gaseous disc is the slowest. In conclusion we provided a new 2D chemical evolution model
capable of following azimuthal density variations. Density fluctuations extracted from a Milky
Way-like dynamical model lead to a scatter in the azimuthal variations of the oxygen abundance gradient
in agreement with observations in external galaxies. We interpret the presence of azimuthal scatter
at all radii by the presence of multiple spiral modes moving at different pattern speeds, as found
in both observations and numerical simulations.
