We present observational results from a new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Snapshot program to extend
the methods of the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey to lower lens-galaxy masses. We confirm and model
40 new strong lenses from this program, which we supplement with 58 lenses previously discovered
by SLACS. We also determine upper limits to the masses of an additional 33 galaxies (18 new and 15 from
SLACS) based on single images of background sources. Incorporating lensing measurements and upper
limits into a single analysis, we find an evidence at 4$\sigma$ that the total mass-density profile
of early-type galaxies varies systematically in the sense of being shallower at larger lens-galaxy
velocity dispersions. This trend provides evidence of variation in the efficiency of dissipative
baryonic processes as a function of galaxy mass. The trend is only evident when upper limits are incorporated,
highlighting the importance of including both "lenses" and "non-lenses" for an unbiased treatment
of the lens population when extending to lower mass ranges. Our results are nevertheless consistent
with published findings of velocity-dispersion-independent mass profiles within combined uncertainties.
By scaling simple stellar population models to the HST I-band data, we identify a strong trend of
increasing dark-matter fraction at higher velocity dispersions, which can alternatively be interpreted
as a trend in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) normalization. Consistent with previous findings
and the suggestion of a non-universal IMF, we find a Salpeter IMF is ruled out for galaxies below $10^{10.8}
M_{\sun}$. Considered together, our mass-profile and dark-matter-fraction trends with increasing
galaxy mass could both be explained by an increasing relative contribution on kiloparsec scales
from a dark-matter halo with a spatial profile more extended than that of the stellar component.
