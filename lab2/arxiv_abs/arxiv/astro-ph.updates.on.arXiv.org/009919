The first two months of the third Advanced LIGO and Virgo observing run (2019 April-May) showed that
distant gravitational wave (GW) events can now be readily detected, with three neutron star (NS)
mergers more than 100 Mpc away reported in a span of just 15 days. However, distant events such as the
three new NS mergers are more likely to be coarsely localized, which highlights the importance of
facilities and scheduling systems that enable deep observations over hundreds to thousands of
square degrees to detect the electromagnetic counterparts. On 2019-05-10 02:59:39.292 UT the
GW candidate S190510g was discovered and initially classified as a BNS merger with 98% probability.
The GW event was localized within an area of 3462 square degrees, later refined to 1166 square degrees
(90%) at a distance of 227 +- 92 Mpc. With most of the highest probability region located in the Southern
hemisphere, we triggered Target of Opportunity observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam),
a wide-field optical imager mounted at the prime focus of the 4m Blanco Telescope at Cerro Tololo
Inter-American Observatory in Chile. This Letter describes our DECam observations and our real-time
analysis results, focusing in particular on the design and implementation of the observing strategy.
Within 24 hours of the merger time, we observed 65% of the total enclosed probability of the final
sky map with a total observing efficiency of 94%. We identified and publicly announced 13 candidate
counterparts. The day after our DECam observations concluded, Advanced LIGO/Virgo reduced the
probability that S190510g was a binary neutron star merger from 98% to 42%.
