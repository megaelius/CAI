Terrestrial planets covered globally with thick oceans (termed ocean planets) in the habitable
zone were previously inferred to have extremely hot climates in most cases. This is because ${\rm
H_2O}$ high-pressure (HP) ice on the seafloor prevents chemical weathering and, thus, removal
of atmospheric CO$_2$. Previous studies, however, ignored melting of the HP ice and horizontal
variation in heat flux from oceanic crusts. Here we examine whether high heat fluxes near the mid-ocean
ridge melts the HP ice and thereby removes atmospheric ${\rm CO_2}$. We develop integrated climate
models of an Earth-size ocean planet with plate tectonics for different ocean masses, which include
the effects of HP ice melting, seafloor weathering, and the carbonate-silicate geochemical carbon
cycle. We find that the heat flux near the mid-ocean ridge is high enough to melt the ice, enabling
seafloor weathering. In contrast to the previous theoretical prediction, we show that climates
of terrestrial planets with massive oceans lapse into extremely cold ones (or snowball states)
with CO$_2$-poor atmospheres. Such extremely cold climates are achieved mainly because the HP
ice melting fixes seafloor temperature at the melting temperature, thereby keeping a high weathering
flux regardless of surface temperature. We estimate that ocean planets with oceans several tens
of the Earth's ocean mass no longer maintain temperate climates. These results suggest that terrestrial
planets with extremely cold climates exist even in the habitable zone beyond the solar system, given
the frequency of water-rich planets predicted by planet formation theories.
