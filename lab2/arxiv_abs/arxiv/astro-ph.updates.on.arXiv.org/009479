The evolution of the comoving kinetic luminosity densities ($\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$) of the radio
loud (RL) high-excitation radio galaxies (RL HERGs) and the low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs)
in the XXL-S field is presented. The wide area and deep radio and optical data of XXL-S have allowed
the construction of the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of the RL HERGs and LERGs across a wide
range in radio luminosity out to high redshift ($z = 1.3$). The LERG RLFs display weak evolution:
$\Phi (z)$ $\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{0.67 \pm 0.17}$ in the pure density evolution (PDE) case and $\Phi
(z)$ $\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{0.84 \pm 0.31}$ in the pure luminosity evolution (PLE) case. The RL HERG
RLFs demonstrate stronger evolution than the LERGs: $\Phi (z)$ $\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{1.81 \pm 0.15}$
for PDE and $\Phi (z)$ $\propto$ (1+$z$)$^{3.19 \pm 0.29}$ for PLE. Converting $L_{\rm{1.4 GHz}}$
into kinetic luminosities, the evolution of $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$ was calculated for the RL HERGs
and LERGs and compared to the predictions from simulations. The prediction for the evolution of
radio mode feedback in the Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution model is consistent with the $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$
evolution for all XXL-S RL AGN, indicating that RL AGN may be able to balance the radiative cooling
of the hot phase of the IGM. Simulations that predict the $\Omega_{\rm{kin}}$ evolution of LERG
equivalent populations show similar slopes to the XXL-S LERG evolution, indicating that LERGs
are well described by models of SMBHs that slowly accrete hot gas. On the other hand, models of RL HERG
equivalent populations differ in their predictions. While LERGs dominate the kinetic luminosity
output of RL AGN at all redshifts, the evolution of the RL HERGs in XXL-S is weaker compared to what
other studies have found. This implies that radio mode feedback from RL HERGs is more prominent at
lower redshifts than was previously thought.
