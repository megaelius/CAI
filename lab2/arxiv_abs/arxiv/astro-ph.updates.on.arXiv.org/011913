We perform spatially resolved stellar population analysis for a sample of 69 early-type galaxies
(ETGs) from the CALIFA integral field spectroscopic survey, including 48 ellipticals and 21 S0's.
We generate and quantitatively characterize profiles of light-weighted mean stellar age and metallicity
within $\lesssim 2R_e$, as a function of radius and stellar-mass surface density $\mu_*$. We study
in detail the dependence of profiles on galaxies' global properties, including velocity dispersion
$\sigma_e$, stellar mass, morphology. ETGs are universally characterized by strong, negative
metallicity gradients ($\sim -0.3\,\text{dex}$ per $R_e$) within $1\,R_e$, which flatten out
moving towards larger radii. A quasi-universal local $\mu_*$-metallicity relation emerges,
which displays a residual systematic dependence on $\sigma_e$, whereby higher $\sigma_e$ implies
higher metallicity at fixed $\mu_*$. Age profiles are typically U-shaped, with minimum around
$0.4\,R_e$, asymptotic increase to maximum ages beyond $\sim 1.5\,R_e$, and an increase towards
the centre. The depth of the minimum and the central increase anti-correlate with $\sigma_e$. A
possible qualitative interpretation of these observations is a two-phase scenario. In the first
phase, dissipative collapse occurs in the inner $1\,R_e$, establishing a negative metallicity
gradient. The competition between the outside-in quenching due to feedback-driven winds and some
form of inside-out quenching, possibly caused by central AGN feedback or dynamical heating, determines
the U-shaped age profiles. In the second phase, the accretion of ex-situ stars from quenched and
low-metallicity satellites shapes the flatter stellar population profiles in the outer regions.
