We present a catalog of emissive point sources detected in the SPT-SZ survey, a contiguous 2530-square-degree
area surveyed with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) from 2008 - 2011 in three bands centered at 95, 150,
and 220 GHz. The catalog contains 4845 sources measured at a significance of 4.5 sigma or greater
in at least one band, corresponding to detections above approximately 9.8, 5.8, and 20.4 mJy in 95,
150, and 220 GHz, respectively. Spectral behavior in the SPT bands is used for source classification
into two populations based on the underlying physical mechanisms of compact, emissive sources
that are bright at millimeter wavelengths: synchrotron radiation from active galactic nuclei
and thermal emission from dust. The latter population includes a component of high-redshift sources
often referred to as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). In the relatively bright flux ranges probed
by the survey, these sources are expected to be magnified by strong gravitational lensing. The survey
also contains sources consistent with protoclusters, groups of dusty galaxies at high redshift
undergoing collapse. We cross-match the SPT-SZ catalog with external catalogs at radio, infrared,
and X-ray wavelengths and identify available redshift information. The catalog splits into 3980
synchrotron-dominated and 865 dust-dominated sources and we determine a list of 506 SMGs. Ten sources
in the catalog are identified as stars. We calculate number counts for the full catalog, and synchrotron
and dusty components, using a bootstrap method and compare our measured counts with models. This
paper represents the third and final catalog of point sources in the SPT-SZ survey.
