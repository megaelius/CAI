The elemental depletion of interstellar sulfur from the gas phase has been a recurring challenge
for astrochemical models. Observations show that sulfur remains relatively non-depleted with
respect to its cosmic value throughout the diffuse and translucent stages of an interstellar molecular
cloud, but its gas-phase constituents cannot account for this cosmic value towards higher-density
environments. We have attempted to address this issue by modeling the evolution of an interstellar
cloud from its pristine state as a diffuse atomic cloud to a molecular environment of much higher
density, using a gas/grain astrochem. code and an enhanced sulfur reaction network. A common gas/grain
reaction network has been systematically updated and greatly extended based on previous lit. and
models, with a focus on the grain chemistry and processes. A simple model was used to benchmark the
resulting network updates, and the results of the model were compared to typical astronomical observations
sourced from the literature. Our new gas/grain model is able to reproduce the elemental depletion
of sulfur, whereby sulfur can be depleted from the gas-phase by two orders of magnitude, and this
process may occur under dark cloud conditions if the cloud has a chemical age of at least 1 Myrs. The
resulting mix of sulfur-bearing species on the grain ranges across all the most common chemical
elements (H/C/N/O), not dissimilar to the molecules observed in cometary environments. Notably,
this mixture is not dominated simply by H2S, unlike all other current astrochem. models. Despite
our relatively simple physical model, most of the known gas-phase S-bearing molecular abundances
are accurately reproduced under dense conditions, however they are not expected to be the primary
molecular sinks of sulfur. Our model predicts that most of the missing sulfur is in the form of organo-sulfur
species trapped on grains.
