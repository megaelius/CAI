In the current planet formation paradigm, gravitational torques exerted by the gas in protoplanetary
disks play a central role in determining the long-term orbital evolution of planetary embryos.
Even though dust is ubiquitous in these systems, its dynamical contribution to this process has
not been assessed. In this Letter, we show that the scattered pebble-flow induced by a low-mass planetary
embryo leads to an asymmetric dust density distribution in its vicinity. We perform a large suite
of multifluid hydrodynamical simulations neglecting dust feedback onto the gas and study the interaction
between the disk and a low-mass planet on a fixed circular orbit. Depending on the dust drift speed,
the dust-to-gas mass ratio/distribution and the mass of the embryo, these asymmetries may play
a crucial role in the migration history of the proto-planet. We present for the first time systematic
measurements of the dust torques and identify two different regimes, gas- and gravity-dominated,
where the scattered pebble-flow results in almost all cases in positive torques. We collect our
results in a first torque map for dusty disks which will enable incorporating the effect of dust dynamics
on migration into population synthesis models. The dust torque meets the necessary conditions
for inducing very fast outward migration of planetary cores. We thus anticipate that dust-driven
migration could play a dominant role in the formation history of planets. Because dust torques scale
with disk metallicity, we submit that dust-driven outward migration may enhance the occurrence
of distant giant planets in higher metallicity systems.
