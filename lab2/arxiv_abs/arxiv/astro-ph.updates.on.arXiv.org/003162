Recent observations of the debris disk of AU Mic have revealed asymmetric, fast outward-moving
arch-like structures above the disk midplane. No model can readily explain the characteristics
of these features. We present a model aiming to reproduce the dynamics of these structures, more
specifically their high projected speeds and their apparent position. We test the hypothesis of
dust emitted by a point source and then expelled from the system by the strong stellar wind of this
young, M-type star. In this model, we make the assumption that the dust grains follow the same dynamics
as the structures. We perform numerical simulations of test particle trajectories to explore the
available parameter space, in particular the radial location $R_{0}$ of the dust producing parent
body and the size of the dust grains as parameterized by $\beta$ (ratio of stellar wind and radiation
pressure forces over gravitation). We consider both the case of a static and an orbiting parent body.
We find that, for all considered scenarii, there is always a set of ($R_0, \beta$) parameters able
to fit the observed features. The common characteristics of these solutions is that they all require
a high value of $\beta$, of around 6. This means that the star is probably very active and the grains
composing the structures are sub-micronic, in order to reach such high $\beta$ values. As for the
location of the hypothetical parent body, we constrain it to lie around 8 au (orbiting case) or 28
au (static case). We show that the scenario of sequential dust releases by an unseen, punctual parent
body is able to explain the radial behaviour of the observed structures. We predict the evolution
of the structures to help future observations to discriminate between the different parent body
configurations that have been considered. We expect new structures to appear on the northwest side
of the disk in the coming years.
