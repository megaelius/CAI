Swirling motions in the solar atmosphere have been widely observed in recent years and suggested
to play a key role in channeling energy from the photosphere into the corona. Here, we present a newly-developed
Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm (ASDA) and discuss its applications. ASDA is found to be very
proficient at detecting swirls in a variety of synthetic data with various levels of noise, implying
our subsequent scientific results are astute. Applying ASDA to photospheric observations with
a spatial resolution of 39.2 km sampled by the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on-board Hinode, suggests
a total number of $1.62\times10^5$ swirls in the photosphere, with an average radius and rotating
speed of $\sim290$ km and $< 1.0$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. Comparisons between swirls detected
in Bifrost numerical MHD simulations and both ground-based and space-borne observations, suggest
that: 1) the spatial resolution of data plays a vital role in the total number and radii of swirls detected;
and 2) noise introduced by seeing effects could decrease the detection rate of swirls, but has no
significant influences in determining their inferred properties. All results have shown that
there is no significant difference in the analysed properties between counter-clockwise or clockwise
rotating swirls. About 70% of swirls are located in intergranular lanes. Most of the swirls have
lifetimes less than twice of the cadences, meaning future research should aim to use data with much
higher cadences than 6 s. In the conclusions, we propose some promising future research applications
where ASDA may provide useful insights.
