In the coming decade, a new generation of telescopes, including JWST and WFIRST, will probe the period
of the formation of first galaxies and quasars, and open up the last frontier for structure formation.
Recent simulations as well as observations have suggested that these galaxies are strongly clustered~(with
large scale bias $\gtrsim6$), and therefore have significant cosmic variance. In this work, we
use BlueTides, the largest volume cosmological simulation of galaxy formation, to directly estimate
the cosmic variance for current and upcoming surveys. Given its resolution and volume, BlueTides
can probe the bias and cosmic variance of $z>7$ galaxies between magnitude $H\sim30$ to $\sim25$
over survey areas $\sim0.1~\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ to $\sim 10~\mathrm{deg}^2$. Within this regime,
the cosmic variance decreases with survey area/ volume as a power law with exponents between $\sim-0.25$
to $\sim-0.45$. For the planned $10~\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of WFIRST, the cosmic variance is between
$6\%$ to $10\%$. Upcoming JWST surveys with areas up to $A\sim100~\mathrm{arcmin}^2$ will have
cosmic variance ranging from $\sim 20-40\%$. Lensed surveys have the highest cosmic variance $\gtrsim
60\%$; these surveys require volumes $\gtrsim(6~\mathrm{Mpc}/h)^3$ and $\gtrsim(11~\mathrm{Mpc}/h)^3$
at $z\sim7.5$ and $z\sim9$ respectively to limit the cosmic variance to less than $100\%$. Finally,
we find that cosmic variance is larger than Poisson variance and forms the dominant component of
the overall uncertainty in all current and upcoming surveys. We present our calculations in the
form of simple fitting functions and an online cosmic variance calculator (CV_AT_COSMIC_DAWN)
which we publicly release.
