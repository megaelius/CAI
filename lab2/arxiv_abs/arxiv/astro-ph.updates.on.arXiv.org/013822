The objective of this work is to determine what fraction of red-giant (RG) stars shows photometric
rotational modulation, and understand its origin. One of the underlying questions is the role of
close binarity in this population, standing upon the fact that RGs in short-period binary systems
(<150 days or so) have been observed to display strong rotational modulation. We select a sample
of about 4500 relatively bright RGs observed by Kepler, and show that 370 of them (8%) display rotational
modulation. Almost all have oscillation amplitudes below the median of the sample, while 30 of them
are not oscillating at all. Of the 85 of these RGs with rotational modulation chosen for follow-up
radial-velocity observation and analysis, 34 show clear evidence of spectroscopic binarity.
Surprisingly, 26 of the 30 non-oscillators are in this group of binaries. To the contrary, about
85% of the active RGs with detectable oscillations are not part of close binaries. With the help of
stellar masses and evolutionary states computed from the oscillation properties, it appears that
low-mass red-giant branch stars tend to be magnetically inactive, while intermediate-mass ones
tend to be highly active. The opposite trends are true for helium-core burning (red clump) stars,
whereby the lower-mass clump stars are comparatively more active and the higher-mass ones less
so. In other words, we find that low-mass red-giant branch stars gain angular momentum as they evolve
to clump stars, while higher-mass ones lose angular momentum. The trend observed with low-mass
stars leads to possible scenarios of planet engulfment or other merging events during the shell-burning
phase. Regarding intermediate-mass stars, the rotation periods are long with respect to theoretical
expectations reported in the literature, which reinforces the existence of an unidentified sink
of angular momentum after the main sequence.
