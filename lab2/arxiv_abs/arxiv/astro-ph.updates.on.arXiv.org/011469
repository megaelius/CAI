The X-ray pulsar SMC X-1 shows a superorbital modulation with an unstable cycle length in the X-ray
band. We present its timing behaviors, including the spin, orbital, and superorbital modulations,
beyond the end of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer mission. The time-frequency maps derived by the
wavelet Z-transform and the Hilbert-Huang transform suggest that a new superorbital period excursion
event occurred in ~MJD 57100 (2015 March). This indicates the excursion is recurrent and probably
(quasi)periodic. The hardness ratio obtained with the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) suggests
increased absorption during the transition from the high to the low state in the superorbital cycle.
Compared to the regular epochs, the superorbital profile during the excursion epochs has a shallower
and narrower valley, likely caused by a flatter warp. By tracking the spin period evolution with
the MAXI Gas Slit Camera in 2-20 keV, we derive an averaged spin-up rate of $\dot{\nu}=2.515(3)\times10^{-11}$
s$^{-2}$ during the period between MJD 55141 (2009 November) and 58526 (2019 February). We obtain
no positive correlation between the spin frequency residual and the superorbital frequency, but
a torque change accompanying the superorbital period excursion is possible. We suggest that the
accretion torque on the neutron star could be changed by various mechanisms, including the change
of mass accretion rate and the warp angle. We update the value of the orbital decay as $\dot{P}_{\rm{orb}}/P_{\rm{orb}}=-3.380(6)\times10^{-6}$
yr$^{-1}$. Finally, we reconfirm the detection of the superorbital modulation in the optical band
and its coherence in phase with the X-ray modulation.
