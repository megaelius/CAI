We present an analysis of the colour-magnitude relation for a sample of 56 X-ray underluminous Abell
clusters, aiming to unveil properties that may elucidate the evolutionary stages of the galaxy
populations that compose such systems. To do so, we compared the parameters of their colour-magnitude
relations with the ones found for another sample of 50 "normal" X-ray emitting Abell clusters, both
selected in an objective way. The $g$ and $r$ magnitudes from the SDSS-DR7 were used for constructing
the colour-magnitude relations. We found that both samples show the same trend: the red sequence
slopes change with redshift, but the slopes for X-ray underluminous clusters are always flatter
than those for the normal clusters, by a difference of about 69% along the surveyed redshift range
of 0.05 $\le z <$ 0.20. Also, the intrinsic scatter of the colour-magnitude relation was found
to grow with redshift for both samples but, for the X-ray underluminous clusters, this is systematically
larger by about 28%. By applying the Cram\'er test to the result of this comparison between X-ray
normal and underluminous cluster samples, we get probabilities of 92% and 99% that the red sequence
slope and intrinsic scatter distributions, respectively, differ, in the sense that X-ray underluminous
clusters red sequences show flatter slopes and higher scatters in their relations. No significant
differences in the distributions of red-sequence median colours are found between the two cluster
samples. This points to X-ray underluminous clusters being younger systems than normal clusters,
possibly in the process of accreting groups of galaxies, individual galaxies and gas.
