(Abridged) The behaviour of mass loss across bi-stability jump is a key uncertainty in models of
massive stars. While an increase in mass loss is theoretically predicted, this has so far not been
observationally confirmed. However, radiation-driven winds of massive stars are known to exhibit
clumpy structures triggered by the line-deshadowing instability (LDI). Wind clumping affects
empirical mass-loss rates inferred from density square-dependent spectral diagnostics. If clumping
properties differ significantly for O and B supergiants across the bi-stability jump, this may
help alleviate discrepancies between theory and observations. We investigate with analytical
and numerical tools how the onset of clumpy structures behaves in the winds of O supergiants (OSG)
and B supergiants (BSG) across the bi-stability jump. We derive a scaling relation for the linear
growth rate of the LDI for a single optically thick line and apply it in both regimes. We run 1D time-dependent
line-driven instability simulations to study the non-linear evolution of the LDI in clumpy OSG
and BSG winds. Linear perturbation analysis for a single line shows that the LDI linear growth rate
scales strongly with stellar effective temperature and terminal wind speed. This implies significantly
lower growth rates for (cooler, slower) BSG winds than for OSG winds. This is confirmed by the non-linear
simulations, which show significant differences in OSG and BSG wind structure formation, with
the latter characterized by significantly weaker clumping factors and lower velocity dispersions.
This suggests that lower correction factors due to clumping should be employed when deriving empirical
mass-loss rates for BSGs on the cool side of the bi-stability jump. Moreover, the non-linear simulations
provide a theoretical background toward explaining the general lack of observed intrinsic X-ray
emission in (single) B star winds.
