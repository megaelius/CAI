In situ observations of energetic particles at the Earth's bow-shock that are attainable by the
satellite missions have long created the opinion that electrons are most efficiently accelerated
in a quasi-perpendicular shock geometry. However, shocks that are deemed to be responsible for
the production of cosmic ray electrons and their radiation from sources such as supernova remnants
are much more powerful and larger than the Earth's bow-shock. Their remote observations and in situ
measurements at Saturn's bow shock, suggest that electrons are accelerated very efficiently in
the quasi-parallel shocks as well. In this paper we investigate the possibility that protons that
are accelerated to high energies create sufficient wave turbulence, which is necessary for the
electron preheating and subsequent injection into the diffusive shock acceleration in a quasi-parallel
shock geometry. An additional test-particle-electron population, which is meant to be a low-density
addition to the electron core-distribution on which the hybrid simulation operates, is introduced.
We investigate how these electrons are energized by the hybrid electromagnetic field. The reduced
spatial dimensionality allowed us to dramatically increase the number of macro-ions per numerical
cell and achieve the converged results for the velocity distributions of test electrons. We discuss
the electron preheating mechanisms, which can make a significant part of thermal electrons accessible
to the ion-driven waves observed in hybrid simulations. We find that the precursor wave field supplied
by ions has a considerable potential to preheat the electrons before they are shocked at the subshock.
