Context. Detailed characterizations of exoplanets are moving to the forefront of planetary science.
Temperature is a key marker for understanding atmospheric physics and chemistry. Aims. We aim to
retrieve temperatures of N2-O2 dominated atmospheres from secondary eclipse spectroscopic observations
of the thermal emission of Earth-like exoplanets orbiting G-, K-, and M-stars using large future
space telescopes. Methods. Line-by-line radiative transfer was used to generate synthetic thermal
infrared (TIR) observations. Atmospheric temperature is approximated by an expansion with base
vectors defined by a singular value decomposition of a matrix comprising representative profiles.
Nonlinear least squares fitting is used to estimate the expansion coefficients. Results. Analysis
of the $4.3 \rm\,\mu m$ and $15 \rm\,\mu m$ CO2 bands in the TIR permits inference of temperatures
even for low signal-to-noise (S/N) ~5 at medium resolution. Deviations from the true temperature
in the upper troposphere and stratosphere are usually a few Kelvin, with larger deviations in the
upper atmosphere and, less often, in the lower troposphere. Although the performance of the two
bands is equivalent in most cases, the longwave TIR is more favorable than the shortwave due to increased
star-planet contrast. A high spectral resolution, as provided by JWST instruments, is important
for retaining sensitivity to the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, the selection of an appropriate
set of base functions is also key. Conclusions. Temperature in the mid-atmosphere can be suitably
characterized by IR spectroscopy with a resolution of at least 1000 (ideally ~2500). Obtaining
the necessary S/N could be feasible with future missions, such as the Origins Space Telescope or
the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets. Meanwhile a least squares fitting with appropriate base
functions is also applicable for other classes of planets.
