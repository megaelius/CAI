Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) were likely major sources of extraterrestrial organics
to the early Earth. However, IDPs experience heating to > 500 ${\deg}$C for up to several seconds
during atmospheric entry. In this study, we aim to understand the effects of atmospheric entry heating
on the dominant organic component in IDPs by conducting flash heating experiments (4 s to 400 {\deg}C,
600 {\deg}C, 800 {\deg}C, and 1000 {\deg}C) on insoluble organic matter (IOM) extracted from the
meteorite Cold Bokkeveld (CM2). For each of the experimental charges, the bulk isotopic compositions
of H, N, and C were analyzed using IRMS, the H isotopic heterogeneities (occurrence of hotspots)
of the samples were measured by NanoSIMS, and the functional group chemistry and ordering of the
IOM was evaluated using FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. IOM in particles heated to >
600 {\deg}C experienced loss of isotopically heavy, labile H and N groups, resulting in decreases
in bulk ${\delta}$D, ${\delta}$15N, H/C and, upon heating > 800 {\deg}C, in N/C. The H heterogeneity
was not greatly affected by flash heating to < 600 {\deg}C, although the hotspots tended to be less
isotopically anomalous in the 600 {\deg}C sample than in the 400 {\deg}C sample. However, the hotspots
all but disappeared in the 800 {\deg}C sample. Loss of C=O groups occurred at 800 {\deg}C. Based on
the Raman G-band characteristics, the heating resulted in increased ordering of the polyaromatic
component of the IOM. The data presented in this study show that all aspects of the composition of
IOM in IDPs are affected by atmospheric entry heating. Modelling and temperature estimates from
stepwise release of He has shown that most IDPs are heated to > 500{\deg}C (Love and Brownlee, 1991;
Nier and Schlutter, 1993), hence, atmospheric entry heating is expected to have altered the organic
matter in most IDPs.
