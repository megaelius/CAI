In contrast to the predictions of the unified model, some X-ray unobscured Seyfert 2 galaxies have
been discovered in the last decade. One of them, the starburst/Seyfert composite galaxy IRAS 01072+4954
(z=0.0236), has a typical Type~1 X-ray emission, while its optical spectrum resembles an HII galaxy
and lacks the expected broad lines. We performed near-infrared integral-field observations of
this object with the aim to determine the nature of its nuclear emission and to find indications for
the existence or absence of a broad-line region. Several reasons have been proposed to explain such
peculiar emission. We studied the validity of such hypotheses, including the possibility for it
to be True-Seyfert~2. We found little obscuration towards the nucleus A_V = 2.5 mag, and a nuclear
star-formation rate Sigma_SFR < 11.6 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}, which is below the average in Seyferts.
Unresolved hot-dust emission with T ~ 1150 K seems to indicate the presence of a torus with its axis
close to the line of sight. We found that IRAS 01072+4954 hosts a low mass black hole with an estimated
mass of M_BH ~ 10^5 Msun and an upper limit of 2.5x10^6 Msun. Its bolometric luminosity is L_bol ~ 2.5x10^{42}
erg/s, which yields a high accretion rate with an Eddington ratio ~ 0.2. If the relations found in
more massive systems also apply to this case, then IRAS 01072+4954 should show broad emission lines
with FWHM_{broad} ~(400-600) km/s. Indeed, some indications for such narrow broad-line components
are seen in our data, but the evidence is not yet conclusive. This source thus seems not to be a True-Seyfert
2, but an extreme case of a narrow line Seyfert 1, which, due to the faintness of the active nucleus,
does not have strong FeII emission in the optical.
