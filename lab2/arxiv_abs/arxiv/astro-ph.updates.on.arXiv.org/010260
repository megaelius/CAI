The warm ($\log~T\approx5$) gas is an important gaseous component in the galaxy baryonic cycle.
We built a 2-dimension disk-CGM model to study the warm gas distribution of the Milky Way (MW) using
the absorption line surveys of Si IV and O VI. In this model, the disk component of both ions has the
same density profile ($n(r, z)=n_0\exp(-|z|/z_0)\exp(-r/r_0)$) with a scale height of $z_0=2.6\pm0.4\rm~kpc$
and a scale length of $r_0=6.1\pm1.2\rm~kpc$. For this disk component, we calculate the warm gas
mass of $\log(M/M_\odot)=(7.6\pm0.2)-\log\frac{Z}{Z_\odot}$. The similar disk density profiles
and total masses of Si IV and O VI-bearing gas set constraints on the ionization mechanisms. We suggest
that the warm gas disk might be dominated by the Galactic fountain mechanism, which ejects and recycles
gas to set both the scale height and the scale length of the warm gas disk. The CGM component in our model
has a dependence on Galactic latitude with a higher column density along the direction perpendicular
to the Galactic plane ($b=90^\circ$) than the column density along the radial direction ($b=0^\circ$).
The column density difference between these two directions is $0.82\pm0.32\rm~dex$ at $6.3\sigma$
for both ions. This difference may be due to the enrichment of Galactic feedback to the entire CGM,
or an additional interaction layer between the warm gas disk and the CGM; existing data cannot distinguish
between these two scenarios. If this higher column density at $b=90^\circ$ is for the entire CGM,
the total warm CGM mass is $\log(M/M_\odot)\approx(9.5-9.8)-\log\frac{Z}{0.5Z_\odot}$ within
the MW virial radius of $250\rm~kpc$.
