Context: Star formation takes place in giant molecular clouds, resulting in mass-segregated young
stellar clusters composed of Sun-like stars, brown dwarves, and massive O-type(50-100\msun)
stars. Aims: To identify candidate hub-filament systems (HFS) in the Milky-Way and examine their
role in the formation of the highest mass stars and star clusters. Methods: Filaments around ~35000
HiGAL clumps that are detected using the DisPerSE algorithm. Hub is defined as a junction of three
or more filaments. Column density maps were masked by the filament skeletons and averaged for HFS
and non-HFS samples to compute the radial profile along the filaments into the clumps. Results:
~3700~(11\%) are candidate HFS of which, ~2150~(60\%) are pre-stellar, ~1400~(40\%) are proto-stellar.
All clumps with L>10^4 Lsun and L>10^5 Lsun at distances respectively within 2kpc and 5kpc are located
in the hubs of HFS. The column-densities of hubs are found to be enhanced by a factor of ~2 (pre-stellar
sources) up to ~10 (proto-stellar sources). Conclusions: All high-mass stars preferentially
form in the density enhanced hubs of HFS. This amplification can drive the observed longitudinal
flows along filaments providing further mass accretion. Radiation pressure and feedback can escape
into the inter-filamentary voids. We propose a ``filaments to clusters'' unified paradigm for
star formation, with the following salient features: a) low-intermediate mass stars form in the
filaments slowly (10^6yr) and massive stars quickly (10^5yr) in the hub, b) the initial mass function
is the sum of stars continuously created in the HFS with all massive stars formed in the hub, c) Feedback
dissiption and mass segregation arise naturally due to HFS properties, and c) explain age spreads
within bound clusters and formation of isolated OB associations.
