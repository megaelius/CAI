Constructing dynamical models for interacting pair of galaxies as constrained by their observed
structure and kinematics crucially depends on the correct choice of the values of the relative inclination
($i$) between their galactic planes as well as the viewing angle ($\theta$), the angle between the
line of sight and the normal to the plane of their orbital motion. We construct Deep Convolutional
Neural Network (DCNN) models to determine the relative inclination ($i$) and the viewing angle
($\theta$) of interacting galaxy pairs, using N-body $+$ Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
simulation data from the GALMER database for training the same. In order to classify galaxy pairs
based on their $i$ values only, we first construct DCNN models for a (a) 2-class ( $i$ = 0 $^{\circ}$,
45$^{\circ}$ ) and (b) 3-class ($i = 0^{\circ}, 45^{\circ} \text{ and } 90^{\circ}$) classification,
obtaining $F_1$ scores of 99% and 98% respectively. Further, for a classification based on both
$i$ and $\theta$ values, we develop a DCNN model for a 9-class classification ($(i,\theta) \sim
(0^{\circ},15^{\circ}) ,(0^{\circ},45^{\circ}), (0^{\circ},90^{\circ}), (45^{\circ},15^{\circ}),
(45^{\circ}, 45^{\circ}), (45^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}), (90^{\circ}, 15^{\circ}), (90^{\circ},
45^{\circ}), (90^{\circ},90^{\circ})$), and the $F_1$ score was 97$\%$. Finally, we tested our
2-class model on real data of interacting galaxy pairs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR15,
and achieve an $F_1$ score of 78%. Our DCNN models could be further extended to determine additional
parameters needed to model dynamics of interacting galaxy pairs, which is currently accomplished
by trial and error method.
