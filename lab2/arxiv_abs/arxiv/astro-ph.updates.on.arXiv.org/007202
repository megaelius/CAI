Classification of transient and variable light curves is an essential step in using astronomical
observations to develop an understanding of their underlying physical processes. However, upcoming
deep photometric surveys, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will produce
a deluge of low signal-to-noise data for which traditional labeling procedures are inappropriate.
Probabilistic classification is more appropriate for the data but are incompatible with the traditional
metrics used on deterministic classifications. Furthermore, large survey collaborations intend
to use these classification probabilities for diverse science objectives, indicating a need for
a metric that balances a variety of goals. We describe the process used to develop an optimal performance
metric for an open classification challenge that seeks probabilistic classifications and must
serve many scientific interests. The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification
Challenge (PLAsTiCC) is an open competition aiming to identify promising techniques for obtaining
classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging a broader community
both within and outside astronomy. Using mock classification probability submissions emulating
archetypes of those anticipated of PLAsTiCC, we compare the sensitivity of metrics of classification
probabilities under various weighting schemes, finding that they yield qualitatively consistent
results. We choose as a metric for PLAsTiCC a weighted modification of the cross-entropy because
it can be meaningfully interpreted. Finally, we propose extensions of our methodology to ever more
complex challenge goals and suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric
of probabilistic classifications.
