We perform a maximum likelihood kinematic analysis of the two dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters
MACS J1206.2-0847 at $z=0.44$ and RXC J2248.7-4431 at $z=0.35$ to determine the total mass profile
in modified gravity models, using a modified version of the MAMPOSSt code of Mamon, Biviano and Bou\'e.
Our work is based on the kinematic and lensing mass profiles derived using the data from the Cluster
Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (hereafter CLASH) and the spectroscopic follow-up with
the Very Large Telescope (hereafter CLASH-VLT). We assume a spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW
hereafter) profile in order to obtain a constraint on the fifth force interaction range $\lambda$
for models in which the dependence of this parameter on the enviroment is negligible at the scale
considered (i.e. $\lambda=const$) and fixing the fifth force strength to the value predicted in
$f(R)$ gravity. We then use information from lensing analysis to put a prior on the other NFW free
parameters. In the case of MACSJ 1206 the joint kinematic+lensing analysis leads to an upper limit
on the effective interaction range $\lambda\le1.61\,\mbox{Mpc}$ at $\Delta\chi^{2}=2.71$
on the marginalized distribution. For RXJ 2248 instead a possible tension with the $\Lambda$CDM
model appears when adding lensing information, with a lower limit $\lambda\ge0.14\,\mbox{Mpc}$
at $\Delta\chi^{2}=2.71$. This is consequence of the slight difference between the lensing and
kinematic data, appearing in GR for this cluster, that could be explained in terms of modifications
of gravity. We discuss the impact of systematics and the limits of our analysis as well as future improvements
of the results obtained.[...]
