A non-zero mutual information between morphology of a galaxy and its large-scale environment is
known to exist in SDSS upto a few tens of Mpc. It is important to test the statistical significance
of these mutual information if any. We propose three different methods to test the statistical significance
of these non-zero mutual information and apply them to SDSS and Millennium Run simulation. We randomize
the morphological information of SDSS galaxies without affecting their spatial distribution
and compare the mutual information in the original and randomized datasets. We also divide the galaxy
distribution into smaller subcubes and randomly shuffle them many times keeping the morphological
information of galaxies intact. We compare the mutual information in the original SDSS data and
its shuffled realizations for different shuffling lengths. Using a t-test, we find that a statistically
significant (at 99.9% confidence level) mutual information between morphology and environment
exists upto the entire length scale probed. We also conduct another experiment using mock datasets
from a semi-analytic galaxy catalogue where we assign morphology to galaxies in a controlled manner
based on the density at their locations. The experiment clearly demonstrate that mutual information
can effectively capture the physical correlations between morphology and environment. Our analysis
suggests that physical association between morphology and environment may extend to much larger
length scales than currently believed and mutual information can be used as an useful statistical
measure for the study of large-scale environmental dependence of galaxy properties.
