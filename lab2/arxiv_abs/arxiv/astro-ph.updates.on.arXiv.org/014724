Time-delay cosmography of lensed quasars has achieved 2.4% precision on the measurement of the
Hubble constant, $H_0$. As part of an ongoing effort to uncover and control systematic uncertainties,
we investigate three potential sources: 1- stellar kinematics, 2- line-of-sight effects, and
3- the deflector mass model. To meet this goal in a quantitative way, we reproduced the H0LiCOW/SHARP/STRIDES
(hereafter TDCOSMO) procedures on a set of real and simulated data, and we find the following. First,
stellar kinematics cannot be a dominant source of error or bias since we find that a systematic change
of 10% of measured velocity dispersion leads to only a 0.7% shift on $H_0$ from the seven lenses analyzed
by TDCOSMO. Second, we find no bias to arise from incorrect estimation of the line-of-sight effects.
Third, we show that elliptical composite (stars + dark matter halo), power-law, and cored power-law
mass profiles have the flexibility to yield a broad range in $H_0$ values. However, the TDCOSMO procedures
that model the data with both composite and power-law mass profiles are informative. If the models
agree, as we observe in real systems owing to the "bulge-halo" conspiracy, $H_0$ is recovered precisely
and accurately by both models. If the two models disagree, as in the case of some pathological models
illustrated here, the TDCOSMO procedure either discriminates between them through the goodness
of fit, or it accounts for the discrepancy in the final error bars provided by the analysis. This conclusion
is consistent with a reanalysis of six of the TDCOSMO (real) lenses: the composite model yields $74.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$
$km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$, while the power-law model yields $H_0=74.2^{+1.6}_{-1.6}$ $km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}$.
In conclusion, we find no evidence of bias or errors larger than the current statistical uncertainties
reported by TDCOSMO.
