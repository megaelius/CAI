Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are a common feature of solar flares, but previously there has
been a lack of observational evidence to support any of the theoretical models that might explain
the origin of QPPs. We aimed to determine if there are any relationships between the QPP period and
other properties of the flaring region, using the sample of flares with QPPs from Pugh et al. (2017b).
If any relationships exist then these can be compared with scaling laws for the theoretical QPP mechanisms.
To obtain the flaring region properties we made use of the AIA 1600 and HMI data. The AIA 1600 images
allow the flare ribbons to be seen while the HMI magnetograms allow the positive and negative magnetic
polarity ribbons to be distinguished and the magnetic properties determined. The ribbon properties
calculated in this study were the ribbon separation distance, area, total unsigned magnetic flux,
and average magnetic field strength. Only the flares that occurred within \pm 60{\deg} of the solar
disk centre were included, which meant a sample of 20 flares with 22 QPP signals. Positive correlations
were found between the QPP period and the ribbon properties. The strongest correlations were with
the separation distance and magnetic flux. Because these ribbon properties also correlate with
the flare duration, and the relationship between the QPP period and flare duration may be influenced
by observational bias, we also made use of simulated data to check if artificial correlations could
be introduced. These simulations show that although QPPs cannot be detected for certain combinations
of QPP period and flare duration, this does not introduce an apparent correlation. There is evidence
of relationships between the QPP period and flare ribbon properties, and in the future the derived
scaling laws between these properties can be compared to equivalent scaling laws for theoretical
QPP mechanisms.
