We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on spatial dust distribution inside H$_\mathrm{II}$
regions using one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, which include absorption
and re-emission of photons by dust. In order to investigate size distribution of dust grains, we
introduce two additional fluid components describing large and small dust grains in the simulations.
Relative velocity between dust and gas strongly depends on the drag force. We include collisional
drag force and coulomb drag force. We find that, in a compact H$_\mathrm{II}$ region, a dust cavity
region is formed by radiation pressure. Resulting dust cavity sizes (~0.2 pc) agree with observational
estimates reasonably well. Since dust inside an H$_\mathrm{II}$ region is strongly charged, relative
velocity between dust and gas is mainly determined by the coulomb drag force. Strength of the coulomb
drag force is about 2-order of magnitude larger than that of the collisional drag force. In addition,
in a cloud of mass $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$, we find that the radiation pressure changes the grain size
distribution inside H$_\mathrm{II}$ regions. Since large (0.1 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) dust grains
are accelerated more efficiently than small (0.01 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) grains, the large to small
grain mass ratio becomes smaller by an order of magnitude compared with the initial one. Resulting
dust size distributions depend on the luminosity of the radiation source. The large and small grain
segregation becomes weaker when we assume stronger radiation source, since dust grain charges
become larger under stronger radiation and hence coulomb drag force becomes stronger.
