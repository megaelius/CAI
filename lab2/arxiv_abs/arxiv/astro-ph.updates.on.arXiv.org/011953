The pebble accretion model has the potential to explain the formation of various types of planets.
A growing planet embedded in a disk induces three-dimensional (3D) gas flow, which may influence
pebble accretion. In this study, we investigate the influence of the 3D planet-induced gas flow
on pebble accretion. Assuming a non-isothermal, inviscid gas disk, we perform 3D hydrodynamical
simulations on the spherical polar grid. Then we numerically integrate the equation of motion of
pebbles in 3D using hydrodynamical simulations data. We find that the trajectories of pebbles in
the planet-induced gas flow differ significantly from those in the unperturbed shear flow for a
wide range of pebble sizes investigated (${\rm St}=10^{-3}$--$10^{0}$, where ${\rm St}$ is the
Stokes number). The horseshoe flow and outflow of the gas alter the motion of the pebbles, which leads
to the reduction of the width of the accretion window, $w_{\rm acc}$, and the accretion cross section,
$A_{\rm acc}$. On the other hand, the changes in trajectories also cause an increase in relative
velocity of pebbles to the planet, which offsets the reduction of $w_{\rm acc}$ and $A_{\rm acc}$.
As a consequence, in the Stokes regime, the accretion probability of pebbles, $P_{\rm acc}$, in
the planet-induced gas flow is comparable to that in the unperturbed shear flow except when the Stokes
number is small, ${\rm St}\sim10^{-3}$, in 2D accretion, or when the thermal mass of the planet is
small, $m=0.03$ in 3D accretion. In contrast, in the Epstein regime, $P_{\rm acc}$ in the planet-induced
gas flow becomes smaller than that in the shear flow in the Stokes regime in both 2D and 3D accretion,
regardless of assumed ${\rm St}$ and $m$. Our results suggest that the 3D planet-induced gas flow
may be helpful to explain the distribution of exoplanets as well as the architecture of the solar
system.
