This paper shows that emerging spatial curvature is a generic feature of relativistic inhomogeneous
models of the large-scale universe. This phenomenon is absent in the Standard Cosmological Model,
which has a flat and fixed spatial curvature (small perturbations are considered in the Standard
Cosmological Model but their global average vanishes, leading to spatial flatness at all times).
This paper shows that with the nonlinear growth of cosmic structures the global average deviates
from zero. The analysis is based on the {\em silent universes} (a wide class of inhomogeneous cosmological
solutions of the Einstein equations) interwoven into the Styrofoam-type configuration. The initial
conditions are set in the early universe as perturbations around the $\Lambda$CDM model with $\Omega_m
= 0.31$, $\Omega_\Lambda = 0.69$, and $H_0 = 67.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. As the growth of structures
becomes nonlinear, the model deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model, and at the present instant if
averaged over a domain with mass $M = 3.2 \times 10^{20} M_{\odot}$ and volume $V = (2150\,{\rm Mpc})^3$
(at these scales the cosmic variance is negligibly small) gives: $\Omega_m^{\cal D} = 0.22$, $\Omega_\Lambda^{\cal
D} = 0.61$, $\Omega_{\cal R}^{\cal D} = 0.15$ (in the FLRW limit $\Omega_{\cal R}^{\cal D} \to \Omega_k$),
and $\langle H \rangle_{\cal D} = 72.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Given the fact that low-redshift
observations favor higher values of the Hubble constant and lower values of matter density, compared
to the CMB constraints, the emergence of the spatial curvature in the low-redshift universe could
be an obvious solution to these discrepancies.
