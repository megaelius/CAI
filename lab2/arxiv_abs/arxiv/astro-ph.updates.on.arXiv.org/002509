We provide a comprehensive review of major developments in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts,
with particular focus on the discoveries made within the last fifteen years when their true nature
was uncovered. We describe the observational properties of photons from the radio to multi-GeV
bands, both in the prompt emission and the afterglow phases. Mechanisms for the generation of these
photons in GRBs are discussed and confronted with observations to shed light on the physical properties
of these explosions, their progenitor stars and the surrounding medium. After presenting observational
evidence that a powerful, collimated, jet moving at close to the speed of light is produced in these
explosions, we describe our current understanding regarding the generation, acceleration, and
dissipation of the jet and compare these properties with jets associated with AGNs and pulsars.
We discuss mounting observational evidence that long duration GRBs are produced when massive stars
die, and that at least some short duration bursts are associated with old, roughly solar mass, compact
stars. The question of whether a black-hole or a strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron
star is produced in these explosions is also discussed. We provide a brief summary of what we have
learned about relativistic collisionless shocks and particle acceleration from GRB afterglow
studies, and discuss the current understanding of radiation mechanism during the prompt emission
phase. We discuss theoretical predictions of possible high-energy neutrino emission from GRBs
and the current observational constraints. Finally, we discuss how these explosions may be used
to study cosmology, e.g. star formation, metal enrichment, reionization history, as well as the
formation of first stars and galaxies in the universe.
