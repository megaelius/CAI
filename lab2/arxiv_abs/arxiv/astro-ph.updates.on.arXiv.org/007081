We investigate the bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of dwarf galaxies using the distribution
of log($L_{H\alpha}/L_{UV}$) of 185 local galaxies. We expand on the work of Weisz et al. 2012 to
consider a wider range of SFHs and stellar metallicities, and show that there are large degeneracies
in a periodic, top-hat burst model. We argue that all galaxies of a given mass have similar SFHs and
we can therefore include the $L_{H\alpha}$ distributions (subtracting the median trend with stellar
mass, referred to as $\Delta \text{log}(L_{H\alpha})$) in our analyses. $\Delta \text{log}(L_{H\alpha})$
traces the amplitude of the bursts, and log($L_{H\alpha}/L_{UV}$) is a function of timescale,
amplitude, and shape of the bursts. We examine the 2-dimensional distribution of these two indicators
constrain the SFHs. We use exponentially rising/falling bursts to determine timescales ($e$-folding
time, $\tau$). We find that galaxies below $10^{7.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ undergo large (amplitudes of
$\sim 100$) and rapid ($\tau < 30$ Myr) bursts, while galaxies above $10^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$ experience
smaller (maximum amplitudes $\sim 10$), slower ($\tau \gtrsim 300$ Myr) bursts. We compare to the
FIRE-2 hydrodynamical simulations and find that the burst amplitudes agree with observations,
but they are too rapid in more massive galaxies ($M_* > 10^8$ M$_{\odot}$). Finally, we confirm that
stochastic sampling of the stellar mass function can not reproduce the observed distributions
unless the standard assumptions of cluster and stellar mass functions are changed. With the next
generation of telescopes, measurements of $L_{UV}$ and $L_{H\alpha}$ will become available for
dwarf galaxies at high-redshift, enabling similar analyses of galaxies in the early universe.
