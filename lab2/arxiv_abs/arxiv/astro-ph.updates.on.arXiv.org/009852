We have carried out polarimetric observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) toward the Class 0 protostellar system L1448 IRS 2, which is a proto-binary embedded
within a flattened, rotating structure, and for which a hint of a central disk has been suggested,
but whose magnetic fields are aligned with the bipolar outflow on the cloud core scale. Our high sensitivity
and high resolution ($\sim 100$ au) observations show a clear hourglass magnetic field morphology
centered on the protostellar system, but the central pattern is consistent with a toroidal field
indicative of a circumstellar disk, although other interpretations are also possible, including
field lines dragged by an equatorial accretion flow into a configuration parallel to the midplane.
If a relatively large disk does exist, it would suggest that the magnetic braking catastrophe is
averted in this system, not through a large misalignment between the magnetic and rotation axes,
but rather through some other mechanisms, such as non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects and/or
turbulence. We have also found a relationship of decreasing polarization fractions with intensities
and the various slopes of this relationship can be understood as multiple polarization mechanisms
and/or depolarization from a changing field morphology. In addition, we found a prominent clumpy
depolarization strip crossing the center perpendicular to the bipolar outflow. Moreover, a rough
estimate of the magnetic field strength indicates that the field is strong enough to hinder formation
of a rotationally supported disk, which is inconsistent with the feature of a central toroidal field.
