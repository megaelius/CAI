We conduct a series of numerical experiments into the nature of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics
in the postbounce stalled-shock phase of core-collapse supernovae using 3D general-relativistic
hydrodynamic simulations of a $27$-$M_\odot$ progenitor star with a neutrino leakage/heating
scheme. We vary the strength of neutrino heating and find three cases of 3D dynamics: (1) neutrino-driven
convection, (2) initially neutrino-driven convection and subsequent development of the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI), (3) SASI dominated evolution. This confirms previous 3D results
of Hanke et al. 2013, ApJ 770, 66 and Couch & Connor 2014, ApJ 785, 123. We carry out simulations
with resolutions differing by up to a factor of $\sim$4 and demonstrate that low resolution is artificially
favorable for explosion in the 3D convection-dominated case, since it decreases the efficiency
of energy transport to small scales. Low resolution results in higher radial convective fluxes
of energy and enthalpy, more fully buoyant mass, and stronger neutrino heating. In the SASI-dominated
case, lower resolution damps SASI oscillations. In the convection-dominated case, a quasi-stationary
angular kinetic energy spectrum $E(\ell)$ develops in the heating layer. Like other 3D studies,
we find $E(\ell) \propto \ell^{-1}$ in the "inertial range," while theory and local simulations
argue for $E(\ell) \propto \ell^{-5/3}$. We argue that current 3D simulations do not resolve the
inertial range of turbulence and are affected by numerical viscosity up to the energy containing
scale, creating a "bottleneck" that prevents an efficient turbulent cascade.
