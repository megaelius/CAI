The Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy, and Centaurus A host flattened distributions of satellite
galaxies which exhibits coherent velocity trends indicative of rotation. Comparably extreme
satellite structures are very rare in cosmological LCDM simulations, giving rise to the `satellite
plane problem'. As a possible explanation it has been suggested that earlier-forming, higher concentration
host halos contain more flattened and kinematically coherent satellite planes. We have tested
for such a proposed correlation between the satellite plane and host halo properties in the ELVIS
suite of simulations. We find evidence neither for a correlation of plane flattening with halo concentration
or formation time, nor for a correlation of kinematic coherence with concentration. The height
of the thinnest sub-halo planes does correlate with the host virial radius and with the radial extent
of the sub-halo system. This can be understood as an effect of not accounting for differences in the
radial distribution of sub-halos, and selecting them from different volumes than covered by the
actual observations. Being part of a halo pair like the Local Group does not result in more narrow
or more correlated satellite planes either. Additionally, using the PhatELVIS simulations we
show that the presence of a central galaxy potential does not favor more narrow or more correlated
satellite planes, it rather leads to slightly wider planes. Such a central potential is a good approximation
of the dominant effect baryonic physics in cosmological simulations has on a sub-halo population.
This suggests that, in contrast to other small-scale problems, the planes of satellite galaxies
issue is made worse by accounting for baryonic effects.
