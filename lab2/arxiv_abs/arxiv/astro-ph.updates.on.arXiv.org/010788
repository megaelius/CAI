Interplanetary dust (IPD) is thought to be recently supplied from asteroids and comets. Grain properties
of the IPD can give us the information about the environment in the proto-solar system, and can be
traced from the shapes of silicate features around 10 $\mu$m seen in the zodiacal emission spectra.
We analyzed mid-IR slit-spectroscopic data of the zodiacal emission in various sky directions
obtained with the Infrared Camera on board AKARI satellite. After we subtracted the contamination
due to instrumental artifacts, we have successfully obtained high S/N spectra and have determined
detailed shapes of excess emission features in the 9 -- 12 $\mu$m range in all the sky directions.
According to a comparison between the feature shapes averaged over all directions and the absorption
coefficients of candidate minerals, the IPD was found to typically include small silicate crystals,
especially enstatite grains. We also found the variations in the feature shapes and the related
grain properties among the different sky directions. From investigations of the correlation between
feature shapes and the brightness contributions from dust bands, the IPD in dust bands seems to have
the size frequency distribution biased toward large grains and show the indication of hydrated
minerals. The spectra at higher ecliptic latitude showed a stronger excess, which indicates an
increase in the fraction of small grains included in the line of sight at higher ecliptic latitudes.
If we focus on the dependence of detailed feature shapes on ecliptic latitudes, the IPD at higher
latitudes was found to have a lower olivine/pyroxene ratio for small amorphous grains. The variation
of the mineral composition of the IPD in different sky directions may imply different properties
of the IPD from different types of parent bodies, because the spatial distribution of the IPD depends
on the type of the parent body.
