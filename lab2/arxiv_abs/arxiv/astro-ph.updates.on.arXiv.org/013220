In this paper, we present a numerical method to study the predicted lightcurves as a function of viewing
angle. We extrapolate the fitting formulae for the mass and velocity of tidal dynamical ejecta across
a wide range of mass ratio validated with 66 simulations and use them in the calculations of the kilonova
lightcurves. The calculated peak luminosity of a BH-NS merger kilonova is typically about a few
times $10^{41}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$, which is always $\lesssim4.5\times10^{41}\ {\rm erg\ s^{-1}}$.
This corresponds to the AB absolute magnitudes fainter than $\sim -15\ {\rm mag}$ in optical and
$\sim -16\ {\rm mag}$ in infrared. Since the projected photosphere area of the dynamical ejecta
is much larger than that of the disk wind outflows, the dynamical ejecta usually contribute to the
majority of the kilonova emission from BH-NS mergers. The fitted blackbody temperature and the
shape of the observed multi-band lightcurves are insensitive to the line of sight. The peak time
of the observed multi-band lightcurves, affected by the light propagation effect, is related to
the relative motion direction between the dynamical ejecta and the observer. The observed luminosity
varies with the projected photosphere area determined by the viewing angles. However, the predicted
peak luminosity only varies by a factor of $\sim (2 - 3)$ (or by $\sim1\ {\rm mag}$) for different viewing
angles. When the short-duration gamma-ray burst afterglow is taken into account, for an on-axis
geometry, the kilonova emission is usually outshone by the afterglow emission and can be only observed
in the redder bands, especially in the $K$-band at late times. Compared with GW170817/AT2017gfo,
the BH-NS merger kilonovae are optically dim but possibly infrared bright. At the same epoch after
the merger, the blackbody fitting temperature of the BH-NS merger kilonovae is lower than that of
GW170817/AT2017gfo.
