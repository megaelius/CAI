Drift-pair bursts are an unusual type of solar low-frequency radio emission, which appear in the
dynamic spectra as two parallel drifting bright stripes separated in time. Recent imaging spectroscopy
observations allowed for the quantitative characterization of the drifting pairs in terms of source
size, position, and evolution. Here, the drift-pair parameters are qualitatively analyzed and
compared with the newly-developed Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique simulating radio-wave propagation
in the inhomogeneous anisotropic turbulent solar corona. The results suggest that the drift-pair
bursts can be formed due to a combination of the refraction and scattering processes, with the trailing
component being the result of turbulent reflection (turbulent radio echo). The formation of drift-pair
bursts requires an anisotropic scattering with the level of plasma density fluctuations comparable
to that in type III bursts, but with a stronger anisotropy at the inner turbulence scale. The anisotropic
radio-wave scattering model can quantitatively reproduce the key properties of drift-pair bursts:
the apparent source size and its increase with time at a given frequency, the parallel motion of the
source centroid positions, and the delay between the burst components. The trailing component
is found to be virtually co-spatial and following the main component. The simulations suggest that
the drift-pair bursts are likely to be observed closer to the disk center and below 100 MHz due to the
effects of free-free absorption and scattering. The exciter of drift-pairs is consistent with
propagating packets of whistlers, allowing for a fascinating way to diagnose the plasma turbulence
and the radio emission mechanism.
