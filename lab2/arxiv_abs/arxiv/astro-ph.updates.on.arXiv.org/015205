Stellar rotation periods can be determined by observing brightness variations caused by active
magnetic regions transiting visible stellar disk as the star rotates. The successful stellar photometric
surveys stemming from the Kepler and TESS observations led to the determination of rotation periods
in tens of thousands of young and active stars. However, there is still a lack of information about
rotation periods of older and less active stars, like the Sun. The irregular temporal profiles of
light curves caused by the decay times of active regions, which are comparable to or even shorter
than stellar rotation periods, combine with the random emergence of active regions to make period
determination for such stars very difficult. We tested the performance of the new method for the
determination of stellar rotation periods against stars with previously determined rotation
periods. The method is based on calculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) and identifying
the position of the inflection point (i.e. point with the highest gradient). The GPS method is specifically
aimed at determining rotation periods of low activity stars like the Sun. We applied the GPS method
to 1047 Sun-like stars observed by the Kepler telescope. We show that the GPS method returns precise
values of stellar rotation periods. Furthermore, it allows us to constrain the ratio between facular
and spot areas of active regions at the moment of their emergence. We show that relative facular area
decreases with stellar rotation rate. Our results suggest that the GPS method can be successfully
applied to retrieve periods of stars with both regular and non-regular light curves.
