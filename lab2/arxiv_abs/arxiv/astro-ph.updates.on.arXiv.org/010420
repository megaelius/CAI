Periodic quasars are candidates for binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) efficiently emitting
low frequency gravitational waves. Recently, $\sim$150 candidates were identified from optical
synoptic surveys. However, they may be false positives caused by stochastic quasar variability
given the few cycles covered (typically 1.5). To independently test the binary hypothesis, we search
for evidence of truncated or gapped circumbinary accretion disks (CBDs) in their spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). Our work is motivated by CBD simulations that predict flux deficits as cutoffs
from central cavities opened by secondaries or notches from minidisks around both BHs. We find that
candidate periodic quasars show SEDs similar to those of control quasars matched in redshift and
luminosity. While seven of 138 candidates show a blue cutoff in the IR-optical-UV SED, which may
represent CBDs with central cavities, the red SED fraction is similar to that in control quasars,
suggesting no correlation between periodicity and SED anomaly. Alternatively, dust reddening
may cause red SEDs. The fraction of extremely radio-loud quasars, i.e., blazars (with $R>100$),
is tentatively higher than that in control quasars (at 2.5$\sigma$). Our results suggest that,
assuming most periodic candidates are robust, IR-optical-UV SEDs of CBDs are similar to those of
accretion disks of single BHs, if the periodicity is driven by BSBHs; the higher blazar fraction
may signal precessing radio jets. Alternatively, most current candidate periodic quasars identified
from few-cycle light curves may be false positives. Their tentatively higher blazar fraction and
lower Eddington ratios may both be caused by selection biases.
