We investigate the infrared contribution from supermassive black hole activity versus host galaxy
emission in the mid to far-infrared (IR) spectrum for a large sample of X-ray bright active galactic
nuclei (AGN) residing in dusty, star-forming host galaxies. We select 703 AGN with L_X = 10^42-46
ergs/s at 0.1 < z < 5 from the Chandra XBootes X-ray Survey with rich multi-band observations in the
optical to far-IR. This is the largest sample to date of X-ray AGN with mid and far-IR detections that
uses spectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to determine intrinsic AGN and host galaxy
infrared luminosities. We determine weak or nonexistent relationships when averaging star-formation
activity as a function of AGN activity, but see stronger positive trends when averaging L_X in bins
of star-forming activity for AGN at low redshifts. We estimate an average dust covering factor of
33% based on infrared SEDs and bolometric AGN luminosity, corresponding to a Type 2 AGN population
of roughly a third. We also see a population of AGN that challenge the inclination based unification
model with individual dust covering factors that contradict the nuclear obscuration expected
from observed X-ray hardness ratios. We see no strong connection between AGN fractions in the IR
and corresponding total infrared, 24 um, or X-ray luminosities. The average rest-frame AGN contribution
as a function of IR wavelength shows significant (~80%) contributions in the mid-IR that trail off
at lambda > 30 um. Additionally, we provide a relation between observed L_X and pure AGN IR output
for high-z AGN allowing future studies to estimate AGN infrared contribution using only observed
X-ray flux density estimates.
