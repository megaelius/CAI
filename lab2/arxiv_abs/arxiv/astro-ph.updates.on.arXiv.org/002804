Interpreting observations of distant galaxies in terms of constraints on physical parameters
- such as stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR) and dust optical depth - requires spectral synthesis
modelling. We analyse the reliability of these physical parameters as determined under commonly
adopted `classical' assumptions: star-formation histories assumed to be exponentially declining
functions of time, a simple dust law and no emission-line contribution. Improved modelling techniques
and data quality now allow us to use a more sophisticated approach, including realistic star-formation
histories, combined with modern prescriptions for dust attenuation and nebular emission (Pacifici
et al. 2012). We present a Bayesian analysis of the spectra and multi-wavelength photometry of 1048
galaxies from the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range 0.7<z<2.8 and in the stellar mass range
9<log(M/Mo)<12. We find that, using the classical spectral library, stellar masses are
systematically overestimated (~0.1 dex) and SFRs are systematically underestimated (~0.6 dex)
relative to our more sophisticated approach. We also find that the simultaneous fit of photometric
fluxes and emission-line equivalent widths helps break a degeneracy between SFR and optical depth
of the dust, reducing the uncertainties on these parameters. Finally, we show how the biases of classical
approaches can affect the correlation between stellar mass and SFR for star-forming galaxies (the
`Star-Formation Main Sequence'). We conclude that the normalization, slope and scatter of this
relation strongly depend on the adopted approach and demonstrate that the classical, oversimplified
approach cannot recover the true distribution of stellar mass and SFR.
