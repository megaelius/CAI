Wide low-mass substellar companions are known to be very rare among low-mass stars, but appear to
become increasingly common with increasing stellar mass. However, B-type stars, which are the
most massive stars within ~150 pc of the Sun, have not yet been examined to the same extent as AFGKM-type
stars in that regard. In order to address this issue, we launched the ongoing B-star Exoplanet Abundance
Study (BEAST) to examine the frequency and properties of planets, brown dwarfs, and disks around
B-type stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) association; we also analyzed archival data
of B-type stars in Sco-Cen. During this process, we identified a candidate substellar companion
to the B9-type spectroscopic binary HIP 79098 AB, which we refer to as HIP 79098 (AB)b. The candidate
had been previously reported in the literature, but was classified as a background contaminant
on the basis of its peculiar colors. Here we demonstrate that the colors of HIP 79098 (AB)b are consistent
with several recently discovered young and low-mass brown dwarfs, including other companions
to stars in Sco-Cen. Furthermore, we show unambiguous common proper motion over a 15-year baseline,
robustly identifying HIP 79098 (AB)b as a bona fide substellar circumbinary companion at a 345+/-6
AU projected separation to the B9-type stellar pair. With a model-dependent mass of 16-25 Mjup yielding
a mass ratio of <1%, HIP 79098 (AB)b joins a growing number of substellar companions with planet-like
mass ratios around massive stars. Our observations underline the importance of common proper motion
analysis in the identification of physical companionship, and imply that additional companions
could potentially remain hidden in the archives of purely photometric surveys.
