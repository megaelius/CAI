Context: Finding Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) behind the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is difficult
because of the high stellar density in these fields. Although the first AGN behind the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC) were reported in the 1980s, it is only recently that the number of AGN known behind the
SMC has increased by several orders of magnitude. Aims: The mid-infrared colour selection technique
has been proven to be an efficient means of identifying AGN, especially obscured sources. The X-ray
regime is complementary in this regard and we use XMM-Newton observations to support the identification
of AGN behind the SMC. Methods: We present a catalogue of AGN behind the SMC by correlating an updated
X-ray point source catalogue from our XMM-Newton survey of the SMC with already known AGN from the
literature as well as a list of candidates obtained from the ALLWISE mid-infrared colour selection
criterion. We studied the properties of the sample with respect to their redshifts, luminosities
and X-ray spectral characteristics. We also identified the near-infrared counterpart of the sources
from the VISTA observations. Results: The redshift and luminosity distributions of the sample
(where known) indicate that we detect sources from nearby Seyfert galaxies to distant and obscured
quasars. The X-ray hardness ratios are compatible with those typically expected for AGN. The VISTA
colours and variability are also consistent in this regard. A positive correlation was observed
between the integrated X-ray flux (0.2--12 keV) and the ALLWISE and VISTA magnitudes. We further
present a sample of new candidate AGN and candidates for obscured AGN. All of these make an interesting
subset for further follow-up studies. An initial spectroscopic follow-up of 6 out of the 81 new candidates
showed all six sources are active galaxies, albeit two with narrow emission lines.
