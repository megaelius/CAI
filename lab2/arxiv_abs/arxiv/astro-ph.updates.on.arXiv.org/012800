We present infrared K'- (2.1 micron) and L'-band (3.8 micron) high-spatial-resolution (<0.3")
imaging observations of 17 nearby (z < 0.17) ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) assisted
with the adaptive optics of the Subaru Telescope. We search for compact red K'-L' color emission
as the indicator of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) due to AGN-heated hot dust emission.
Two luminous dual AGN candidates are revealed. Combining these results with those of our previous
study, we can state that the detected fraction of luminous dual AGNs in nearby ULIRGs is much less
than unity (<20%), even when infrared wavelengths >2 micron are used that should be sensitive to
buried AGNs due to small dust extinction effects. For ULIRGs with resolved multiple nuclear K'-band
emission, we estimate the activation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at individual galaxy
nuclei in the form of AGN luminosity normalized by SMBH mass inferred from host galaxy stellar luminosity.
We confirm a trend that more massive SMBHs in K'-band brighter primary galaxy nuclei are generally
more active, with higher SMBH-mass-normalized AGN luminosity than less massive SMBHs in K'-band
fainter secondary galaxy nuclei, as predicted by numerical simulations of gas-rich major galaxy
mergers. In two sources, the presence of even infrared elusive extremely deeply buried AGNs is indicated
by comparisons with available (sub)millimeter data. Non-synchronous SMBH activation (i.e.,
less activation of less massive SMBHs) and the possible presence of such infrared elusive AGNs may
be responsible for the small fraction of infrared-detected luminous dual AGNs in nearby merging
ULIRGs.
