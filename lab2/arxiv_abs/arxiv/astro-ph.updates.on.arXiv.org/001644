The nuclear symmetry energy is intimately connected with nuclear astrophysics. This contribution
focuses on the estimation of the symmetry energy from experiment and how it is related to the structure
of neutron stars. The most important connection is between the radii of neutron stars and the pressure
of neutron star matter in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation density $n_s$. This pressure is
essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry energy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients
of a Taylor expansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$. We discuss constraints on these parameters
that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that these constraints are largely model-independent
by deriving them qualitatively from a simple nuclear model. We also summarize how recent theoretical
studies of pure neutron matter can reinforce these constraints. To date, several different astrophysical
measurements of neutron star radii have been attempted. Attention is focused on photospheric radius
expansion bursts and on thermal emissions from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. While none of
these observations can, at the present time, determine individual neutron star radii to better
than 20% accuracy, the body of observations can be used with Bayesian techniques to effectively
constrain them to higher precision. These techniques invert the structure equations and obtain
estimates of the pressure-density relation of neutron star matter, not only near $n_s$, but up to
the highest densities found in neutron star interiors. The estimates we derive for neutron star
radii are in concordance with predictions from nuclear experiment and theory.
