The state-of-the-art geometry models of stars/dust suggest that dust attenuation toward nebular
regions ($A_{V,gas}$) is always larger than that of stellar regions ($A_{V,star}$). Utilizing
the newly released integral field spectroscopic data from the MaNGA survey, we investigate whether
and how the $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratio varies from subgalactic to galactic scales. On a subgalactic
scale, we report a stronger correlation between $A_{V,star}$ and $A_{V,gas}$ for more active HII
regions. The local $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ is found to have moderate nonlinear correlations with
three tracers of diffuse ionized gas (DIG), as well as indicators of gas-phase metallicity and ionization.
The DIG regions tend to have larger $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ compared to classic HII regions excited
by young OB stars. Metal-poor regions with a higher ionized level suffer much less nebular attenuation
and thus have larger $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratios. A low-$A_{V,gas}$ and high-$A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$
sequence, which can be resolved into DIG-dominated and metal-poor regions, on the three BPT diagrams
is found. Based on these observations, we suggest that besides the geometry of stars/dust, local
physical conditions such as metallicity and ionized level also play an important role in determining
the $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$. On a galactic scale, the global $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratio has
strong correlations with stellar mass ($M_*$), moderate correlations with SFR and metallicity,
and weak correlations with inclination and specific SFR. Galaxies with larger $M_*$ and higher
SFR that are more metal-rich tend to have smaller $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ ratios. Such correlations
form a decreasing trend of $A_{V,star}/A_{V,gas}$ along the star-forming main sequence and mass-metallicity
relation. The dust growth process accompanied by galaxy growth might be one plausible explanation
for our observations.
