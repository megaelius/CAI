Seeking to establish whether active region upflow material contributes to the slow solar wind,
we examine in detail the plasma upflows from Active Region (AR)10978, which crossed the Sun's disc
in the interval 8 to 16 December, 2007 during Carrington rotation (CR)2064. In previous work, using
data from the Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer, upflow velocity evolution was extensively studied
as the region crossed the disc while a linear force-free magnetic extrapolation was used to confirm
aspects of the velocity evolution and to establish the presence of quasi-separatrix layers at the
upflow source areas. The plasma properties, temperature, density and first ionisation potential
bias (FIP-bias) were measured with the spectrometer during the disc passage of the active region.
Global potential field source surface (PFSS) models showed that AR 10978 was completely covered
by the closed field of a helmet streamer that is part of the streamer belt. Thus it is not clear how any
of the upflowing AR-associated plasma could reach the source surface at 2.5 R(Sun)and contribute
to the slow solar wind. However a detailed examination of solar-wind in-situ data obtained by the
Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft at the L1 point shows that the increase in O^7+/O^6+,
C^6+/C^5+ and Fe/O - a FIP-bias proxy - are present before the heliospheric current sheet crossing.
These increases, along with an accompanying reduction in proton velocity and an increase in density
are characteristic of both AR and slow-wind plasma. Finally we describe a two-step reconnection
process by which some of the upflowing plasma from the AR could reach the heliosphere.
