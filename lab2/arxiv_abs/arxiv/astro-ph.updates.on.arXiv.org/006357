Large-scale, 'dead' radio galaxies are almost as rare as those hosted by dusty disk galaxies. The
emission surrounding the lenticular galaxy NGC 1534 is one such example, and in this paper we present
a followup of the remnant radio emission surrounding the galaxy with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array in conjunction with data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). We find that NGC 1534 has
no significant compact emission suggesting a lack of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), and instead
find low-power radio emission tracing its star-formation history. The radio-derived star-formation
rate is found to be consistent with that derived via mid-infrared emission at $S\!F\!R_{1.4} = 0.38
\pm 0.03$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, further pointing towards a lack of nuclear activity. The spectral
energy distribution of the large-scale emission is well-fit by a continuous injection model with
an additional 'off' component, implying the emission is indeed no longer fuelled by any injection
of relativistic electrons. In particular, we find that the spectral age of the emission is on the
order of $\sim203$ Myr, having been active for only $\sim44$ Myr. Polarimetric analysis points
to both a large-scale magneto-ionic foreground associated with the Galaxy with a Faraday depth
of $+33$ rad$\,$m$^{-2}$ and a component associated with the northern lobe of the radio emission
at $-153$ rad$\,$m$^{-2}$. The magnetic field structure of the northern lobe shows an unusual circular
structure of unknown origin. We discuss that while such sources are rare, combined low and high frequency
radio surveys with high surface-brightness sensitivities are expected to greatly increase their
numbers in the coming decade and this combined with panchromatic data from new optical and infrared
observations should provide a wealth of information on the hosts of this emission.
