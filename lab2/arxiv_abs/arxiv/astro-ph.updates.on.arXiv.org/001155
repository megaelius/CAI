We present a novel perspective on the clustering of dark matter in phase space by defining the particle
phase space average density ($P^2SAD$) as a two-dimensional extension of the two-point correlation
function averaged within a certain volume in phase space. This statistics is a very sensitive measure
of cold small scale (sub)structure of dark matter haloes. By analysing the structure of $P^2SAD$
in Milky-Way-size haloes using the high resolution Aquarius simulations, we find it to be nearly
universal at small scales (i.e. small separations in phase space), in the regime dominated by gravitationally
bound substructures. This remarkable universality occurs across time and in regions of substantially
different ambient densities (by nearly four orders of magnitude), with typical variations in $P^2SAD$
of a factor of a few. The maximum variations occur in regions where resolved substructures have been
strongly disrupted (e.g. near the halo centre). The universality is also preserved across haloes
of similar mass but diverse mass accretion histories and subhalo distributions: they possess only
slightly different $P^2SAD$s at small scales without any re-scaling. The universality is also
broken at large scales (i.e. large separations in phase space), where the smooth dark matter distribution
in the halo dominates $P^2SAD$. Although at small scales the structure of $P^2SAD$ is roughly described
by a subhalo model, we argue that the simulation data is better fitted by a family of superellipse
contours. This functional shape is inspired by a model that extends the stable clustering hypothesis
into phase space. In a companion paper ( arXiv:1311.3296 ), we refine this model and show its advantages
as a method to obtain predictions for non-gravitational signatures of dark matter.
