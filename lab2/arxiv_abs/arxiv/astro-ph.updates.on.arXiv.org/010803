Tremaine and Weinberg (TW) proposed a conceptually simple procedure relying on long-slit spectroscopy
to measure the pattern speeds of bars ($\Omega_{\rm p}$) in disk galaxies. Using a simulated galaxy,
we investigate the potential biases and uncertainties of TW measurements using increasingly popular
integral-field spectrographs (IFSs), for which multiple pseudo-slits (and thus independent
measurements) can be constructed with a single observation. Most important, to establish the spatial
coverage required and ensure the validity of the measurements, the inferred $\Omega_{\rm p}$ must
asymptotically converge as the (half-)length of each pseudo-slit used is increased. The requirement
for our simulation is to reach $\approx1.3$ times the half-light radius, but this may vary from galaxy
to galaxy. Only those slits located within the bar region yield accurate measurements. We confirm
that the position angle of the disk is the dominant source of systematic error in TW $\Omega_{\rm
p}$ measurements, leading to under/overestimates of tens of percents for inaccuracies of even
a few degrees. Recasting the data so that the data grid aligns with the disk major axis leads to slightly
reduced uncertainties. Accurate measurements are obtained only for well-defined ranges of the
bar angle (relative to the galaxy major axis) $\phi_{\rm bar}$ and the inclination angle $i$, here
$10\lesssim\phi_{\rm bar}\lesssim75^{\circ}$ and $105\lesssim\phi_{\rm bar}\lesssim170^{\circ}$
and $15\lesssim i\lesssim70^{\circ}$. The adopted (pseudo-)slit widths, spatial resolution,
and (unless extremely aggressive) spatial binning of IFS data have no significant impact on the
measurements. Our results thus provide useful guidelines for reliable and accurate direct $\Omega_{\rm
p}$ measurements with IFS observations.
