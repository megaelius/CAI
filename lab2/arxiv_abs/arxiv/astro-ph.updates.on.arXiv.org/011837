Despite the existence of co-orbital bodies in the solar system, and the prediction of the formation
of co-orbital planets by planetary system formation models, no co-orbital exoplanets (also called
trojans) have been detected thus far. In this paper we investigate how a pair of co-orbital exoplanets
would fare during their migration in a protoplanetary disc. To this end, we computed a stability
criterion of the Lagrangian equilibria L4 and L5 under generic dissipation and slow mass evolution.
Depending on the strength and shape of these perturbations, the system can either evolve towards
the Lagrangian equilibrium, or tend to increase its amplitude of libration, possibly all the way
to horseshoe orbits or even exiting the resonance. We estimated the various terms of our criterion
using a set of hydrodynamical simulations, and show that the dynamical coupling between the disc
perturbations and both planets have a significant impact on the stability: the structures induced
by each planet in the disc perturb the dissipative forces applied on the other planets over each libration
cycle. Amongst our results on the stability of co-orbitals, several are of interest to constrain
the observability of such configurations: long-distance inward migration and smaller leading
planets tend to increase the libration amplitude around the Lagrangian equilibria, while leading
massive planets and belonging to a resonant chain tend to stabilise it. We also show that, depending
on the strength of the dissipative forces, both the inclination and the eccentricity of the smaller
of the two co-orbitals can be significantly increased during the inward migration of the co-orbital
pair, which can have a significant impact on the detectability by transit of such configurations.
