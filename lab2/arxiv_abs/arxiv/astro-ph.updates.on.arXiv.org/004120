We use MasterCode to perform a frequentist analysis of the constraints on a phenomenological MSSM
model with 11 parameters, the pMSSM11, including constraints from ~ 36/fb of LHC data at 13 TeV and
PICO, XENON1T and PandaX-II searches for dark matter scattering, as well as previous accelerator
and astrophysical measurements, presenting fits both with and without the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint.
The pMSSM11 is specified by the following parameters: 3 gaugino masses $M_{1,2,3}$, a common mass
for the first-and second-generation squarks $m_{\tilde{q}}$ and a distinct third-generation
squark mass $m_{\tilde{q}_3}$, a common mass for the first-and second-generation sleptons $m_{\tilde
l}$ and a distinct third-generation slepton mass $m_{\tilde \tau}$, a common trilinear mixing
parameter $A$, the Higgs mixing parameter $\mu$, the pseudoscalar Higgs mass $M_A$ and $\tan\beta$.
In the fit including $(g-2)_{\mu}$, a Bino-like $\tilde\chi^0_1$ is preferred, whereas a Higgsino-like
$\tilde \chi^0_1$ is favoured when the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint is dropped. We identify the mechanisms
that operate in different regions of the pMSSM11 parameter space to bring the relic density of the
lightest neutralino, $\tilde\chi^0_1$, into the range indicated by cosmological data. In the
fit including $(g-2)_{\mu}$, coannihilations with $\tilde \chi^0_2$ and the Wino-like $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$
or with nearly-degenerate first- and second-generation sleptons are favoured, whereas coannihilations
with the $\tilde \chi^0_2$ and the Higgsino-like $\tilde\chi^{\pm}_1$ or with first- and second-generation
squarks may be important when the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ constraint is dropped. Prospects remain for discovering
strongly-interacting sparticles at the LHC as well as for discovering electroweakly-interacting
sparticles at a future linear $e^+ e^-$ collider such as the ILC or CLIC.
