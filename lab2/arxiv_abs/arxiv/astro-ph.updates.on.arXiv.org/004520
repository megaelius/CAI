The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is an important systematic effect in weak-lensing surveys,
which can affect the derived cosmological parameters. One direct way to distinguish different
alignment models and quantify their effects on the measurement is to produce mocked weak-lensing
surveys. In this work, we use full-sky ray-tracing technique to produce mock images of galaxies
from the ELUCID $N$-body simulation run with the WMAP9 cosmology. In our model we assume that the
shape of central elliptical galaxy follows that of the dark matter halo, and spiral galaxy follows
the halo spin. Using the mocked galaxy images, a combination of galaxy intrinsic shape and the gravitational
shear, we compare the predicted tomographic shear correlations to the results of KiDS and DLS. It
is found that our predictions stay between the KiDS and DLS results. We rule out a model in which the
satellite galaxies are radially aligned with the center galaxy, otherwise the shear-correlations
on small scales are too high. Most important, we find that although the intrinsic alignment of spiral
galaxies is very weak, they induce a positive correlation between the gravitational shear signal
and the intrinsic galaxy orientation (GI). This is because the spiral galaxy is tangentially aligned
with the nearby large-scale overdensity, contrary to the radial alignment of elliptical galaxy.
Our results explain the origin of detected positive GI term from the weak-lensing surveys. We conclude
that in future analysis, the GI model must include the dependence on galaxy types in more detail.
