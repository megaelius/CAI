Fallback in core-collapse supernovae plays a crucial role in determining the properties of the
compact remnants and of the ejecta composition. We perform three-dimensional simulations of mixing
and fallback for selected non-rotating supernova models to study how explosion energy and asymmetries
correlate with the remnant mass, remnant kick, and remnant spin. We find that the strongest kick
and spin is imparted by partial fallback in an asymmetric explosion. Black hole (BH) kicks of several
hundred $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and spin parameters of $\mathord{\sim}0.25$ can be
obtained in this scenario. If the initial explosion energy barely exceeds the envelope binding
energy, stronger fallback results, and the remnant kick and spin remain small. If the explosion
energy is high with respect to the envelope binding energy, there is little fallback with a small
effect on the remnant kick, but the spin-up by fallback can be substantial. For a non-rotating $12\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$
progenitor, we find that the neutron star (NS) is spun up to millisecond periods. The high specific
angular momentum of the fallback material can also lead to disk formation around black holes. Fallback
may thus be a pathway towards millisecond-magnetar or collapsar-type engines for hypernovae and
gamma-ray bursts that does not require rapid progenitor rotation. Within our small set of simulations,
none reproduced the peculiar layered fallback necessary to explain the metal-rich iron-poor composition
of many carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Models with different explosion energy and different
realisations of asymmetries may, however, be compatible with CEMP abundance patterns.
