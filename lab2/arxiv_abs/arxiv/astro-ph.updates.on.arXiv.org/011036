Several deep observations such as those carried out at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
have revealed prominent Low Surface Brightness (LSB) fine structures that change the apparent
morphology of galaxies. Previous photometry surveys have developed observational techniques
which exploit the diffuse light detected in the external regions of galaxies. In these studies the
outer perturbations have been identified and classified like tidal tails, stellar streams, and
shells. These structures are tracers of interacting and merging events and they keep a memory of
the mass assembly of galaxies. Cosmological numerical simulations are needed to estimate their
visibility time-scale (among other properties) in order to reconstruct the past merger history
of galaxies. In the present work, we analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation to build
a comprehensive interpretation of the properties of fine structures. We make a census of several
types of LSB fine structures by visual inspection of individual snapshots at various time. We reconstruct
the evolution of the number of fine structures detected around an early-type galaxy and we compare
with the merger history of the galaxy. We find that most of fine structures are associated with major
and intermediate mass merger events. Their survival time scale ranges between 0.7 and 4 Gyr. Shells
and streams remain visible for a longer time than tidal tails. These estimates of survival times
provide clues to interpret the shape and frequency of fine structures observed in deep images in
terms of mass assembly. We find that the detectability of stellar streams is the most sensitive to
the surface brightness limit. We see 2-3 times more streams with a surface brightness cut of 33 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ than with 29 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. The detection of shells display a strong dependence
on the projection angle.
