We have measured the CH G band (CH(G)) index for evolved stars in the globular cluster M3 based on the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic survey. It is found that there is a useful way to select
red giant branch (RGB) stars from the contamination of other evolved stars such as asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) and red horizontal branch (RHB) stars by using the CH(G) index versus (g-r) diagram
if the metallicity is known from the spectra. When this diagram is applied to field giant stars with
similar metallicity, we establish a calibration of CH(G)=1.625(g-r)-1.174(g-r)^2-0.934. This
method is confirmed by stars with [Fe/H]~2.3 where spectra of member stars in globular clusters
M15 and M92 are available in the SDSS database. We thus extend this kind of calibration to every individual
metallicity bin ranging from [Fe/H] ~ -3.0 to [Fe/H] ~ 0.0 by using field red giant stars with 0.4 <
(g-r) < 1.0. The metallicity-dependent calibrations give CH(G) =1.625(g-r)-1.174(g-r)^2+
0.060[Fe/H]-0.830 for -3.0 < [Fe/H] <-1.2 and CH(G)=0.953(g-r)-0.655(g-r)^2+0.060[Fe/H]-0.650
for -1.2 < [Fe/H] < 0.0. The calibrations are valid for the SDSS spectroscopic data set, and
they cannot be applied blindly to other data sets. With the two calibrations, a significant number
of the contaminating stars (AGB and RHB stars) were excluded and thus a clear sample of red giant stars
is obtained by selecting stars within 0.05 mag of the calibration. The sample is published online
and it is expected that this large and clean sample of RGB stars will provide new information on the
formation and evolution of the Galaxy.
