Complex turbulent motions of magnetized gas are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. The source
of this turbulence, however, is still poorly understood. Previous work suggests that compression
caused by supernova shockwaves, gravity, or cloud collisions, may drive the turbulence to some
extent. In this work, we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of contraction in turbulent, magnetized clouds from the warm neutral medium (WNM) of the ISM to the
formation of cold dense molecular clouds, including radiative heating and cooling. We study different
contraction rates and find that observed molecular cloud properties, such as the temperature,
density, Mach number, and magnetic field strength, and their respective scaling relations, are
best reproduced when the contraction rate equals the turbulent turnover rate. In contrast, if the
contraction rate is significantly larger (smaller) than the turnover rate, the compression drives
too much (too little) turbulence, producing unrealistic cloud properties. We find that the density
probability distribution function evolves from a double log-normal representing the two-phase
ISM, to a skewed, single log-normal in the dense, cold phase. For purely hydrodynamical simulations,
we find that the effective driving parameter of contracting cloud turbulence is natural to mildly
compressive (\mbox{$b\sim0.4$--$0.5$}), while for MHD turbulence, we find \mbox{$b\sim0.3$--$0.4$},
i.e., solenoidal to naturally mixed. Overall, the physical properties of the simulated clouds
that contract at a rate equal to the turbulent turnover rate, indicate that large-scale contraction
may explain the origin and evolution of turbulence in the ISM.
