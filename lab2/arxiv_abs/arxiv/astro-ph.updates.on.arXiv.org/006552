We obtained optical/near-IR rest-frame Magellan FIRE spectra (including Pa$\beta$ and Pa$\gamma$)
of 25 starburst galaxies at 0.5<z<0.9, with average star formation rates (SFR) x7 above the Main
Sequence (MS). We find that Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios saturate around a constant value corresponding
to $A_{\rm V}\sim$2-3 mag, while line to IR luminosity ratios suggest a large range of more extreme
obscurations and appear to be uncorrelated to the former. This behavior is not consistent with standard
attenuation laws derived for local and distant galaxies, while being remarkably consistent with
observations of starburst cores in which young stars and dust are homogeneously mixed. This model
implies $A_{\rm V}=$2-30 mag attenuation to the center of starburst cores, with a median of ~9 mag
(a factor of 4000). X-ray hardness ratios for 6 AGNs in our sample and column densities derived from
observed dust masses and radio sizes independently confirm this level of attenuation. In these
conditions observed optical/near-IR emission comes from surface regions, while inner starburst
cores are invisible. We thus attribute the high [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratios to widespread shocks from
accretion, turbulence and dynamic disturbances rather than to AGNs. The large range of optical
depths demonstrates that substantial diversity is present within the starburst population, possibly
connected to different merger phases or progenitor properties. The majority of our targets are,
in fact, morphologically classified as mergers. We argue that the extreme obscuration provides
in itself smoking gun evidence of their merger origin, and a powerful tool for identifying mergers
at even higher redshifts.
