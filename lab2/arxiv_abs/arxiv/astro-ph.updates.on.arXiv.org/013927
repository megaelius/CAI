We present a new catalog and results for the cluster system of the starburst galaxy NGC 4449 based
on multi-band imaging observations taken as part of the LEGUS and Halpha-LEGUS surveys. We improve
the spectral energy fitting method used to estimate cluster ages and find that the results, particularly
for older clusters, are in better agreement with those from spectroscopy. The inclusion of Halpha
measurements, the role of stochasticity for low mass clusters, the assumptions about reddening,
and the choices of SSP model and metallicity all have important impacts on the age-dating of clusters.
A comparison with ages derived from stellar color-magnitude diagrams for partially resolved clusters
shows reasonable agreement, but large scatter in some cases. The fraction of light found in clusters
relative to the total light (i.e., T_L) in the U, B, and V filters in 25 different ~kpc-size regions
throughout NGC 4449 correlates with both the specific Region Luminosity, R_L, and the dominant
age of the underlying stellar population in each region. The observed cluster age distribution
is found to decline over time as dN/dt ~ t^g, with g=-0.85+/-0.15, independent of cluster mass, and
is consistent with strong, early cluster disruption. The mass functions of the clusters can be described
by a power law with dN/dM ~ M^b and b=-1.86+/-0.2, independent of cluster age. The mass and age distributions
are quite resilient to differences in age-dating methods. There is tentative evidence for a factor
of 2-3 enhancement in both the star and cluster formation rate ~100 - 300 Myr ago, indicating that
cluster formation tracks star formation generally. The enhancement is probably associated with
an earlier interaction event.
