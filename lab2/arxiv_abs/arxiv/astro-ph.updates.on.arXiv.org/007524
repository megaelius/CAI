Most stars form in binaries and the evolution of their discs remains poorly understood. To shed light
on this subject, we carry out 3D ideal MHD simulations with the AMR code FLASH of binary star formation
for separations of $10-20\,\mathrm{AU}$. We run a simulation with no initial turbulence (NT),
and two with turbulent Mach numbers of $\mathcal{M} = \sigma_v/c_s = 0.1$ and $0.2$ (T1 and T2) for
$5000\,\mathrm{yr}$ after protostar formation. By the end of the simulations the circumbinary
discs in NT and T1, if any, have radii of $\lesssim20\,\mathrm{AU}$ with masses $\lesssim0.02\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
while T2 hosts a circumbinary disc with radius $\sim70-80\,\mathrm{AU}$ and mass $\sim0.12\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$.
These circumbinary discs formed from the disruption of circumstellar discs and harden the binary
orbit. Our simulated binaries launch large single outflows. We find that NT drives the most massive
outflows, and also removes large quantities of linear and angular momentum. T2 produces the least
efficient outflows concerning mass, momentum and angular momentum ($\sim$61 per cent, $\sim$71
per cent, $\sim$68 per cent of the respective quantities in NT). We conclude that while turbulence
helps to build circumbinary discs which organise magnetic fields for efficient outflow launching,
too much turbulence may also disrupt the ordered magnetic field structure required for magneto-centrifugal
launching of jets and outflows. We also see evidence for episodic accretion during the binary star
evolution. We conclude that the role of turbulence in building large circumbinary discs may explain
some observed very old ($>10\,\mathrm{Myr}$) circumbinary discs. The longer lifetime of circumbinary
discs may increase the likelihood of planet formation.
