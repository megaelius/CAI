The solar photon pressure provides a viable source of thrust for spacecraft in the solar system.
Theoretically it could also enable interstellar missions, but an extremely small mass per cross
section area is required to overcome the solar gravity. We identify aerographite, a synthetic carbon-based
foam with a density of 0.18 kg/m^3 (15,000 times more lightweight than aluminum) as a versatile material
for highly efficient propulsion with sunlight. A hollow aerographite sphere with a shell thickness
eps_shl = 1 mm could go interstellar upon submission to the solar radiation in interplanetary space.
Upon launch at 1 AU from the Sun, an aerographite shell with eps_shl = 0.5 mm arrives at the orbit of
Mars in 60 d and at Pluto's orbit in 4.3 yr. Release of an aerographite hollow sphere, whose shell is
1 micrometer thick, at 0.04 AU (the closest approach of the Parker Solar Probe) results in an escape
speed of nearly 6900 km/s and 185 yr of travel to the distance of our nearest star, Proxima Centauri.
The infrared signature of a meter-sized aerographite sail could be observed with JWST up to 2 AU from
the Sun, beyond the orbit of Mars. An aerographite hollow sphere with eps_shl = 100 micrometer and
a radius of 1 m (5 m) weighs 230 mg (5.7 g) and has a 2.2 g (55 g) mass margin for interstellar escape. The
payload margin is ten times the mass of the spacecraft, whereas the payload on chemical interstellar
rockets is typically a thousandth of the weight of the rocket. Simplistic communication would enable
studies of the interplanetary medium and a search for the suspected Planet Nine, and would serve
as a precursor mission to alpha Centauri. We estimate prototype developments costs of 1 million
USD, a price of 1000 USD per sail, and a total of <10 million USD including launch for a piggyback concept
with an interplanetary mission.
