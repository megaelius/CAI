We present results of the cross-correlation Lya intensity mapping with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) ultra-deep narrowband images and Lya emitters (LAEs) at $z=5.7$ and $6.6$ in a total area of
$4$ deg$^2$. Although overwhelming amount of data quality controls have been performed for the
narrowband images and the LAE samples, we further conduct extensive analysis evaluating systematics
of large-scale point spread function wings, sky subtractions, and unknown errors on the basis of
physically uncorrelated signals and sources found in real HSC images and object catalogs, respectively.
Removing the systematics, we carefully calculate cross-correlations between Lya intensity of
the narrowband images and the LAEs. We identify very diffuse Lya emission with the $3\sigma$ ($2\sigma$)
significance at $>150$ comoving kpc (ckpc) far from the LAEs at $z = 5.7$ ($6.6$), beyond a virial
radius of star-forming galaxies with $M_\mathrm{h} \sim 10^{11} M_\odot$. The diffuse Lya emission
possibly extends up to $1,000$ ckpc with the surface brightness of $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$
cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. We confirm that the small-scale ($<150$ ckpc) Lya radial profiles of
LAEs in our Lya intensity maps are consistent with those obtained by recent MUSE observations (Leclercq
et al. 2017). Comparisons with numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale ($\sim 150-1,000$
ckpc) Lya emission are not explained by unresolved faint sources of neighboring galaxies including
satellites, but by a combination of Lya photons emitted from the central LAE and other unknown sources,
such as a cold-gas stream and galactic outflow. We find no evolution in the Lya radial profiles of
our LAEs from $z=5.7$ to $6.6$, where theoretical models predict a flattening of the profile slope
made by cosmic reionization, albeit with our moderately large observational errors.
