Blazars represent the most abundant class of high-energy extragalactic $\gamma$-ray sources.
The subset of blazars known as BL Lac objects is on average closer to Earth and characterized by harder
spectra at high energy than the whole sample. The fraction of BL Lacs that is too dim to be detected
and resolved by current $\gamma$-ray telescopes is therefore expected to contribute to the high-energy
isotropic diffuse $\gamma$-ray background (IGRB). The IGRB has been recently measured over a wide
energy range by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Gamma-ray Space Telescope ({\it Fermi}).
We present a new prediction of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray flux due to the unresolved BL Lac blazar population.
The model is built upon the spectral energy distribution and the luminosity function derived from
the fraction of BL Lacs detected (and spectrally characterized) in the $\gamma$-ray energy range.
We focus our attention on the ${\cal O}(100)$ GeV energy range, predicting the emission up to the
TeV scale and taking into account the absorption on the extragalactic background light. In order
to better shape the BL Lac spectral energy distribution, we combine the {\it Fermi}-LAT data with
Imaging Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes measurements of the most energetic sources. Our analysis
is carried on separately for low- and intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs on one hand, and
high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs on the other one: we find in fact statistically different features
for the two. The diffuse emission from the sum of both BL Lac classes increases from about 10$\%$ of
the measured IGRB at 100 MeV to $\sim$100$\%$ of the data level at 100 GeV. At energies greater than
100 GeV, our predictions naturally explain the IGRB data, accommodating their softening with increasing
energy. Uncertainties are estimated to be within of a factor of two of the best-fit flux up to 500 GeV.
