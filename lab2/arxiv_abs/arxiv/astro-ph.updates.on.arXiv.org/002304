We study the dark nature of GRB 130528A through multi-wavelength observations and conclude that
the main reason for the optical darkness is local extinction inside of the host galaxy. Automatic
observations were performed at BOOTES-4/MET robotic telescope. We also triggered target of opportunity
(ToO) observation at the OSN, IRAM PdBI and the GTC+OSIRIS. The host galaxy photometric observations
in optical to near-infrared (nIR) wavelengths were achieved through large ground-based aperture
telescopes, such as the 10.4m GTC, the 4.2m WHT, 6m BTA, and the 2m LT. Based on these observations,
spectral energy distributions (SED) for the host galaxy and afterglow were constructed. Thanks
to mm observations at PdBI, we confirm the presence of a mm source within the XRT error circle that
faded over the course of our observations and identify the host galaxy. However, we do not find any
credible optical source within early observations with BOOTES-4/MET and 1.5m OSN telescopes.
Spectroscopic observation of this galaxy by GTC showed a single faint emission line that likely
corresponds to [OII] 3727\{AA} at a redshift of 1.250+/-0.001 implying a SFR(M_sun/yr) > 6.18
M_sun/yr without correcting for dust extinction. The probable extinction was revealed through
analysis of the afterglow SED, resulting in a value of AV >= ~ 0.9 at the rest frame, this is comparable
to extinction levels found among other dark GRBs. The SED of the host galaxy is explained well (chi2/d.o.f.=0.564)
by a luminous (MB=-21.16), low-extinction (AV =0, rest frame), and aged (2.6 Gyr) stellar population.
We can explain this apparent contradiction in global and line-of-sight extinction if the GRB birth
place happened to lie in a local dense environment. In light of having relatively small specific
SFR (SSFR) ~ 5.3 M_sun/yr (L/L_star)-1, this also could explain the age of the old stellar population
of host galaxy.
