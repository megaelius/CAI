We report here a method that can precisely localize a merging black hole. The current gravitational-wave
localization methods rely mainly on merging neutron stars or other sources with electromagnetic
counterparts. However, the scientific targets of merging black holes are entirely different and
they allow us to probe exciting properties such as higher-order modes, high redshifts, and the strong
field of gravity. Unfortunately, the lack of an electromagnetic counterpart and the poor sky localization
accuracies of the current gravitational-wave detectors make it generally difficult to localize
a merging black hole precisely. However, lensed gravitational waves, whose first observation
is predicted in this decade, could allow us to search for the source through locating its similarly
lensed host galaxy. Specifically, a dedicated follow-up of the sky localization of the lensed gravitational
wave could allow us to identify the lensed host galaxy, and to reconstruct its lens profile. Unfortunately,
uniquely identifying the correct host galaxy is challenging, because there are hundreds and sometimes
thousands of other lensed galaxies within the sky area spanned by the gravitational-wave observation.
However, by combining the gravitational-wave information with the lens reconstructions of all
the lensed galaxy candidates, we show that one can localize quadruply lensed waves to one or at most
a few galaxies with the LIGO/Virgo/Kagra network. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that once
the lensed host is identified, the gravitational-wave source can be localized within the host galaxy,
and the system can be used to measure the Hubble constant.
