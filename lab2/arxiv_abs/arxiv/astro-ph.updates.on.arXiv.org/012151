What is the expected infrared output of elliptical galaxies? Here we report the latest findings
obtained in this high time resolution (~10 years) and high spatial resolution (2.5 parsec at center)
study. We add a set of grain physics to the MACER code, including (a) dust grains made in passive stellar
evolution; (b) dust grain growth due to collision and sticking; (c) grain destruction due to thermal
sputtering; (d) dust cooling of hot gas via inelastic collisions; and (e) radiation pressure on
dust grains. The code improvements enable us to analyze the effects of dust on metal depletion and
AGN obscuration, and also to assess the infrared output of the modeled galaxies. We simulate a representative
massive elliptical galaxy of a central stellar velocity dispersion ~ 260 km/s and modest rotation.
We find that: (1) the circumnuclear disk (of a size <~ 1 kpc) is dusty in its outer region where most
of the metals are in dust grains, while in the inner disk most of the dust grains are destroyed by the
AGN irradiation; (2) the dusty disk is optically thick to both the starlight within the disk and the
radiation from the central AGN. Thus the AGN will be obscured behind the disk, and the latter is of
a covering factor ~ 0.2; (3) the dust infrared emission is mainly due to the AGN irradiation. The median
infrared luminosity is ~ 2e44 erg/s, and it can reach >~ 1e46 erg/s during outbursts; (4) the duty
cycles of the AGN activities, star formation, and the dust infrared luminosity roughly match observations,
e.g., in most of its lifetime, the simulated galaxy is a stereotypical "quiescent" elliptical galaxy
with L_{IR} ~ 1e11*L_{solar}, while the star formation rate can exceed 250 M_{solar}/yr during
central outbursts.
