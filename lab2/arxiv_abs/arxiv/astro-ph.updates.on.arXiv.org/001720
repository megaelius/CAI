The first gravitational-wave (GW) observations will greatly benefit, or even depend on, the detection
of coincident electromagnetic counterparts. These counterparts will similarly enhance the scientific
impact of later detections. Electromagnetic follow-ups can be, nevertheless, challenging for
GW event candidates with poorly reconstructed directions. Localization can be inefficient in
several important scenarios: (i) in the early advanced detector era, only the two LIGO observatories
will be operating; (ii) later, even with more observatories, the detectors' sensitivity will probably
be non-uniform; (iii) the first events, as well as a significant fraction of later events, will likely
occur near the detectors' horizon distance, where they are only marginally detectable, having
low signal-to-noise ratios. In these scenarios, the precision of localization can be severely
limited. Follow-up observations will need to cover hundreds to thousands of square degrees of the
sky over a limited period of time, reducing the list of suitable follow-up telescopes or telescope
networks. Compact binary mergers, the most anticipated sources for the first GW observations,
will be detectable via advanced LIGO/Virgo from hundreds of megaparsecs, setting the scale to the
sensitivity required from follow-up observatories. We demonstrate that the Cherenkov Telescope
Array will be capable of following up GW event candidates over the required large sky area with sufficient
sensitivity to detect short gamma-ray bursts, which are thought to originate from compact binary
mergers, out to the horizon distance of advanced LIGO/Virgo. CTA can therefore be invaluable starting
with the first multimessenger detections, even with poorly reconstructed GW source directions.
This scenario also provides a further scientific incentive for GW observatories to further decrease
the delay of their event reconstruction.
