We investigate the purely spatial Lagrangian coordinate transformation from the Lagrangian to
the basic Eulerian frame. We demonstrate three techniques for extracting the relativistic displacement
field from a given solution in the Lagrangian frame. These techniques are (a) from defining a local
set of Eulerian coordinates embedded into the Lagrangian frame; (b) from performing a specific
gauge transformation; and (c) from a fully non-perturbative approach based on the ADM split. The
latter approach shows that this decomposition is not tied to a specific perturbative formulation
for the solution of the Einstein equations. Rather, it can be defined at the level of the non-perturbative
coordinate change from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian description. Studying such different techniques
is useful because it allows us to compare and develop further the various approximation techniques
available in the Lagrangian formulation. We find that one has to solve the gravitational wave equation
in the relativistic analysis, otherwise the corresponding Newtonian limit will necessarily contain
spurious non-propagating tensor artefacts at second order in the Eulerian frame. We also derive
the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor in the Lagrangian frame, and find that it is not only excited by
gravitational waves but also by tensor perturbations which are induced through the non-linear
frame-dragging. We apply our findings to calculate for the first time the relativistic displacement
field, up to second order, for a $\Lambda$CDM Universe in the presence of a local primordial non-Gaussian
component. Finally, we also comment on recent claims about whether mass conservation in the Lagrangian
frame is violated.
