Quantitative characterization of galaxy morphology is vital in enabling comparison of observations
to predictions from galaxy formation theory. However, without significant overlap between the
observational footprints of deep and shallow galaxy surveys, the extent to which structural measurements
for large galaxy samples are robust to image quality (e.g., depth, spatial resolution) cannot be
established. Deep images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 co-adds provide a unique
solution to this problem - offering $1.6-1.8$ magnitudes improvement in depth with respect to SDSS
Legacy images. Having similar spatial resolution to Legacy, the co-adds make it possible to examine
the sensitivity of parametric morphologies to depth alone. Using the Gim2D surface-brightness
decomposition software, we provide public morphology catalogs for 16,908 galaxies in the Stripe
82 $ugriz$ co-adds. Our methods and selection are completely consistent with the Simard et al. (2011)
and Mendel et al. (2014) photometric decompositions. We rigorously compare measurements in the
deep and shallow images. We find no systematics in total magnitudes and sizes except for faint galaxies
in the $u$-band and the brightest galaxies in each band. However, characterization of bulge-to-total
fractions is significantly improved in the deep images. Furthermore, statistics used to determine
whether single-S\'ersic or two-component (e.g., bulge+disc) models are required become more
bimodal in the deep images. Lastly, we show that asymmetries are enhanced in the deep images and that
the enhancement is positively correlated with the asymmetries measured in Legacy images.
