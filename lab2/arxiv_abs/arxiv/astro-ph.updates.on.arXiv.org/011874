We find that the combined LF of N- and SC-type stars are consistent with a Gaussian distribution peaking
at M_bol~ -5.2 mag. The resulting LF however shows two tails at lower and higher luminosities more
extended than those previously found, indicating that AGB carbon stars with Solar metallicity
may reach M_bol~-6.0 mag. We find that J-type stars are about half a magnitude fainter on average
than N- and SC-type stars, while R-hot stars are half a magnitude brighter than previously found.
The Galactic spatial distribution and velocity components of the N-, SC- and J-type stars are very
similar, while about 30 % of the R-hot stars in the sample are located at distances larger than ~ 500
pc from the Galactic Plane, and show a significant drift with respect to the local standard of rest.
The LF derived for N- and SC-type in the Solar neighbourhood fully agrees with the expected luminosity
of stars of 1.5-3 M_o on the AGB. On a theoretical basis, the existence of an extended low luminosity
tail would require a contribution of extrinsic low mass carbon stars, while the high luminosity
one would imply that stars with mass up to ~5 Mo may become carbon star on the AGB. J-type stars not only
differ significantly in their chemical composition with respect to the N- and SC-types but also
in their LF, which reinforces the idea that these carbon stars belong to a dvifferent type whose origin
is still unknown. The derived luminosities of R-hot stars make these stars unlikely to be in the red-clump
as previously claimed. On the other hand, the derived spatial distribution and kinematic properties,
together with their metallicity, indicate that most of the N-, SC- and J-type stars belong to the
thin disc population, while a significant fraction of R-hot stars show characteristics compatible
with the thick disc.
