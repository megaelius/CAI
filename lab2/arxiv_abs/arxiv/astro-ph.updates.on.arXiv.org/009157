The gravitational-wave signal from the merger of two neutron stars cannot be easily differentiated
from the signal produced by a comparable-mass mixed binary of a neutron star and a black hole. Indeed,
both binary types can account for the gravitational-wave signal GW170817 even if its electromagnetic
counterpart emission is taken into account. The existence of low-mass black holes ($<5M_{\odot}$)
is astrophysically disfavored. However, such back holes could be of primordial origin or the outcome
of interactions between neutron stars and dark matter. We propose a method to identify mixed binaries
of neutron stars merging with low-mass black holes using gravitational-waves alone. This method
is based on the fact that certain neutron star properties that can be measured with gravitational-waves
are common or similar for all neutron stars. For example all neutron stars share the same equation
of state and if the latter is hadronic, neutron stars have similar radii. If a mixed binary is misidentified
as a neutron star binary, the inferred neutron star properties will be misestimated and appear as
outliers in a population of low-mass binaries. We show that as few as a handful of low-mass events
will allow for the identification of the type of one event at the $80\%$ confidence level. We model
the population of low-mass binaries with a hierarchical mixture model and show that we can constrain
the existence of mixed binaries or measure their abundance relative to neutron star binaries to
$\sim 0.1$ at the $68\%$ credible level with 100 events. This method requires neither information
from the post-inspiral phase of the binary, nor an EM counterpart.
