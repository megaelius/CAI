It arises a puzzle in \NGC\, how to secularly maintain the counter-rotating disc from $0.2$ to $7\,$pc
unambiguously detected by recent ALMA observations of molecular gas. Upon further analysis of
disc dynamics, we find that the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability (KHI) results in an unavoidable
catastrophe of the disc developed at the interface between the reversely rotating parts, and demonstrate
that a close binary of supermassive black holes provides tidal torques as the unique external sources
to prevent the disc from the KH catastrophe. We are led to the inescapable conclusion that there must
be a binary black hole at the center of NGC 1068, to prevent it from the KH catastrophe. The binary is
composed of black holes with a separation of $0.1\,$pc from GRAVITY/VLTI observations, a total
mass of $1.3\times 10^{7}\:M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of $\sim 0.3$ estimated from the angular
momentum budge of the global system. The KHI gives rise to forming a gap without cold gas at the velocity
interface which overlaps with the observed gap of hot and cold dust regions. Releases of kinematic
energies from the KHI of the disc are in agreement with observed emissions in radio and $\gamma$-rays.
Such a binary is shrinking with a timescale much longer than the local Hubble time via gravitational
waves, however, the KHI leads to an efficient annihilation of the orbital angular momentum and speed
up merge of the binary, providing a new paradigm of solving the long term issue of "final parsec problem".
Future observations of GRAVITY+/VLTI are expected to be able to spatially resolve the CB-SMBHs
suggested in this paper.
