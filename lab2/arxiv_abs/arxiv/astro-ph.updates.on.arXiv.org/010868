Many attempts have been made to provide catalogs of potential sources of ultra-high energy cosmic
ray (UHECR) particles based on various astronomical tracers, such as observed radio or gamma-ray
emission. A closer look reveals, however, that they all suffer from significant bias and selection
effects. We present here a demo-version of a catalog for one often-discussed UHECR source class,
radio galaxies (or radio-loud AGN), which is based on a complete theoretical description of jet-energetics,
particle acceleration physics, relativistic beaming effects and nuclear composition, parametrized
by a comprehensible set of adjustable physical quantities. In addition to the bright radio galaxies
Centaurus A, Virgo A, Fornax A and Cygnus A discussed in previous work, we find several sources with
blazar-like properties that can contribute on a similar level if relativistic beaming effects
are considered. We present a simple method to test the basic properties of the catalog for any choice
of parameters (without the need to run expensive simulations), and find that in the canonical case
the anisotropy signals expected from radio galaxies promise to be in good agreement with current
observational findings. In particular, radio galaxies can reproduce almost exactly the direction
of the dipole above 8 EeV detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory if we assume that extragalactic
magnetic fields are strong (>1nG) only in structures, but very weak in voids. We plan to provide a
completed and improved version of this catalog in electronic form, to be used in more detailed UHECR
propagation simulations. For immediate applications, we suggest a complete set of 16 strong UHECR
sources which can contribute to UHECR anisotropy on the level which can be currently probed by experiment,
and note that 6 of them have not been considered in any previous studies.
