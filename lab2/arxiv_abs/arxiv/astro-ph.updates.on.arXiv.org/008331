The population of giant planets on short-period orbits can potentially be explained by some flavours
of high-eccentricity migration. In this paper we investigate one such mechanism involving "secular
chaos", in which secular interactions between at least three giant planets push the inner planet
to a highly eccentric orbit, followed by tidal circularization and orbital decay. In addition to
the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to dynamical tides that are excited
inside the giant planet. Using the method of Gaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions,
we explore the conditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the properties
of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations show that once the inner planet
reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity, dynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy,
producing an eccentric warm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium
tides to become a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption, increasing
the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets survive the process. We find that the
final orbital periods generally lie in the range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed
hot Jupiter population. We couple the planet migration to the stellar spin evolution to predict
the final spin-orbit misalignments. The distribution of the misalignment angles we obtain shows
a lack of retrograde orbits compared to observations. Our results suggest that high-eccentricity
migration via secular chaos can only account for a fraction of the observed hot Jupiter population.
