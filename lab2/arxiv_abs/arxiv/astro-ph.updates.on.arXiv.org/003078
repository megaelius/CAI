The existence of two kinematically and chemically distinct stellar subpopulations in the Sculptor
and Fornax dwarf galaxies offers the opportunity to constrain the density profile of their matter
haloes by measuring the mass contained within the well-separated half-light radii of the two metallicity
subpopulations. Walker and Pe\~{n}arrubia have used this approach to argue that data for these
galaxies are consistent with constant-density `cores' in their inner regions and rule out `cuspy'
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles with high statistical significance, particularly in the
case of Sculptor. We test the validity of these claims using dwarf galaxies in the APOSTLE $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of analogues of the Local Group. These galaxies all have
NFW dark matter density profiles and a subset of them develop two distinct metallicity subpopulations
reminiscent of Sculptor and Fornax. We apply a method analogous to that of Walker and Penarrubia
to a sample of 53 simulated dwarfs and find that this procedure often leads to a statistically significant
detection of a core in the profile when in reality there is a cusp. Although multiple factors contribute
to these failures, the main cause is a violation of the assumption of spherical symmetry upon which
the mass estimators are based. The stellar populations of the simulated dwarfs tend to be significantly
elongated and, in several cases, the two metallicity populations have different asphericity and
are misaligned. As a result, a wide range of slopes of the density profile are inferred depending
on the angle from which the galaxy is viewed.
