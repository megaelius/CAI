We present ammonia maps of portions of the W3 and Perseus molecular clouds in order to compare gas
emission with submillimetre continuum thermal emission which are commonly used to trace the same
mass component in star-forming regions, often under the assumption of LTE. The Perseus and W3 star-forming
regions are found to have significantly different physical characteristics consistent with the
difference in size scales traced by our observations. Accounting for the distance of the W3 region
does not fully reconcile these differences, suggesting that there may be an underlying difference
in the structure of the two regions. Peak positions of submillimetre and ammonia emission do not
correlate strongly. Also, the extent of diffuse emission is only moderately matched between ammonia
and thermal emission. Source sizes measured from our observations are consistent between regions,
although there is a noticeable difference between the submillimetre source sizes with sources
in Perseus being significantly smaller than those in W3. Fractional abundances of ammonia are determined
for our sources which indicate a dip in the measured ammonia abundance at the positions of peak submillimetre
column density. Virial ratios are determined which show that our sources are generally bound in
both regions, although there is considerable scatter in both samples. We conclude that sources
in Perseus are bound on smaller scales than in W3 in a way that may reflect their previous identification
as low- and high-mass, respectively. Our results indicate that assumptions of local thermal equilibrium
and/or the coupling of the dust and gas phases in star-forming regions may not be as robust as commonly
assumed.
