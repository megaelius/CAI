Super star cluster A1 in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 3125 is characterized by broad He\ii \lam1640
emission (full width at half maximum, $FWHM\sim1200$ km s$^{-1}$) of unprecedented strength (equivalent
width, $EW=7.1\pm0.4$ \AA). Previous attempts to characterize the massive star content in NGC
3125-A1 were hampered by the low resolution of the UV spectrum and the lack of co-spatial panchromatic
data. We obtained far-UV to near-IR spectroscopy of the two principal emitting regions in the galaxy
with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)
onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (\hst). We use these data to study three clusters in the galaxy,
A1, B1, and B2. We derive cluster ages of 3-4 Myr, intrinsic reddenings of $E(B-V)=0.13$, 0.15, and
0.13, and cluster masses of $1.7\times10^5$, $1.4\times10^5$, and $1.1\times10^5$ M$_\odot$,
respectively. A1 and B2 show O\vb \lam1371 absorption from massive stars, which is rarely seen in
star-forming galaxies, and have Wolf-Rayet (WR) to O star ratios of $N(WN5-6)/N(O)=0.23$ and 0.10,
respectively. The high $N(WN5-6)/N(O)$ ratio of A1 cannot be reproduced by models that use a normal
IMF and generic WR star line luminosities. We rule out that the extraordinary He\ii \lam1640 emission
and O\vb \lam1371 absorption of A1 are due to an extremely flat upper IMF exponent, and suggest that
they originate in the winds of very massive ($>120\,M_\odot$) stars. In order to reproduce the
properties of peculiar clusters such as A1, the present grid of stellar evolution tracks implemented
in Starburst99 needs to be extended to masses $>120\,M_\odot$.
