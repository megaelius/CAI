We perform theoretical and numerical studies of the full relativistic two-point galaxy correlation
function, considering the linear-order scalar and tensor perturbation contributions and the
wide-angle effects. Using the gauge-invariant relativistic description of galaxy clustering
and accounting for the contributions at the observer position, we demonstrate that the complete
theoretical expression is devoid of any long-mode contributions from scalar or tensor perturbations
and it lacks the infrared divergences in agreement with the equivalence principle. By showing that
the gravitational potential contribution to the correlation function converges in the infrared,
our study justifies an IR cut-off $(k_{\text{IR}} \leq H_0)$ in computing the gravitational potential
contribution. Using the full gauge-invariant expression, we numerically compute the galaxy two-point
correlation function and study the individual contributions in the conformal Newtonian gauge.
We find that the terms at the observer position such as the coordinate lapses and the observer velocity
(missing in the standard formalism) dominate over the other relativistic contributions in the
conformal Newtonian gauge such as the source velocity, the gravitational potential, the integrated
Sachs-Wolf effect, the Shapiro time-delay and the lensing convergence. Compared to the standard
Newtonian theoretical predictions that consider only the density fluctuation and redshift-space
distortions, the relativistic effects in galaxy clustering result in a few percent-level systematic
errors beyond the scale of the baryonic acoustic oscillation. Our theoretical and numerical study
provides a comprehensive understanding of the relativistic effects in the galaxy two-point correlation
function, as it proves the validity of the theoretical prediction and accounts for effects that
are often neglected in its numerical evaluation.
