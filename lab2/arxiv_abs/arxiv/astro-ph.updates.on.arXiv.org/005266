Strong gravitational lenses provide source/lens distance ratios D_obs useful in cosmological
tests. Previously, a catalog of 69 such systems was used in a one-on-one comparison between the standard
model, LCDM, and the R_h=ct universe, which has thus far been favored by the application of model
selection tools to many other kinds of data. But in that work, the use of model parametric fits to the
observations could not easily distinguish between these two cosmologies, in part due to the limited
measurement precision. Here, we instead use recently developed methods based on Gaussian Processes
(GP), in which D_obs may be reconstructed directly from the data without assuming any parametric
form. This approach not only smooths out the reconstructed function representing the data, but
also reduces the size of the 1-sigma confidence regions, thereby providing greater power to discern
between different models. With the current sample size, we show that analyzing strong lenses with
a GP approach can definitely improve the model comparisons, producing probability differences
in the range ~10-30%. These results are still marginal, however, given the relatively small sample.
Nonetheless, we conclude that the probability of R_h=ct being the correct cosmology is somewhat
higher than that of LCDM, with a degree of significance that grows with the number of sources in the
subsamples we consider. Future surveys will significantly grow the catalog of strong lenses and
will therefore benefit considerably from the GP method we describe here. In addition, we point out
that if the R_h=ct universe is eventually shown to be the correct cosmology, the lack of free parameters
in the study of strong lenses should provide a remarkably powerful tool for uncovering the mass structure
in lensing galaxies.
