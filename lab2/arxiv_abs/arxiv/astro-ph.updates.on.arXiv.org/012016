The Axion Like Particle (ALP) is a hypothetical pseudo-scalar particle beyond the Standard Model,
with a compelling possible connection to dark matter and early universe physics. ALPs can be converted
into photons via interactions with magnetic fields in the universe, i.e., the so-called inverse
Primakoff effect. In this paper, we propose a novel method to explore ALP-induced photons from X-ray
data obtained from the {\it Suzaku} satellite, arising from a possible interaction of ALPs with
the direction-dependent Earth's magnetic field viewed from the satellite. {\it Suzaku} data is
suitable for this purpose because its low-altitude Earth orbit result in intrinsically low cosmic-ray
background radiation. We study whether the X-ray diffuse background (XDB) spectra estimated from
the four deep fields collected over eight years, vary with the integrated Earth's magnetic strength
in the direction of each target field at each observation epoch, which amounts to $10^2$ Tm-a value
greater than that achieved by terrestrial experiments due to the large coherent length. From the
detailed analysis, we did not find evidence of the XDB confidence level spectra having dependence
on the Earth's magnetic strength. We obtained 99 % confidence level upper limit on a possible residual
contribution to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) surface brightness to be $1.6\times 10^{-9}~{\rm
ergs~s}^{-1}{\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm sr}^{-1}$ normalized at $10^4$ T${}^2$ m${}^2$ in the 2-6 keV range,
which corresponds to 6-15 % of the observed CXB brightness, depending on which model of unresolved
point sources are used in the interpretation. It is consistent with 80-90 % of the CXB now being resolved
into point sources.
