The measurement of the Sun's diameter has been first tackled by the Greek astronomers from a geometric
point of view. Their estimation of ~1800", although incorrect, was not truly called into question
for several centuries. The first pioneer works for measuring the Sun's diameter with an astrometric
precision were made around the year 1660 by Gabriel Mouton, then by Picard and La Hire. A canonical
value of the solar radius of 959".63 was adopted by Auwers in 1891. Despite considerable efforts
during the second half of the XXth century, involving dedicated space instruments, no consensus
was reached on this issue. However, with the advent of high sensitivity instruments on board satellites,
such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), it was
possible to extract with an unprecedented accuracy the surface gravity oscillation f modes, over
nearly two solar cycles, from 1996 to 2017. Their analysis in the range of angular degree l=140-300
shows that the so-called "seismic radius" exhibits a temporal variability in anti-phase with the
solar activity. Even if the link between the two radii (photospheric and seismic) can be made only
through modeling, such measurements provide an interesting alternative which led to a revision
of the standard solar radius by the International Astronomical Union in 2015. This new look on such
modern measurements of the Sun's global changes from 1996 to 2017 gives a new way for peering into
the solar interior, mainly to better understand the subsurface fields which play an important role
in the implementation of the solar cycles.
