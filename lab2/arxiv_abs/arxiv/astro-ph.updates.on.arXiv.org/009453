Present day solar imaging spectrometers typically yield a few hundred million spectra in one hour
of observing time. This number will increase by an order of magnitude for future instruments with
larger 4k x 4k sensors as planned to be used for the upcoming DKIST solar telescope. A fast quantitative
analysis of such huge data volumes can be done by comparing the observations to an archive of pre-calculated
synthetic spectra to infer the thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. To analyze intensity
spectra of the Ca II IR line at 854 nm in the solar atmosphere, we generated an archive with 2,000,000
spectra under the assumption of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) with the NICOLE code
(Socas-Navarro et al, 2015). We tested its performance by inverting 60 spectral scans of Ca II IR
at 854 nm in the magnetically quiet Sun with 700,000 profiles each. Based on the inversion results
obtained using the full archive, we construct a smaller archive by keeping only the about 70,000
archive profiles that were actually used. We can reproduce the observed intensity spectra to within
a few percent using either the full or the small archive. For spectra with 30 wavelength points, this
NLTE inversion approach takes 0.02 (0.35) s per profile to obtain a temperature stratification
when using the small (full) archive, i.e., it can invert a single spectral scan in about 4 (68) hrs.
The code is able to simultaneously deal with an arbitrary number of spectral lines. This makes it
a promising tool for deriving thermodynamic properties of the solar atmosphere from current or
future solar high-resolution observations of photospheric and chromospheric lines.
