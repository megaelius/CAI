We have been developing a monolithic active pixel sensor, ``XRPIX``, for the Japan led future X-ray
astronomy mission ``FORCE`` observing the X-ray sky in the energy band of 1-80 keV with angular resolution
of better than 15``. XRPIX is an upper part of a stack of two sensors of an imager system onboard FORCE,
and covers the X-ray energy band lower than 20 keV. The XRPIX device consists of a fully depleted high-resistivity
silicon sensor layer for X-ray detection, a low resistivity silicon layer for CMOS readout circuit,
and a buried oxide layer in between, which is fabricated with 0.2 $\mu$ m CMOS silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) technology. Each pixel has a trigger circuit with which we can achieve a 10 $\mu$ s time resolution,
a few orders of magnitude higher than that with X-ray astronomy CCDs. We recently introduced a new
type of a device structure, a pinned depleted diode (PDD), in the XRPIX device, and succeeded in improving
the spectral performance, especially in a readout mode using the trigger function. In this paper,
we apply a mesh experiment to the XRPIX devices for the first time in order to study the spectral response
of the PDD device at the subpixel resolution. We confirmed that the PDD structure solves the significant
degradation of the charge collection efficiency at the pixel boundaries and in the region under
the pixel circuits, which is found in the single SOI structure, the conventional type of the device
structure. On the other hand, the spectral line profiles are skewed with low energy tails and the
line peaks slightly shift near the pixel boundaries, which contribute to a degradation of the energy
resolution.
