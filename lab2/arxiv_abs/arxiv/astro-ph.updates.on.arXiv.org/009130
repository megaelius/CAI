Context. Towards the multimessenger era, the scientific demand for simultaneous observations
with different facilities is continuously increasing. The main challenges of coordinating observations
is the determination of common visibility and respective scheduling constraints to find common
free slots. While all this information is publicly available via the respective observatory web
pages, it is cumbersome to find this information from a large diversity of web interfaces and web
tables. Aims. Coordinated observations have been planned already, but their number will continue
to increase, and the larger complexity requires much better use of automatic routines. Methods.
Automatic tools are not able to obtain visibility and planning information from web interfaces.
Standard interfaces between observatories need to be developed to use automatic tools. We present
two Virtual Observatory (VO) protocols ObjVisSAP and ObsLocTAP that work with a URL-based query
approach with standardized query parameters and standardized output. Clients can pull the required
information directly from the respective observatories and compute overlapping, unplanned,
visibility intervals. Many other use cases are possible. Results. A prototype service has been
implemented by the INTEGRAL mission and a very simple client script queries visibility intervals
for given coordinates within the next 30 days. An observer can quickly see whether a source is observable
within the near future. Other missions are on their way to implement the services. Conclusions.
Once the major observatories have implemented the services and powerful tools are available that
rely on getting visibility and planning observations via these protocols, we expect many other,
also ground-based, observatories to follow. We are developing documentation to support observatories
with the implementation.
