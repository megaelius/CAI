A large set of stars observed by CoRoT and Kepler shows clear evidence for the presence of a stellar
background, which is interpreted to arise from surface convection, i.e., granulation. These observations
show that the characteristic time-scale (tau_eff) and the root-mean-square (rms) brightness
fluctuations (sigma) associated with the granulation scale as a function of the peak frequency
(nu_max) of the solar-like oscillations. We aim at providing a theoretical background to the observed
scaling relations based on a model developed in the companion paper. We computed for each 3D model
the theoretical power density spectrum (PDS) associated with the granulation as seen in disk-integrated
intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. For each PDS we derived tau_eff and sigma and compared
these theoretical values with the theoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical
model and the Kepler measurements. We derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,
which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. In addition, we show
that these quantities also scale as a function of the turbulent Mach number (Ma) estimated at the
photosphere. The theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well
on a global scale. Our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observed variations
of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. It also highlights the important role of Ma in controlling the
properties of the stellar granulation. However, the observations made with Kepler on a wide variety
of stars cannot confirm the dependence of our scaling relations on Ma. Measurements of the granulation
background and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statistically sufficient number of
cool dwarf stars will be required for confirming the dependence of the theoretical scaling relations
with Ma.
