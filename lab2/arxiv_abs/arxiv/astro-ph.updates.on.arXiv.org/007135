Strong gravitational lensing offers a wealth of astrophysical information on the background source
it affects, provided the lensed source can be reconstructed as if it was seen in the absence of lensing.
In the present work, we illustrate how sparse optimisation can address the problem. As a first step
towards a full free-form lens modelling technique, we consider linear inversion of the lensed source
under sparse regularisation and joint deblending from the lens light profile. The method is based
on morphological component analysis, assuming a known mass model. We show with numerical experiments
that representing the lens and source light using an undecimated wavelet basis allows us to reconstruct
the source and to separate it from the foreground lens at the same time. Both the source and lens light
have a non-analytic form, allowing for the flexibility needed in the inversion to represent arbitrarily
small and complex luminous structures in the lens and source. in addition, sparse regularisation
avoids over-fitting the data and does not require the use of any adaptive mesh or pixel grid. As a consequence,
our reconstructed sources can be represented on a grid of very small pixels. Sparse regularisation
in the wavelet domain also allows for automated computation of the regularisation parameter, thus
minimising the impact of arbitrary choice of initial parameters. Our inversion technique for a
fixed mass distribution can be incorporated in future lens modelling technique iterating over
the lens mass parameters. The python package corresponding to the algorithms described in this
article can be downloaded via the github platform at https://github.com/herjy/SLIT.
