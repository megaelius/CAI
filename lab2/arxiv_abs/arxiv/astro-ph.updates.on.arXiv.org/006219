The Streaming Instability (SI) is a mechanism to concentrate solids in protoplanetary disks. Nonlinear
particle clumping from the SI can trigger gravitational collapse into planetesimals. To better
understand the numerical robustness of the SI, we perform a suite of vertically-stratified 3D simulations
with fixed physical parameters known to produce strong clumping. We vary the numerical implementation,
namely the computational domain size and the vertical boundary conditions (vBCs), comparing newly-implemented
outflow vBCs to the previously-used periodic and reflecting vBCs. We find strong particle clumping
by the SI is mostly independent of the vBCs. However, peak particle densities are higher in larger
simulation domains due to a larger particle mass reservoir. We report SI-triggered zonal flows,
i.e., azimuthally-banded radial variations of gas pressure. These structures have low amplitudes,
insufficient to halt particle radial drift, confirming that particle trapping in gas pressure
maxima is not the mechanism of the SI. We find that outflow vBCs produce artificially large gas outflow
rates at vertical boundaries. However, the outflow vBCs reduce artificial reflections at vertical
boundaries, allowing more particle sedimentation, and showing less temporal variation and better
convergence with box size. The radial spacing of dense particle filaments is $\sim0.15$ gas scale
heights ($H$) for all vBCs, which sets the feeding zone for planetesimal growth in self-gravitating
simulations. Our results validate the use of the outflow vBCs in SI simulations, even with vertical
boundaries close ($\leq 0.4H$) to the disk midplane. Overall, our study demonstrates the numerical
robustness of nonlinear particle clumping by the SI.
