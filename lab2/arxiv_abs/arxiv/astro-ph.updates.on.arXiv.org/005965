A key uncertainty in interpreting observations of bimodal merging galaxy clusters is the unknown
angle between the subcluster separation vector and the plane of the sky. We present a new method for
constraining this key parameter. We find analogs of observed systems in cosmological n-body simulations
and quantify their likelihood of matching the observed projected separation and relative radial
velocities between subclusters, as a function of viewing angle. We derive constraints on the viewing
angle of many observed bimodal mergers including the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-558) and El Gordo (ACT-CL
J0102-4915). We also present more generic constraints as a function of projected separation and
relative radial velocity, which can be used to assess additional clusters as information about
them becomes available. The constraints from these two observables alone are weak (typically $\gtrsim
70-75^\circ$ at 68\% confidence and $\gtrsim 55-60^\circ$ at 95\% confidence) but incorporate
much more cosmological context than the classical timing argument, marginalizing over many realizations
of substructure, peculiar velocities, and so on. Compared to the MCMAC code, which implements the
timing argument on NFW halos, our constraints generally predict subcluster separation vectors
closer to the plane of the sky. This is because in realistic mergers the subcluster velocity vectors
are not entirely parallel to the separation vector (i.e, the mergers are not perfectly head-on).
As a result, observation of a nonzero relative radial velocity does not exclude a separation vector
in the plane of the sky, as it does in the head-on timing argument employed by MCMAC.
