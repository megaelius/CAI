We aim to ascertain the physical parameters of a propagating wave over the solar disk detected by
the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Using imaging data from the IRIS and the Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO), we tracked bright spots to determine the parameters of a propagating
transverse wave in active region (AR) loops triggered by activation of a filament. Deriving the
Doppler velocity of Si IV line from spectral observations of IRIS, we have determined the rotating
directions of active region loops which are relevant to the wave. On 2015 December 19, a filament
was located on the polarity inversion line of the NOAA AR 12470. The filament was activated and then
caused a C 1.1 two-ribbon flare. Between the flare ribbons, two rotation motions of a set of bright
loops were observed to appear in turn with opposite directions. Following the end of the second rotation,
a propagating wave and an associated transverse oscillation were detected in these bright loops.
In 1400 A channel, there was bright material flowing along the loops in a wave-like manner, with a
period of ~128 s and a mean amplitude of ~880 km. For the transverse oscillation, we tracked a given
loop and determine the transverse positions of the tracking loop in a limited longitudinal range.
In both of 1400 A and 171 A channels, approximately four periods are distinguished during the transverse
oscillation. The mean period of the oscillation is estimated as ~143 s and the displacement amplitude
as between ~1370 km and ~690 km. We interpret these oscillations as a propagating kink wave and obtain
its speed of ~1400 km s-1. Our observations reveal that a flare associated with filament activation
could trigger a kink propagating wave in active region loops over the solar disk.
