Galaxies which hosted many core-collapse supernovae (SN) explosions can be used to study the conditions
necessary for the formation of massive stars. NGC 2770 was dubbed a SN factory, because it hosted
four core-collapse SNe in 20 years (three type Ib and one type IIn). Its star formation rate (SFR)
was reported not to be enhanced and therefore not compatible with such a high SN rate. We aim at explaining
the high SN rate of NGC 2770. We used archival HI line data for NGC 2770 and reinterpret the Halpha and
optical continuum data. Even though the continuum-based SFR indicators do not yield high values,
the dust-corrected Halpha luminosity implies a high SFR, consistent with the high SN rate. Such
disparity between the SFR estimators is an indication of recently enhanced star formation activity,
because the continuum indicators trace long timescale of the order of 100 Myr, unlike the line indicators,
which trace timescales of the order of 10 Myr. Hence, the unique feature of NGC 2770 compared to other
galaxies is the fact that it is observed very recently after the enhancement of the SFR. It also has
high dust extinction, E(B-V) above 1 mag. We provide support for the hypothesis that the increased
SFR in NGC 2770 is due to the interaction with its companion galaxies. We report an HI bridge between
NGC 2770 and its closest companion and the existence of a total of four companions within 100 kpc (one
identified for the first time). There are no clear HI concentrations close to the positions of SNe
in NGC 2770 such as those detected for hosts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined SNe type Ic
(IcBL). This suggests that the progenitors of type Ib SNe are not born out of recently accreted atomic
gas, as was suggested for GRB and IcBL SN progenitors.
