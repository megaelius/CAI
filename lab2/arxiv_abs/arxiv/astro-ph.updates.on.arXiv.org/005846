It is expected that a pressure bump can be formed at the inner edge of a dead-zone, and where vortices
can develop through the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). It has been suggested that self-gravity
can significantly affect the evolution of such vortices. We present the results of 2D hydrodynamical
simulations of the evolution of vortices forming at a pressure bump in self-gravitating discs with
Toomre parameter in the range $4-30$. We consider isothermal plus non-isothermal disc models that
employ either the classical $\beta$ prescription or a more realistic treatment for cooling. The
main aim is to investigate whether the condensating effect of self-gravity can stabilize vortices
in sufficiently massive discs. We confirm that in isothermal disc models with ${\cal Q} \gtrsim
15$, vortex decay occurs due to the vortex self-gravitational torque. For discs with $3\lesssim
{\cal Q} \lesssim 7$, the vortex develops gravitational instabilities within its core and undergoes
gravitational collapse, whereas more massive discs give rise to the formation of global eccentric
modes. In non-isothermal discs with $\beta$ cooling, the vortex maintains a turbulent core prior
to undergoing gravitational collapse for $\beta \lesssim 0.1$, whereas it decays if $\beta \ge
1$. In models that incorpore both self-gravity and a better treatment for cooling, however, a stable
vortex is formed with aspect ratio $\chi \sim 3-4$. Our results indicate that self-gravity significantly
impacts the evolution of vortices forming in protoplanetary discs, although the thermodynamical
structure of the vortex is equally important for determining its long-term dynamics.
