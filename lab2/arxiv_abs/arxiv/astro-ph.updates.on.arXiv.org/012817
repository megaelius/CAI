Turbulence in the protoplanetary disks induces collisions between dust grains, and thus facilitates
grain growth. We investigate the two fundamental assumptions of the turbulence in obtaining grain
collisional velocities -- the kinetic energy spectrum and the turbulence autocorrelation time
-- in the context of the turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We carry
out numerical simulations of the MRI as well as driven turbulence, for a range of physical and numerical
parameters. We find that the convergence of the turbulence $\alpha$-parameter does not necessarily
imply the convergence of the energy spectrum. The MRI turbulence is largely solenoidal, for which
we observe a persistent kinetic energy spectrum of $k^{-4/3}$. The same is obtained for solenoidal
driven turbulence with and without magnetic field, over more than 1 dex near the dissipation scale.
This power-law slope appears to be converged in terms of numerical resolution, and to be due to the
bottleneck effect. The kinetic energy in the MRI turbulence peaks at the fastest growing mode of
the MRI. In contrast, the magnetic energy peaks at the dissipation scale. The magnetic energy spectrum
in the MRI turbulence does not show a clear power-law range, and is almost constant over approximately
1 dex near the dissipation scale. The turbulence autocorrelation time is nearly constant at large
scales, limited by the shearing timescale, and shows a power-law drop close to $k^{-1}$ at small
scales, with a slope steeper than that of the eddy crossing time. The deviation from the standard
picture of the Kolmogorov turbulence with the injection scale at the disk scale height can potentially
have a significant impact on the grain collisional velocities.
