The Ultraviolet Luminosity Function (UVLF) is a key observable for understanding galaxy formation
from cosmic dawn. There has been considerable debate on whether Schechter-like LFs (characterized
by an exponential drop-off at the bright end) that well describe the LF in our local Universe are also
a sufficient description of the LF at high redshifts ($z>6$). We model the UVLF over cosmic history
with a semi-empirical framework and include a log-normal scatter, $\Sigma$, in galaxy luminosities
with a conditional luminosity function approach. We show that stochasticity induces a flattening
or a feedback scale in the median galaxy luminosity versus halo mass relation, $L_{c}(M_{h})$ to
account for the increase of bright objects placed in lower mass halos. We observe a natural broadening
in the bright-end exponential segment of the UVLF for $z>6$ if processes that regulate star-formation
acts on the same mass scale as at $z\sim5$, where the degree of broadening is enhanced for larger $\Sigma$.
Alternatively, if the bright-end feedback is triggered at a near-constant luminosity threshold,
the feedback threshold occurs at progressively lower halo masses with increasing redshift, due
to galaxies being more luminous on average at a fixed halo mass from rapid halo assembly. Such feedback
results in a LF shape with a bright-end closer to that of a Schechter function. We include predictions
for the $z>8$ UVLFs from future all-sky surveys such as WFIRST which has the potential to both quantify
the scatter and type of feedback, and provide insight behind the mechanisms that drive star formation
in the early Universe.
