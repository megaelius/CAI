We propose a new approach to Bayesian prior probability distributions (priors) that can improve
orbital solutions for low-phase-coverage orbits, where data cover less than approximately 40%
of an orbit. In instances of low phase coverage such as with stellar orbits in the Galactic center
or with directly-imaged exoplanets, data have low constraining power and thus priors can bias parameter
estimates and produce under-estimated confidence intervals. Uniform priors, which are commonly
assumed in orbit fitting, are notorious for this. We propose a new observable-based prior paradigm
that is based on uniformity in observables. We compare performance of this observable-based prior
and of commonly assumed uniform priors using Galactic center and directly-imaged exoplanet (HR
8799) data. The observable-based prior can reduce biases in model parameters by a factor of two and
helps avoid under-estimation of confidence intervals for simulations with less than about 40%
phase coverage. Above this threshold, orbital solutions for objects with sufficient phase coverage
such as S0-2, a short-period star at the Galactic center with full phase coverage, are consistent
with previously published results. Below this threshold, the observable-based prior limits prior
influence in regions of prior dominance and increases data influence. Using the observable-based
prior, HR 8799 orbital analyses favor lower eccentricity orbits and provide stronger evidence
that the four planets have a consistent inclination around 30 degrees to within 1-sigma. This analysis
also allows for the possibility of coplanarity. We present metrics to quantify improvements in
orbital estimates with different priors so that observable-based prior frameworks can be tested
and implemented for other low-phase-coverage orbits.
