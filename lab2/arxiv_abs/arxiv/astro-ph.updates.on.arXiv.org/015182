Total solar irradiance (TSI) has been monitored from space since 1978. The measurements show a prominent
variability in phase with the solar cycle, as well as fluctuations on timescales shorter than a few
days. However, the measurements were done by multiple and usually relatively short-lived missions
making the possible long-term trend in the TSI highly uncertain. While the variability in the UV
irradiance is clearly in-phase with the solar cycle, the phase of the variability in the visible
range has been debated. In this paper, we aim at getting an insight into the long-term trend of TSI
since 1996 and the phase of the solar irradiance variations in the visible part of the spectrum. We
use independent ground-based full-disc photometric observations in Ca~II~K and continuum from
the Rome and San Fernando observatories to compute the TSI since 1996. We follow the empirical San
Fernando approach based on the photometric sum index. We find a weak declining trend in the TSI of
-7.8$^{+4.9}_{-0.8}\times10^{-3}$ Wm$^{-2}$y$^{-1}$ between the 1996 and 2008 activity minima,
while between 2008 and 2019 the reconstructed TSI shows no trend to a marginally decreasing (but
statistically insignificant) trend of -0.1$^{+0.25}_{-0.02}\times10^{-3}$ Wm$^{-2}$y$^{-1}$.
The reference TSI series used for the reconstruction does not significantly affect the determined
trend. The variation in the blue continuum (409.2 nm) is rather flat, while the variation in the red
continuum (607.1 nm) is marginally in anti-phase, although this result is extremely sensitive
to the accurate assessment of the quiet Sun level in the images. These results provide further insights
into the long-term variation of the total solar irradiance. The amplitude of the variations in the
visible is below the uncertainties of the processing, which prevents an assessment of the phase
of the variations.
