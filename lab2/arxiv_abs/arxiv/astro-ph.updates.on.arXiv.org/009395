The formation process of Population III (PopIII) stars in the mass accretion phase is investigated
by numerical experiments. The barotropic relation of primordial gas and artificial stiffening
of the equation of state in very dense regions ($> 10^{15}~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) enables us to follow the
fragmentation of PopIII circumstellar disks and the merging processes of the fragments. The disk
becomes gravitationally unstable to fragmentation , followed by a rapid merger process typically
within 100 yrs, which roughly corresponds to one orbital time of the circumstellar disk. We also
find that the fragmentation of the gas disk around a multiple system, a circumbinary disk, is rare;
however, it is frequent in the disk around an individual protostar. We also perform a simulation
with standard sink particles, where the number and total mass of sink particles are in rough agreement
with those of the stiff equation of state runs. Based on the results of these numerical results, we
model the evolution of the number of fragments with a simple phenomenological equation. We find
that the average number of fragments is roughly proportional to $t^{0.3}$, where $t$ is the elapsed
time since the formation of the first protostar. Next, we compare this trend with a number of published
numerical studies by scaling the elapsed time according to the scale-free nature of the system.
As a result, we find most of the results in the literature agree well with the relation. Present results
combined with the previous studies in the literature imply that the PopIII stars tend to be born not
as single stars, but in multiple systems.
