We analyze the observations from Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-A\&B/COR-1
of an eruptive prominence in the intermediate corona on 7 June 2011 at 08:45 UT, which consists of
magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor (MRT) unstable plasma segments. Its upper northward segment shows spatio-temporal
evolution of MRT instability in form of finger structures upto the outer corona and low inter-planetary
space. Using method of Dolei et al.(2014), It is estimated that the density in each bright finger
is greater than corresponding dark region lying below of it in the surrounding intermediate corona.
The instability is evolved due to wave perturbations that are parallel to the magnetic field at the
density interface. We conjecture that the prominence plasma is supported by tension component
of the magnetic field against gravity. Using linear stability theory, magnetic field is estimated
as 21-40 mG to suppress growth of MRT in the observed finger structures. In the southward plasma segment,
a horn-like structure is observed at 11:55 UT in the intermediate corona that also indicates MRT
instability. Falling blobs are also observed in both the plasma segments. In the outer corona upto
6-13 solar radii, the mushroom-like plasma structures have been identified in the upper northward
MRT unstable plasma segment using STEREO-A/COR-2. These structures most likely grew due to the
breaking and twisting of fingers at large spatial scales in weaker magnetic fields. In the lower
inter-planetary space upto 20 solar radii, these structures are fragmented into various small-scale
localized plasma spikes most likely due to turbulent mixing.
