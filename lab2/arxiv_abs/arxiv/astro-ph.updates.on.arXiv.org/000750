The cosmological simulations indicates that the dark matter haloes have specific self similar
properties. However the halo similarity is affected by the baryonic feedback, the momentum injected
by the supernovae re-shape the dark matter core and transform it to a flat density core, with a scale
length imposed by the baryonic feedback. Additionally the baryon feedback impose also an equilibrium
condition, which when coupled with the imposed baryonic scale length induce a new type of similarity.
The new self similar solution implies that the acceleration generated by dark matter is scale free,
which in turns implies that the baryonic acceleration at a reference radius is also scale free. Constant
dark matter and baryonic accelerations at a reference radius have effectively been observed for
a large class of different galaxies, which is in support of this approach. The new self similar properties
implies that the total acceleration at larger distances is scale free, the transition between the
dark matter and baryons dominated regime occurs at a constant acceleration, and the maximum of the
velocity curve which defines the amplitude of the velocity curve at larger distances is proportional
to $M^{\frac{1}{4}}$. These results demonstrates that in this self similar model, cold dark matter
is consistent with the basics of MOND phenomenology for the galaxies. In agreement with the observation
the coincidence between the self similar model and MOND is expected to break at the scale of clusters
of galaxies. Some numerical experiments shows that the behavior of the density near the origin is
closely approximated by a Einasto profile.
