Broad, asymmetric, and red-skewed Fe Kalpha emission lines have been observed in the spectra of
low-mass X-ray binaries hosting neutron stars (NSs) as a compact object. Because more than one model
is able to describe these features, the explanation of where and how the red-skewed Fe lines are produced
is still a matter of discussion. It is broadly accepted that the shape of the Fe Kalpha line is strongly
determined by the special and general relativistic effects occurring in the innermost part of the
accretion disk. In this relativistic framework, the Fe fluorescent lines are produced in the innermost
part of the accretion disk by reflection of hard X-ray photons coming from the central source (corona
and/or NS surface). We developed an alternative and nonrelativistic model, called the windline
model, that is capable to describe the Fe line features. In this nonrelativistic framework, the
line photons are produced at the bottom of a partly ionized outflow (wind) shell as a result of illumination
by the continuum photons coming from the central source, and the red-skewness of the line profile
is explained by repeated electron scattering of the photons in a diverging outflow. Because GX~13+1
is a well-known disk-wind source, it is a perfect target for testing the windline model and comparing
it to the relativistic one. In order to access the goodness of the fit and distinguish between the
two line models, we used the run-test statistical method in addition to the canonical $\chi^2$ statistical
method. The diskline and windline models both fit the asymmetric GX13+1 Fe line well. From a statistical
point of view, for the two observations we analyzed, the run-test was not able to distinguish between
the two Fe line models, at 5% significance level.
