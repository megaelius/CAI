In this paper we study Horndeski theories of gravity, the most general minimally coupled scalar-tensor
theories of second order. While the cosmological background evolution can be described by an effective
equation of state, the perturbations in this class of theories are characterised by four free functions
of time. Here, we consider a specific parametrisation of these functions tracing the dark energy
component. We evaluate the likelihood of the full parameter set resulting from combining temperature
and polarisation fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background including their gravitational
lensing signal, tomographic angular galaxy clustering and weak cosmic shear, together with all
possible non-vanishing cross-correlations; both for a Gaussian approximation of the likelihood
with the Fisher-formalism as well as without the assumption of a specific functional form through
Monte-Carlo Markov-chains (MCMCs). Our results show that the combination of stage IV cosmological
surveys has a very strong constraining power even on complex cosmological models and could exclude
variations of the effective Newtonian gravitational coupling larger than $10\%$ over the age of
the Universe. In particular, we confirm strong correlations between parameter groups. Furthermore,
we find that the expected contours from MCMC are significantly larger than those from the Fisher
analysis even with the vast amount of signal provided by stage IV experiments, illustrating the
importance of a proper treatment of non-Gaussian likelihoods and the limiting nature of the Cram{\'e}r-Rao-bound,
and the high level of precision one needs for unlocking the sensitivity on gravitational parameters.
