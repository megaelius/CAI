AGN-driven outflows are believed to play an important role in regulating the growth of galaxies
mostly via negative feedback. However, their effects on their hosts are far from clear, especially
for low and moderate luminosity Seyferts. To investigate this issue, we have obtained cold molecular
gas observations, traced by the CO(2-1) transition, using the NOEMA interferometer of five nearby
(distances between 19 and 58 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies. The resolution of approx. 0.3-0.8 arcsec (approx.
30-100 pc) and field of view of NOEMA allowed us to study the CO(2-1) morphology and kinematics in
the nuclear regions (approx. 100 pc) and up to radial distances of approx. 900 pc. We have detected
CO(2-1) emission in all five galaxies with disky or circumnuclear ring like morphologies. We derived
cold molecular gas masses on nuclear (approx. 100 pc) and circumnuclear (approx. 650 pc) scales
in the range from $10^6$ to $10^7$M$_{\odot}$ and from $10^7$ to $10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively.
In all of our galaxies the bulk of this gas is rotating in the plane of the galaxy. However, non-circular
motions are also present. In NGC 4253, NGC 4388 and NGC 7465, we can ascribe the streaming motions
to the presence of a large-scale bar. In Mrk 1066 and NGC 4388, the non-circular motions in the nuclear
regions are explained as outflowing material due to the interaction of the AGN wind with molecular
gas in the galaxy disk. We conclude that for an unambiguous and precise interpretation of the kinematics
of the cold molecular gas we need a detailed knowledge of the host galaxy (i.e., presence of bars,
interactions, etc) as well as of the ionized gas kinematics and the ionization cone geometry.
