The LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration recently announced the detection of a compact object
binary merger, GW190412, as the first asymmetric binary black hole (BBH) merger with mass ratio
$q\approx0.25$. Other than the mass ratio, this BBH has shown to have a positive effective spin of
around $\chi_{\rm eff}\approx0.28$. Assuming a field formation channel, associating this effective
spin to either the primary or the secondary BH each has its implications: If the spin of the BBH comes
form the primary BH, it would imply that the angular momentum transport in the formation of massive
BHs operates such that high spin massive BHs are born abundantly. If, on the other hand, the spin is
due to the secondary BH through tidal spin up processes, one has to note that such processes have very
short delay times and low local star formation rate at sufficiently low metallicities. We show that
the predicted merger rate density from this channel is $\lesssim 0.3~\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ and
in tension with the rather high local merger rate of such systems which we estimate from this single
event to be $\sim 2.5^{+3.5}_{-0.5}~\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ (90\% confidence interval). Large
natal kicks ($v\gtrsim 500\,{\rm km/s}$) would be required to get such BBHs with in-plane spin component
to account for the marginal detection of precession in GW190412. However, this would only exacerbate
the tension as the estimated local merger rate would be further decreased. Similarly, the formation
of such systems through the dynamical assembly is exceedingly rare, leaving this system a dilemma
hard to account for with the currently accepted paradigms of BBH formation.
