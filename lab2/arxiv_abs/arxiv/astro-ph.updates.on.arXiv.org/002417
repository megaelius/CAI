The polarized thermal emission from Galactic dust is the main foreground present in measurements
of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit
the Planck HFI polarization data from 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power spectra $C_\ell^{EE,BB}$
over the range $40<\ell<600$. These will bring new insights into interstellar dust physics
and a precise determination of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We
show that statistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large fractions of the
sky using $C_\ell$. For the dust, they are well described by power laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{EE,BB}=-2.42\pm0.02$.
The amplitudes of the polarization $C_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in a way similar to
the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence is consistent with modified blackbody
emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and $T_d=19.6$K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes
of the Galactic $B$- and $E$-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting regions
there are no "clean" windows where primordial CMB $B$-mode polarization could be measured without
subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate the level of dust polarization in the BICEP2
experiment field. Extrapolation of the Planck 353GHz data to 150GHz gives a dust power $\ell(\ell+1)C_\ell^{BB}/(2\pi)$
of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$K$_{CMB}^2$ over the $40<\ell<120$ range; the statistical
uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is an additional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation,
both in the same units. This is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this $\ell$ range, which
highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal. The present uncertainties will
be reduced through an ongoing, joint analysis of the Planck and BICEP2 data sets.
