The morphology of bipolar planetary nebulae can be attributed to interactions between a fast wind
from the central engine and dense toroidal shaped ejecta left over from common envelope evolution.
Here we use the 3-D hydrodynamic adaptive mesh refinement code AsrtroBEAR to study the possibility
that bipolar preplanetary nebula outflows can emerge collimated even from an uncollimated spherical
wind in the aftermath of a common envelope event. The output of a single common envelope simulation
via the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code PHANTOM serves as the initial conditions for our simulations.
Four cases of winds, all with high enough momenta to account for observed high momenta preplanetary
nebula outflows, are injected spherically from the region of the common envelope binary remnant
into the ejecta. We compare cases with two different values of momenta and cases with no radiative
cooling versus application of optically thin emission via a cooling curve to the outflow. Our simulations
show that in all cases highly collimated bipolar outflows result from deflection of the spherical
wind via the interaction with the common envelope ejecta. Significant asymmetries between the
top and bottom lobes are seen in all cases, reflecting the influence of asymmetries in the turbulent
dynamics of the common envelope interaction. The asymmetry is strongest for the lower momentum
case with radiative cooling. While real post common envelope winds may not be spherical, our models
show that collimation via "inertial confinement" will be strong enough to create jet-like outflows
even beginning with maximally uncollimated drivers.
