Goldstone Apple Valley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) is a science education partnership among NASA,
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Lewis Center for Educational Research (LCER), offering
unique opportunities for K -12 students and their teachers. The GAVRT program operates a 34-m radio
telescope with a wide-band, low noise receiver, which is tunable in four independent dual-polarization
bands from 3 to 14 GHz. The annular eclipse of the Sun on 2012 May 20 was observed by GAVRT as part of education
outreach. In this paper we present the results of this eclipse data and discuss the multi-wavelength
strip scan brightness distribution across three active regions. We derive the source brightness
temperatures and angular sizes as a function of frequency and interpret the results in terms of the
gyroresonance mechanism. We show examples of the increasing brightness and widening of source
size (isogauss surface) with wavelength as evidence for gyroresonance emission layers of broader
(diverging ) isogauss surfaces of the magnetic field geometry in the corona above solar surface.
We present an example how the derived frequency - brightness temperature relationship is translated
to a magnetic field - brightness temperature relationship under the frame-work of gyroresonance
emission. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of GAVRT bands as excellent probes to study the
layers of the corona above the active regions (sun spots), in particular the prevalence of the gyroresonance
mechanism. Our results provide a frame-work for multiwavelength cm-wavelength eclipse observations
and illustrate how the GAVRT program and K- 12 student/teacher participation can produce science
data useful to the scientific community and science missions.
