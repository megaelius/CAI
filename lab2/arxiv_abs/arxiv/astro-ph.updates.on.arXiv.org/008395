Morphological classification is a key piece of information to define samples of galaxies aiming
to study the large-scale structure of the universe. In essence, the challenge is to build up a robust
methodology to perform a reliable morphological estimate from galaxy images. Here, we investigate
how to substantially improve the galaxy classification within large datasets by mimicking human
classification. We combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine
and deep learning methodologies. We propose two distinct approaches for galaxy morphology: one
based on non-parametric morphology and traditional machine learning algorithms; and another
based on Deep Learning. To measure the input features for the traditional machine learning methodology,
we have developed a system called CyMorph, with a novel non-parametric approach to study galaxy
morphology. The main dataset employed comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7).
We also discuss the class imbalance problem considering three classes. Performance of each model
is mainly measured by Overall Accuracy (OA). A spectroscopic validation with astrophysical parameters
is also provided for Decision Tree models to assess the quality of our morphological classification.
In all of our samples, both Deep and Traditional Machine Learning approaches have over 94.5% OA to
classify galaxies among 2 classes (elliptical and spiral galaxies). We provide a catalog with ~670,000
galaxies containing our best results, including morphological metrics and classification (supplementary
data link). We compare our classification with state-of-art morphological classification from
literature.
