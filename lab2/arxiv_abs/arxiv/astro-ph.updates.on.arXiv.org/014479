Large multi-object spectroscopic surveys require automated algorithms to optimise their observing
strategy. One of the most ambitious upcoming spectroscopic surveys is the 4MOST survey. The 4MOST
survey facility is a fibre-fed spectroscopic instrument on the VISTA telescope with a large enough
field of view to survey a large fraction of the southern sky within a few years. Several Galactic and
extragalactic surveys will be carried out simultaneously, so the combined target density will
strongly vary. In this paper, we describe a new tiling algorithm that can naturally deal with the
large target density variations on the sky and which automatically handles the different exposure
times of targets. The tiling pattern is modelled as a marked point process, which is characterised
by a probability density that integrates the requirements imposed by the 4MOST survey. The optimal
tilling pattern with respect to the defined model is estimated by the tiles configuration that maximises
the proposed probability density. In order to achieve this maximisation a simulated annealing
algorithm is implemented. The algorithm automatically finds an optimal tiling pattern and assigns
a tentative sky brightness condition and exposure time for each tile, while minimising the total
execution time that is needed to observe the list of targets in the combined input catalogue of all
surveys. Hence, the algorithm maximises the long-term observing efficiency and provides an optimal
tiling solution for the survey. While designed for the 4MOST survey, the algorithm is flexible and
can with simple modifications be applied to any other multi-object spectroscopic survey.
