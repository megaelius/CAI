We present Chandra observations of 2106 radio-quiet quasars in the redshift range 1.7<z<2.7 from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), through data release fourteen (DR14), that do not contain broad
absorption lines (BAL) in their rest-frame UV spectra. This sample adds over a decade worth of SDSS
and Chandra observations to our previously published sample of 139 quasars from SDSS DR5 which is
still used to correlate X-ray and optical/UV emission in typical quasars. We fit the SDSS spectra
for 753 of the quasars in our sample that have high-quality (exposure time $\gtrapprox$10 ks and
off-axis observation angle <10 arcmin) X-ray observations, and analyze their X-ray-to-optical
SED properties ($\alpha_{ox}$ and $\Delta\alpha_{ox}$) with respect to the measured CIV and MgII
emission-line rest-frame equivalent width (EW) and the CIV emission-line blueshift. We find significant
correlations (at the >99.99% level) between $\alpha_{ox}$ and these emission-line parameters,
as well as between $\Delta\alpha_{ox}$ and CIV EW. Slight correlations are found between $\Delta\alpha_{ox}$
and CIV blueshift, MgII EW, and the CIV EW to MgII EW ratio. The best-fit trend in each parameter space
is used to compare the X-ray weakness ($\Delta\alpha_{ox}$) and optical/UV emission properties
of typical quasars and weak-line quasars (WLQs). The WLQs typically exhibit weaker X-ray emission
than predicted by the typical quasar relationships. The best-fit relationships for our typical
quasars are consistent with predictions from the disk-wind quasar model. The behavior of the WLQs
compared to our typical quasars can be explained by an X-ray "shielding" model.
