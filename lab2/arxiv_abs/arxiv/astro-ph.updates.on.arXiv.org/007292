We report the spectroscopic confirmation and modeling of the quadruply imaged quasar GRAL113100-441959,
the first gravitational lens (GL) to be discovered mainly from astrometric considerations. Follow-up
spectra obtained with Keck/LRIS reveal the lensing nature of this quadruply-imaged quasar with
redshift $z_s = 1.090 \pm 0.002$, but show no evidence of the central lens galaxy. Using the image
positions and $G$-band flux ratios provided by Gaia Data Release 2 as constraints, we model the system
with a singular power-law elliptical mass distribution (SPEMD) plus external shear, to different
levels of complexity. We show that relaxing the isothermal constraint of the SPEMD is not statistically
significant, and thus we simplify the SPEMD to a singular isothermal ellipsoid to estimate the Einstein
radius of the main lens galaxy $\theta_{\text{E}} = 0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}851$, the intensity
and position angle of the external shear $(\gamma,\theta_{\gamma}) = (0.044,11.\!\!^{\circ}5)$,
and we predict the lensing galaxy position to be $(x_{\text{gal}},y_{\text{gal}}) = (-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}424,-0.\!\!^{\prime\prime}744)$
with respect to image A. We provide time delay predictions for pairs of images, assuming a plausible
range of lens redshift values $z_l$ between $0.5$ and $0.9$. We finally examine the impact on time
delays of the so-called Source Position Transformation, a family of degeneracies existing between
different lens density profiles that reproduce most of the lensing observables equally well. We
show that this effect contributes significantly to the time delay error budget and cannot be ignored
during the modeling. This has implications for robust cosmography applications of lensed systems.
GRAL113100-441959 is the first in a series of seven new spectroscopically confirmed GLs discovered
from Gaia Data Release 2.
