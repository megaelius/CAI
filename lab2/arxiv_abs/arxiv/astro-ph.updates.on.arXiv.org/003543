We present a catalog of 182 galaxy clusters detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect by the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope in a contiguous 987.5 deg$^{2}$ field (E-D56) located on the celestial
equator. The clusters were detected as SZ decrements by applying a matched filter to 148 GHz maps
that combine the original ACT equatorial survey with data taken in the first two observing seasons
using the ACTPol receiver. Optical/IR confirmation and redshift measurements come from a combination
of large public surveys and our own follow-up observations. Where necessary, we measured photometric
redshifts for clusters using a pipeline that achieves accuracy $\Delta z/(1 + z)=0.015$ when tested
on SDSS data. Under the assumption that clusters can be described by the so-called Universal Pressure
Profile (UPP) and its associated mass-scaling law, the full signal-to-noise > 4 sample spans the
mass range $1.6 < M^{\rm UPP}_{\rm 500c}/10^{14}{\rm M}_{\odot}<9.1$, with median $M^{\rm UPP}_{\rm
500c}=3.1 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$. The sample covers the redshift range 0.1 < z < 1.4, with median
z = 0.49. Thirty nine clusters are new to the literature, which have median z=0.72. We compare our
catalog with other overlapping cluster samples selected using the SZ, optical, and X-ray wavelengths.
We find the ratio of the UPP-based SZ mass to richness-based weak-lensing mass is $\langle M^{\rm
UPP}_{\rm 500c} \rangle / \langle M^{\rm \lambda WL}_{\rm 500c} \rangle = 0.68 \pm 0.11$, in agreement
with some previous weak-lensing studies. After applying this calibration, the mass distribution
for clusters with $M_{\rm 500c} > 4 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ is consistent with the number of
such clusters found in the South Pole Telescope SZ survey, where the mass-scaling relation was scaled
to match the cluster abundance in a fixed $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
