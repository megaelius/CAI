The central engines of some superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are generally suggested to be newly
born fast rotating magnetars, which spin down mainly through magnetic dipole radiation and gravitational
wave emission. We calculate the magnetar-powered SLSNe light curves (LCs) with the tilt angle evolution
of newly born magnetars involved. We show that, depending on the internal toroidal magnetic fields
${\bar B}_{\rm t}$, the initial spin periods $P_{\rm i}$, and the radii $R_{\rm DU}$ of direct Urca
(DU) cores of newly born magnetars, as well as the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$ for $^3P_2$ neutron
superfluidity, bumps could appear in the SLSNe LCs after the maximum lights when the tilt angles
grow to $\pi/2$. The value of $T_{\rm c}$ determines the arising time and the relative amplitude
of a bump. The quantity $R_{\rm DU}$ can affect the arising time and the luminosity of a bump, as well
as the peak luminosity of a LC. Moreover, it is interesting that a stronger ${\bar B}_{\rm t}$ will
lead to both a brighter peak and a brighter bump in a LC. While keeping other quantities unchanged,
the bump in the LC disappears for the magnetar with smaller $P_{\rm i}$. We suggest that, once the
SLSNe LCs with such kinds of bumps are observed, by fitting these LCs with our model, not only $B_{\rm
d}$ and $P_{\rm i}$ of newly born magnetars but also the crucial physical quantities ${\bar B}_{\rm
t}$, $R_{\rm DU}$, and $T_{\rm c}$ could be determined. Nonobservation of SLSNe LCs with such kinds
of bumps hitherto may already put some (\textit{though very rough}) constraints on ${\bar B}_{\rm
t}$, $P_{\rm i}$, $R_{\rm DU}$, and $T_{\rm c}$. Therefore, observation of SLSNe LCs may provide
a new approach to probe the physics of newly born magnetars.
