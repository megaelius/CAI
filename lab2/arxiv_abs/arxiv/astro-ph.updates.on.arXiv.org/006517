We determine the color excesses, photometric distances, ages, astrometric parallaxes and proper
motions for 94 open clusters in the northern part of the Milky Way. We estimate the color excesses
and photometric distances based on the data from IPHAS photometric survey of the northern Galactic
plane using individual total-to-selective extinction ratios R_r=A_r/E_(r-i) for each cluster
computed via the color-difference method based on IPHAS r, i, and H_alpha-band, 2MASS J, H, and K_s-band,
WISE W1-band, and Pan-STARRS i, z, and y-band data. The inferred R_r values vary significantly from
cluster to cluster spanning the R_r=3.1--5.2 interval with a mean and standard deviation equal
to <R_r>=3.99 and sigma R_r=0.34, respectively. We identified cluster members using (1) absolute
proper motions determined from individual-epoch positions of stars retrieved from IPHAS, 2MASS,
URAT1, ALLWISE, UCAC5, and Gaia DR1 catalogs and positions of stars on individual Palomar Sky Survey
plates reconstructed based on the data provided in USNO-B1.0 catalog and (2) absolute proper motions
provided in Gaia DR2 catalog, and computed the average Gaia DR2 trigonometric parallaxes and proper
motions of the clusters. The mean formal error of the inferred astrometric parallaxes of clusters
is of about 7microarcseconds, however, a comparison of astrometric and photometric parallaxes
of our cluster sample implies that Gaia DR2 parallaxes are, on the average, systematically underestimated
by 45 +/-9 microarcseconds. This result agrees with estimates obtained by other authors using other
objects. At the same time, we find our photometric distance scale to be correct within the quoted
errors (the inferred correction factor is equal to unity to within a standard error of 0.025).
