We perform a calibration of the mixing length parameter at the bottom boundary of the convection
zone for helium-dominated atmospheres of white dwarfs. This calibration is based on a grid of 3D
DB (pure-helium) and DBA (helium-dominated with traces of hydrogen) model atmospheres computed
with the CO5BOLD code, and a grid of 1D DB and DBA envelope structures. The 3D models span a parameter
space of hydrogen-to-helium abundances between -10.0 and -2.0, surface gravities between 7.5
and 9.0 and effective temperatures between 12000 K and 34000 K. The 1D envelopes cover a similar atmospheric
parameter range, but are also calculated with different values of the mixing length parameter,
namely ML2/alpha between 0.4 and 1.4. The calibration is performed based on two definitions of the
bottom boundary of the convection zone, the Schwarzschild and the zero convective flux boundaries.
Thus, our calibration is relevant for applications involving the bulk properties of the convection
zone including its total mass, which excludes the spectroscopic technique. Overall, the calibrated
ML2/alpha is smaller than what is commonly used in evolutionary models and theoretical determinations
of the blue edge of the instability strip for pulsating DB and DBA stars. With calibrated ML2/alpha
we are able to deduce more accurate convection zone sizes needed for studies of planetary debris
mixing and dredge-up of carbon from the core. We highlight this by calculating examples of metal-rich
3D DBAZ models and finding their convection zone masses. Mixing length calibration represents
the first step of in-depth investigations of convective overshoot in white dwarfs with helium-dominated
atmospheres.
