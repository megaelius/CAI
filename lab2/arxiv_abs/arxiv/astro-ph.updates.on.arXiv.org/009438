The migration of Neptune's resonances through the proto-Kuiper belt has been imprinted in the distribution
of small bodies in the outer Solar System. Here we analyze five published Neptune migration models
in detail, focusing on the high pericenter distance (high-q) trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) near
Neptune's 5:2 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances, because they have large resonant populations, are
outside the main classical belt, and are relatively isolated from other strong resonances. We compare
the observationally biased output from these dynamical models with the detected TNOs from the Outer
Solar System Origins Survey, via its Survey Simulator. All of the four new OSSOS detections of high-q
non-resonant TNOs are on the Sunward side of the 5:2 and 3:1 resonances. We show that even after accounting
for observation biases, this asymmetric distribution cannot be drawn from a uniform distribution
of TNOs at 2sigma confidence. As shown by previous work, our analysis here tentatively confirms
that the dynamical model that uses grainy slow Neptune migration provides the best match to the real
high-q TNO orbital data. However, due to extreme observational biases, we have very few high-q TNO
discoveries with which to statistically constrain the models. Thus, this analysis provides a framework
for future comparison between the output from detailed, dynamically classified Neptune migration
simulations and the TNO discoveries from future well-characterized surveys. We show that a deeper
survey (to a limiting r-magnitude of 26.0) with a similar survey area to OSSOS could statistically
distinguish between these five Neptune migration models.
