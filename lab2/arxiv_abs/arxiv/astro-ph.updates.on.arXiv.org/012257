We present new spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of the gravitational lens SDSS J1004+4112
taken with the 6m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO, Russia). In order to
explain the variability that is observed only in the blue wing of the C IV emission line, corresponding
to image A, we analyze the spectroscopy and polarimetry of the four images of the lensed system. Spectra
of the four images were taken in 2007, 2008, and 2018, and polarization was measured in the period
2014-2017. Additionally, we modeled the microlensing effect in the polarized light, assuming
that the source of polarization is the equatorial scattering in the inner part of the torus. We find
that a blue enhancement in the CIV line wings affects component A in all three epochs. We also find
that the UV continuum of component D was amplified in the period 2007-2008, and that the red wings
of CIII] and CIV appear brighter in D than in the other three components. We report significant changes
in the polarization parameters of image D, which can be explained by microlensing.Our simulations
of microlensing of an equatorial scattering region in the dusty torus can qualitatively explain
the observed changes in the polarization degree and angle of image D. We do not detect significant
variability in the polarization parameters of the other images (A, B, and C), although the averaged
values of the polarization degree and angle are different for the different images. Microlensing
of a broad line region model including a compact outflowing component can qualitatively explain
the CIV blue wing enhancement (and variation) in component A. However, to confirmed this hypothesis,
we need additional spectroscopic observation in future.
