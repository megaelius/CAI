We enumerate the micro-states in Higgs theories, addressing (i) the number of vacuum states and
(ii) the appropriate measure in the quantum path integral. To address (i) we explicitly construct
the set of ground state wave-functionals in the field basis focussing on scalar modes $\theta(x)$.
Firstly, we show that in the limit in which the gauge coupling is zero, we obtain an infinite set of
degenerate ground states at large volume distinguished by $\theta(x)\to\theta(x)+\theta_0$,
spontaneously breaking the global symmetry, as is well known. We then show that at finite gauge coupling
there is a unique ground state at large volume since the wave-functional only depends on $\nabla\theta$
in the IR, and we explain this at the level of the Lagrangian. Since gauge fields fall off exponentially
from sources there are no conserved charges or symmetries in the Higgs phase; so the Higgs mechanism
is the removal of symmetry from the theory. We show how physical features of defects, such as cosmic
strings in the abelian Higgs model, are best understood in this context. Since there is a unique ground
state, we address (ii) whether the path integral is a volume measure for the radial Higgs field $\mathcal{D}\rho\,\rho^{N-1}$
from the $N$ components of the Higgs multiplet, or a line measure $\mathcal{D}\rho$ as the $N-1$
would-be Goldstones can be removed in unitary gauge. We prove that the need to avoid quartic divergences
demands a tower of counter terms that resum to exactly give the volume measure. So the size of the Hilbert
space in the zero gauge coupling case and finite gauge coupling case are in one-to-one correspondence,
despite the degeneracy of the ground state being lifted in the latter. As a cosmological application,
we point out that the volume measure can make it exponentially more unlikely in $N(=4)$ for the Standard
Model Higgs to relax to the electroweak vacuum in the early universe.
