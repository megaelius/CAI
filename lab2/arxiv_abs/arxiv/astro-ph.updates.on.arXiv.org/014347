Stellar winds are an integral part of the underlying dynamo, the motor of stellar activity. The wind
controls the star's angular momentum loss, which depends on the magnetic field geometry which,
in turn, varies significantly in time and latitude. Here we study basic properties of a self-consistent
model that includes simple representations of both the global stellar dynamo in a spherical shell
and the exterior in which the wind accelerates and becomes supersonic. We numerically solve an axisymmetric
mean-field model for the induction, momentum, and continuity equations using an isothermal equation
of state. The model allows for the simultaneous generation of a mean magnetic field and the development
of a Parker wind. The resulting flow is transonic at the critical point, which we arrange to be between
the inner and outer radii of the model. The boundary conditions are assumed to be such that the magnetic
field is antisymmetric about the equator, i.e., dipolar. At the solar rotation rate, the dynamo
is oscillatory and of $\alpha^2$ type. In most of the domain, the magnetic field corresponds to that
of a split monopole. The magnetic energy flux is largest between the stellar surface and the critical
point. At rapid rotation of up to 50 times the solar value, most of the magnetic field is lost along
the axis within the inner tangential cylinder of the model. The model reveals unexpected features
that are not generally anticipated from models that are designed to reproduce the solar wind: highly
variable angular momentum flux fluxes even from just an $\alpha^2$ dynamo in the star. For rapid
rotation, magnetic fields are ejected mostly along the axis, where the wind speed is reduced.
