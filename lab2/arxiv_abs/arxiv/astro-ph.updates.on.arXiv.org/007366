We perform simulations of the capabilities of the next generation Very Large Array in the context
of imaging low order CO emission from typical high redshift star forming galaxies at ~ 1 kpc resolution.
We adopt as a spatial and dynamical template the CO 1-0 emission from M 51, scaled accordingly for
redshift, transition, and total gas mass. The molecular gas masses investigated are factors of
1.4, 3.5, and 12.5 larger that of M 51, at z = 0.5, 2, and 4.2, respectively. The z = 2 galaxy gas mass is
comparable to the lowest mass galaxies currently being discovered in the deepest ALMA and NOEMA
cosmological CO line surveys, corresponding to galaxies with star formation rates ~ 10 to 100 $M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. The ngVLA will perform quality imaging at 1kpc resolution of the gas distribution and
dynamics over this disk. We recover the overall rotation curve, galaxy orientation properties,
and molecular ISM internal velocity dispersion. The model at z = 4.2 corresponds to a massive star
forming main sequence disk (SFR ~ 130 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). The ngVLA can obtain 1kpc resolution
images of such a system in a reasonable integration time, and recover the basic galaxy orientation
parameters, and, asymptotically, the maximum rotation velocity. We compare the ngVLA results
with capabilities of ALMA and the Jansky VLA. ALMA and the VLA can detect the integrated low order
CO emission from these galaxies, but lack the sensitivity to perform the high resolution imaging
to recover the dynamics at 1kpc scales. To do so would require of order 1000 hrs per galaxy with these
current facilities. We investigate a 'minimal' ngVLA configuration, removing the longest baselines
and much of the very compact core, and find good imaging can still be performed at 1 kpc resolution.
