Transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets has the potential to provide precise measurements of
atmospheric chemical abundances, in particular of hot Jupiters whose large sizes and high temperatures
make them conducive to such observations. To date, several transmission spectra of hot Jupiters
have revealed low amplitude features of water vapour compared to expectations from cloud-free
atmospheres of solar metallicity. The low spectral amplitudes in such atmospheres could either
be due to the presence of aerosols that obscure part of the atmosphere or due to inherently low abundances
of H$_2$O in the atmospheres. A recent survey of transmission spectra of ten hot Jupiters used empirical
metrics to suggest atmospheres with a range of cloud/haze properties but with no evidence for H$_2$O
depletion. Here, we conduct a detailed and homogeneous atmospheric retrieval analysis of the entire
sample and report the H$_2$O abundances, cloud properties, terminator temperature profiles,
and detection significances of the chemical species. Our present study finds that the majority
of hot Jupiters have atmospheres consistent with sub-solar H$_2$O abundances at their day-night
terminators. The best constrained abundances range from $\mathrm{log(H_2O)}$ of $-5.04^{+0.46}_{-0.30}$
to $-3.16^{+0.66}_{-0.69}$, which compared to expectations from solar-abundance equilibrium
chemistry correspond to $0.018^{+0.035}_{-0.009}\times$ solar to $1.40^{+4.97}_{-1.11}\times$
solar. Besides H$_2$O we report statistical constraints on other chemical species and cloud/haze
properties, including cloud/haze coverage fractions which range from $0.18^{+0.26}_{-0.12}$
to $0.76^{+0.13}_{-0.15}$. The retrieved H$_2$O abundances suggest sub-solar oxygen and/or
super-solar C/O ratios, and can provide important constraints on the formation and migration pathways
of hot giant exoplanets.
