Gravitational waves from the explosive merger of distant black holes are encoded with details regarding
the complex extreme-gravity spacetime present at their source. Famously described by the Kerr
spacetime metric for rotating black holes in general relativity, what if effects beyond this theory
are present? One way to efficiently test this hypothesis is to first obtain a metric which parametrically
deviates from the Kerr metric in a model-independent way. Given such a metric, one can then predict
the ensuing corrections to both the inspiral and ringdown portions of the gravitational waveform
for black holes present in the new spacetime. With these tools in hand, one can then test gravitational
wave signals for such effects by two different methods, (i) inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency
test, and (ii) parameterized test. In this paper, we demonstrate the exact recipe one needs to do
just this. We first derive parameterized corrections to the waveform inspiral, ringdown, and remnant
properties for a generic non-Kerr spacetime and apply this to two example beyond-Kerr spacetimes
each parameterized by a single non-Kerr parameter. We then predict the beyond-Kerr parameter magnitudes
required in an observed gravitational wave signal to be statistically inconsistent with the Kerr
case in general relativity. We find that the two methods give very similar bounds. The constraints
found with existing gravitational-wave events are comparable to those from x-ray observations,
while future gravitational-wave observations using Cosmic Explorer (Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna) can improve such bounds by two (three) orders of magnitude.
