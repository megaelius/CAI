We address the issue of numerical convergence in cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulations using a suite of runs drawn from the EAGLE project. Our simulations adopt subgrid models
that produce realistic galaxy populations at a fiducial mass and force resolution, but systematically
vary the latter in order to study their impact on galaxy properties. We provide several analytic
criteria that help guide the selection of gravitational softening for hydrodynamical simulations,
and present results from runs that both adhere to and deviate from them. Unlike dark matter-only
simulations, hydrodynamical simulations exhibit a strong sensitivity to gravitational softening,
and care must be taken when selecting numerical parameters. Our results--which focus mainly on
star formation histories, galaxy stellar mass functions and sizes--illuminate three main considerations.
First, softening imposes a minimum resolved escape speed, $v_\epsilon$, due to the binding energy
between gas particles. Runs that adopt such small softening lengths that $v_\epsilon \gt 10\,{\rm
km s^{-1}}$ (the sound speed in ionised $\sim 10^4\,{\rm K}$ gas) suffer from reduced effects of
photo-heating. Second, feedback from stars or active galactic nuclei may suffer from numerical
over-cooling if the gravitational softening length is chosen below a critical value, $\epsilon_{\rm
eFB}$. Third, we note that small softening lengths exacerbate the segregation of stars and dark
matter particles in halo centres, often leading to the counter-intuitive result that galaxy sizes
{\em increase} as softening is reduced. The structure of dark matter haloes in hydrodynamical runs
respond to softening in a way that reflects the sensitivity of their galaxy populations to numerical
parameters.
