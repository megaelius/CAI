The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a worldwide project aimed at building the next-generation
ground-based gamma-ray observatory. Within the CTA project, the Italian National Institute for
Astrophysics (INAF) is developing an end-to-end prototype of the CTA Small-Size Telescopes with
a dual-mirror (SST-2M) Schwarzschild-Couder configuration. The prototype, named ASTRI SST-2M,
is located at the INAF "M.C. Fracastoro" observing station in Serra La Nave (Mt. Etna, Sicily) and
is currently in the scientific and performance validation phase. A mini-array of (at least) nine
ASTRI telescopes has been then proposed to be deployed at the Southern CTA site, by means of a collaborative
effort carried out by institutes from Italy, Brazil, and South-Africa. The CTA/ASTRI team is developing
an end-to-end software package for the reduction of the raw data acquired with both ASTRI SST-2M
prototype and mini-array, with the aim of actively contributing to the global ongoing activities
for the official data handling system of the CTA observatory. The group is also undertaking a massive
Monte Carlo simulation data production using the detector Monte Carlo software adopted by the CTA
consortium. Simulated data are being used to validate the simulation chain and evaluate the ASTRI
SST-2M prototype and mini-array performance. Both activities are also carried out in the framework
of the European H2020-ASTERICS (Astronomy ESFRI and Research Infrastructure Cluster) project.
A data archiving system, for both ASTRI SST-2M prototype and mini-array, has been also developed
by the CTA/ASTRI team, as a testbed for the scientific archive of CTA. In this contribution, we present
the main components of the ASTRI data handling systems and report the status of their development.
