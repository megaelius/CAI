We employ the hemisphere comparison (HC) method and the dipole fitting (DF) method to investigate
the cosmic anisotropy in the recently released Pantheon sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and
five combinations among Pantheon. For the HC method, we find the maximum anisotropy level in the
full Pantheon sample is $\mathrm{AL}_{max}=0.361\pm0.070$ and corresponding direction $(l,b)=({123.05^{\circ}}^{+11.25^{\circ}}_{-4.22^{\circ}},
{4.78^{\circ}}^{+1.80^{\circ}}_{-8.36^{\circ}})$. A robust check shows the maximum anisotropy
level is statistically significant. We also find that the Low-$z$ and SNLS subsamples have decisive
impact on the overall anisotropy while other three subsamples have little impact. Moreover, the
anisotropy level map significantly rely on the inhomogeneous distribution of SNe Ia in the sky.
For the DF method, we find the dipole anisotropy in the Pantheon sample is very weak. The dipole magnitude
is constrained to be less than $1.16\times10^{-3}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. However, the dipole
direction is well inferred by MCMC method and it points towards $(l,b)=({306.00^{\circ}}^{+82.95^{\circ}}_{-125.01^{\circ}},
{-34.20^{\circ}}^{+16.82^{\circ}}_{-54.93^{\circ}})$. This direction is very close to the
axial direction to the plane of SDSS subsample. It may imply that SDSS subsample is the decisive part
to the dipole anisotropy in the full Pantheon sample. All these facts imply that the cosmic anisotropy
found in Pantheon sample significantly rely on the inhomogeneous distribution of SNe Ia in the sky.
More homogeneous distribution of SNe Ia is necessary to search for a more convincing cosmic anisotropy.
