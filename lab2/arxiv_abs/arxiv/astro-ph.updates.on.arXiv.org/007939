The microquasar SS 433 is the only known steady supercritical accretor in the Galaxy. It is well-known
for its relativistic baryonic jets, but the system also drives equatorial outflows. These have
been routinely detected in radio images, and components associated with a circumbinary disk have
also been suggested in optical emission lines. We wish to spatially resolve the regions producing
the stationary emission lines of SS 433 to shed light on its circumbinary structure and outflows.
With an estimated binary orbit size $\lesssim 0.1 \text{ mas}$, this requires optical interferometry.
We use the optical interferometer VLTI+GRAVITY to spatially resolve SS 433 in the near-infrared
K band at high spectral resolution ($R\approx 4000$) on three nights in July 2017. The stationary
Br$\gamma$ line is clearly dominated by an extended $\sim 1 \text{ mas} \sim 5 \text{ AU}$ circumbinary
structure perpendicular to the jets and with a strong rotation component. The rotation direction
is retrograde relative to the jet precession, in accordance with the slaved disk precession model.
The structure has a very high specific angular momentum and is too extended to be a stable circumbinary
disk in Keplerian rotation; interpreting it as such leads to a very high enclosed mass $M \gtrsim
400 M_{\odot}$. We instead interpret it as the centrifugal ejection of the circumbinary disk, with
the implication that there must be an efficient transfer of specific angular momentum from the binary
to the disk. We suggest that the equatorial outflows sometimes seen in radio images result from similar
episodes of circumbinary disk centrifugal ejection. In addition to the equatorial structure,
we find a very extended $\sim 6 \text{ mas} \sim 30 \text{ AU}$ spherical wind component to the Br$\gamma$
line: the entire binary is engulfed in an optically thin spherical line emission envelope.
