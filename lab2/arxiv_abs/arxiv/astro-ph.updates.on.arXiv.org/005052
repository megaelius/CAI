The giant impact hypothesis remains the leading theory for lunar origin. However, current models
struggle to explain the Moon's composition and isotopic similarity with Earth. Here we present
a new lunar origin model. High-energy, high-angular momentum giant impacts can create a post-impact
structure that exceeds the corotation limit (CoRoL), which defines the hottest thermal state and
angular momentum possible for a corotating body. In a typical super-CoRoL body, traditional definitions
of mantle, atmosphere and disk are not appropriate, and the body forms a new type of planetary structure,
named a synestia. Using simulations of cooling synestias combined with dynamic, thermodynamic
and geochemical calculations, we show that satellite formation from a synestia can produce the
main features of our Moon. We find that cooling drives mixing of the structure, and condensation
generates moonlets that orbit within the synestia, surrounded by tens of bars of bulk silicate Earth
(BSE) vapor. The moonlets and growing moon are heated by the vapor until the first major element (Si)
begins to vaporize and buffer the temperature. Moonlets equilibrate with BSE vapor at the temperature
of silicate vaporization and the pressure of the structure, establishing the lunar isotopic composition
and pattern of moderately volatile elements. Eventually, the cooling synestia recedes within
the lunar orbit, terminating the main stage of lunar accretion. Our model shifts the paradigm for
lunar origin from specifying a certain impact scenario to achieving a Moon-forming synestia. Giant
impacts that produce potential Moon-forming synestias were common at the end of terrestrial planet
formation.
