We analyse the oxygen abundance and specific star formation rates (sSFR) variations with redshift
in star-forming SDSS galaxies of different masses. We find that the maximum value of the sSFR, sSFRmax,
decreases when the stellar mass, Ms, of a galaxy increases, and decreases with decreasing of redshift.
The sSFRmax can exceed the time-averaged sSFR by about an order of magnitude for massive galaxies.
The metallicity - redshift relations for subsamples of galaxies with sSFR = sSFRmax and with sSFR
= 0.1sSFRmax coincide for massive (log(Ms/Mo) > 10.5, with stellar mass Ms in solar units) galaxies
and differ for low-mass galaxies. This suggests that there is no correlation between oxygen abundance
and sSFR in massive galaxies and that the oxygen abundance correlates with the sSFR in low-mass galaxies.
We find evidence in favour of that the irregular galaxies show, on average, higher sSFR and lower
oxygen abundances than the spiral galaxies of similar masses and that the mass - metallicity relation
for spiral galaxies differs slightly from that for irregular galaxies. The fact that our sample
of low-mass galaxies is the mixture of spiral and irregular galaxies can be responsible for the dependence
of the metallicity - redshift relation on the sSFR observed for the low-mass SDSS galaxies. The mass
- metallicity and luminosity - metallicity relations obtained for irregular SDSS galaxies agree
with corresponding relations for nearby irregular galaxies with direct abundance determinations.
We find that the aperture effect does not make a significant contribution to the redshift variation
of oxygen abundances in SDSS galaxies.
