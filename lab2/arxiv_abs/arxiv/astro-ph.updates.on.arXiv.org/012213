Rich complexes of associated absorption lines (AALs) in quasar spectra provide unique information
about gaseous infall, outflows, and feedback processes in quasar environments. We study five quasars
at redshifts 3.1 to 4.4 with AAL complexes containing from 7 to 18 CIV 1548, 1551 systems in high-resolution
spectra. These complexes span velocity ranges $\lesssim$3600 km/s within $\lesssim$8200 km/s
of the quasar redshifts. All are highly ionised with no measurable low-ionisation ions like SiII
or CII, and all appear to form in the quasar/host galaxy environments based on evidence for line locking,
partial covering of the background light source, strong NV absorption, and/or roughly solar metallicities,
and on the implausibility of such complexes forming in unrelated intervening galaxies. Most of
the lines in all five complexes identify high-speed quasar-driven outflows at velocity shifts
$v\lesssim -1000$ km/s. Four of the complexes also have lines at smaller blueshifted velocities
that might form in ambient interstellar clouds, low-speed outflows or at feedback interfaces in
the host galaxies where high-speed winds impact and shred interstellar clouds. The partial covering
we measure in some of the high-speed outflow lines require small absorbing clouds with characteristic
sizes $\lesssim$1 pc or $\lesssim$0.01 pc. The short survival times of these clouds require locations
very close to the quasars, or cloud creation in situ at larger distances perhaps via feedback/cloud-shredding
processes. The AAL complex in one quasar, J1008+3623, includes unusually narrow CIV systems at
redshifted velocities $350\lesssim v\lesssim640$ km/s that are excellent candidates for gaseous
infall towards the quasar, e.g., ''cold-mode" accretion or a gravitationally-bound galactic
fountain.
