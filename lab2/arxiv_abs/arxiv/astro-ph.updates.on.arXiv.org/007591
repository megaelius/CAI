Low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs), with either a neutron star (NS) or a black hole, show in their power
spectra quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs). Those at highest frequencies show up in pairs and are
named twin peak high frequency QPOs (HF QPOs). Their central frequencies are typical of the orbital
motion timescale close to the compact object. HF QPOs are believed to carry unique information on
the matter moving in the extreme gravitational field around the compact object. In previous works
we highlighted the work done by strong tides on clumps of plasma orbiting in the accretion disk as
suitable mechanism to produce the HF QPOs. We showed that the upper of the twin peak HF QPOs seen in
NS LMXBs could originate from the tidal circularization of the clump's relativistic orbit, while
the lower HF QPO could come from the spiraling clump losing orbital energy. Here we focus on the tidal
deformation of a magnetized clump of plasma once tides load energy on it. The likely evolution of
the shape of the clump after tidal circularization of the orbit and its subsequent orbital evolution
are investigated. In atoll NS LMXBs, a subclass of NS LMXBs less luminous than Z NS LMXBs, the lower
HF QPO displays a characteristic behavior of its coherence $Q$ versus its central frequency $\nu$.
$Q$ keeps increasing over the range of frequencies $\nu\sim$ 600-850 Hz and then drops abruptly
at $\nu\sim$ 900 Hz. We note, for the first time, that such behavior is reproduced by magnetized clumps
of plasma stretched by strong tides and falling onto the NS on unstable orbits. We emphasize the overall
behavior of the lower HF QPO coherence as candidate to disclose the innermost stable bound orbit
predicted by the general relativity theory in the strong field regime.
