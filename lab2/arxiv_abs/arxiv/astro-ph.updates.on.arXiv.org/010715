This paper studies pseudo-bulges (P-bulges) and classical bulges (C-bulges) in Sloan Digital
Sky Survey central galaxies using the new bulge indicator $\Delta\Sigma_1$, which measures relative
central stellar-mass surface density within 1 kpc. We compare $\Delta\Sigma_1$ to the established
bulge-type indicator $\Delta\langle\mu_e\rangle$ from Gadotti (2009) and show that classifying
by $\Delta\Sigma_1$ agrees well with $\Delta\langle\mu_e\rangle$. $\Delta\Sigma_1$ requires
no bulge-disk decomposition and can be measured on SDSS images out to $z = 0.07$. Bulge types using
it are mapped onto twenty different structural and stellar-population properties for 12,000 SDSS
central galaxies with masses 10.0 < log $M_*$/$M_{\odot}$ < 10.4. New trends emerge from this large
sample. Structural parameters show fairly linear log-log relations vs. $\Delta\Sigma_1$ and
$\Delta\langle\mu_e\rangle$ with only moderate scatter, while stellar-population parameters
show a highly non-linear "elbow" in which specific star-formation rate remains roughly flat with
increasing central density and then falls rapidly at the elbow, where galaxies begin to quench.
P-bulges occupy the low-density end of the horizontal arm of the elbow and are universally star-forming,
while C-bulges occupy the elbow and the vertical branch and exhibit a wide range of star-formation
rates at fixed density. The non-linear relation between central density and star-formation rate
has been seen before, but this mapping onto bulge class is new. The wide range of star-formation rates
in C-bulges helps to explain why bulge classifications using different parameters have sometimes
disagreed in the past. The elbow-shaped relation between density and stellar indices suggests
that central structure and stellar-populations evolve at different rates as galaxies begin to
quench.
