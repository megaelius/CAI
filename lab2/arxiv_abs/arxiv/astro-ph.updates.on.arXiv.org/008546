Although advances in exoplanet detection techniques have seen an increase in discoveries, observing
a planet in the earliest stages of formation still remains a difficult task. Here four epochs of spectra
of the transitional disk object T Cha are analysed to determine whether spectro-astrometry can
be used to detect a signal from its proposed protoplanet, T Cha b. The unique properties of T Cha are
also further constrained. H{\alpha} and [O I]{\lambda} 6300, the most prominent lines, were analysed
using spectro-astrometry. H{\alpha} being a direct accretion tracer is the target for the T Cha
b detection while [O I]{\lambda} 6300 is considered to be an indirect tracer of accretion. [O I]{\lambda}
6300 is classified as a broad low velocity component (BC LVC). The mass accretion rate was derived
for all epochs using new [O I]{\lambda} 6300 LVC relationships and the H{\alpha} line luminosity.
It is shown that a wind is the likely origin of the [O I]{\lambda} 6300 line and that the [O I]{\lambda}
6300 line serves as a better accretion tracer than H{\alpha} in this case. From the comparison between
M acc([OI]) and M acc(H{\alpha}) it is concluded that T Cha is not an intrinsically weak accretor
but rather that a significant proportion of the H{\alpha} emission tracing accretion is obscured.
T Cha b is not detected in the spectro-astrometric analysis yet a detection limit of 0.5 mas is derived.
The analysis in this case was hampered by spectro-astrometric artefacts and by the unique properties
of T Cha. While it seems that spectro-astrometry as a means of detecting exoplanets in TDs can be challenging
it can be used to put an limit on the strength of the H{\alpha} emission from accreting planetary companions
and thus can have an important input into the planning of high angular resolution observations.
