Upcoming wide-area weak lensing surveys are expensive both in time and cost and require an optimal
survey design in order to attain maximum scientific returns from a fixed amount of available telescope
time. The super-sample covariance (SSC), which arises from unobservable modes that are larger
than the survey size, significantly degrades the statistical precision of weak lensing power spectrum
measurement even for a wide-area survey. Using the 1000 mock realizations of the log-normal model,
which approximates the weak lensing field for a $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter model, we
study an optimal survey geometry to minimize the impact of SSC contamination. For a continuous survey
geometry with a fixed survey area, a more elongated geometry such as a rectangular shape of 1:400
side-length ratio reduces the SSC effect and allows for a factor 2 improvement in the cumulative
signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) of power spectrum measurement up to $\ell_{\rm max}\simeq $ a few
$10^3$, compared to compact geometries such as squares or circles. When we allow the survey geometry
to be disconnected but with a fixed total area, assuming $1\times 1$ sq. degrees patches as the fundamental
building blocks of survey footprints, the best strategy is to locate the patches with $\sim 15$ degrees
separation. This separation angle corresponds to the scale at which the two-point correlation
function has a negative minimum. The best configuration allows for a factor 100 gain in the effective
area coverage as well as a factor 2.5 improvement in the $S/N$ at high multipoles, yielding a much
wider coverage of multipoles than in the compact geometry.
