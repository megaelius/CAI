There are thousands of asteroids in near-Earth space and millions expected in the Main Belt. They
are diverse in their physical properties and compositions. They are also time capsules of the early
Solar System making them valuable for planetary science, and are strategic for resource mining,
planetary defense/security and as interplanetary depots. But we lack direct knowledge of the geophysical
behavior of an asteroid surface under milligravity conditions, and therefore landing on an asteroid
and manipulating its surface material remains a daunting challenge. Towards this goal we are putting
forth plans for a 12U CubeSat that will be in Low Earth Orbit and that will operate as a spinning centrifuge
on-orbit. In this paper, we will present an overview of the systems engineering and instrumentation
design on the spacecraft. Parts of this 12U CubeSat will contain a laboratory that will recreate
asteroid surface conditions by containing crushed meteorite. The laboratory will spin at 1 to 2
RPM during the primary mission to simulate surface conditions of asteroids 2 km and smaller, followed
by an extended mission where the spacecraft will spin at even higher RPM. The result is a bed of realistic
regolith, the environment that landers and diggers and maybe astronauts will interact with. The
CubeSat is configured with cameras, lasers, actuators and small mechanical instruments to both
observe and manipulate the regolith at low simulated gravity conditions. A series of experiments
will measure the general behavior, internal friction, adhesion, dilatancy, coefficients of restitution
and other parameters that can feed into asteroid surface dynamics simulations. Effective gravity
can be varied, and external mechanical forces can be applied.
