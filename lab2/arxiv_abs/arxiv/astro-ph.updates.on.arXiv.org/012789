It is commonly assumed that the properties and geometry of the accretion flow in transient low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) significantly change when the X-ray luminosity decays below $\sim 10^{-2}$
of the Eddington limit ($L_{\rm Edd}$). However, there are few observational cases where the evolution
of the accretion flow is tracked in a single X-ray binary over a wide dynamic range. In this work, we
use NuSTAR and NICER observations obtained during the 2018 accretion outburst of the neutron star
LMXB 4U 1608-52, to study changes in the reflection spectrum. We find that the broad Fe-K$\alpha$
line and Compton hump, clearly seen during the peak of the outburst when the X-ray luminosity is $\sim
10^{37}$ erg/s ($\sim 0.05$ $L_{\rm Edd}$), disappear during the decay of the outburst when the
source luminosity drops to $\sim 4.5 \times 10^{35}$ erg/s ($\sim 0.002$ $L_{\rm Edd}$). We show
that this non-detection of the reflection features cannot be explained by the lower signal-to-noise
at lower flux, but is instead caused by physical changes in the accretion flow. Simulating synthetic
NuSTAR observations on a grid of inner disk radius, disk ionisation, and reflection fraction, we
find that the disappearance of the reflection features can be explained by either increased disk
ionisation ($\log \xi \geq 4.1$) or a much decreased reflection fraction. A changing disk truncation
alone, however, cannot account for the lack of reprocessed Fe-K$\alpha$ emission. The required
increase in ionisation parameter could occur if the inner accretion flow evaporates from a thin
disk into a geometrically thicker flow, such as the commonly assumed formation of an radiatively
inefficient accretion flow at lower mass accretion rates.
