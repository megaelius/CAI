Gravitational wave interferometers have proved the existence of a new class of binary black holes
(BBHs) weighting tens of solar masses and they have provided the first reliable measurement of the
rate of coalescing black holes (BHs) in the local universe. On another side, long gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) detected with gamma-ray satellites are believed to be associated with the birth of stellar
mass BHs, providing a measure of the rate of these events across the history of the universe, thanks
to the measure of their cosmological redshift. These two types of sources, which are subject to different
detection biases and involve BHs born in different environments with potentially different characteristics,
provide complementary information on the birth rate of stellar BHs. We compare here the birth rates
of BHs found in BBH mergers and in long GRBs. We construct a simple model which makes reasonable assumptions
on the history of GRB formation, and which takes into account some major uncertainties, like the
beaming angle of GRBs or the delay between the formation of BBHs and their coalescence. We use this
model to evaluate the ratio of the number of stellar mass BHs formed in BBH mergers to those formed
in GRBs. We find that in our reference model the birth rate of stellar BHs in BBH mergers represents
from 5% to 50% of the rate of long GRBs, while comparable birth rates are allowed by models with smaller
beaming angles or when a stronger evolution with redshift is considered for BBHs with respect to
GRBs. We briefly discuss this result in view of our understanding of the progenitors of GRBs and BBH
mergers, and we emphasize that this ratio, which will be better constrained in the coming years,
can be directly compared with the prediction of stellar evolution models if a single model is used
to produce GRBs and of BBH mergers with the same assumptions.
