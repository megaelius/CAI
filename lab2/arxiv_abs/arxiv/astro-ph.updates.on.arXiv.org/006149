Galaxy mass and environment play a major role in the evolution of galaxies. In the transition from
star-forming to quenched galaxies, Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have also a principal action.
However, the connections between these three actors are still uncertain. In this work we investigate
the effects of stellar mass and the large-scale environment (LSS), on the fraction of optical nuclear
activity in a population of isolated galaxies, where AGN would not be triggered by recent galaxy
interactions or mergers. As a continuation of a previous work, we focus on isolated galaxies to study
the effect of stellar mass and the LSS in terms of morphology (early- and late-type), colour (red
and blue), and specific star formation rate (quenched and star-forming). To explore where AGN activity
is affected by the LSS we fix the stellar mass into low- and high-mass galaxies. We use the tidal strength
parameter to quantify their effects. We found that AGN is strongly affected by stellar mass in 'active'
galaxies (namely late-type, blue, and star-forming), however it has no influence for 'quiescent'
galaxies (namely early-type, red, and quenched), at least for masses down to $\rm 10^{10}\,[M_\odot]$.
In relation to the LSS, we found an increment on the fraction of SFN with denser LSS in low-mass star
forming and red isolated galaxies. Regarding AGN, we find a clear increment of the fraction of AGN
with denser environment in quenched and red isolated galaxies, independently of the stellar mass.
AGN activity would be 'mass triggered' in 'active' isolated galaxies. This means that AGN is independent
of the intrinsic property of the galaxies, but on its stellar mass. On the other hand, AGN would be
'environment triggered' in 'quiescent' isolated galaxies, where the fraction of AGN in terms of
sSFR and colour increases from void regions to denser LSS, independently of its stellar mass.
