Gravitational-wave detectors have opened a new window through which we can observe black holes
(BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Analyzing the 11 detections from LIGO/Virgo's first gravitational-wave
catalog, GWTC-1, we investigate whether the power-law fit to the BH mass spectrum can also accommodate
the binary neutron star (BNS) event GW170817, or whether we require an additional feature, such
as a mass gap, in between the NS and BH populations. We find that with respect to the power-law fit to
binary black hole (BBH) masses, GW170817 is an outlier at the 0.13\% level, suggesting a distinction
between NS and BH masses. A single power-law fit across the entire mass range is in mild tension with:
(a) the detection of one source in the BNS mass range ($\sim 1$--$2.5 \,M_\odot$), (b) the absence
of detections in the "mass-gap" range ($\sim 2.5$--$5 \,M_\odot$), and (c) the detection of 10 sources
in the BBH mass range ($\gtrsim 5 \,M_\odot$). Instead, the data favor models with a feature between
NS and BH masses, including a mass gap (Bayes factor of 4.6) and a break in the power law, with a steeper
slope at NS masses compared to BH masses (91\% credibility). We estimate the merger rates of compact
binaries based on our fit to the global mass distribution, finding $\mathcal{R}_\mathrm{BNS}
= 871^{+3015}_{-805} \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{R}_\mathrm{BBH}
= 47.5^{+57.9}_{-28.8} \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We conclude that, even in the
absence of any prior knowledge of the difference between NSs and BHs, the gravitational-wave data
alone already suggest two distinct populations of compact objects.
