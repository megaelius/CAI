We study the physical properties and molecular excitation of the different warm gas components
found in the protoplanetary nebula CRL 618. We revise our previous Herschel/HIFI observations,
which consist of several 12CO and 13CO lines in the far-infrared/sub-mm band. These data have been
re-analyzed in detail by improving calibration, the signal-to-noise-ratio, and baseline substraction.
We identify the contributions of the different nebular components to the line profiles. We have
used a spatio-kinematical model to better constrain the temperature, density, and kinematics
of the molecular components probed by the improved CO observations. The 12CO and 13CO J=16-15, J=10-9,
and J=6-5 transitions are detected in this source. The line profiles present a composite structure
showing spectacular wings in some cases, which become dominant as the energy level increases. Our
analysis of the high-energy CO emission with the already known low-energy J=2-1 and J=1-0 lines
confirms that the high-velocity component, or fast bipolar outflow, is hotter than previously
estimated with a typical temperature of ~300 K. This component may then be an example of a very recent
acceleration of the gas by shocks that has not yet cooled down. We also find that the dense central
core is characterized by a very low expansion velocity, ~5 km/s, and a strong velocity gradient.
We conclude that this component is very likely to be the unaltered circumstellar layers that are
lost in the last AGB phase, where the ejection velocity is particularly low. The physical properties
of the other two nebular components, the diffuse halo and the double empty shell, more or less agrees
with the estimations derived in previous models.
