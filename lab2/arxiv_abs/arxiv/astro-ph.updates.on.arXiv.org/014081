On 28th January 2018, the large Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO) 2002TC302 occulted a m$_v= $15.3 star
with ID 130957813463146112 in the Gaia DR2 stellar catalog. 12 positive occultation chords were
obtained from Italy, France, Slovenia and Switzerland. Also, 4 negative detections were obtained
near the north and south limbs. This represents the best observed stellar occultation by a TNO other
than Pluto, in terms of the number of chords published thus far. From the 12 chords, an accurate elliptical
fit to the instantaneous projection of the body, compatible with the near misses, can be obtained.
The resulting ellipse has major and minor axes of 543 $\pm$ 18 km and 460 $\pm$ 11 km, respectively,
with a position angle of 3 $\pm$ 1 degrees for the minor axis. This information, combined with rotational
light curves obtained with the 1.5m telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory and the 1.23m telescope
at Calar Alto observatory, allows us to derive possible 3D shapes and density estimations for the
body, based on hydrostatic equilibrium assumptions. The effective area equivalent diameter is
$\sim$ 84 km smaller than the radiometrically derived diameter using thermal data from Herschel
and Spitzer Space Telescopes. This might indicate the existence of an unresolved satellite of up
to $\sim$ 300 km in diameter, to account for all the thermal flux, although the occultation and thermal
diameters are compatible within their error bars given the considerable uncertainty of the thermal
results. The existence of a potential satellite also appears to be consistent with other ground-based
data presented here. From the effective occultation diameter combined with H$_V$ measurements
we derive a geometric albedo of 0.147 $\pm$ 0.005, which would be somewhat smaller if 2002TC302 has
a satellite. The best occultation light curves do not show any signs of ring features or any signatures
of a global atmosphere.
