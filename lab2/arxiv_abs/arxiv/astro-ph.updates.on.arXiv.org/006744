The joint detection of the gravitational wave (GW) GW170817 and its electromagnetic (EM) counterparts
GRB170817A and kilonova AT 2017gfo has triggered extensive study of the EM emission of binary neutron
star mergers. A parameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM analyses is
the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from different angles, the amount of
GW energy changes (implying that orientation and distance are correlated) and the EM signatures
can vary, depending on the structure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the
binary orbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the EM data, and
can potentially be extracted from either side. In the first part of this study, we present a systematic
analysis of how well the viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We
show that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified via the EM counterpart
and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\%$ of the systems the viewing angle can be constrained
to $\leq 7^{\circ}$ uncertainty from the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models.
On the other hand, if no redshift measurement is available, the measurement of the viewing angle
with GW alone is not informative, unless the true viewing angle is close to $90^{\circ}$. This holds
true even if the sky position is measured independently. Then, we consider the case where some constraints
on the viewing angle can be placed from the EM data itself. We show that the EM measurements can then
be used in the analysis of GW data to improve the precision of the luminosity distance, and hence of
the Hubble constant, by a factor of 2 to 3. That would allow for a $1\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant,
independent of the cosmic distance ladder, in the next 5 years.
