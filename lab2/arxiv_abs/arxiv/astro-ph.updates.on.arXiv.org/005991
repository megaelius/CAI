Given its velocity dispersion, the early-type galaxy NGC 1600 has an unusually massive ($M_\bullet
= 1.7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$) central supermassive black hole (SMBH), surrounded by a large core
($r_\mathrm{b} = 0.7$ kpc) with a tangentially biased stellar distribution. We present high-resolution
equal-mass merger simulations including SMBHs to study the formation of such systems. The structural
parameters of the progenitor ellipticals were chosen to produce merger remnants resembling NGC
1600. We test initial stellar density slopes of $\rho \propto r^{-1}$ and $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$
and vary the initial SMBH masses from $8.5 \times 10^8$ to $8.5 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$. With increasing
SMBH mass the merger remnants show a systematic decrease in central surface brightness, an increasing
core size, and an increasingly tangentially biased central velocity anisotropy. Two-dimensional
kinematic maps reveal decoupled, rotating core regions for the most massive SMBHs. The stellar
cores form rapidly as the SMBHs become bound, while the velocity anisotropy develops more slowly
after the SMBH binaries become hard. The simulated merger remnants follow distinct relations between
the core radius and the sphere-of-influence, and the SMBH mass, similar to observed systems. We
find a systematic change in the relations as a function of the progenitor density slope, and present
a simple scouring model reproducing this behavior. Finally, we find the best agreement with NGC
1600 using SMBH masses totaling the observed value of $M_\bullet = 1.7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$.
In general, density slopes of $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$ for the progenitor galaxies are strongly
favored for the equal-mass merger scenario.
