Context. QPPs are usually detected as spatial displacements of coronal loops in imaging observations
or as periodic shifts of line properties in spectroscopic observations. They are often applied
for remote diagnostics of magnetic fields and plasma properties on the Sun. Aims. We combine imaging
and spectroscopic measurements of available space missions, and investigate the properties of
non-damping oscillations at flaring loops. Methods. We used the IRIS to measure the spectrum over
a narrow slit. The double-component Gaussian fitting method was used to extract the line profile
of Fe XXI 1354.08 A at "O I" window. The quasi-periodicity of loop oscillations were identified in
the Fourier and wavelet spectra. Results. A periodicity at about 40 s is detected in the line properties
of Fe XXI, HXR emissions in GOES 1-8 A derivative, and Fermi 26-50 keV. The Doppler velocity and line
width oscillate in phase, while a phase shift of about Pi/2 is detected between the Doppler velocity
and peak intensity. The amplitudes of Doppler velocity and line width oscillation are about 2.2
km/s and 1.9 km/s, respectively, while peak intensity oscillate with amplitude at about 3.6% of
the background emission. Meanwhile, a quasi-period of about 155 s is identified in the Doppler velocity
and peak intensity of Fe XXI, and AIA 131 A intensity. Conclusions. The oscillations at about 40 s
are not damped significantly during the observation, it might be linked to the global kink modes
of flaring loops. The periodicity at about 155 s is most likely a signature of recurring downflows
after chromospheric evaporation along flaring loops. The magnetic field strengths of the flaring
loops are estimated to be about 120-170 G using the MHD seismology diagnostics, which are consistent
with the magnetic field modeling results using the flux rope insertion method.
