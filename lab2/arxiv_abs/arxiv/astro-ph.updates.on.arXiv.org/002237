We present a detailed analysis of ALMA Bands 7 and 9 data of CO, HCO+, HCN and CS, augmented with Plateau
de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) data of the ~ 200 pc circumnuclear disk (CND) and the ~ 1.3 kpc starburst
ring (SB ring) of NGC~1068, a nearby (D = 14 Mpc) Seyfert 2 barred galaxy. We aim at determining the
physical characteristics of the dense gas present in the CND and whether the different line intensity
ratios we find within the CND as well as between the CND and the SB ring are due to excitation effects
(gas density and temperature differences) or to a different chemistry. We estimate the column densities
of each species in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). We then compute large one-dimensional
non-LTE radiative transfer grids (using RADEX) by using first only the CO transitions, and then
all the available molecules in order to constrain the densities, temperatures and column densities
within the CND. We finally present a preliminary set of chemical models to determine the origin of
the gas. We find that in general the gas in the CND is very dense (> 10^5 cm^-3) and hot (T> 150K),
with differences especially in the temperature across the CND. The AGN position has the lowest CO/HCO+,
CO/HCN and CO/CS column density ratios. RADEX analyses seem to indicate that there is chemical differentiation
across the CND. We also find differences between the chemistry of the SB ring and some regions of the
CND; the SB ring is also much colder and less dense than the CND. Chemical modelling does not succeed
in reproducing all the molecular ratios with one model per region, suggesting the presence of multi-gas
phase components. The LTE, RADEX and chemical analyses all indicate that more than one gas-phase
component is necessary to uniquely fit all the available molecular ratios within the CND.
