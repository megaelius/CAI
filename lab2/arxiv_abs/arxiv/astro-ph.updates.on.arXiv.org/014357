We examine morphology-separated color-mass diagrams to study the quenching of star formation
in $\sim 100,000$ ($z\sim0$) Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and $\sim 20,000$ ($z\sim1$) Cosmic
Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) galaxies. To classify galaxies
morphologically, we developed Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet), a convolutional neural
network that classifies galaxies according to their bulge-to-total light ratio. GaMorNet does
not need a large training set of real data and can be applied to data sets with a range of signal-to-noise
ratios and spatial resolutions. GaMorNet's source code as well as the trained models are made public
as part of this work ( this http URL ). We first trained GaMorNet on simulations of galaxies with a bulge
and a disk component and then transfer learned using $\sim25\%$ of each data set to achieve misclassification
rates of $\lesssim5\%$. The misclassified sample of galaxies is dominated by small galaxies with
low signal-to-noise ratios. Using the GaMorNet classifications, we find that bulge- and disk-dominated
galaxies have distinct color-mass diagrams, in agreement with previous studies. For both SDSS
and CANDELS galaxies, disk-dominated galaxies peak in the blue cloud, across a broad range of masses,
consistent with the slow exhaustion of star-forming gas with no rapid quenching. A small population
of red disks is found at high mass ($\sim14\%$ of disks at $z\sim0$ and $2\%$ of disks at $z \sim 1$).
In contrast, bulge-dominated galaxies are mostly red, with much smaller numbers down toward the
blue cloud, suggesting rapid quenching and fast evolution across the green valley. This inferred
difference in quenching mechanism is in agreement with previous studies that used other morphology
classification techniques on much smaller samples at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim1$.
