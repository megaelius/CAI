Lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) are an attractive technology for millimeter-wave
observations that require large arrays of extremely low-noise detectors. We designed, fabricated
and characterized 64-element (128 LEKID) arrays of horn-coupled, dual-polarization LEKIDs optimized
for ground-based CMB polarimetry. Our devices are sensitive to two orthogonal polarizations in
a single spectral band centered on 150 GHz with $\Delta\nu/\nu=0.2$. The $65\times 65$ mm square
arrays are designed to be tiled into the focal plane of an optical system. We demonstrate the viability
of these dual-polarization LEKIDs with laboratory measurements. The LEKID modules are tested
with an FPGA-based readout system in a sub-kelvin cryostat that uses a two-stage adiabatic demagnetization
refrigerator. The devices are characterized using a blackbody and a millimeter-wave source. The
polarization properties are measured with a cryogenic stepped half-wave plate. We measure the
resonator parameters and the detector sensitivity, noise spectrum, dynamic range, and polarization
response. The resonators have internal quality factors approaching $1\times 10^{6}$. The detectors
have uniform response between orthogonal polarizations and a large dynamic range. The detectors
are photon-noise limited above 1 pW of absorbed power. The noise-equivalent temperatures under
a 3.4 K blackbody load are $<100~\mu\mathrm{K\sqrt{s}}$. The polarization fractions of detectors
sensitive to orthogonal polarizations are >80%. The entire array is multiplexed on a single readout
line, demonstrating a multiplexing factor of 128. The array and readout meet the requirements for
4 arrays to be read out simultaneously for a multiplexing factor of 512. This laboratory study demonstrates
the first dual-polarization LEKID array optimized for CMB polarimetry and shows the readiness
of the detectors for on-sky observations.
