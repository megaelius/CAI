We present a study of the spectral properties of 441 pulsars observed with the Parkes radio telescope
near the centre frequencies of 728, 1382 and 3100 MHz. The observations at 728 and 3100 MHz were conducted
simultaneously using the dual-band 10-50cm receiver. These high-sensitivity, multi-frequency
observations provide a systematic and uniform sample of pulsar flux densities. We combine our measurements
with spectral data from the literature in order to derive the spectral properties of these pulsars.
Using techniques from robust regression and information theory we classify the observed spectra
in an objective, robust and unbiased way into five morphological classes: simple or broken power
law, power law with either low or high-frequency cut-off and log-parabolic spectrum. While about
$79 \%$ of the pulsars that could be classified have simple power law spectra, we find significant
deviations in 73 pulsars, 35 of which have curved spectra, 25 with a spectral break and 10 with a low-frequency
turn-over. We identify 11 gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) pulsars, with 3 newly identified in
this work and 8 confirmations of known GPS pulsars; 3 others show tentative evidence of GPS, but require
further low-frequency measurements to support this classification. The weighted mean spectral
index of all pulsars with simple power law spectra is $-1.60 \pm 0.03$. The observed spectral indices
are well described by a shifted log-normal distribution. The strongest correlations of spectral
index are with spin-down luminosity, magnetic field at the light-cylinder and spin-down rate.
We also investigate the physical origin of the observed spectral features and determine emission
altitudes for three pulsars.
