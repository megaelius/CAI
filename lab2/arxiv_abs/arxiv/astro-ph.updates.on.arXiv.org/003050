The venerable NOD2 data reduction software package for single-dish radio continuum observations,
developed for use at the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope, has been successfully applied over many
decades. Modern computing facilities call for a new design. We aim to develop an interactive software
tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) for the reduction of single-dish radio continuum maps.
Special effort is given on the reduction of distortions along the scanning direction (scanning
effects) by combining maps scanned in orthogonal directions or dual- or multiple-horn observations
that need to be processed in a restoration procedure. The package should also process polarisation
data and offer the possibility to include special tasks written by the individual user. Based on
the ideas of the NOD2 package we developed NOD3, which includes all necessary tasks from the raw maps
to the final maps in total intensity and linear polarisation. Furthermore, plot routines and several
methods for map analysis are available. The NOD3 package is written in Python which allows to extend
the package by additional tasks. The required data format for the input maps is FITS. NOD3 is a sophisticated
tool to process and analyse maps from single-dish observations that are affected by 'scanning effects'
due to clouds, receiver instabilities, or radio-frequency interference (RFI). The 'basket-weaving'
tool combines orthogonally scanned maps to a final map that is almost free of scanning effects. The
new restoration tool for dual-beam observations reduces the noise by a factor of about two compared
to the NOD2 version. Combining single-dish with interferometer data in the map plane ensures the
full recovery of the total flux density.
