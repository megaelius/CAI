We present the 850 $\mu$m polarization observations toward the IC5146 filamentary cloud taken
using the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) and its associated polarimeter
(POL-2), mounted on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), as part of the B-fields In STar forming
Regions Observations (BISTRO). This work is aimed at revealing the magnetic field morphology within
a core-scale ($\lesssim 1.0$ pc) hub-filament structure (HFS) located at the end of a parsec-scale
filament. To investigate whether or not the observed polarization traces the magnetic field in
the HFS, we analyze the dependence between the observed polarization fraction and total intensity
using a Bayesian approach with the polarization fraction described by the Rice likelihood function,
which can correctly describe the probability density function (PDF) of the observed polarization
fraction for low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. We find a power-law dependence between the polarization
fraction and total intensity with an index of 0.56 in $A_V\sim$ 20--300 mag regions, suggesting
that the dust grains in these dense regions can still be aligned with magnetic fields in the IC5146
regions. Our polarization maps reveal a curved magnetic field, possibly dragged by the contraction
along the parsec-scale filament. We further obtain a magnetic field strength of 0.5$\pm$0.2 mG
toward the central hub using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, corresponding to a mass-to-flux
criticality of $\sim$ $1.3\pm0.4$ and an Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number of $<$0.6. These results suggest
that gravity and magnetic field is currently of comparable importance in the HFS, and turbulence
is less important.
