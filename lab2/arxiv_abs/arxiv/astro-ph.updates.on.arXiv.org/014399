Weak lensing, which is the deflection of light by matter along the line of sight, has proven to be an
efficient method for constraining models of structure formation and reveal the nature of dark energy.
So far, most weak-lensing studies have focused on the shear field that can be measured directly from
the ellipticity of background galaxies. However, within the context of forthcoming full-sky weak-lensing
surveys such as Euclid, convergence maps (mass maps) offer an important advantage over shear fields
in terms of cosmological exploitation. While it carry the same information, the lensing signal
is more compressed in the convergence maps than in the shear field. This simplifies otherwise computationally
expensive analyses, for instance, non-Gaussianity studies. However, the inversion of the non-local
shear field requires accurate control of systematic effects caused by holes in the data field, field
borders, shape noise, and the fact that the shear is not a direct observable (reduced shear). We present
the two mass-inversion methods that are included in the official Euclid data-processing pipeline:
the standard Kaiser & Squires method (KS), and a new mass-inversion method (KS+) that aims to reduce
the information loss during the mass inversion. This new method is based on the KS method and includes
corrections for mass-mapping systematic effects. The results of the KS+ method are compared to
the original implementation of the KS method in its simplest form, using the Euclid Flagship mock
galaxy catalogue. In particular, we estimate the quality of the reconstruction by comparing the
two-point correlation functions and third- and fourth- order moments obtained from shear and convergence
maps, and we analyse each systematic effect independently and simultaneously...
