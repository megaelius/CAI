The properties of the smallest subunits of cometary dust contain information on their origin and
clues to the formation of planetesimals and planets. Compared to IDPs or particles collected during
the Stardust mission, dust collected in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the
Rosetta mission provides a resource of minimally altered material with known origin whose structural
properties can be used to further the investigation of our early Solar System. A novel method is presented
to achieve the highest spatial resolution of imaging possible with the MIDAS Atomic Force Microscope
on-board Rosetta. 3D topographic images with resolutions of down to 8\,nm are analysed to determine
the subunit sizes of particles on the nanometre scale. Three morphological classes can be determined,
namely (i) fragile agglomerate particles of sizes larger than about 10\,$\mathrm{\mu m}$ comprised
by micrometre-sized subunits that may be again aggregates and show a moderate packing density on
the surface of the particles; (ii) a fragile agglomerate with a size about few tens of micrometres
comprised by micrometre-sized subunits suggested to be again aggregates and arranged in a structure
with a fractal dimension less than two; (iii) small, micrometre-sized particles comprised by subunits
in the hundreds of nanometres size range that show surface features suggested to again represent
subunits. Their differential size distributions follow a log-normal distribution with means
about 100\,nm and standard deviations between 20 and 35\,nm. All micrometre-sized particles are
hierarchical dust agglomerates of smaller subunits. The arrangement, appearance and size distribution
of the smallest determined surface features are reminiscent of those found in CP IDPs and they represent
the smallest directly detected subunits of comet 67P.
