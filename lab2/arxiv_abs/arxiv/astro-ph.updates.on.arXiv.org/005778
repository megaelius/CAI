Context: the space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler have provided photometric observations of
unprecedented quality. The study of solar-like oscillations observed in red giant stars by these
satellites allows a better understanding of the different physical processes occurring in their
interiors. In particular, the study of the mode excitation and damping is a promising way to improve
our understanding of stellar physics that has, so far, been performed only on a limited number of
targets. Aims: the recent asteroseismic characterization of the evolutionary status for a large
number of red giants allows us to study the physical processes acting in the interior of red giants
and how they are modify during stellar evolution. In this work, we aim to obtain information on the
excitation and damping of pressure modes through the measurement of the stars' pressure mode widths
and amplitudes and to analyze how they are modified with stellar evolution. The objective is to bring
observational constraints on the modeling of the physical processes behind mode excitation and
damping. Methods: we fit the frequency spectra of red giants with well defined evolutionary status
using Lorentzians functions to derive the pressure mode widths and amplitudes. To strengthen our
conclusions, we used two different fitting techniques. Results: pressure mode widths and amplitudes
were determined for more than 5000 red giants. With a stellar sample two orders of magnitude larger
than previous results, we confirmed that the mode width depends on stellar evolution and varies
with stellar effective temperature. In addition, we discovered that the mode width depends on stellar
mass. We also confirmed observationally the influence of the stellar metallicity on the mode amplitudes,
as predicted by models.
