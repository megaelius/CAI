Based on a decomposition of the magnetic field into potential and nonpotential components, magnetic
energy and relative helicity can both also be decomposed into two quantities: potential and free
energies, and volume-threading and current-carrying helicities. In this study, we perform a coupled
analysis of their behaviors in a set of parametric 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of
solar-like eruptions. We present the general formulations for the time-varying components of
energy and helicity in resistive MHD. We calculated them numerically with a specific gauge, and
compared their behaviors in the numerical simulations, which differ from one another by their imposed
boundary-driving motions. Thus, we investigated the impact of different active regions surface
flows on the development of the energy and helicity-related quantities. Despite general similarities
in their overall behaviors, helicities and energies display different evolutions that cannot
be explained in a unique framework. While the energy fluxes are similar in all simulations, the physical
mechanisms that govern the evolution of the helicities are markedly distinct from one simulation
to another: the evolution of volume-threading helicity can be governed by boundary fluxes or helicity
transfer, depending on the simulation. The eruption takes place for the same value of the ratio of
the current-carrying helicity to the total helicity in all simulations. However, our study highlights
that this threshold can be reached in different ways, with different helicity-related processes
dominating for different photospheric flows. This means that the details of the pre-eruptive dynamics
do not influence the eruption-onset helicity-related threshold. Nevertheless, the helicity-flux
dynamics may be more or less efficient in changing the time required to reach the onset of the eruption.
