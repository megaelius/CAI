The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) is a 3 Unit (3U) CubeSat designed for a 3-month mission
to study solar soft X-ray spectral irradiance. The first of the two flight models was deployed from
the International Space Station in 2016 May and operated for one year before its natural deorbiting.
This was the first flight of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT 3-axis attitude determination and
control system -- a commercially available, high-precision pointing system. We characterized
the performance of the pointing system on orbit including performance at low altitudes where drag
torque builds up. We found that the pointing accuracy was 0.0042\degree\ - 0.0117\degree\ (15$''$
- 42$''$, 3$\sigma$, axis dependent) consistently from 190 km - 410 km, slightly better than the
specification sheet states. Peak-to-peak jitter was estimated to be 0.0073\degree\ (10 s$^{-1}$)
- 0.0183\degree\ (10 s$^{-1}$) (26$''$ (10 s$^{-1}$) - 66$''$ (10 s$^{-1}$), 3$\sigma$). The system
was capable of dumping momentum until an altitude of 185 km. We found small amounts of sensor degradation
in the star tracker and coarse sun sensor. Our mission profile did not require high-agility maneuvers
so we are unable to characterize this metric. Without a GPS receiver, it was necessary to periodically
upload ephemeris information to update the orbit propagation model and maintain pointing. At 400
km, these uploads were required once every other week. At $\sim$270 km, they were required every
day. We also characterized the power performance of our electric power system, which includes a
novel pseudo-peak power tracker -- a resistor that limited the current draw from the battery on the
solar panels. With 19 30\% efficient solar cells and an 8 W system load, the power balance had 65\%
of margin on orbit. We present several recommendations to other CubeSat programs throughout.
