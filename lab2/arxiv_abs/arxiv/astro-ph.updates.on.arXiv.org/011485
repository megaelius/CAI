Supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds are ideal laboratories to study the acceleration
of particles at shock waves and their transport and interactions in the surrounding interstellar
medium. In this paper, we focus on the supernova remnant W28, which over the years has been observed
in all energy domains from radio waves to very-high-energy gamma rays. The bright gamma-ray emission
detected from molecular clouds located in its vicinity revealed the presence of accelerated GeV
and TeV particles in the region. An enhanced ionization rate has also been measured by means of millimetre
observations, but such observations alone cannot tell us whether the enhancement is due to low energy
(MeV) cosmic rays (either protons or electrons) or the X-ray photons emitted by the shocked gas.
The goal of this study is to determine the origin of the enhanced ionization rate and to infer from
multiwavelength observations the spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated at the supernova remnant
shock in the unprecedented range spanning from MeV to multi-TeV particle energies. We developed
a model to describe the transport of X-ray photons into the molecular cloud, and we fitted the radio,
millimeter, and gamma-ray data to derive the spectrum of the radiating particles. The contribution
from X-ray photons to the enhanced ionization rate is negligible, and therefore the ionization
must be due to cosmic rays. Even though we cannot exclude a contribution to the ionization rate coming
from cosmic ray electrons, we show that a scenario where cosmic ray protons explain both the gamma-ray
flux and the enhanced ionization rate provides the most natural fit to multiwavelength data. This
strongly suggests that the intensity of CR protons is enhanced in the region for particle energies
in a very broad range covering almost 6 orders of magnitude: from $\lesssim 100$ MeV up to several
tens of TeV.
