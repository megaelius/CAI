During reionization, neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) imprints a damping wing
absorption feature on the spectrum of high-redshift quasars. A detection of this signature provides
compelling evidence for a significantly neutral Universe, and enables measurements of the hydrogen
neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}(z)$ at that epoch. Obtaining reliable quantitative constraints
from this technique, however, is challenging due to stochasticity induced by the patchy inside-out
topology of reionization, degeneracies with quasar lifetime, and the unknown unabsorbed quasar
spectrum close to rest-frame Ly$\alpha$. We combine a large-volume semi-numerical simulation
of reionization topology with 1D radiative transfer through high-resolution hydrodynamical
simulations of the high-redshift Universe to construct models of quasar transmission spectra
during reionization. Our state-of-the-art approach captures the distribution of damping wing
strengths in biased quasar halos that should have reionized earlier, as well as the erosion of neutral
gas in the quasar environment caused by its own ionizing radiation. Combining this detailed model
with our new technique for predicting the quasar continuum and its associated uncertainty, we introduce
a Bayesian statistical method to jointly constrain the neutral fraction of the Universe and the
quasar lifetime from individual quasar spectra. We apply this methodology to the spectra of the
two highest redshift quasars known, ULAS J1120+0641 and ULAS J1342+0928, and measured volume-averaged
neutral fractions $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle(z=7.09)=0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.26}$ and $\langle
x_{\rm HI} \rangle(z=7.54)=0.60^{+0.20}_{-0.23}$ (posterior medians and 68% credible intervals)
when marginalized over quasar lifetimes of $10^3 \leq t_{\rm q} \leq 10^8$ years.
