The group of thermally emitting isolated neutron stars (INSs) known as the ``Magnificent Seven''
(M7) is unique among the various neutron star populations. Crustal heating by means of magnetic
field decay and an evolutionary link with magnetars may explain why these objects rotate slower
and have higher thermal luminosities and magnetic field intensities than standard pulsars of similar
age. The third brightest INS, RX J1605.3+3249, is the only object amidst the seven still lacking
a detected periodicity. We observed the source with the XMM-Newton Observatory for 60 ks aiming
at unveiling the neutron star rotation rate and investigating its spectrum in detail. A periodic
signal at P=3.387864(16) s, likely the neutron star spin period, is detected at the 4-sigma confidence
level. The coherent combination of the new data with a past XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observation of the
source constrains the pulsar spin-down rate at the 2-sigma confidence level, implying a dipolar
magnetic field of B~7.4e13 G. If confirmed, RX J1605.3+3249 would be the neutron star with the highest
dipolar field amongst the M7. The spectrum of the source shows evidence for a cool blackbody component,
as well as for the presence of two broad absorption features. Furthermore, high-resolution spectroscopy
with the RGS cameras confirms the presence of the narrow absorption feature at energy 0.57 keV in
the co-added spectrum of the source, also seen in other thermally emitting isolated neutron stars.
Phase-resolved spectroscopy, as well as a dedicated observing campaign aimed at determining a
timing solution, will give invaluable constraints on the neutron star geometry and will allow one
to confirm the high value of spin down, which would place the source closer to a magnetar than any other
M7 INS.
