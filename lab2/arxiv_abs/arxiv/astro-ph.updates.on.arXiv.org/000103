If gravity is an emergent phenomenon, as suggested by several recent results, then the structure
of the action principle for gravity should encode this fact. With this motivation we study several
features of the Einstein-Hilbert action and establish direct connections with horizon thermodynamics.
We begin by introducing the concept of holographically conjugate variables (HCVs) in terms of which
the surface term in the action has a specific relationship with the bulk term. In addition to g_{ab}
and its conjugate momentum \sqrt{-g} M^{cab}, this procedure allows us to (re)discover and motivate
strongly the use of f^{ab}=\sqrt{-g}g^{ab} and its conjugate momentum N^c_{ab}. The gravitational
action can then be interpreted as a momentum space action for these variables. We also show that many
expressions in classical gravity simplify considerably in this approach. For example, the field
equations can be written in a form analogous to Hamilton's equations for a suitable Hamiltonian
if we use these variables. More importantly, the variation of the surface term, evaluated on any
null surface which acts a local Rindler horizon can be given a direct thermodynamic interpretation.
The term involving the variation of the dynamical variable leads to T\delta S while the term involving
the variation of the conjugate momentum leads to S\delta T. We have found this correspondence only
for the choice of variables (g_{ab}, \sqrt{-g} M^{cab}) or (f^{ab}, N^c_{ab}). We use this result
to provide a direct thermodynamical interpretation of the boundary condition in the action principle,
when it is formulated in a spacetime region bounded by the null surfaces. We analyse these features
from several different perspectives and provide a detailed description, which offers insights
about the nature of classical gravity and emergent paradigm.
