Using deep narrow-band (NB) imaging and optical spectroscopy from the Keck telescope and MMT, we
identify a sample of 20 emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at z=0.065-0.90 where the weak auroral emission
line, [OIII]4363, is detected at >3\sigma. These detections allow us to determine the gas-phase
metallicity using the "direct'' method. With electron temperature measurements and dust attenuation
corrections from Balmer decrements, we find that 4 of these low-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor
with 12+log(O/H) <= 7.65 or one-tenth solar. Our most metal-deficient galaxy has 12+log(O/H)
= 7.24^{+0.45}_{-0.30} (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowest metallicity galaxies identified
in the local universe. We find that our galaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with
average specific star formation rate (SFR) of (100 Myr)^{-1}, and that they have high central SFR
surface densities (average of 0.5 Msun/yr/kpc^2. In addition, more than two-thirds of our galaxies
have between one and four nearby companions within a projected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is
an excess among star-forming galaxies at z=0.4-0.85. We also find that the gas-phase metallicities
for a given stellar mass and SFR lie systematically below the local M-Z-(SFR) relation by \approx0.2
dex (2\sigma\ significance). These results are partly due to selection effects, since galaxies
with strong star formation and low metallicity are more likely to yield [OIII]4363 detections.
Finally, the observed higher ionization parameter and electron density suggest that they are lower
redshift analogs to typical z>1 galaxies.
