Several B-type main-sequence stars show chemical peculiarities. A particularly striking class
are the $^3$He stars exhibiting a remarkable enrichment of $^3$He with respect to $^4$He. This isotopic
anomaly has also been found in blue horizontal branch (BHB) and subdwarf B (sdB) stars, which are
helium-core burning stars of the extreme horizontal branch. Using a hybrid local/non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE/NLTE) approach for B-type stars, we analyzed high-quality spectra of two $^3$He
BHBs and nine $^3$He sdBs to determine their isotopic abundances. We redetermined their atmospheric
parameters and analyzed selected neutral helium lines, including $\lambda$4922 $\mathring{A}$
and $\lambda$6678 $\mathring{A}$, being very sensitive to the $^4$He/$^3$He abundance ratio.
Most of the $^3$He sdBs cluster in a small temperature strip between 26000 K and 30000 K, being helium-deficient.
BD+48$^\circ$ 2721 had to be reclassified as a BHB star because of its low temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}=$
20700 K). About 60 per cent of the analyzed $^3$He stars show $^4$He/$^3$He$<$ 0.25, whereas the
rest shows ratios up to $^4$He/$^3$He$=$ 3.09. We classify the former as pure $^3$He (p3He) and the
latter as $^3$He enriched (e3He) stars. A search for $^3$He stars in the ESO SPY survey led to the discovery
of two new e3He sdB stars. The observed helium line profiles of all BHBs and of three sdBs were not matched
by chemically homogeneous atmospheres, but hint at vertical helium stratification. This phenomenon
has been seen in other peculiar B-type stars, but is found for the first time for sdBs. We estimate
helium to increase from the outer to the inner atmosphere by factors ranging from 1.4 (SB 290) up to
8.0 (BD+48$^\circ$ 2721).
