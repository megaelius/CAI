Recent observations of ultra-hot Jupiters with dayside temperatures in excess of $2500~\mathrm{K}$
have found evidence for new physical processes at play in their atmospheres. In this work, we investigate
the effects of the dissociation of molecular hydrogen and recombination of atomic hydrogen on the
atmospheric circulation of ultra-hot Jupiters. To do so, we incorporate these effects into a general
circulation model (GCM) for hot Jupiter atmospheres, and run a large suite of models varying the
incident stellar flux, rotation period, and strength of frictional drag. We find that including
hydrogen dissociation and recombination reduces the fractional day-to-night temperature contrast
of ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres and causes the speed of the equatorial jet to decrease in simulations
with fixed rotation. This is because the large energy input required for hydrogen dissociation
cools the dayside of the planet, and the energy released due to hydrogen recombination warms the
nightside. The resulting decrease in the day-to-night temperature contrast reduces the day-to-night
pressure gradient that drives the circulation, resulting in weaker wind speeds. The results from
our GCM experiments qualitatively agree with previous theory which found that the fractional day-night
temperature contrast of ultra-hot Jupiters should decrease with increasing equilibrium temperature
due to hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Lastly, we compute full-phase light curves from
our suite of GCM experiments, finding that the reduced day-to-night temperature contrast in ultra-hot
Jupiter atmospheres causes a smaller phase curve amplitude. The reduction in phase curve amplitude
due to hydrogen dissociation and recombination could explain the relatively small phase curve
amplitudes of observed ultra-hot Jupiters.
