Telescopes to be launched over the next decade-and-a-half, such as JWST, EUCLID, ATHENA and Lynx,
promise to revolutionise the study of the high redshift Universe and greatly advance our understanding
of the early stages of galaxy formation. We use a model that follows the evolution of the masses and
spins of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to make
predictions for the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) luminosity function at $z\geq7$ in the broadband
filters of JWST and EUCLID at near-infrared wavelengths, and ATHENA and Lynx at X-ray energies.
The predictions of our model are relatively insensitive to the choice of seed black hole mass, except
at the lowest luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{bol}}<10^{43}\mathrm{ergs^{-1}}$) and the highest
redshifts ($z>10$). We predict that surveys with these different telescopes will select somewhat
different samples of SMBHs, with EUCLID unveiling the most massive, highest accretion rate SMBHs,
Lynx the least massive, lowest accretion rate SMBHs, and JWST and ATHENA covering objects inbetween.
At $z=7$, we predict that typical detectable SMBHs will have masses, $M_{\mathrm{BH}}\sim10^{5-8}M_{\odot}$,
and Eddington normalised mass accretion rates, $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}\sim0.6-2$.
The SMBHs will be hosted by galaxies of stellar mass $M_{\star}\sim10^{8-10}M_{\odot}$, and dark
matter haloes of mass $M_{\mathrm{halo}}\sim10^{11-12}M_{\odot}$. We predict that the detectable
SMBHs at $z=10$ will have slightly smaller black holes, accreting at slightly higher Eddington
normalised mass accretion rates, in slightly lower mass host galaxies compared to those at $z=7$,
and reside in haloes of mass $M_{\mathrm{halo}}\sim10^{10-11}M_{\odot}$.
