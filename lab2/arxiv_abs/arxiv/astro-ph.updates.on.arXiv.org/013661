Massive and very massive stars can play important roles in stellar populations by ejecting strong
stellar winds and exploding in energetic phenomena. It is therefore of high importance that their
behaviour is properly accounted for in synthetic model populations. Here we present nine grids
of stellar evolutionary model sequences, together with finely resolved interpolated sequences
and synthetic populations, of stars with 9-500 Msun and with metallicities ranging from Solar down
to 1/250 Solar. The stellar models were computed with the 'Bonn' evolutionary code (covering core-hydrogen-
and core-helium-burning phases, both complete). Post-processing for publication has been done
using optimized methods, developed by our team, for massive and very massive stars. Interpolation
and population synthesis were also performed on the models by our newly developed routine synStars.
Eight of the grids represent slowly rotating massive stars with normal/classical evolution, while
one grid represents fast rotating, chemically-homogeneously evolving models. Apart from the
common stellar parameters such as mass, radius, surface temperature, luminosity and mass loss
rate, we present stellar wind properties such as estimated wind velocity and kinetic energy of the
wind. Additionally, we provide complete chemical yields of 34 isotopes, and estimates for the masses
of the compact object remnants. The 'Bonn' Optimized Stellar Tracks (BoOST) project is published
as simple tables - including stellar models, interpolated tracks and synthetic populations - thus
ideal for further scientific applications. For example, star-formation studies could be done
with BoOST to cover broad metallicity ranges, and so could be simulations of high-redshift galaxies.
Additionally, gravitational-wave event rate predictions could be refined using BoOST by accounting
for very massive stars at low-metallicity.
