We study the propagation and dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a set of numerical models
that each include a solar--like stratified atmosphere and a magnetic field with a null point. All
simulations have the same magnetic field configuration but different transition region heights.
Compressive wave packets introduced in the photospheric portion of the simulations refract towards
the null and collapse it into a current sheet, which then undergoes reconnection. The collapsed
null forms a current sheet due to a strong magnetic pressure gradient caused by the inability of magnetic
perturbations to cross the null. Although the null current sheet undergoes multiple reconnection
episodes due to repeated reflections off the lower boundary, we find no evidence of oscillatory
reconnection arising from the dynamics of the null itself. Wave mode conversion around the null
generates a series of slow mode shocks localized near each separatrix. The shock strength is asymmetric
across each separatrix, and subsequent shock damping therefore creates a tangential discontinuity
across each separatrix, with long--lived current densities. A parameter study of the injected
wave energy to reach the null confirms our previous WKB estimates. Finally, using current estimates
of the photospheric acoustic power, we estimate that the shock and Ohmic heating we describe may
account for $\approx1-10\%$ of the radiative losses from coronal bright points with similar topologies,
and are similarly insufficient to account for losses from larger structures such as ephemeral regions.
At the same time, the dynamics are comparable to proposed mechanisms for generating type--II spicules.
