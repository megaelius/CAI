Alignment of dust grains in astrophysical environments results in the polarization of starlight
as well as the polarization of radiation emitted by dust. We demonstrate the advances in grain alignment
theory allow the use of linear and circular polarization to probe not only the magnetic field, but
also dust composition, the dust environment, etc. We revisit the process of grain alignment by Radiative
Torques (RATs) and focus on constraining magnetic susceptibility of grains via observations.
We discuss the possibility of observational testing of the magnetic properties of grains as the
alignment changes from being in respect to the magnetic field to being in respect to the radiation
direction. This opens both a possibility of constraining the uncertain parameters of the RATs theory
and provides a new way of measuring magnetic fields in interstellar medium and circumstellar regions.
We provide a detailed discussion of the precession induced both by the magnetic field and the anisotropic
radiation and revisit a number of key processes related to magnetic response of the grains. We consider
various effects that increase the rate of magnetic relaxation both in silicate and carbonaceous
grains. In particular, we find a new relaxation process related to the change of the amplitude of
internal magnetization within a wobbling triaxial grain and identify a range of grain sizes in which
this effect can dominate the internal alignment of angular momentum within grain axes. We show that
these relaxation processes significantly change the dynamics of grains in the presence of RATs.
We apply our analysis for observed grain alignment in special environments to put constraints on
the enhanced magnetic properties of dust grains in the cloud near supernovae, in cometary coma,
and protoplanetary disks.
