The Yarkovsky effect is a thermal process acting upon the orbits of small celestial bodies, which
can cause these orbits to slowly expand or contract with time. The effect is subtle -- typical drift
rates lie near $10^{-4}$ au/My for a $\sim$1 km diameter object -- and is thus generally difficult
to measure. However, objects with long observation intervals, as well as objects with radar detections,
serve as excellent candidates for the observation of this effect. We analyzed both optical and radar
astrometry for all numbered Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), as well as several un-numbered NEAs,
for the purpose of detecting and quantifying the Yarkovsky effect. We present 159 objects with measured
drift rates. Our Yarkovsky sample is the largest published set of such detections, and presents
an opportunity to examine the physical properties of these NEAs and the Yarkovsky effect in a statistical
manner. In particular, we confirm the Yarkovsky effect's theoretical size dependence of 1/$D$,
where $D$ is diameter. We also examine the efficiency with which this effect acts on our sample objects
and find typical efficiencies of around 12%. We interpret this efficiency with respect to the typical
spin and thermal properties of objects in our sample. We report the ratio of negative to positive
drift rates in our sample as $N_R/N_P = 2.9 \pm 0.7$ and interpret this ratio in terms of retrograde/prograde
rotators and main belt escape routes. The observed ratio has a probability of 1 in 46 million of occurring
by chance, which confirms the presence of a non-gravitational influence. We examine how the presence
of radar data affects the strength and precision of our detections. We find that, on average, the
precision of radar+optical detections improves by a factor of approximately 1.6 for each additional
apparition with ranging data compared to that of optical-only solutions.
