[Abridged] We present UV/optical observations of PS16aqv (SN 2016ard), a Type I superluminous
supernova (SLSN-I) classified as part of our search for low-$z$ SLSNe. PS16aqv is a fast evolving
SLSNe-I that reached a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{r} \approx -22.1$. The lightcurves exhibit
a significant undulation at 30 rest-frame days after peak, with a behavior similar to undulations
seen in the slowly fading SLSN-I SN 2015bn. This similarity strengthens the case that fast and slow
SLSNe-I form a continuum with a common origin. At $\approx\!80$ days after peak, the lightcurves
exhibit a transition to a slow decline, followed by significant subsequent steepening, indicative
of a plateau phase or a second significant undulation. Deep limits at $\approx280$ days after peak
imply a tight constraint on the nickel mass, $M_{\rm Ni} \lesssim 0.35$ M$_{\odot}$ (lower than
for previous SLSNe-I), and indicate that some SLSNe-I do not produce significantly more nickel
than normal Type Ic SNe. Using MOSFiT, we model the lightcurve with a magnetar central engine model
and find $P_{\rm spin} \approx 0.9$ ms, $B \approx 1.5 \times 10^{14}$ G, and $M_{\rm ej} \approx
16$ M$_{\odot}$. The implied rapid spin-down time and large reservoir of available energy coupled
with the high ejecta mass may account for the fast evolving lightcurve and slow spectroscopic evolution.
We also study the location of PS16aqv in its host galaxy and find that it occurred at an offset of $2.46
\pm 0.21$ kpc from the central star-forming region. We find the host galaxy exhibits low metallicity
and spatially varying extinction and star formation rate, with the explosion site exhibiting lower
values than the central region. The complexity seen in the lightcurves of PS16aqv and other events
highlights the importance of obtaining well-sampled lightcurves for exploring deviations from
a uniform decline.
