Cosmic ray pressure gradients transfer energy and momentum to extraplanar gas in disk galaxies,
potentially driving significant mass loss as galactic winds. This may be particularly important
for launching high-velocity outflows of "cool" (T < 10^4 K) gas. We study cosmic-ray driven disk
winds using a simplified semi-analytic model assuming streamlines follow the large-scale gravitational
potential gradient. We consider scaled Milky Way-like potentials including a disk, bulge, and
halo with a range of halo velocities V_H = 50-300 km/s, and streamline footpoints with radii in the
disk R_0=1-16 kpc at height 1 kpc. Our solutions cover a wide range of footpoint gas velocity u_0,
magnetic-to-cosmic-ray pressure ratio, gas-to-cosmic-ray pressure ratio, and angular momentum.
Cosmic ray streaming at the Alfv\'en speed enables the effective sound speed C_eff to increase from
the footpoint to a critical point where C_eff,c = u_c ~ V_H; this differs from thermal winds in which
C_eff decreases outward. The critical point is typically at a height of 1-6 kpc from the disk, increasing
with V_H, and the asymptotic wind velocity exceeds the escape speed of the halo. Mass loss rates are
insensitive to the footpoint values of the magnetic field and angular momentum. In addition to numerical
parameter space exploration, we develop and compare to analytic scaling relations. We show that
winds have mass loss rates per unit area up to ~ Pi_0 V_H^-5/3 u_0^2/3 where Pi_0 is the footpoint cosmic
ray pressure and u_0 is set by the upwelling of galactic fountains. The predicted wind mass-loss
rate exceeds the star formation rate for V_H < 200 km/s and u_0 = 50 km/s, a typical fountain velocity.
