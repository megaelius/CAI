The internal structures and properties of oscillating red-giant stars can be accurately inferred
through their global oscillation modes (asteroseismology). Based on 1460 days of Kepler observations
we perform a thorough asteroseismic study to probe the stellar parameters and evolutionary stages
of three red giants in eclipsing binary systems. We present the first detailed analysis of individual
oscillation modes of the red-giant components of KIC 8410637, KIC5640750 and KIC9540226. We obtain
estimates of their asteroseismic masses, radii, mean densities and logarithmic surface gravities
by using the asteroseismic scaling relations as well as grid-based modelling. As these red giants
are in double-lined eclipsing binaries, it is possible to derive their independent dynamical masses
and radii from the orbital solution and compare it with the seismically inferred values. For KIC
5640750 we compute the first spectroscopic orbit based on both components of this system. We use
high-resolution spectroscopic data and light curves of the three systems to determine up-to-date
values of the dynamical stellar parameters. With our comprehensive set of stellar parameters we
explore consistencies between binary analysis and asteroseismic methods, and test the reliability
of the well-known scaling relations. For the three red giants under study, we find agreement between
dynamical and asteroseismic stellar parameters in cases where the asteroseismic methods account
for metallicity, temperature and mass dependence as well as surface effects. We are able to attain
agreement from the scaling laws in all three systems if we use $\Delta\nu_{\rm ref,emp} = 130.8 \pm
0.9\,\mu$Hz instead of the usual solar reference value.
