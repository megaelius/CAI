Context. Modern high resolution observations allow to view closer into the objects powering relativistic
jets. This is especially the case for SS433, an X-ray binary from which a precessing jet is observed
down to the sub-parsec scale. Aims. We want to study full 3D dynamics of relativistic jets associated
with AGN or XRB. We study the precessing motion of a jet as a model for the jet associated with the XRB
SS433. Our study of the jet dynamics in this system focuses on the sub-parsec scales. We investigate
the impact of jet precession and the variation of the Lorentz factor of the injected matter on the
general 3D jet dynamics and its energy transfer to the surrounding medium. We realize synthetic
radio mapping of the data, to compare our results with observations. Methods. For our study we use
the code MPI-AMRVAC with SRHD model of a baryonic jet. We use a AMR scheme and an inner time-dependent
boundary prescription to inject the jets. Parameters extracted from observations were used. 3D
jet realizations that match the SS433 jet are intercompared. We track the energy content, as deposited
in different regions of the domain affected by the jet. Our code also follows a population of particles
injected with the jet. This evolving energy spectrum of accelerated electrons, allows to obtain
the radio emission from our simulation. Results. we obtain meaningful observations. We find increased
energy transfer for a precessing jet compared to a standing jets. We obtain synthetic radio maps
for all jets. Conclusions. The synthetic radio map matches best for a model using the canonical kinematic
model. Overdense precessing jets experience significant deceleration in their propagation through
the ISM, and while the overall jet is of helical shape. This argument show that the kinematic model
for SS433 assuming ballistic propagation has to be corrected for this decelretaion.
