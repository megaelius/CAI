High resolution spectroscopy, providing constraints on plasma motions and temperatures, is a
powerful means to investigate the structure of accretion streams in CTTS. In particular, the accretion
shock region, where the accreting material is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its
inward bulk motion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first time the
motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a Doppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS
observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This test should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component
in CTTS, and constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in the X-ray
emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the position of a selected sample of
emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW Hya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity
to vary. We found that the plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with
respect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this X-ray-emitting
material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the accretion stream, and not in coronal
structures. The comparison of the observed velocity along the line of sight, 38.3+/-5.1 km/s, with
the inferred intrinsic velocity of the post shock of TW Hya, v_post~110-120 km/s, indicates that
the footpoints of the accretion streams on TW Hya are located at low latitudes on the stellar surface.
Our results indicate that complex magnetic field geometries, such as that of TW Hya, permit low-latitude
accretion spots. Moreover, since on TW Hya the redshift of the soft X-ray emission is very similar
to that of the narrow component of the CIV resonance doublet at 1550 Ang, as found by Ardila et al. (2013),
then the plasma at 2-4 MK and that at 0.1 MK likely originate in the same post-shock regions.
