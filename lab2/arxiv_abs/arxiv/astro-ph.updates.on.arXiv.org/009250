We explore the probable chemical signature of planet formation in the remarkable binary system
HD 106515. The A star hosts a massive long-period planet with 9 MJup detected by radial velocity.
We also refine stellar and planetary parameters by using non-solar-scaled opacities when modeling
the stars. Methods. We carried out a simultaneous determination of stellar parameters and abundances,
by applying for the first time non-solar-scaled opacities in this binary system, in order to reach
the highest possible precision. Results. The stars A and B in the binary system HD 106515 do not seem
to be depleted in refractory elements, which is different when comparing the Sun with solar-twins.
Then, the terrestrial planet formation would have been less efficient in the stars of this binary
system. Together with HD 80606/7, this is the second binary system which does not seem to present
a (terrestrial) signature of planet formation, and hosting both systems an eccentric giant planet.
This is in agreement with numerical simulations, where the early dynamical evolution of eccentric
giant planets clear out most of the possible terrestrial planets in the inner zone. We refined the
stellar mass, radius and age for both stars and found a notable difference of 78% in R compared to previous
works. We also refined the planet mass to mp sini = 9.08 +/- 0.20 MJup, which differs by 6% compared
with literature. In addition, we showed that the non-solar-scaled solution is not compatible with
the classical solar-scaled method, and some abundance differences are comparable to NLTE or GCE
effects specially when using the Sun as reference. Then, we encourage the use of non-solar-scaled
opacities in high-precision studies such as the detection of Tc trends.[abridged]
