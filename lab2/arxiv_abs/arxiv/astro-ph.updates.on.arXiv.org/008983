We study how the use of several stellar subtraction methods and line fitting approaches can affect
the derivation of the main kinematic parameters (velocity and velocity dispersion fields) of the
ionized gas component. The target of this work is the nearby galaxy NGC 2906, observed with the MUSE
instrument at Very Large Telescope. A sample of twelve spectra is selected from the inner (nucleus)
and outer (spiral arms) regions, characterized by different ionization mechanisms. We compare
three different methods to subtract the stellar continuum (FIT3D, STARLIGHT and pPXF), combined
with one of the following stellar libraries: MILES, STELIB and GRANADA+MILES. The choice of the
stellar subtraction method is the most important ingredient affecting the derivation of the gas
kinematics, followed by the choice of the stellar library and by the line fitting approach. In our
data, typical uncertainties in the observed wavelength and width of the H\alpha and [NII] lines
are of the order of <\delta\lambda>_rms \sim 0.1\AA\ and <\delta\sigma>_rms \sim 0.2\AA\ (\sim
5 and 10km/s, respectively). The results obtained from the [NII] line seem to be slightly more robust,
as it is less affected by stellar absorption than H\alpha. All methods considered yield statistically
consistent measurements once a mean systemic contribution \Delta\bar\lambda=\Delta\bar\sigma=0.2xDelta_{MUSE}
is added in quadrature to the line fitting errors, where \Delta_{MUSE} = 1.1\AA\ \sim 50 km/s denotes
the instrumental resolution of the MUSE spectra. Although the subtraction of the stellar continuum
is critical in order to recover line fluxes, any method (including none) can be used in order to measure
the gas kinematics, as long as an additional component of 0.2 x Delta_MUSE is added to the error budget.
