We use EAGLE to quantify the effect galaxy mergers have on the stellar specific angular momentum
of galaxies, $j_{\rm stars}$. We split mergers into: dry (gas-poor)/wet (gas-rich), major/minor,
and different spin alignments and orbital parameters. Wet (dry) mergers have an average neutral
gas-to-stellar mass ratio of $1.1$ ($0.02$), while major (minor) mergers are those with stellar
mass ratios $\ge 0.3$ ($0.1-0.3$). We correlate the positions of galaxies in the $j_{\rm stars}$-stellar
mass plane at $z=0$ with their merger history, and find that galaxies of low spins suffered dry mergers,
while galaxies of normal/high spins suffered predominantly wet mergers, if any. The radial $j_{\rm
stars}$ profiles of galaxies that went through dry mergers are deficient by $\approx 0.3$~dex at
$r\lesssim 10\,r_{50}$ (with $r_{50}$ being the half-stellar mass radius), compared to galaxies
that went through wet mergers. Studying the merger remnants reveals that dry mergers reduce $j_{\rm
stars}$ by $\approx 30$\%, while wet mergers increase it by $\approx 10$\%, on average. The latter
is connected to the build-up of the bulge by newly formed stars of high rotational speed. Moving from
minor to major mergers accentuates these effects. When the spin vectors of the galaxies prior to
the dry merger are misaligned, $j_{\rm stars}$ decreases to a greater magnitude, while in wet mergers
co-rotation and high orbital angular momentum efficiently spun-up galaxies. We predict what would
be the observational signatures in the $j_{\rm stars}$ profiles driven by dry mergers: (i) shallow
radial profiles and (ii) profiles that rise beyond $\approx 10\,r_{50}$, both of which are significantly
different from spiral galaxies.
