The thermal evolution of young neutron stars (NSs) reflects the neutrino emission properties of
their cores. Heinke et al. (2010) measured a 3.6+/-0.6% decay in the surface temperature of the Cassiopeia
A (Cas A) NS between 2000 and 2009, using archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-S
detector in Graded mode. Page et al. (2011) and Shternin et al. (2011) attributed this decay to enhanced
neutrino emission from a superfluid neutron transition in the core. Here we test this decline, combining
analysis of the Cas A NS using all Chandra X-ray detectors and modes (HRC-S, HRC-I, ACIS-I, ACIS-S
in Faint mode, and ACIS-S in Graded mode) and adding a 2012 May ACIS-S Graded mode observation, using
the most current calibrations (CALDB 4.5.5.1). We measure the temperature changes from each detector
separately and test for systematic effects due to the nearby filaments of the supernova remnant.
We find a 0.92%-2.0% decay over 10 years in the effective temperature, inferred from HRC-S data,
depending on the choice of source and background extraction regions, with a best-fit decay of 1.0+/-0.7%.
In comparison, the ACIS-S Graded data indicate a temperature decay of 3.1%-5.0% over 10 years, with
a best-fit decay of 3.5+/-0.4%. Shallower observations using the other detectors yield temperature
decays of 2.6+/-1.9% (ACIS-I), 2.1+/-1.0% (HRC-I), and 2.1+/-1.9% (ACIS-S Faint mode) over 10
years. Our best estimate indicates a decline of 2.9+/-0.9 (stat) +1.6/-0.3 (sys) % over 10 years.
The complexity of the bright and varying supernova remnant background makes a definitive interpretation
of archival Cas A Chandra observations difficult. A temperature decline of 1-3.5% over 10 years
would indicate extraordinarily fast cooling of the NS that can be regulated by superfluidity of
nucleons in the stellar core.
