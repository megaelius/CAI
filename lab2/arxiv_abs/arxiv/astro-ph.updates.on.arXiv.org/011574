Gravitational-wave detections are now starting to probe the mass distribution of stellar-mass
black holes (BHs). Robust predictions from stellar models are needed to interpret these. Theory
predicts the existence of a gap in the BH mass distribution because of pair-instability supernova.
The maximum BH mass below the gap is the result of pulsational mass loss. We evolve massive helium
stars through their late hydrodynamical phases of evolution using the open-source MESA stellar
evolution code. We find that the location of the lower edge of the mass gap at 45$M_\odot$ is remarkably
robust against variations in the metallicity ($\approx 3M_\odot$), the treatment of internal
mixing ($\approx 1M_\odot$), stellar wind mass loss ($\approx 4M_\odot$), making it the most robust
predictions for the final stages of massive star evolution. The reason is that the onset of the instability
is dictated by the near-final core mass, which in turn sets the resulting BH mass. However, varying
$^{12}C\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}O$ reaction rate within its $1\sigma$ uncertainties
shifts the location of the gap between $40M_\odot$ and $56M_\odot$. We provide updated analytic
fits for population synthesis simulations. Our results imply that the detection of merging BHs
can provide constraints on nuclear astrophysics. Furthermore, the robustness against metallicity
suggests that there is a universal maximum for the location of the lower edge of the gap, which is insensitive
to the formation environment and redshift for first-generation BHs. This is promising for the possibility
to use the location of the gap as a "standard siren" across the Universe.
