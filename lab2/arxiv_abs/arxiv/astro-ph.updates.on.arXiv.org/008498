We study projected underdensities in the cosmic galaxy density field known as 'troughs', and their
overdense counterparts, which we call 'ridges'. We identify these regions using a bright sample
of foreground galaxies from the photometric Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), specifically selected
to mimic the spectroscopic Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey (GAMA). Using background galaxies from
KiDS, we measure the weak gravitational lensing profiles of the troughs/ridges. We quantify the
amplitude of their lensing strength $A$ as a function of galaxy density percentile rank $P$ and galaxy
overdensity $\delta$, and find that the skewness in the galaxy density distribution is reflected
in the total mass distribution measured by weak lensing. We interpret our results using the mock
galaxy catalogue from the Marenostrum Institut de Ci\`encies de l'Espai (MICE) simulation, and
find a good agreement with our observations. Using signal-to-noise weights derived from the Scinet
LIghtCone Simulations (SLICS) mock catalogue we optimally stack the lensing signal of KiDS troughs
with an angular radius $\theta_A$ = {5,10,15,20} arcmin, resulting in {16.8,14.9,10.13,7.55}
$\sigma$ detections. Finally, we select troughs using a volume-limited sample of galaxies, split
into two redshift bins between 0.1 < z < 0.3. For troughs/ridges with transverse comoving radius
$R_A$ = 1.9 Mpc/h, we find no significant difference in the comoving Excess Surface Density as a function
of $P$ and $\delta$ between the low- and high-redshift sample. Using the MICE and SLICS mocks we predict
that trough and ridge evolution could be detected with gravitational lensing using deeper and wider
lensing surveys, such as those from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and Euclid.
