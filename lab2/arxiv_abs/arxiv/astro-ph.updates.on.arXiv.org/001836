A significant fraction ($\sim 30$ %) of the gamma-ray sources listed in the second $\textit{Fermi}$
LAT (2FGL) catalog is still of unknown origin, being not yet associated with counterparts at lower
energies. Using the available information at lower energies and optical spectroscopy on the selected
counterparts of these gamma-ray objects we can pinpoint their exact nature. Here we present a pilot
project pointing to assess the effectiveness of the several classification methods developed
to select gamma-ray blazar candidates. To this end, we report optical spectroscopic observations
of a sample of 5 gamma-ray blazar candidates selected on the basis of their infrared WISE colors or
of their low-frequency radio properties. Blazars come in two main classes: BL Lacs and FSRQs, showing
similar optical spectra except for the stronger emission lines of the latter. For three of our sources
the almost featureless optical spectra obtained confirm their BL Lac nature, while for the source
WISEJ022051.24+250927.6 we observe emission lines with equivalent width $EW\sim 31$ $\AA$, identifying
it as a FSRQ with $z = 0.48$. The source WISEJ064459.38+603131.7, although not featuring a clear
radio counterpart, shows a blazar-like spectrum with weak emission lines with $EW \sim 7$ $\AA$,
yielding a redshift estimate of $z=0.36$. In addition we report optical spectroscopic observations
of 4 WISE sources associated with known gamma-ray blazars without a firm classification or redshift
estimate. For all of these latter sources we confirm a BL Lac classification, with a tentative redshift
estimate for the source WISEJ100800.81+062121.2 of $z = 0.65$.
