We present direct spectroscopic modeling of 44 Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) using the spectral
synthesis code SYNAPPS. We confirm detections of helium emission in the early-time spectra of two
SNe Iax: SNe 2004cs and 2007J. These He I features are better fit by a pure-emission Gaussian than
by a P-Cygni profile, indicating that the helium emission originates from the circumstellar environment
rather than the SN ejecta. Based on the spectral modeling of the remaining 42 SNe Iax with early-time
spectra, we find no obvious helium features in other SN Iax spectra. However, $\approx 68\%$ of our
sample lack sufficiently deep luminosity limits to detect helium emission with a luminosity of
that seen in SNe 2004cs and 2007J. Using the objects with constraining luminosity limits, we calculate
that 25% of SNe Iax have detectable helium in their spectra. We examine 11 SNe Iax with late-time spectra
and find no hydrogen or helium emission from swept up material. For late-time spectra, we calculate
typical upper limits of stripped hydrogen and helium to be $2 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $10^{-2}$
M$_{\odot}$, respectively. While detections of helium in SNe Iax support a white dwarf-He star
binary progenitor system (i.e., a single-degenerate [SD] channel), non-detections may be explained
by variations in SNe Iax such as explosion asymmetry, smaller amounts of stripped He-rich material,
or the fraction of helium in an excited state. The lack of helium in the majority of our sample demonstrates
the complexity of SN Iax progenitor systems and the need for further modeling. With strong independent
evidence indicating that SNe Iax arise from a SD progenitor channel, we caution the common interpretation
that the lack of helium or hydrogen emission at late-time in SN Ia spectra rules out SD progenitor
scenarios for this class.
