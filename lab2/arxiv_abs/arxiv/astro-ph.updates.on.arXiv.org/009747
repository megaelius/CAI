Continuum spectrum emitted by the accretion disk around quasars hold a wealth of information regarding
the strong gravitational field produced by the massive central object. Such strong gravity regime
is often expected to exhibit deviations from general relativity (GR) which may manifest through
the presence of extra dimensions. Higher dimensions, which serve as the corner stone for string
theory and M-theory can act as promising alternatives to dark matter and dark energy with interesting
implications in inflationary cosmology, gravitational waves and collider physics. Therefore
it is instructive to investigate the effect of more than four spacetime dimensions on the black hole
continuum spectrum which provide an effective astrophysical probe to the strong gravity regime.
To explore such a scenario, we compute the optical luminosity emitted by a thin accretion disk around
a rotating supermassive black hole albeit in the presence of extra dimensions. The background metric
resembles the Kerr-Newman spacetime in GR where the tidal charge parameter inherited from extra
dimensions can also assume negative signature. The theoretical luminosity computed in such a background
is contrasted with optical observations of eighty quasars. The difference between the theoretical
and observed luminosity for these quasars is used to infer the most favoured choice of the rotation
parameter for each quasar and the tidal charge parameter. This has been achieved by minimizing/maximizing
several error estimators, e.g., chi-squared, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement
etc. Intriguingly, all of them favour a negative value for the tidal charge parameter, a characteristic
signature of extra dimensions. Thus accretion disk does provide a significant possibility of exploring
the existence of extra dimensions through its close correspondence with the strong gravity regime.
