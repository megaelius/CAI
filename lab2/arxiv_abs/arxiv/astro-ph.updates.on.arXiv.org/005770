Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are simple in the most basic model, but can show many complex
features. The ultra-long duration GRB 111209A, one of the longest GRBs ever detected, also has the
best-monitored afterglow in this rare class of GRBs. We want to address the question whether GRB
111209A was a special event beyond its extreme duration alone, and whether it is a classical GRB or
another kind of high-energy transient. The afterglow may yield significant clues. We present afterglow
photometry obtained in seven bands with the GROND imager as well as in further seven bands with the
UVOT telescope on-board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. The light curve is analysed by multi-band
modelling and joint fitting with power-laws and broken power-laws, and we use the contemporaneous
GROND data to study the evolution of the spectral energy distribution. We compare the optical afterglow
to a large ensemble we have analysed in earlier works, and especially to that of another ultra-long
event, GRB 130925A. We furthermore undertake a photometric study of the host galaxy. We find a strong,
chromatic rebrightening event at approx 0.8 days after the GRB, during which the spectral slope
becomes redder. After this, the light curve decays achromatically, with evidence for a break at
about 9 days after the trigger. The afterglow luminosity is found to not be exceptional. We find that
a double-jet model is able to explain the chromatic rebrightening. The afterglow features have
been detected in other events and are not unique. The duration aside, the GRB prompt emission and
afterglow parameters of GRB 111209A are in agreement with the known distributions for these parameters.
While the central engine of this event may differ from that of classical GRBs, there are multiple
lines of evidence pointing to GRB 111209A resulting from the core-collapse of a massive star with
a stripped envelope.
