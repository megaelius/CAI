We investigate the connection between environment and the different quenching channels that galaxies
are prone to follow in the rest-frame NUVrK colour diagram, as identified by Moutard et al. (2016b).
Namely, the fast quenching channel followed by $young$ low-mass galaxies and the slow quenching
channel followed by $old$ high-mass ones. We make use of the >22 deg$^2$ covered the VIPERS Multi-Lambda
Survey (VIPERS-MLS) to select a galaxy sample complete down to stellar masses of $M_* > 10^{9.4}
M_\odot$ at $z < 0.65$ ($M_* > 10^{8.8} M_\odot$ at $z < 0.5$) and including 33,500 (43,000) quiescent
galaxies properly selected at $0.2 < z < 0.65$, while being characterized by reliable photometric
redshifts ($\sigma_{\delta z/(1+z)} \leq 0.04$) that we use to measure galaxy local densities.
We find that (1) the quiescence of low-mass [$M_* \leq 10^{9.7} M_\odot$] galaxies requires a strong
increase of the local density, which confirms the lead role played by environment in their fast quenching
and, therefore, confirms that the low-mass upturn observed in the stellar mass function of quiescent
galaxies is due to $environmental$ $quenching$. We also observe that (2) the reservoir of low-mass
star-forming galaxies located in very dense regions (prone to environmental quenching) has grown
between $z \sim 0.6$ and $ z \sim 0.4$ whilst the share of low-mass quiescent galaxies (expected to
being environmentally quenched) may have simultaneously increased, which would plead for a rising
importance of $environmental$ $quenching$ with cosmic time, compared to $mass$ $quenching$.
We finally discuss the composite picture of such environmental quenching of low-mass galaxies
and, in particular, how this picture may be consistent with a $delayed$-$then$-$rapid$ quenching
scenario.
