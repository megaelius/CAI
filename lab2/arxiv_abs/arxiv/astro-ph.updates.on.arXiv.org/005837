We report the first results of AS2UDS: an 870 $\mu$m continuum survey with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter
Array (ALMA) of a total area of $\sim$ 50 arcmin$^2$ comprising a complete sample of 716 submillimeter
sources drawn from the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) map of the UKIDSS/UDS field. The
S2CLS parent sample covers a 0.96 degree$^2$ field at $\sigma_{850}=0.90\pm0.05$ mJy beam$^{-1}$.
Our deep, high-resolution ALMA observations with $\sigma_{\rm 870}\sim$ 0.25 mJy and a 0.15"--0.30"
FWHM synthesized beam, provide precise locations for 695 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) responsible
for the submillimeter emission corresponding to 606 sources in the low resolution, single-dish
map. We measure the number counts of SMGs brighter than $S_{\rm 870}\geq$ 4 mJy, free from the effects
of blending and show that the normalisation of the counts falls by 28 $\pm$ 2% in comparison to the
SCUBA-2 parent sample, but that the shape remains unchanged. We determine that 44$^{+16}_{-14}$%
of the brighter single-dish sources with $S_{850}\geq$ 9 mJy consist of a blend of two or more ALMA-detectable
SMGs brighter than $S_{870}\sim$ 1 mJy (corresponding to a galaxy with a total-infrared luminosity
of $L_{IR}\geq$ 10$^{12}$ L$_\odot$), in comparison to 28 $\pm$ 2% for the single-dish sources
at $S_{\rm 850}\geq$ 5 mJy. Using the 46 single-dish submillimeter sources that contain two or more
ALMA-detected SMGs with photometric redshifts, we show that there is a significant statistical
excess of pairs of SMGs with similar redshifts ($<$1% probability of occurring by chance), suggesting
that at least 30% of these blends arise from physically associated pairs of SMGs.
