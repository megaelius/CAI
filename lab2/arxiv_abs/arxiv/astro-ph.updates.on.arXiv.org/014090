Our paper reviews the planned space-based gamma-ray telescope GAMMA-400 and evaluates in details
its opportunities in the field of dark matter (DM) indirect searches. We estimated the GAMMA-400
mean sensitivity to the diphoton DM annihilation cross section in the Galactic center for DM particle
masses in the range of 1-500 GeV. We obtained the sensitivity gain at least by 1.2-1.5 times (depending
on DM particle mass) with respect to the expected constraints from 12 years of observations by Fermi-LAT
for the case of Einasto DM density profile. The joint analysis of the data from both telescopes may
yield the gain up to 1.8-2.3 times. Thus the sensitivity reaches the level of annihilation cross
section $\langle \sigma v \rangle_{\gamma\gamma}(m_\chi = 100~\mbox{GeV}) \approx 10^{-28}$
cm$^3$/s. This will allow us to test the hypothesized narrow lines predicted by specific DM models,
particularly the recently proposed pseudo-Goldstone boson DM model. We estimated the GAMMA-400
sensitivity to axion-like particle (ALP) parameters by a potential observation of the supernova
explosion in the Local Group. This is very sensitive probe of ALPs reaching the level of ALP-photon
coupling constant $g_{a\gamma} \sim 10^{-13}~\mbox{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses $m_a \lesssim
1$ neV. We also calculated the sensitivity to ALPs by constraining the modulations in the spectra
of the Galactic gamma-ray pulsars due to possible ALP-photon conversion. GAMMA-400 is expected
to be more sensitive than the CAST helioscope for ALP masses $m_a \approx (1-10)$ neV reaching $g_{a\gamma}^{min}
\approx 2 \cdot 10^{-11}~\mbox{GeV}^{-1}$. Other potentially interesting targets and candidates
are briefly considered too.
