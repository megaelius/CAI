In a recent article, Kleidis and Spyrou (2015) proposed that both dark matter (DM) and dark energy
(DE) can be treated as a single component, if accommodated in the context of a polytropic DM fluid
with thermodynamical content. Depending only on the polytropic exponent, $-0.103 < \Gamma \leq
0$, this unified DM model reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements performed with
the aid of the supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia) standard candles, without suffering either from the age
or from the coincidence problem. To demonstrate also its compatibility with current observational
data concerning structure formation, in the present article we discuss the evolution of cosmological
perturbations in the $\Lambda$ CDM-like (i.e., $\Gamma = 0$) limit of the polytropic DM model. The
corresponding results are quite encouraging, since, such a model reproduces every major effect
already known from conventional (i.e., pressureless cold dark matter - CDM) structure formation
theory, such as the constancy of metric perturbations in the vicinity of recombination and the (late-time)
Meszaros effect on their rest-mass density counterparts (Meszaros 1974). The non-zero (polytropic)
pressure, on the other hand, drives the evolution of small-scale velocity perturbations along
the lines of the root-mean-square velocity law of conventional Statistical Physics. As a consequence,
in this model "peculiar velocities" slightly increase, instead of being redshifted away by cosmic
expansion. What is more important is that, upon consideration of scale-invariant metric perturbations,
the spectrum of their rest-mass density counterparts exhibits an effective power-law dependence
on the (physical) wavenumber, with the associated scalar spectral index being equal to $n_s = 0.970$;
a theoretical value that actually reproduces the corresponding observational (Planck) result
(Ade et al. 2016).
