Despite the significant progress achieved in recent years, the physical mechanisms underlying
the origin of solar energetic particles (SEPs) are still a matter of debate. The complex nature of
both particle acceleration and transport poses challenges to developing a universal picture of
SEP events that encompasses both the low-energy (from tens of keV to a few hundreds of MeV) observations
made by space-based instruments and the GeV particles detected by the worldwide network of neutron
monitors in ground-level enhancements (GLEs). The high-precision data collected by the Payload
for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) satellite experiment
offer a unique opportunity to study the SEP fluxes between $\sim$80 MeV and a few GeV, significantly
improving the characterization of the most energetic events. In particular, PAMELA can measure
for the first time with good accuracy the spectral features at moderate and high energies, providing
important constraints for current SEP models. In addition, the PAMELA observations allow the relationship
between low and high-energy particles to be investigated, enabling a clearer view of the SEP origin.
No qualitative distinction between the spectral shapes of GLE, sub-GLE and non-GLE events is observed,
suggesting that GLEs are not a separate class, but are the subset of a continuous distribution of
SEP events that are more intense at high energies. While the spectral forms found are to be consistent
with diffusive shock acceleration theory, which predicts spectral rollovers at high energies
that are attributed to particles escaping the shock region during acceleration, further work is
required to explore the relative influences of acceleration and transport processes on SEP spectra.
