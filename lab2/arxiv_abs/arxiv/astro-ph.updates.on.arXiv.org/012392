We report ALMA observations of the neutral atomic carbon transitions [CI] and multiple CO lines
in a sample of $\sim30$ main sequence galaxies at $z\sim1$, including novel information on [CI](2-1)
and CO(7-6) for 7 of such normal objects. We complement our observations with a collection of $>200$
galaxies with coverage of similar transitions, spanning the $z=0-4$ redshift interval and a variety
of ambient conditions from local to high-redshift starbursts. We find systematic variations in
the [CI]/IR and [CI]/high-$J$ ($J=7$) CO luminosity ratios among the various samples. We interpret
these differences as increased dense molecular gas fractions and star formation efficiencies
in the strongest high-redshift starbursts with respect to normal main sequence galaxies. We further
report constant $L'_{\rm [CI]2-1}$/$L'_{\rm [CI]1-0}$ ratios across the galaxy populations
and redshifts, suggesting that gas temperatures $T_{\rm exc}$ traced by [CI] do not strongly vary.
We find only a mild correlation with $T_{\rm dust}$ and that, generally, $T_{\rm exc} \lesssim T_{\rm
dust}$. We fit the line ratios with classical PDR models, retrieving consistently larger densities
and intensities of the UV radiation fields in submm galaxies than in main sequence and local objects.
However, these simple models fall short in representing the complexity of a multiphase interstellar
medium and should be treated with caution. Finally, we compare our observations with the Santa Cruz
semi-analytical model of galaxy evolution, recently extended to simulate submm emission. While
we confirm the success in reproducing the CO lines, we find systematically larger [CI] luminosities
at fixed IR luminosity than predicted theoretically. This highlights the necessity of improving
our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the [CI] emission on galactic scales. We release
our data compilation to the community.
