Ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray sources located off-galactic centre and have luminosities
exceeding the Eddington limit of a stellar-mass black hole ($L_X>10^{39}\;{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$).
With the discovery of X-ray pulsations in some of these objects (e.g. M82 X-2), we know a part of the
ULX population has a neutron star (NS) accretor. We present systematic modelling of intermediate-mass
X-ray binaries (IMXBs; donor-star mass range $2.0$ to $8.0\;$M$_{\odot}$) to explain the formation
of this sub-population of ULXs. Using MESA, we explore the allowed initial parameter space of binary
systems consisting of a neutron star and an intermediate-mass donor star, that could explain the
observed properties of ULXs. Our simulations take into account beaming effects and also include
stellar rotation, tides, general angular momentum losses, and a detailed and self-consistent
calculation of the mass-transfer rate. Exploring the initial parameters that lead to the formation
of neutron-star ULXs, we study the conditions that lead to dynamical stability of these systems,
which depends strongly on the response of the donor star to mass loss. Using two values for the initial
NS mass ($1.3\;$M$_{\odot}$ and $2.0\;$M$_{\odot}$) we find that IMXBs can produce NS-ULXs with
typical time-averaged isotropic-equivalent X-ray luminosities between $10^{39}$--$10^{41}\;{\rm
erg\,s}^{-1}$ on a timescale of up to $\sim\!1.0\;$Myr for the lower luminosities, assuming geometrical
beaming. Finally, we estimate their likelihood of detection, the types of white-dwarf remnants
left behind by the donors, as well as the total amount of mass accreted by the neutron stars. We also
compare our results to the observed pulsating ULXs and infer their initial parameters. Our results
suggest that a large subset of the observed pulsating ULX population can be explained by IMXBs in
a super-Eddington mass-transfer phase.
