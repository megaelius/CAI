The statistical properties of galaxy clusters can only be used for cosmological purposes if observational
effects related to cluster detection are accurately characterized. These effects include the
selection function associated to cluster finder algorithms and survey strategy. The importance
of the selection becomes apparent when different cluster finders are applied to the same galaxy
catalog, producing different cluster samples. We consider parametrized functional forms for
the observable-mass relation, its scatter as well as the completeness and purity of cluster samples,
and study how prior knowledge on these function parameters affects dark energy constraints derived
from cluster statistics. Under the assumption that completeness and purity reach 50 % at masses
around 10^{13.5} Msun/h, we find that self-calibration of selection parameters in current and
upcoming cluster surveys is possible, while still allowing for competitive dark energy constraints.
We consider a fiducial survey with specifications similar to those of the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
with 5000 deg^2, maximum redshift of zmax ~ 1.0 and threshold observed mass M_{th} ~ 10^{13.8} Msun/h,
such that completeness and purity ~ 60 % - 80 % at masses around M_{th}. Perfect knowledge of all selection
parameters allows for constraining a constant dark energy equation of state to sigma(w)=0.033.
Employing a joint fit including self-calibration of the effective selection degrades constraints
to sigma(w)=0.046. External calibrations at the level of 1 % in the parameters of the observable-mass
relation and completeness/purity functions are necessary to improve the joint constraints to
sigma(w)=0.041. In the lack of knowledge of selection parameters, future experiments probing
larger areas and greater depths suffer from stronger relative degradations on dark energy constraints
compared to current surveys.
