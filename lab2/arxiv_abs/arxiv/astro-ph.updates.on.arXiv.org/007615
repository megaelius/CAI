It was empirically determined that the umbra-penumbra boundaries of stable sunspots are characterized
by a constant value of the vertical magnetic field. We analyzed the evolution of the photospheric
magnetic field properties of a decaying sunspot belonging to NOAA 11277 between August 28 - September
3, 2011. The observations were acquired with the spectropolarimeter on-board of the Hinode satellite.
We aim to proof the validity of the constant vertical magnetic-field boundary between the umbra
and penumbra in decaying sunspots. A spectral-line inversion technique was used to infer the magnetic
field vector from the full-Stokes profiles. In total, eight maps were inverted and the variation
of the magnetic properties in time were quantified using linear or quadratic fits. We found a linear
decay of the umbral vertical magnetic field, magnetic flux, and area. The penumbra showed a linear
increase of the vertical magnetic field and a sharp decay of the magnetic flux. In addition, the penumbral
area quadratically decayed. The vertical component of the magnetic field is weaker on the umbra-penumbra
boundary of the studied decaying sunspot compared to stable sunspots. Its value seem to be steadily
decreasing during the decay phase. Moreover, at any time of the shown sunspot decay, the inner penumbra
boundary does not match with a constant value of the vertical magnetic field, contrary to what was
seen in stable sunspots. During the decaying phase of the studied sunspot, the umbra does not have
a sufficiently strong vertical component of the magnetic field and is thus unstable and prone to
be disintegrated by convection or magnetic diffusion. No constant value of the vertical magnetic
field was found for the inner penumbral boundary.
