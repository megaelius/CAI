We present near-infrared observations of 42 gravitationally lensed galaxies obtained in the framework
of the KMOS Lensed Emission Lines and VElocity Review (KLEVER) Survey, a program aimed at investigating
the spatially resolved properties of the ionised gas in 1.2<z<2.5 galaxies by means of a full coverage
of the YJ, H and K near-infrared bands. Detailed metallicity maps and gradients are derived for a
sub-sample of 28 galaxies from reconstructed source plane emission line maps, exploiting the variety
of different emission line diagnostics provided by the broad wavelength coverage of the survey.
About 85% of these galaxies are characterised by metallicity gradients shallower than 0.05 dex/kpc
and 89% are consistent with flat slope within 3$\sigma$ (67% within 1$\sigma$), suggesting a mild
evolution with cosmic time. In the context of cosmological simulations and chemical evolution
models, the presence of efficient feedback mechanisms and/or extended star formation profiles
on top of the classical "inside-out" scenario of mass assembly is generally required to reproduce
the observed flatness of the metallicity gradients beyond z$\sim$1 . Three galaxies with significantly
(> 3$\sigma$) "inverted" gradients are also found, showing an anti-correlation between metallicity
and star formation rate density on local scales, possibly suggesting recent episodes of pristine
gas accretion or strong radial flows in place. Nevertheless, the individual metallicity maps are
characterised by a variety of different morphologies, with flat radial gradients sometimes hiding
non-axisymmetric variations on kpc scales which are washed out by azimuthal averages, especially
in interacting systems or in those undergoing local episodes of recent star formation.
