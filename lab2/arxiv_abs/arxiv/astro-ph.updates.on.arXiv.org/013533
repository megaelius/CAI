Recent years have seen increasing interest in the characterization of sub-Neptune sized planets
because of their prevalence in the Galaxy, contrasted with their absence in our solar system. HD
97658 is one of the brightest stars hosting a planet of this kind, and we present the transmission
spectrum of this planet by combining four HST transits, twelve Spitzer/IRAC transits, and eight
MOST transits of this system. Our transmission spectrum has higher signal to noise ratio than that
from previous works, and the result suggests that the slight increase in transit depth from wavelength
1.1 to 1.7 microns reported in previous works on the transmission spectrum of this planet is likely
systematic. Nonetheless, our atmospheric modeling results are not conclusive as no model provides
an excellent match to our data. Nonetheless we find that atmospheres with high C/O ratios (C/O >~
0.8) and metallicities of >~ 100x solar metallicity are favored. We combine the mid-transit times
from all the new Spitzer and MOST observations and obtain an updated orbital period of P=9.489295
+/- 0.000005 d, with a best-fit transit time center at T_0 = 2456361.80690 +/- 0.00038 (BJD). No transit
timing variations are found in this system. We also present new measurements of the stellar rotation
period (34 +/- 2 d) and stellar activity cycle (9.6 yr) of the host star HD 97658. Finally, we calculate
and rank the Transmission Spectroscopy Metric of all confirmed planets cooler than 1000 K and with
sizes between 1 and 4 R_Earth. We find that at least a third of small planets cooler than 1000 K can be
well characterized using JWST, and of those, HD 97658b is ranked fifth, meaning it remains a high-priority
target for atmospheric characterization.
