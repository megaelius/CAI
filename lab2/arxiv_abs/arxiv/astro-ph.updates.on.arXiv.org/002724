The mass distribution and chemical composition of globular cluster (GC) systems preserve fossil
record of the early stages of galaxy formation. The observed distribution of GC colors within massive
early-type galaxies in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) reveals a multi-modal shape, which
likely corresponds to a multi-modal metallicity distribution. We present a simple model for the
formation and disruption of GCs that aims to match the ACSVCS data. This model tests the hypothesis
that GCs are formed during major mergers of gas-rich galaxies and inherit the metallicity of their
hosts. To trace merger events, we use halo merger trees extracted from a large cosmological N-body
simulation. We select 20 halos in the mass range of $2\times 10^{12}$ to $7\times 10^{13}M_\odot$
and match them to 19 Virgo galaxies with K-band luminosity between $3\times 10^{10}$ and $3\times
10^{11}L_\odot$. To set the [Fe/H] abundances, we use an empirical galaxy mass-metallicity relation.
We find that a minimal merger ratio of 1:3 best matches the observed cluster metallicity distribution.
A characteristic bimodal shape appears because metal-rich GCs are produced by late mergers between
massive halos, while metal-poor GCs are produced by collective merger activities of less massive
hosts at early times. The model outcome is robust to alternative prescriptions for cluster formation
rate throughout cosmic time, but a gradual evolution of the mass-metallicity relation with redshift
appears to be necessary to match the observed cluster metallicities. We also affirm the age-metallicity
relation, predicted by an earlier model, in which metal-rich clusters are systematically several
billion years younger than their metal-poor counterparts.
