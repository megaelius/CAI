Space asteroseismology reveals that stellar structure and evolution models of intermediate-
and high-mass stars are in need of improvement in terms of angular momentum and chemical element
transport. We aim to probe the interior structure of a hot massive star in the core-hydrogen burning
phase of its evolution. We analyse CoRoT space photometry, Gaia DR2 space astrometry, and high-resolution
high signal-to-noise HERMES and HARPS time-series spectroscopy of the slowly rotating B2V star
HD 170580. From the time-series spectroscopy we derive $vsini=4\pm 2\,$km\,s$^{-1}$, where the
uncertainty results from the complex pulsational line-profile variability. We detect 42 frequencies
with amplitude above 5$\sigma$. Among these we identify 5 rotationally split triplets and 1 quintuplet.
Asteroseismic modelling based on CoRoT, Gaia DR2 and spectroscopic data leads to a star of 8M$_\odot$
near core-hydrogen exhaustion and an extended overshoot zone. The detected low-order pressure-mode
frequencies cannot be fit within the uncertainties of the CoRoT data by models without atomic diffusion.
Irrespective of this limitation, the low-order gravity modes reveal HD 170580 to be a slow rotator
with an average rotation period between 73 and 98 d and a hint of small differential rotation. Future
Gaia DR3 data taking into account the multiplicity of the star, along with long-term TESS photometry
would allow to put better observational constraints on the asteroseismic models of this blue evolved
massive star. Improved modelling with atomic diffusion, including radiative levitation, is needed
to achieve compliance with the low helium surface abundance of the star. This poses immense computational
challenges but is required to derive the interior rotation and mixing profiles of this star.
